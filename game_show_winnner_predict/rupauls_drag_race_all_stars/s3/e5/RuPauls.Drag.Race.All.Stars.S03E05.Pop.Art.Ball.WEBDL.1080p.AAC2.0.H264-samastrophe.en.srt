1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,200


2
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,669
- Previously
on "All Stars... "

3
17:02:49,365 --> 00:00:04,338
- It's time to play
Snatch Game!

4
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,606
[cheering]

5
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,274
- What's an appro-ho?
Who you calling ho?

6
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,076
[laughs]

7
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,444
- Carson, I've been meaning
to get these back to you.

8
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,046
[laughs]

9
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:15,382
- Winner, winner,
chicken...dinner.

10
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,117
- Crickets.

11
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,787
- What's this?
- From Thorgy.

12
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,555
It's says fuck

13
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,555
this shady bitch Shangela.

14
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,823
- I didn't show it to you

15
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,392
'cause I thought it was
not helpful or appropriate.

16
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,028
- But you decided
to hang it on the wall?

17
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,130
- Trixie Mattel.
- I didn't laugh,

18
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,699
like, the whole time.

19
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,667
- Kennedy Davenport.

20
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,503
- The green leaves
on the bottom.

21
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:36,937
Maybe up
the sophistication level.

22
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:38,539
- Chi Chi DeVayne.

23
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,441
- You spelled
your name wrong.

24
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,643
And it was like tumbleweeds.

25
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,545
- Shangela.

26
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,580
You're a winner, baby.
- Yay!

27
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,917
- BenDeLaCreme.
You are also a winner, baby.

28
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:53,287
- Oh!

29
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,223
- There's two lipsticks.
It's bad.

30
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,594
- Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

31
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,062
- I chose Chi Chi.

32
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,597
- Shangela?

33
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,533
- This person left
"RuPaul's Drag Race"

34
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,034
not winning the crown,

35
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,103
but definitely
going forward as a winner

36
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,738
and creating a career
for themselves.

37
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,274
And I know they will do that
long after this

38
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,742
because I believe
in their talent.

39
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,777
I also chose Chi Chi.

40
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:20,681
- Chi Chi, sashay away.

41
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:30,224
- $5,000!

42
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,560
- Oh, my gosh!

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,862
That was crazy.

44
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,464
- Oh, Chi Chi.

45
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,533
- "Love all of you gals.

46
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,436
Remember to keep it fair,
Chi Chi."

47
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,672
- I haven't seen
a polite mirror message

48
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:47,007
since Morgan, okay?

49
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,842
She has
such a heart of gold.

50
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,511
- We love you, Chi Chi.

51
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,612
- My boo.

52
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,881
- Chi Chi's
almost like my daughter.

53
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:57,785
I am gonna miss her spirit
in the workroom.

54
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,422
- Let's buy Shangela
a round of shots.

55
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,724
- Well, I'll take that.

56
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,025
But you know I'm watching
your station, mama.

57
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,728
If I see another note,
it's a wrap. [laughs]

58
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,030
I can't believe
I get a second chance.

59
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,032
I guess I didn't know
if she would be able

60
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,201
to put aside
with the whole drama

61
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,569
about something Thorgy wrote.

62
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,072
But Shangela made a decision
based on the competition,

63
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,207
and I, like,
really respect that.

64
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,176
My heart's yours.
I'll never forget it.

65
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,210
You'll never
have to buy drinks

66
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,912
at the same bar
as me again, girl.

67
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,880
And I will PayPal you
$10,000.

68
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,783
- Oh, I've got 5K right now
for me and BenDeLa.

69
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,119
I just want to clear the air
with Trixie.

70
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,622
I hope that she sees
that by my decision

71
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,891
that I am someone
who could be trusted

72
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,928
and who could possibly
be an ally for her.

73
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,596
Me and Trixie actually
have things in common,

74
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,431
and I would love to focus on
those more

75
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,233
so that we could help each other
get to the top.

76
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,802
- While we're all sad
to see Chi Chi go,

77
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,138
if we're just looking
at track record,

78
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:54,375
today was actually
a fairly clear decision.

79
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,710
And now we get to the point

80
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,946
where being fair

81
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:02,249
is going to be more muddy
than it was today.

82
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,551
We're halfway through,

83
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,888
and the criteria for how
we want to eliminate people

84
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,723
is getting more confusing

85
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,293
because some people have
been safe the whole time.

86
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,230
Some people have been in the top
and the bottom.

87
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,599
It's really hard to know
what to judge things on.

88
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,901
- I mean, we would like to
all go on a group criteria

89
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,503
that we all decide upon.

90
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,905
But, honestly,
just letting y'all know,

91
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,373
that ain't really
what's gonna go down.

92
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,542
- We all are at the top,

93
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,880
so our job
gets harder every week.

94
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,282
- Just be respectful with
the mirror messages, people.

95
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,283
[all laugh]

96
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,819
- Everyone
is making these jokes,

97
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,388
but you never know who will
pull the stunts here and there.

98
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,624
There have been surprises
in the past.

99
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,696
It's All Stars, girl.
Anything can happen.

100
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,733
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race All Stars"

101
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,468
receives a one year supply

102
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,904
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

103
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,540
a coveted spot
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

104
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,310
and a cash prize
of $100,000!

105
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,447
With extra special guest judges
Shay Mitchell

106
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,282
and Tituss Burgess.

107
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,616
- ? RuPaul's Drag Race

108
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,051
- ? May the best woman

109
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,620
? Best woman win

110
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:18,926
- Oh!

111
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,794
- Oh, the girls.

112
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,731
Back in the mix
with the top six. Whoo!

113
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,165
[alarm]

114
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,700
[imitates alarm]

115
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,703
- She done already
done had herses.

116
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,405
- You wanna be an "it girl"?

117
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,574
A real super star?

118
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:37,611
Your 15 minutes of fame
starts now.

119
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,148
Hello, hello, hello!

120
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,450
[cheering]

121
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,018
- Oh, my God!

122
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:49,256
- Ladies, this week,
in tribute to my hero,

123
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:53,861
we're throwing ourselves
a little Andy Warhol Ball.

124
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,230
- Yeah!
- Yes!

125
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,967
- Warhol's celebrity portraits
are worth millions,

126
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:04,638
but many started out
as Polaroid snapshots.

127
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,775
So for today's mini challenge,

128
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,078
you'll pose
as I take a picture

129
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:15,816
that we'll transform
into a pop art portrait

130
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,185
that will be worth pennies.

131
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,686
[all laugh]

132
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:24,124
You've got 15 minutes
to get into quick drag.

133
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,259
Get famous!

134
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,194
- Sis!

135
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,096
- I look like I'm in
an albino cast from Chicago.

136
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,764
- [laughs]

137
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,199
- Ladies,
you're not a real woman

138
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,267
if you don't have perfume on!

139
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,537
- All right, super stars,
time's up.

140
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,673
First up, Kennedy Davenport.

141
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,275
Ooh.

142
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,076
What story
are your eyes gonna tell?

143
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,545
- Dreamy.

144
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:45,679
- Oh, that's nice,
that's nice.

145
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,048
Why don't you show
top teeth like...

146
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,651
But don't look like
I'm gonna hurt you or anything.

147
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,953
- [laughs]
- That's beautiful.

148
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,354
- Hey, sis.

149
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,491
I know a thing or two
about old glamour.

150
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:59,359
I got my Dita Von Teese hair.

151
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,528
I'm gonna look good
in this Polaroid.

152
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,696
Ooh, I feel like a model
right now.

153
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,165
- You look like
Linda Evangelista.

154
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,733
- One, two, three.

155
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,802
I'll see you at Studio 54.

156
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,104
Can you lean into it
like that?

157
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,407
Yeah. Oh, nice. Lovely.

158
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,275
Oh, that's nice,
that's nice.

159
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,578
Oh, I can see this
hanging in the Louvre.

160
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,146
- Is that the bathroom?
- [laughs]

161
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,280
- Oh, my God!

162
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,515
I didn't even know
this was happening.

163
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,151
- Oh, look at Miss Trixie
looking all soft...

164
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,620
softish.

165
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,089
- I'm gonna do, like,
a punk rich woman.

166
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,691
- Okay. All right.
- Oh, my God.

167
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,125
There's so much going on.

168
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,998
- Ladies, one of you
is a true pop tart.

169
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,703
Aja.

170
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,038
- Ooh, bitch!
Yes!

171
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,506
I have never won
a mini challenge.

172
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,875
Bitch, I earned it.

173
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,144
- You've won a year's worth
of hamburgers...

174
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,347
- Ooh!
- From Hamburger Mary's.

175
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,348
- I'm so hungry.

176
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,517
- Plus $2,000 cash money,
honey.

177
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,919
- All right.

178
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,823
- And we'll be posting all
of your portraits on VH1.com.

179
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,925
Now, ladies,

180
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:08,228
our Warhol Ball
is just getting started.

181
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,564
For this week's
maxi challenge,

182
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,865
you'll need to create

183
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:16,003
two Warhol-inspired looks
from scratch.

184
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,172
- [inhales]

185
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:24,411
- First look, in homage to his
iconic Campbell Soup can series,

186
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:28,215
I want you
to become souper models.

187
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:31,919
That's right. You need
to design a soup can

188
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,021
that captures the true flavor

189
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,891
of your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve and talent.

190
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,159
Now, for your second look,

191
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:43,730
inspired by Andy's
favorite nightclub, Studio 54,

192
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,801
you need to design
disco queen couture.

193
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,673
Now, to give you a sense
of how wild Studio 54 could be,

194
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,008
Bianca Jagger
was once photographed

195
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:58,011
entering the club
on a white horse.

196
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,080
God, I miss quaaludes!

197
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,148
[all laugh]

198
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,750
You can use fabrics
provided by Mood

199
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,887
and hair
provided by RockStar Wigs.

200
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,889
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

201
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:11,892
and may the best All Star win.

202
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,163
- The maxi challenge
is to create a soup

203
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,199
that reflects who you are
as a drag persona.

204
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,268
Last week, I believed
I was going home,

205
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,536
and this week,
I love sewing.

206
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,971
I love making costumes.

207
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,139
And I'm actually really good
at branding and selling stuff.

208
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,041
So I'm feeling really good.

209
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,209
I wanna win
a fucking challenge.

210
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,844
Is anybody else
doing energy?

211
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,713
- Well, I'm not doing energy.
I'm doing sugar.

212
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,385
- Aja's making something
really sweet

213
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,954
because she's sweet?

214
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,590
- Like, sweets, like,
come get your sugar rush.

215
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,559
Like, I want my soup
to be a candy soup.

216
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,794
- A candy-flavored soup?

217
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,031
It's not interesting and doesn't
really brand you at all.

218
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,199
That's, like, crazy.

219
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,504
- Mine is spicy.
Mine is hot.

220
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,772
And it's call "Achoo."

221
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,007
- Achoo?

222
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:04,911
- Yeah, it's like spicy,
kind of very flavorful.

223
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,179
It's called "Achoo."

224
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,248
- What the fuck is achoo?

225
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,416
Achoo.

226
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,052
Shouldn't soup help a cold,
not cause one?

227
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,454
You don't hear no soup
being called... [coughs].

228
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,756
- I'm writing my ingredients
right now.

229
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,923
- Uh-huh.

230
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,458
- It's like, you know,
like a peanut soup.

231
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,927
- You're buying ginger,
garlic, onions,

232
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,329
ground peanuts.

233
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,530
That's soup.

234
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,831
That's soup!

235
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,534
- It has some kick to it.
[laughs]

236
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:30,237
- This isn't "The Chew."
We're not making food.

237
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,272
- What do you think?
"Achoo."

238
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,741
- Honey, if she names
that soup "Achoo,"

239
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,010
that soup is gonna be a recipe
for the bottom two.

240
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,379
- Coming up...

241
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,914
- I took two months
of sewing classes.

242
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,315
Aah!

243
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,218
- Do anybody have a lampshade
that Shangy could borrow?

244
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,186
- Girl!

245
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,321
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

246
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,657
[RuPaul laughs]

247
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,295
- Can you trace me a pattern
real quick?

248
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,697
This is my body, girl.

249
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,999
- You're stupid.

250
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,667
- For this week's
maxi challenge,

251
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,236
we have to drag up
a life-size soup can

252
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,273
and also come up with
a seventies disco queen look

253
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,541
for the Warhol Ball.

254
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,343
I don't know how to run
a sewing machine,

255
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,413
but I have won
a design challenge

256
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,748
with a glue stick before,

257
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,284
so I'm hoping
I can do it again.

258
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,286
- I wanted to do
something black.

259
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,455
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, this'll work.

260
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,622
- So what do I need to do
right now?

261
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,057
Do you need
to cut anything?

262
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,725
- What do you want me to do? You
want me to cut it out for you?

263
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,827
or sew it for you?

264
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,728
- I can cut it,
then if you wanna sew it.

265
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,030
Because
I don't know how to sew.

266
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,299
Well, you can tell me
exactly what you need me to do.

267
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,402
- Okay. Just get some fabric
and double it,

268
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,671
and then just, like,
pin this onto it.

269
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:41,141
I'm helping Bebe sew
her little base of her outfit.

270
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,277
She's making fringe
out of sequins.

271
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,413
I think Bebe feels like
she's very seasoned,

272
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,849
but she hasn't won
any challenges

273
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,418
and she just really
has a lot to prove.

274
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,554
Work for your sister,
please.

275
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,191
- Oh, mother fucker.

276
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,495
- ? There's a hot glue gun

277
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,698
- Does anybody have a lampshade
that Shangy could borrow?

278
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,733
- Girl!
Look, it ain't no secret.

279
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,368
I'm not a super seamstress.

280
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:11,471
Oh, come on, work with mama,
work with mama.

281
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,106
Work, Bertha. Oh, fuck.

282
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,041
However, I'm not
a person that gives up

283
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,243
or throws in the towel.

284
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,277
Come on, Bertha.

285
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,146
I've gone away
and I have learned

286
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,548
at least how to work
the sewing machine.

287
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,884
Bertha's not gonna
beat me today.

288
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,986
Please, sir,
help me and Bertha.

289
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,988
Here we go.

290
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,757
Oh! [laughs]

291
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:34,294
Aah! Why does the top one
keep coming out?

292
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,763
- Let me tell you
who's not gonna win.

293
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:37,864
- Girl.

294
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,866
- Shangela, what you do--

295
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,134
Can I help you?
- I don't know what I did,

296
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,202
but I didn't do right.

297
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,137
- Oh, that is wrong.
- [laughs]

298
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,373
- This is
an opportunity for me

299
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,175
to at least in a small way

300
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,210
thank her
for saving me last week.

301
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,845
This is what you're gonna do.
Put this on your body.

302
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,813
'Cause if this fits,
this could be really cute.

303
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,849
- Mama, it ain't gonna fit
over my body, though.

304
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,217
- Oh, is it too small?
- It doesn't stretch.

305
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,585
Go lower, go lower.

306
00:11:58,585 --> 00:11:59,953
- It doesn't stretch?

307
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,255
- I didn't know the fabric
doesn't stretch.

308
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,657
- Oh, bitch.

309
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,225
- [laughs]

310
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,560
- Did it fit?

311
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,563
- No, bitch. [laughs]

312
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,897
I know
y'all think I'm lying,

313
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,701
but I took two months of sewing
classes, and for what?

314
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,204
I guess I should've taken
some fabric picking classes.

315
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,338
That's what
I should have taken.

316
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,539
It's not gonna work.

317
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,508
Maybe if I go over my head.

318
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,343
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

319
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,346
I'm basically back at square one
at the drawing board.

320
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,916
Goddog it!

321
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,853
- Happy New Year, everybody!

322
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,056
- It's elimination day.

323
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,325
We're going to present our looks
and our soup cans to the judges,

324
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,994
and one of us
is gonna get canned.

325
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,731
Soup can.

326
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,934
- Oh!

327
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,803
- I feel so proud
of my outfit.

328
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,939
Like, making that
felt so, like, nostalgic.

329
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,242
You know, I'm on the machine
like mmm, yeah.

330
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,977
I'm very excited
for this runway

331
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,312
because the judges
have commended me

332
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:04,117
on boosting not only
my look, but my style.

333
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,285
They called me stylish!

334
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,786
So right now,
I'm living my moment.

335
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,021
Oh, I'm so happy

336
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,825
with my drapey, like,
pearl-back necklace fantasy.

337
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,393
Y'all can't handle it.

338
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,594
- Girl, bye.

339
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,563
I think Aja
is very confident.

340
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,931
Shoot, over confident.

341
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:21,801
- Y'all can't
ha-ha-handle it.

342
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,472
- I mean, I'm impressed with her
sewing skills and everything,

343
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,540
but she too much.

344
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,442
- Liza would die for this.

345
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,311
Bam!

346
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,148
- How are you guys who are
super confident for today--

347
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,850
because
I'm not in that group--

348
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,119
how are you thinking
if you're in the top

349
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,354
that you're gonna make your
decision on who to send home?

350
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,123
- Let's go down the line
starting with BenDeLa.

351
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,725
- Right now, it feels hard.

352
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,528
Like, how do you, like,
quantify it at this point

353
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,097
where everybody
is performing at a high level?

354
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,932
Something
I really wanted to do

355
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,535
was, like, kind of write
who placed where every week.

356
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,704
Kind of try to, like,
do some math about it

357
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,205
just to be technical.

358
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,607
- Girl.

359
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,910
- Does it help more if somebody
has, like, been in the top

360
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,645
but has also
been in the bottom?

361
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,681
Or if somebody's been,
like, consistently safe?

362
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,149
- Jesus.

363
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,051
- Honestly, I don't want
that responsibility

364
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,852
of, like, figuring it out
or deciding it.

365
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,254
I'd really rather
be, like, okay,

366
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,657
this is, like, the technical way
I've decided to do this.

367
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,827
- Girl, come on.
Get out your head.

368
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,697
If it was me
and I was in Ben's position

369
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,033
and I was winning...

370
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,469
I understand
I have a job to do

371
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,671
and I have to let people go.

372
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,173
Maybe she just
can't handle it.

373
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,375
- If we're basing it
on track record--

374
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,212
- As we should not.
I don't think we should.

375
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,115
It's not like, ooh,
we should do it this way

376
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,717
or we should do it that way.

377
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,685
Just play the game,
and when you end up in the top,

378
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:46,820
you know what you gotta do.

379
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,688
You been in this profession
long enough

380
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,090
to make your own decision.

381
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,958
For whatever reason it may be,
it's yours.

382
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,059
- But I don't think
we're saying

383
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,627
we wouldn't make
our own decision.

384
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,329
But I still
am, like, interested

385
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,465
in finding different
perspectives to look at.

386
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,167
- Yeah.
Well, I didn't say that.

387
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,235
- Oh, my God!

388
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,371
- I'm not saying that.
- Justify it.

389
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,706
- If you think too much
of the situation,

390
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,708
it's gonna work your brain.
- Hit her!

391
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,343
- Shut up.

392
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,245
- [laughs]

393
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,647
- Coming up...
[horse neighs]

394
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,549
Oh, she's got horsepower.

395
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,185
[all laugh]

396
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,321
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

397
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,690
[RuPaul laughs]

398
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,727
- ? Covergirl,
put the bass in your walk ?

399
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:34,901
? Covergirl,
put the bass in your walk ?

400
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:38,772
? Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ?

401
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,640
? Covergirl

402
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,444

Drag Race All Stars."

404
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:51,317
A woman whose cans
are definitely museum worthy,

405
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,452
Michelle Visage.

406
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,453
- [laughs]

407
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,655
- Funny man Ross Mathews.

408
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,557
Now, Ross, do you like art?

409
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,659
- Yes, if it's well hung.

410
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:01,127
- [laughs]

411
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,196
- She's a pretty little liar

412
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:06,332
soon to be seen in the film
"Cadaver",

413
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,434
Shay Mitchell.

414
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,902
- I am so excited
to be here.

415
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,738
- Now, "Cadaver" isn't
my life story, is it?

416
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,706
[all laugh]

417
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,075
And the fabulous
Tituss Burgess.

418
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,312
Have you had any good
pinot noir lately?

419
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,713
- For breakfast.

420
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,850
- And by pinot noir,

421
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,850
I mean black dick.

422
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,851
[all laugh]

423
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,086
- For breakfast.
[all laugh]

424
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,156
This week,
we challenged our All Stars

425
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,959
to bring it to you
at the Warhol Ball.

426
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,895
Gentlemen,

427
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,531
and may the best All Star win.

428
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,507
Category

429
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,275
First up, Aja.

430
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,613
- I'm Aja,
and I'm moist and sweet.

431
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:57,484
Mmm, open wide and get a taste
of my sugar tits

432
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,153
because
I'm made of candy, bitch,

433
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,588
and I look good.

434
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,556
- Type 2 dia-booties.

435
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,824
[all laugh]

436
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,526

- Open wide and get a taste

438
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,964
of Shangie Angie's
caffeinated Halleloops.

439
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:14,334
Just like my soup,
I'm an all night party, baby.

440
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,870
Heat me up
and watch my loops swell

441
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,671
with loads of heartiness,

442
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,406
guaranteeing
that after one bite,

443
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,343
honey, your friends will be
saying, "Slow down, bitch!"

444
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,744
Ooh, halle-loo!

445
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,045
- She's serving canned fish.

446
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,381
- Oh, no!
[all laugh]

447
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,716
- Trixie Mattel.

448
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,783
- Open wide and get a taste

449
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,119
of nonrefillable,
prescription only,

450
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,089
habit-forming,
heart-slowing goodness.

451
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,257
Just like my soup,

452
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm inspired by rainbows,
little birdies,

453
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,330
and the reemerging dark recesses
of a rocky childhood.

454
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,798
Side effects include
drowsiness, nausea,

455
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,167
depression,
and a broken DVR.

456
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,737
- Looks like "Children
of the Corn" chowder.

457
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,039
[all laugh]

458
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,707
- Kennedy Davenport.

459
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:57,844
- Grandma Kennedy's
Pot Licka Juice.

460
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:59,879
I'm scrumptious-ba-da-rumptious.

461
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,814
Ask for me by name,

462
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,785
and spoon your way
to a fat bootay.

463
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,587
- I forked my way to mine.

464
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,555
[all laugh]

465
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:11,324

466
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,692
- Don't be scared.

467
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,129
I'm bringing a taste of Africa
into your mouth.

468
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:20,700
I am Zaza,
Spicy, flavorful, hot,

469
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,470
and I will make you
want to shout Cameroon!

470
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,639
- [laughs]

471
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,408
- The soup du jour is nut.

472
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,276
[all laugh]

473
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,711
- BenDeLaCreme.

474
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:34,480

477
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,888
of talent, desperation
and dumb luck.

478
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:45,825
Heat me up and watch me rise

479

CreamDeLaCreme's
All Purpose Soup.

480
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,096
Perfect for any occasion.

481
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,798
- She's lactating.

482
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,867
- [laughs]

483
00:18:54,867 --> 00:19:02,375
- Category is Disco Queen
Eleganza Extravaganza!

484
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,576
Aja.

485
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,545
- You can lead a whore
to water.

[all laugh]

487
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,483
- Sis, life is so crazy.

488
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,385
Last night,
I was at the Target,

489
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,220
and I ran into Lindsay Lohan,

490
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,888
who had the nerve to tell me

491
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,191
that I looked like
Linda Evangelista.

492
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,359
The nerve.
Henny.

493
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,127
Who would have thought

494
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,563
that my life would go
from twerking these cheeks

495
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:28,101
to now telling people that
their smile is beautiful,

496
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,535
and getting paid for it.

497
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,971
- That's a look you can wear
in winter, fall,

498
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:33,806
Donna Summer.
- Yes.

499
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,375
- Shangela.

500
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,177
Never look
a gift whore in the mouth.

501
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:42,115
- Dear Diary, last night
Solange Knowles

502
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:44,817
dragged me to Mariah Carey's
New Year's Eve party,

503
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,954
where she was like,
"Happy New Year, everybody!"

504
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:50,023
Ha ha! Who would
have thought my life

505
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,358
would go from shucking corn
in Paris, Texas

506
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,262
to now meeting with Tyra Banks
and Miss J. Alexander for lunch

507
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,164
to talk about
shooting photos

508
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,401
for America's Next Top Model,
Cycle Number 276.

509
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,568
Halle-loo.

510
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,771
- She's got a big disc.

511
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:05,772
- Is that a 12-inch?

512
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,740
- I think so.
- [laughs]

513
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,542
- Trixie Mattel.

514
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,546
A whore by any other name
is still a whore.

515
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,814
[all laugh]

516
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,015
- OMG, girl.

517
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,650
Last night, I dreamed
I was in the front row

518
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,719
of Tiffani-Amber Thiessen's
fashion show

519
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,954
Seated between Karen
from finance and John Wayne,

520
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,556
who's looking
better than ever.

521
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,125
Then I raced to dinner
with Soleil Moon Frye,

522
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,161
Betsey Johnson
and Buffy the Vampire Slayer,

523
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,729
And all they could talk about

524
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,864
was rhinestoning
their lady parts.

525
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,533
Wow, I love life.

526
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,168
- Ru, who needs
a horse toe

527
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,569
when you can have a camel?

528
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,104
[all laugh]

529
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:39,572
- Kennedy.

530
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,208
Oh, she's got horsepower.

531
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,242
- [laughs]

532
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,745
- Today,
I woke up at 1 P.M.

533
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,247
My phone was screaming.

534
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,849
It was Michelle Obama

535
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,118
yelling at me
that I was late

536
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,821
and was supposed to be
at the photoshoot

537
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,155
for "JET" magazine.

538
00:20:56,155 --> 00:21:00,326
When I arrived,
Miranda Priestly kissed me hello

539
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,830
while London's ambassador
shoved a 20 in my hand

540
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,832
and told me I looked cheap!

541
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,633
Eff that, honey.

542
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,702
- [laughs]

543
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,505
- Well, now I can't even see
her disco balls.

544
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,940
- Hmm.

545
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,709
Bebe Zahara Benet.

546
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,812
If you want to ride,
ride the white horse.

547
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,047
- Yes, Hunty.

548
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:25,017
- Dear Diary,
life is so crazy!

549
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,954
Last night, I was at
Diana Ross's famous party

550
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,489
at the Moulin Rouge.

551
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,957
The paparazzi swooped in,

552
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,526
and the scene
got really, really crazy.

553
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,094
I had my pepper spray
in my purse,

554
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:36,395
so I whipped it out

555
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,164
and started spraying
those bitches,

556
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,233
and everybody went crazy.

557
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,667
[laughs]

558
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,102
- Looks like
a homosexual carwash.

559
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,304
- [laughs]
- The best kind.

560
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,906
- Yes, please.

561
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,207
- BenDeLaCreme.

562
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,410
She's arriving sidesaddle,
henny.

563
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,380
- Dear Diary, last night
I was at the Vatican,

564
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,383
and I ran into
the Taco Bell chihuahua.

565
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,018
He tossed me into his limo

566
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:02,355
and dragged me to Baby Jessica's
party at the bottom of a well.

567
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:05,725
We got there and Stevie Wonder,
of all people,

568
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:09,195
had the nerve to tell me
I looked like Michelle Visage.

569
00:22:09,195 --> 00:22:11,230
Real original, Stevie!

570
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,199
- [laughs]

571
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,400
- Coming up...

572
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,968
- All I can say is R.I.P.
to this challenge

573
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,036
because you murdered it.

574
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,038
- Oh, my God,
your face and your hair.

575
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,307
- I really don't have
any negatives to say,

576
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,109
and that ain't easy.

577
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,244
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

578
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,647
[RuPaul laughs]

579
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:30,817
- Welcome, All Stars.

580
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,952
It's time
for the judges' critiques,

581
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,988
starting with Aja.

582
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,723
- I'm gonna start
with your can.

583
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,991
- Yes.
- Not that it wasn't fun,

584
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:42,562
but I found that your can
had nothing about you.

585
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,463
- I was trying to go
for, like,

586
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,699
it's, like, sweet and sexy.

587
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,000
- That's not what
we know you for.

588
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,304
- I think of you
as spicy and fiery.

589
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,539
- And tonight on the runway,
you put it together nicely,

590
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,075
but this is really not disco.

591
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,210
- I was trying to go
for, like,

592
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,080
a Cher meets,
like, Frances Joli, like--

593
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,248
- Frances who?

594
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,516
- Frances Joli.

595
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:04,784
- You mean France Joli?

596
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:05,918
- Is that how you say it?

597
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,054
- France Joli.
- Oh!

598
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,388
I just learned that
right now. [laughs]

599
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,259
- And the wig feels like
it's in a different decade.

600
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,460
- For the hair,
I was just trying to go

601
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,929
in kind of like
a Bridget Bardot like--

602
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,965
- Well, she's sixties.

603
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:21,534
- I'm all over the place
right now with my references.

604
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,935
- You're 23 years old,
right?

605
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,604
Obviously, you weren't here

606
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,540
for a lot of the history
of humans on this planet.

607
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,275
- Yeah. [laughs]
- But we're queens.

608
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,743
It's important
to know pop culture

609
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,111
and things like that.

610
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,915
I just expect queens to do
a little bit more research.

611
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,485
Especially seventies
wasn't that long ago, doll.

612
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,121
- I really do love
the fashion from that era,

613
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,856
So, like, that's why
I'm, like, really, like,

614
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,791
kind of devastated
that I missed the mark.

615
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,028
- Well, Frances Joli
was flattered, wherever she is.

616
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,163
[all laugh]

617
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:55,301
Let's move on down
to solid gold Shangela.

618
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,469
- Whoo.

619
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,972
- The warm fish soup
kind of turned me off,

620
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,440
but you still looked fish.

621
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,642
- I'm glad you know
what fish is. Halle-loo.

622
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,610
- I do, I do.

623
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,611
- I loved your can.

624
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,913
I thought it was branded
right away.

625
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,648
Halleloops!
Oh, Shangela.

626
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,782
I've heard that before.
You sold it.

627
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,752
- But Shangy,
this runway look.

628
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,986
- Yes, ma'am. I know.

629
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,988
- [laughs]

630
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,290
First of all,
you came out here.

631
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,325
We couldn't see
any part of your face.

632
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,093
I bet you looked real pretty
under that dish on your head.

633
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,162
- Oh, hello!

634
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:25,264
- Hi! Look at that!

635
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,133
I don't know what's going on
under the tinsel.

636
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,468
I don't understand why
there's three giant records

637
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,671
on the front
of your tiny little body.

638
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,739
It's a little crazy tonight.

639
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,474
- It is big disco,

640
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,777
but it looks
a little homemade.

641
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:40,212
- It is, and with
a hot glue gun and a staple gun,

642
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,347
you could do it, too.

643
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,115
[all laugh]

644
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,484
I did make an effort
on the sewing machine,

645
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,585
and I broke every needle

646
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,854
and had a friend
to help me to thread it.

647
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,589
But, you know,
it's just not my gimmick.

648
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,259
And I can hold my head high
in saying that, you know,

649
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,695
at least I didn't bow down.
Halle-loo.

650
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,229
- Thank you, Shangela.

651
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,831
Up next, Trixie Mattel.

652
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,533
- Hi, guys.

653
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,934
- All I can say is R.I.P.
to this challenge,

654
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,002
'cause you murdered it.

655
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,303
- The can came out.

656
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,871
You could have been backstage,

657
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,173
and I would have known
that was your can.

658
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:10,042
- This is definitely
giving me disco Barbie.

659
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,211
I mean, the whole look
is so great.

660
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,714
- It tells me a story
of a country girl

661
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,084
who decided I have to fit in
at Studio 54.

662
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:21,487
And the best part about it
is you made it.

663
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,488
- I did.

664
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,290
- You know what
your body shape is.

665
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,958
The arms, the legs,
the width.

666
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,928
Even the camel toe.
It's all good.

667
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,162
- There's not enough money
in the world

668
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,130
for me to put tape
on my dick.

669
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,198
- You have a dick?
[all laugh]

670
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,166
- I think it's in the back
somewhere.

671
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,870
- I don't know if you got
the invite late or what,

672
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,673
but you RSVP'd
and you showed up today.

673
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,742
- The Trixie that I wanted
has finally arrived.

674
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,444
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

675
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,013
- [laughs]

676
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,681
Kennedy Davenport.

677
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,116
- Listen, I know you're quirky
and you do fun things,

678
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:52,885
but when you came out, I was
like why is she a grandma?

679
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,754
This is a branding challenge,

680
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,856
so you want to brand
what you're known for.

681
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:58,357
- Right.
- It didn't work.

682
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,759
I didn't get the story.

683
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,727
I didn't get the connection.

684
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:02,895
- It was more
branding the booty.

685
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,130
- I would have led with that.

686
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,099
But, oh, my God,
your face and your hair.

687
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,468
- You have my favorite
disco queen look,

688
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,836
and you would definitely
be catching

689
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,705
everybody's attention
at Studio 54.

690
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,974
- Your mesh looked regal
like a super hero

691
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,542
and seventies
all at the same time.

692
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,977
You look absolutely beautiful.

693
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,079
- Thank you.

694
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,347
- Up next, Bebe.

695
00:26:21,347 --> 00:26:22,348
- Hi, Mother.

696
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:24,216
- Is peanut soup
a thing in Cameroon?

697
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,553
- It is. It's one of,
like, our delicacies.

698
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,822
- Ooh, it sounds delicious.

699
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:30,823
- [laughs]

700
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,358
- I thought your can
was beautiful.

701
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:34,593
Artistically,
it was very understated.

702
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,228
If it was a print,
I would hang that.

703
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,964
- And because
you represent a country

704
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,166
and you're very proud of it,

705
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,934
the branding
worked beautifully.

706
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,471
And, baby, when baby Bebe
walked out got on this runway,

707
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:47,406
I about lost my mind.

708
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:51,110
Absolutely stunning.
You made this?

709
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,112
- I did.
- So beautiful.

710
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,214
I really don't have
any negatives to say,

711
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,248
and that ain't easy.

712
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,050
- Everything
from the accessories,

713
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,752
to the jewels on your face,

714
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,487
it's 10 out of 10
for this look.

715
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:02,521
- Thank you.

716
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,223
- Up next, BenDeLaCreme.

717
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,291
- Hi.

718
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,960
- So your can tonight
was fantastic.

719
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,628
- Thank you.
- The colors were you.

720
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,163
Your hair was adorable.

721
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,933
It was terminally delightful.
That's your brand.

722
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,768
- I like this look.

723
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,069
I don't love this look.

724
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,805
It doesn't scream
disco queen.

725
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,073
- You're definitely
not the queen.

726
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,409
You're probably in line
trying to get into the club.

727
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,511
- I feel like I'm in the alley
behind the disco.

728
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,213
- Listen, it does not suck.

729
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,715
But it's simple, basic.

730
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,684
You can do better and more.

731
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:34,286
- And I don't know if you're
tired tonight or something,

732
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,889
but we are at the edge of our
seats every time you walk out

733
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,124
just because of the level
you've been performing.

734
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:39,825
So if it's not at 120,

735
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:44,463
if it's just at 100,
we're like, oh, 100. Okay.

736
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:47,299
- Thank you, ladies.

737
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,535
Based on
the judges' critiques,

738
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,804
I've made some decisions.

739
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,442
Bebe Zahara Benet,

740
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,612
Trixie Mattel,

741
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:00,846
Con-drag-ulations.

742
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,449
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

743
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,284
[applause]

744
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:09,221
You each won
a two-night escape for two

745
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,458
at the W Hotel,
Fort Lauderdale.

746
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,897
BenDeLaCreme,
Kennedy Davenport.

747
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,466
You are safe.

748
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,800
- [exhales]
Thank you, Lord.

749
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,801
- Thank you.

750
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,671
- That means Aja
and Shangela,

751
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:27,506
you are the bottom two.

752
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,712
Trixie and Bebe,
each of you needs to decide

753
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,016
which of the bottom two
you'll eliminate

754
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,385
if you win the lip sync.

755
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:43,055
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.

756
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,624
- Coming up...

757
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,625
- I'm just trying to smile,

758
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,295
and sometimes
it's just so hard.

759
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:52,064
- My mood
just changed to fear.

760
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,233
- Someone's feelings
are going to be hurt.

761
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,467
- Ah, bitch.

762
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,270
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

763
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,706
[RuPaul laughs]

764
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,579
- ? Oh, my God

765
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,414
- I've never been
in a position

766
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:12,484
where I had to choose
who to eliminate.

767
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,920
And it's like are you going to
be honest about the situation?

768
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,056
Are you going
to play the game?

769
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,124
How do you choose
who's gonna go home?

770
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,827
- Shangela and Aja,
how are you guys feeling?

771
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,730
- I mean, this is my first time
in the bottom,

772
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,098
and it's just...

773
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,668
We know what it is.

774
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:33,439
- I've never felt
more drag scalped,

775
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,506
like, murdered.

776
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,875
At that moment,
I was like, whoa.

777
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,044
- I just cracked.

778
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,179
And to see her being cracked

779
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,449
when just this morning
she was, like,

780
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,817
I'm gonna win the challenge.

781
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:47,419
It's a testament to how
you can't be too confident.

782
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,388
- I wanna talk.
Do you wanna talk?

783
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,024
- Yeah. It really helps.
- Do you wanna talk?

784
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,259
- Yes.
- Let's do it.

785
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,260
- Well, TYA.

786
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,694
- TYA?
- Tell your ass.

787
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:59,665
[all laugh]

788
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,166
- Hi, sister.
- Hi, sis.

789
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,236
Oh, my gosh.
How you feeling?

790
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,572
- I'm hoping that this moment
won't define

791
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:09,041
how much I can bring
to this competition.

792
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,010
You have
a hard choice to make,

793
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,480
and regardless of what else,
you are always my sister.

794
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,517
- I do feel like Shangela
has shown amazing work,

795
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,386
but Aja is a fireball.

796
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:22,588
Aja is somebody
who has shown a lot of growth

797
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,689
compared to Season 9.

798
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:26,091
So it's really, really hard.

799
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,693
Oh, bitch.

800
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,863
- Maybe I can't
pronounce names right,

801
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,299
but, like, I really
made this with the intent

802
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,135
to, like, really be couture
and high fashion

803
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,569
and still give disco.

804
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:41,273
- On one hand, I think Aja's
runway was the most beautiful.

805
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,275
On the other hand,
the judges didn't.

806
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,778
And her can
was, like, terrible.

807
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:48,080
It had nothing
to do with Aja.

808
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,482
- I fucked up so bad
on my season,

809
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:53,552
and I want to go
as far as I can.

810
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,654
- I know you do.

811
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,290
- When Ross was like
"I sort of feel bad for you

812
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,625
because
you perform so well,"

813
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:02,227
it's, like, we need to see
120% every time.

814
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,129
And, like, I don't know whether
you're just tired or what.

815
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:05,998
I was, like, yes, I'm tired!

816
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,200
I am exhausted every minute!

817
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,868
You just happened
to notice this time.

818
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,869
- I noticed, too.

819
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,638
- What?

820
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:14,707
- I noticed, too, this challenge
was working you.

821
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,874
- Oh, my God, yeah.

822
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,710
- You let this challenge
work your ass,

823
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:23,315
and then it kind of like
spewed a little onstage.

824
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,918
- Wait. What does that mean,
spewed a little onstage?

825
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:28,220
- Like you kind of
let it show.

826
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,755
- Oh, really?
When I was walking--

827
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,125
- That you were not like
your usual self, you know.

828
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,393
- Kennedy's saying that

829
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,628
I seemed like my energy
is a little lower,

830
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,629
and it's like, duh.

831
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,365
I just won
a million challenges

832
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,899
'cause I was working
super hard.

833
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:45,270
I have had to not only
pull it out

834
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,107
in everything that we've done
as we all have,

835
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:51,677
I have also
had to decide every week

836
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,212
who is gonna walk out
of this workroom.

837
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:56,281
And that emotionally
is enough.

838
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,750
- It is trying. Mm-hmm.

839
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,084
- I don't wanna be
on the judges panel.

840
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,319
I wanna be one of the girls.

841
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,522
So, anyway,
blah-blah-blah. Poor me.

842
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,357
- BenDeLa is relieved

843
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,893
that she has been taken off
of this high horse, honey.

844
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:10,963
Some people are not made to deal
with that type of pressure.

845
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:15,000
But, listen,
if you don't want to win,

846
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,869
stop playing to win.

847
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,540
- We were just here, bitch.

848
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,574
- Yeah.

849
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,476
- Do you want
this chair back?

850
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:27,045
- Mama, it's a whole
different dynamic now.

851
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,747
- If the tables were turned,

852
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,382
I wouldn't expect Shangela
to save me

853
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,584
just because
I saved her once.

854
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:33,719
That falls into more

855
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:35,320
of a RuPaul's Best Friend
Race category,

856
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,256
and it should be judged on
did you do the worst?

857
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,124
She knows her outfit
was the worst outfit.

858
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,493
It's maybe the worst thing
I've seen on "Drag Race."

859
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,562
It's getting hard. It's getting
really hard, you know.

860
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,831
But she has one of the best
track records here.

861
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,900
Look how many weeks
she's hit homeruns.

862
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,235
But I don't know
if those homeruns

863
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,471
outweigh the fact that there's
a record glued to her head.

864
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,639
I don't know.

865
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,240
- I know you have
a rough decision,

866
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,077
but I could see us next week
top five, top four, top three.

867
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,213
I see that for you.
I see that for me.

868
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,381
I wanna stay.

869
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,482
- I know you do.

870
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,817
- Whatever choice you make,

871
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,985
you'll forever be a top three
kind of person to me.

872
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,988
When Daenerys is creating
alliances on "Game of Thrones,"

873
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,024
she's creating them
out of mutual respect,

874
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:14,526
and that's what I hope I've done
in this competition.

875
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,828
But I love you.
- You're a real life All Star.

876
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,729
- I've done my best
at creating these alliances,

877
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,165
and now I'm just
gonna leave it up to them.

878
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,034
- First of all,
I'm going to let you know

879
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:24,369
that you look
really beautiful today

880
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,138
and you're very authentic.

881
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,506
and I like the fact

882
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,241
that I can see you
just blossoming right here.

883
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,909
And I watched you tonight.

884
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,144
- I just wanna make it
to the top.

885
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,879
- Yeah.
- So I'm not, like...

886
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,381
- No matter what,
you've made it.

887
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,683
You're here.

888
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,618
- [sighs]
I'm trying to tell her

889
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,119
why I think I should stay,

890
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,955
but Bebe
is not letting me talk

891
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:44,490
and she's just going on.

892
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,625
- It's just how far
you have made--

893
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,260
You have made it, girl.

894
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,862
- And I can't even
plead my case.

895
00:33:52,097 --> 00:33:54,132
- I just want to say
I'm very proud of you

896
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,801
because you are just a star
in my eyes

897
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,135
and I really love you.

898
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:00,873
So let's go back
to the group, honey.

899
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,107
I love you, my sis.

900
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:07,579
- My entire mood
just changed to fear.

901
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:10,582
[sighs]

902
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,817
- What's going on, sis?

903
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,553
Because I know
how you feel, so...

904
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,723
- Yeah. I just feel
so numb right now.

905
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,091
I'm just trying to smile,

906
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,894
and just have a good time.

907
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:24,530
Sometimes
it's just so hard.

908
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,266
- It hurts me
to see her so broken.

909
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:30,102
But I get it.
This is scary.

910
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,470
One of us is going home.

911
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,013
- I'm thinking about
who did the worst today?

912
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,915
Who did the best today?
Who has the best track record?

913
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,017
Who can save my skin
tomorrow?

914
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:46,818
I could stare at these
two lipsticks all day,

915
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,254
but it's one resounding
gut feeling.

916
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,892
- I have to kind of
look at everything.

917
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,995
I can't look at just
the judges' critiques.

918
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,631
I have to look at
the whole picture.

919
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:03,035
But I do believe that I have
made the right decision.

920
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:05,504
My decision is honest.

921
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:06,872
But I know in spite of that,

922
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,207
someone's feelings
are going to be hurt.

923
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,278
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

924
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,614
[RuPaul laughs]

925
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,552
- Welcome back, ladies.

926
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:24,323
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

927
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:27,859
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

928
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,697
win $10,000,
and earn the power

929
00:35:31,697 --> 00:35:35,367
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

930
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,071
The time has come...
[thunder]

931
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,707
for you to lip sync...

932
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:44,042
[echoing] for your legacy!

933
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,845
- I want to win the lip sync
for once.

934
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,314
On Season 7, I'll lost
a lip sync to Pearl.

935
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:50,949
Do you know what it's like
to lose a lip sync

936
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,684
to a partially sedated twink
from Brooklyn?

937
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,786
- Good luck,

938
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:58,190
and don't fuck it up.

939
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,125
[music plays]

940
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,836
- ? I defy

941
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:14,006
? Anyone who claims that I

942
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,241
? Didn't control

943
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,876
? Whatever moved

944
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,879
? In my soul

945
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,782
? And I could touch

946
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,517
? Touch delight

947
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,354
? Just because
you fell for me ?

948
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:33,191
? Why should I
feel uptight? ?

949
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,062
? Love had to show me
one thing ?

950
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,531
? I was so right

951
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,700
? So right

952
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,736
? Thought I could turn
emotion ?

953
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:45,871
? On and off

954
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,739
? I was so sure

955
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:49,808
? I was so, so sure

956
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:54,579
? But love taught me

957
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,580
? Taught me

958
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,550
? Taught me

959
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,219
? I was so right

960
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,321
? So right

961
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,158
? Thought
I could turn emotion ?

962
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,626
? On and off

963
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:08,960
? I was so sure

964
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,229
? So sure

965
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,834
? That love taught me

966
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:16,902
? Taught me

967
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,471
? Who was,
who was the boss ?

968
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:20,472
? Love

969
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:23,075
? But love taught me

970
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,577
? Taught me, taught me

971
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,279
- Whoo!

972
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:28,413
- Yay!

973
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,717
[cheers and applause]

974
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,722
- Ladies, I have made
my decision.

975
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,529
Bebe Zahara Benet...

976
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,700
You're a winner, baby.
[applause]

977
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,868
Con-drag-ulations.

978
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:54,172
You've won a cash tip
of $10,000.

979
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,376
Trixie Mattel, you are safe.

980
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,711
You may join
the other girls.

981
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:07,586
Aja and Shangela,
please step forward.

982
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:15,694
Bebe, with great power
comes great responsibility.

983
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:21,166
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

984
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:24,236
- [sighs]

985
00:38:24,236 --> 00:38:25,837
- When I was coming
to this competition,

986
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:29,207
I didn't know what
my relationship was going to be

987
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,742
with all of you girls.

988
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,544
I had no clue.

989
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,846
And I came here

990
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:37,983
and I bonded so much
with every single one of you.

991
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:42,654
I just hope that we
stay as family.

992
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,059
I'm going to send Aja home.

993
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,062
[sighs]

994
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:54,166
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

995
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,468
Aja, you are

996
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,671
and you will always be
an All Star.

997
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,306
- Thank you so much.

998
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:04,276
I'm just grateful to have lived
this experience twice.

999
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:06,278
That is some shit.

1000
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:10,015
- Now sashay away.

1001
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,991
- Sis, I gotta go.

1002
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,893
Bye-ee.

1003
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,296
I was a little surprised.

1004
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:26,665
I helped Bebe
make her outfit.

1005
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:28,967
Sis...
The tea, the tea, the tea.

1006
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,303
But then again,
this is All Stars,

1007
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,438
and bitches gonna send
whoever they want home.

1008
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,207
And I respect her decision.

1009
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:37,475
And I just want to thank
all my supporters

1010
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,110
for believing in me
and, like--

1011
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,346
[bell rings]

1012
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,351
- Blessed be, kitty girl.

1013
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:49,221
The day of reckoning
is upon us.

1014
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:53,625
[evil laugh]

1015
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,093
- Somebody gonna die
or something's happening.

1016
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,194
I don't know.

1017
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,662
Y'all scaring me.

1018
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:02,100
Aah!

1019
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,702
- All right,
we're alone now.

1020
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,737
You can come out.

1021
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,841
Blessed be, kitty girls.

1022
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,510
How many
of my eliminated girls

1023
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,212
were you able to capture?

1024
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,349
- We think
you'll be pleased.

1025
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,951
- Under his eye.

1026
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,786
- Under his eye.

1027
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:25,023
- Under his eye-ee.

1028
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,626
- Let yourselves be known!

1029
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:39,304
The time has come
for your revenge.

1030
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,075
[evil laugh]

1031
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,849
- Next time
on "All Stars..."

1032
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,617
You'll be auditioning

1033
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,253
to be part
of my new super group,

1034
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,822
the Kitty Girls.
- Ow!

1035
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:01,459
- The look is straight
out of Baby Spice's wardrobe.

1036
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,661
- You nailed it.

1037
00:41:02,661 --> 00:41:04,029
- I was blown away.

1038
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,297
- Wait a minute!

1039
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:10,936
I've decided to audition
a few other girls.

1040
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:13,805
- I think this is
a crock of shit.

1041
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,707
- I'm not here for drama.

1042
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,610
- Oh, it's about to go down.
