1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,803
- Previously
on "All Stars..."

3
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,504
- I think I would have
chosen Thorgy to stay.

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:08,909
I find Thorgy's concepts
much more exciting.

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,245
- Fuck my drag, right?

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:15,148
- You'll be improv-ing your way
through "The Bitchelor."

7
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,717
- Ooh, you is fine.

8
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,318
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

9
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,988
- Have you ever
taken out a catheter?

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:21,989
- Aja.

11
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,757
- I didn't get needy girl.

12
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,158
- Oh, my God.
- At all.

13
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,027
- Chi Chi DeVayne.

14
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,263
- You were constantly
overshadowed.

15
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,832
- Milk.
- You were going so fast--

16
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:32,999
- I can't handle it
right now!

17
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,535
- You weren't sharing
the stage.

18
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,705
- Kennedy Davenport,
you're a winner, baby.

19
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,441
- Whoo!
[applause]

20
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:45,412
- Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

21
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,248
- I had to think about
everything that was going on,

22
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,152
on and off screen
to make my decision,

23
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,453
so I chose...

24
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,357
Milk.

25
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,628
- Milk, sashay away.

26
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,873
- Ooh, Lord.

27
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,174
- Oh, my God.

28
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,244
"Love you girls,
but y'all know--"

29
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,379
- "This is bogus."
- Bogus?

30
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,114
[chuckles]

31
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,416
- The girls
are getting mighty shady

32
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,518
with the mirror this season,
aren't they?

33
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:26,687
First I got told to suck it.

34
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:30,023
Now Kennedy is getting told
that her decision is bogus.

35
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,658
- That was shady,
but all right.

36
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,926
Bitch, please.

37
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,798
How is it bogus if you
are getting bad critiques?

38
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,967
Let me go on and say
why I did what I did.

39
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,737
Like the judges,
I just wasn't enthused at all.

40
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,540
On a personal note,
I couldn't relate to Milk,

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,643
and then for her to sit and say
that she would've sent me home,

42
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,978
that hurt my feelings.

43
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,380
- I totally understand
where she's coming from.

44
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,116
If someone tried
to devalidate my drag,

45
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,384
I would send them home, too.

46
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,685
Because if Milk
was in the top,

47
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,054
she could have
sent home Kennedy.

48
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,224
- I just didn't feel
nothing genuine from Milk.

49
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,828
- Ben, who did you choose
to go home?

50
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,296
- I chose Chi Chi.

51
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,866
One of the things that Chi Chi
and I talked about was--

52
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:13,867
- The fire.

53
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,869
- It felt like it dimmed.

54
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,905
- I'm not mad at, you know,
Ben for picking me.

55
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:23,577
Obviously somebody up there
is keeping me here for a reason.

56
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,546
- Chi Chi can give
way more than she's giving.

57
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,882
Because guess what?
Now all eyes are on Chi Chi.

58
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,883
Sorry.

59
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,352
- Time to change.
- Whoo!

60
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,221
- I was a little gagged,
but, um, I was a little gagged.

61
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,355
- I was totally gagged.

62
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,390
It's subjective.

63
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,691
At some point
it comes down to, like,

64
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:41,661
what does one person think
about a performance?

65
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,497
- Or even a person.

66
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,433
That monologue was about what
she thought of Milk as a person.

67
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,769
This elimination,
it was so jarring,

68
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,572
and it's kind of coming down
to personal relationships.

69
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,573
Like, can we get eliminated

70
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,574
because
we don't talk to someone?

71
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,143
Is that the reality here?

72
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,813
It's scary because
there's no comfort level.

73
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,983
Everybody could go home
at any time for whatever reason.

74
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,551
Well, I don't know
what's gonna happen next week,

75
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,053
but it's gonna be
a great Christmas.

76
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,426
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race All Stars"

77
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,027
receives a one-year supply

78
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,563
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

79
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,232
a coveted spot
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

80
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,869
and a cash prize
of $100,000.

81
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,906
With extra-special
guest judge Nicole Byer

82
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,574
and Kristin Chenoweth.

83
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,809
- ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race

84
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,110
- ♪ May the best woman

85
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,680
- ♪ Best woman win

86
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,552
- ♪ Party like wow, pussy
about to end this drought ♪

87
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,387
- [laughs]

88
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,622
- Sis, we up in this room.

89
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,025
I ain't got no time
to be in the bottom.

90
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,126
Bitch, it's time to work.

91
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,463
- Hello, hello, hello!

92
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,731
- Hi!
- Hey!

93
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,567
- Gingham fantasy.

94
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,671
- Ladies,
this week's maxi challenge

95
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,875
is an All Stars edition
of "Snatch Game!"

96
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,611
[cheering]

97
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,147
#AllStars3.
- Whoo-hoo!

98
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,582
- Every season's
"Snatch Game"

99
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,818
separates the cans
from the cannots,

100
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,920
and this time
it's even gonna be harder

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,889
because this is All Stars.

102
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,592
- Gentlemen,
start your engines,

103
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,129
and may
the best All Star win.

104
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,632
- Let me guess.

105
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,034
- I'm going to be doing
Patricia Arquette

106
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,569
in the television show
"Medium."

107
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,770
- [laughs]

108
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,239
- No, I'm doing RuPaul.

109
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,240
- Mother Ru.

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,941
- In my season,
I was so sad

111
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,710
because I didn't get
to do "Snatch Game,"

112
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,980
and I wanted to do RuPaul
in front of RuPaul so bad.

113
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,581
And every time I do RuPaul
in front of people,

114
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,649
they think it's hilarious.

115
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,451
She likes dad jokes
like I do.

116
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,720
She likes puns, bad jokes.
It's gonna be great.

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,754
I'm winning the challenge.

118
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,022
- You sound
real confident, sis.

119
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,992
- I am.
- You do not play with that.

120
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,928
Nobody has been successful
doing RuPaul.

121
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,630
I mean,
just because you do her

122
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,399
on your little show
playing around,

123
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,768
it's harder doing it
before the competition.

124
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,638
Who you gonna do?

125
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,907
- Miss Maya Angelou.

126
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,074
- What you doing?

127
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,210
- I'm doing Paul Lynde.
- Okay.

128
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,478
- Do you know him?
- No.

129
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,481
- Paul Lynde was this comedian
in the seventies.

130
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,350
He was the center square
on "Hollywood Squares"

131
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,885
for like a full decade.
- Okay.

132
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,822
- At this point,
Ben has won so many challenges,

133
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,525
so now it's like
I'm this horse,

134
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,793
but then I see
this other horse,

135
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,962
like, now miles ahead
of the rest of us,

136
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,298
and it's, like,
I'm never gonna catch up.

137
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,333
So it's just, like,
I have to get a win.

138
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,935
I have to get a win so bad.

139
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,269
So this
is my first "Snatch Game."

140
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,804
I have nothing to live up to,
so I feel like I'm--

141
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,573
- What's this?

142
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,274
- The thing of, like,
living up to a predecessor--

143
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,976
- From Thorgy.

144
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,011
- Oh, Thorgy wrote this?
- Yeah.

145
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,315
- It says fuck
this shady bitch Shangela."

146
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,583
And it has
my name crossed out.

147
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,918
- I didn't show it you

148
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,254
because I thought it was
not helpful or appropriate.

149
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,489
- But you decided
to hang it on the wall?

150
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,825
- Oh, boy, here we go.

151
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,127
- Its my note from Thorgy.
I put it behind the Milk note.

152
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,363
- Yeah, but this one
specifically talks about me

153
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,731
and then says,
"fuck this shady bitch,"

154
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,266
and then points at my name,

155
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,134
and then
you hung it on the wall.

156
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,538
- Oh, face crack.

157
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:15,008
I know Trixie's stomach
has fallen out of her ass.

158
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,476
- Well, I don't care
what you think.

159
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,278
She gave it to me because she
was sad, and I'm honoring her.

160
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,580
I like those people.

161
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,449
- Trixie, you can't tell me

162
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,386
that you read Thorgy
calling Shangela a bitch,

163
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,988
and you just saw
the goodness in the letter

164
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:28,989
and wanted to put it up.

165
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,357
Cut the shit.

166
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,459
- I would not do something--

167
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,027
No, girl, leave it now.

168
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,395
I know you feel--
that's the way you really feel

169
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,463
about someone like me.

170
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,365
I wouldn't put that up
against someone

171
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:39,699
because I would not want you
to feel bad like that.

172
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,301
- I never even showed it to you
because I didn't want--

173
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,469
- You hung
it on the wall, sis.

174
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,470
- Oh, my God,
get out of my station.

175
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,471
- But it is what it is.

176
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,207
- Ooh, the drama
in the pageant.

177
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,109
- Bitch, I've gotta light
an incense around here

178
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,677
to clear the air.

179
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,779
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

180
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,148
[RuPaul laughs]

181
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,420
- How did Thorgy's feelings
about Shangela

182
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,955
make Shangela mad at me now?

183
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,723
- I think she was just upset

184
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,259
because you hung it up
and didn't tell her.

185
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,030
- Thorgy left a really shitty
message to me on the mirror.

186
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,431
I took the high road
on that.

187
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,934
Then I find out she double
dogged me in a written note.

188
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,070
Then Trixie hangs the note up
on the wall.

189
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,239
How much does Shangy
got to take?

190
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,807
- Trixie is a mess,

191
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,776
and she shouldn't even
have that up there.

192
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,278
She put it up there
to be a mess.

193
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,313
- What do you mean
by a mess?

194
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,614
- Why would you
put it up there?

195
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,882
- I wouldn't, but--
- My point.

196
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:32,385
So her putting it up there,
that's being a mess.

197
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,120
- I just think maybe
she wasn't thinking about it.

198
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,255
- Girl.
Come on, Ben.

199
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,289
- Maybe she was just
thinking about her--

200
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,059
- Some things
you just do not do.

201
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,128
If we all supposed to be
this sisterhood and stuff,

202
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,997
that type of shit
don't supposed to fly.

203
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,534
- Hey, ladies!

204
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,202
- Hi!

205
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,203
- Look who's here!

206
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,237
- Hi, guys.

207
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,472
[cheering]

208
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,973
- Marc Jacobs.
- Yes!

209
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,709
- Are you ready, Marc?
- I'm ready.

210
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,710
- Let's go.

211
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,278
- Hi, Mother.

212
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,981
- BeBe, now, this is
an interesting get up here.

213
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,783
- Right.
Very pointy shoulders.

214
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,318
- Uh-huh.
Any guesses, Marc?

215
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,987
- Oh, I don't know.
Grace Jones?

216
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,057
- Oh, it is Grace Jones?
- It is Grace Jones.

217
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,159
- Oh, my God.
- I guessed?

218
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,128
- Yes. Wow.
- Yes, Grace Jones.

219
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,663
- This is exciting,

220
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,865
because then I just
get to embody somebody else

221
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,567
that is not necessarily me,
you know?

222
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,936
As much as I love her,
the way she would talk

223
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,537
and the words that
come out from her mouth,

224
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,606
I'm like, oh, my God,
did she just say that, you know?

225
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,174
- But you also have
to be funny, which is--

226
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,909
- You gotta make Ru laugh.
- That's right.

227
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,945
- I know, and that's what
I'm trying to work on.

228
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,146
- Yeah.

229
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,214
- I personally think

230
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:38,084
Grace Jones is a look
and an attitude.

231
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,219
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

232
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,421
- But to make Grace Jones
truly funny,

233
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,056
I wonder
if BeBe can do that.

234
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,658
- Hi, Shangela.

235
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,860
- Hey, Ru!

236
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,661
- Hi, Shangela.
- Hi!

237
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,463
- I see tarot cards,

238
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,533
there's a telephone
and a kaftan back there.

239
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,835
Marc, do you know who this is?
- Who is it?

240
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,871
- This is Miss Cleo. Yes.

241
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,206
- The late great Miss Cleo.

242
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,142
- That's right. She died
a couple years ago--

243
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,710
- Did she?
- From heart disease.

244
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,944
- She didn't
see that coming?

245
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,012
- No.

246
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,814
- That was my joke, Marc.

247
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,115
- I'm sorry.
- That was my joke.

248
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,084
- Now, were there other people
that you considered?

249
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,686
- For sure.
I considered diva Jenifer Lewis,

250
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,754
who I love so very much.

251
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,223
- And you know her intimately.
- Yes.

252
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,525
This is actually
one of Jen's coats.

253
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:22,429
She let me go diving in
her closet before coming here,

254
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:23,897
and it's Marc Jacobs.

255
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,732
- And you didn't know Marc
would be here today.

256
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,467
- No! I saw it
in the cards, though.

257
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,802
Hon, the power of the tarot.

258
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,069
- Yeah, see,
the cards never lie.

259
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,671
- Call me now, darling.

260
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,972
- Well, actually,
your accent

261
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:37,110
sounded a little like Ireland
for a minute there.

262
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,912
- Wait a minute.

263
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,213
Miss Cleo is Jamaican.

264
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,682
If you thinking she for
a four-leaf clover fish,

265
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,785
I'm maybe
going home with Cleo.

266
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,687
- Oh, darling, no.

267
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,389
They didn't say that
in the cards.

268
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,723
But maybe she was Irish--

269
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,426
- Are you hearing
an Irish accent?

270
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,662
- I've got
a lot riding on this.

271
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,230
I can't fuck this up.
Call me.

272
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,631
- Call me now.

273
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,100
- I'm going with the backup,
Jenifer Lewis.

274
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,837
- Hi, Kennedy.
- Hi.

275
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,004
- Hi, Kennedy.

276
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,040
- So I see
a church lady outfit here.

277
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,843
- Mm-hmm. She have two boys.

278
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,044
- Oh, oh, okay, I know.

279
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,413
You're
a Housewife of Atlanta.

280
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,481
- Yes.

281
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,216
- You're Phaedra Parks.
- Phaedra Parks.

282
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,450
- I love that.

283
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,919
- She believe in her Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ,

284
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,754
and want to pray for you.
- Amen.

285
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,755
- But behind closed doors,

286
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,290
she want to pull out
her nasty stuff.

287
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,358
- [laughs]

288
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,826
- Now, you won
as Little Richard.

289
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,561
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now, if you win this one,

290
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,029
you'll be the first queen
in history

291
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,398
to win two "Snatch Games."

292
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,433
- Two Snatches.

293
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,169
- Two Snatches.
I love that.

294
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,303
- Oh, wow.

295
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,973
- "Snatch Game"
is more important than ever

296
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,242
to determine
who is a contender

297
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,511
and who is just road kill.

298
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,779
- Bring on the pressure.

299
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,616
The struggle is real
on my end.

300
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,654
- Can I talk to you?

301
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,723
- Yeah, let's talk.

302
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,725
- I can't go forward
with the "Snatch Game"

303
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,493
thinking that Shangela
is, like, mad at me.

304
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,029
- It didn't even occur to me
it hurt your feelings.

305
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,330
- It does hurt my feelings.

306
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,331
- I didn't write it.

307
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,334
- All right, sis.

308
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,738
I'm used to girls,
sometimes me,

309
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:12,906
thinking one way about them,

310
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,207
and then it totally
flipped the script.

311
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,608
The lowest moment
in my season

312
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,144
was when Ru
asked who should go home.

313
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,979
- Who do you think
should go home tonight?

314
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,881
- I would like to see
Shangela go.

315
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,616
She's just a loud mouth,

316
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,351
and she's always talking
and halle-looing.

317
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,886
- You should be on
Season 5 or 6.

318
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,054
That's where you should be.

319
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,056
- These are people
I thought were my friends.

320
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,958
Girl, I was cracked.

321
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,327
- I have absolute respect
for you, and I'm really sorry.

322
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,396
I should have just
tore that section off

323
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,730
and kept it positive.

324
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,333
- I appreciate your apology.
I do.

325
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,702
Lucky you're meeting
"All Stars 3" me.

326
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,071
Season 3 me would have
snatched that note off the wall

327
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,140
and come for you,
but I'm not gonna do that.

328
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,342
Trixie's apology
seems sincere,

329
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:53,746
but I'm looking at her with
this one good eye like this.

330
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,548
Oh, can I trust you, bitch?

331
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,518
'Cause you giving me very
flip-flop fish right now.

332
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,386
Let's see which way
the cookie crumbles.

333
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,554
- All right.
Let's do this goddamn--

334
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,555
- Good luck, RuPaul.

335
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,524
- Coming up...

336
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,559
- RuPaul, when are we
going to fuck?

337
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,061
- [laughs]
- Where's Sabrina?

338
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,396
I will sue the bitch,
darling.

339
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,265
- Carson, I've been meaning
to get these back to you.

340
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,600
- [laughs]

341
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,768
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

342
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,972
[RuPaul laughs]

343
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:23,710
- Welcome to an All Star edition
of the "Snatch Game."

344
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,012
Let's welcome
our contestants.

345
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:30,717
He hasn't worn men's underwear
since 1982.

346
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,986
Let's welcome
Carson Kressley.

347
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,488
- Oh. Hi, everybody.

348
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,924
- Her boob job is so old

349
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,627
her breasts
are filled with asbestos.

350
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,628
- That's true.

351
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,129
- Please welcome
Michelle Visage.

352
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,333
Contestants, are you ready
to meet our celebrities?

353
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,334
- Yes!
- Yes!

354
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,003
- All right.

355
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:55,274
Don't be jealous of her boogie,
it's RuPaul.

356
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,978
- Welcome to "Snatch Game"
at "RuPaul's Drag Race."

357
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:02,382
Give it up for our special
guest host, Boy RuPaul.

358
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:06,853
- Now, RuPaul,
do I call you he or she?

359
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,588
- You can call me he, she,
Regis and Kathi Lee

360
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,957
as long as you buy
"American" on iTunes.

361
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,792
[all laugh]

362
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:18,398
- All right. Next up, from
"Real Housewives of Atlanta,"

363
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,033
it's Phaedra Parks,
ladies and gentlemen.

364
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,101
- Oh, hey, hey, hey, Ru.

365
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,738
I just got back
from the New Birth Missionary

366
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:30,443
Baptist Church Church of God and
Christ convocational service.

367
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:33,079
- Uh-huh. Well, thank you
for being here, Phaedra.

368
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,514
- No, thank you,
and God bless.

369
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,049
- All right.

370
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:40,286
Straight from the center square,
it's Paul Lynde.

371
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,822
- Well, hi, there, Ru.
I'm glad it's you.

372
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,391
For a second I thought somebody
had gift wrapped Flip Wilson.

373
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,827
[all laugh]

374
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,764
- All right. She's one
of Oprah's favorite things.

375
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,501
Let's hear it
for "Mya Angelou?"

376
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,905
You know, you spelled
your name wrong on there.

377
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,606
- Oh, did I?
- Yes.

378
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,475
- How you spell Maya?

379
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,377
- Oh, damn, Chi Chi.

380
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,979
How you gonna be one of the
world's most beloved poets,

381
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,082
and you can't spell
your own name?

382
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,684
- Now, Maya,
I've always wanted to know,

383
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,519
why does
the caged bird sing?

384
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,858
- The caged bird sings,
darling, because...

385
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,132
I don't know why
the caged bird sings, darling.

386
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:28,000
- [laughs] All right.

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,536
From the hit show "Blackish,"
Jenifer Lewis.

388
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,306
- Yes, that's right, RuPaul.
That's Jenifer Lewis.

389
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:37,009
One "N," one "I",
and a helluva lot of talent.

390
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,345
[all laugh]

391
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:45,118
- Up next, star of "The Queen,"
Crystal LaBeija.

392
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,185
- Ru, where's Sabrina?

393
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,588
I will sue the bitch,
darling.

394
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,759
- Crystal LaBeija from
the legendary House of LaBeija.

395
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,360
- The founder, the mother,
the creator.

396
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,562
I am everything.
And I know I'm beautiful.

397
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,331
I don't need anyone
to tell me.

398
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,499
- [laughs]

399
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,267
All right. Up next,

400
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,936
pull up
to the bumper, baby.

401
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,207
Style and music icon
Grace Jones.

402
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,709
- So, RuPaul?
- Yes.

403
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,444
- When are we going
to fuck?

404
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,780
- [all laugh]

405
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,181
- You don't like women?

406
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,951
No man can turn down
this pussy.

407
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,488
- Your Miss Jones
was not graceful.

408
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,660
- All right.

409
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,930
All right, up next,
last but not least,

410
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,166
she's not just popular,

411
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,768
she's won
a Tony and an Emmy.

412
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,273
Please welcome the gorgeous
Kristin Chenoweth.

413
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,141
[applause]
Hello, Kristin.

414
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,509
- Hello, my darling.

415
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,546
I always thought that one
of these queens would do me,

416
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,680
and no one ever did,

417
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,615
so I decided to come here
and do myself.

418
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,083
- That's right.
- ♪ Whoo

419
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,985
- Yes! Yes!
[applause]

420
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,288
- Sweetheart, none of these
queens are gonna do you.

421
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,756
[all laugh]

422
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,292
- I'm so happy
that you are here.

423
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,327
- I'm so happy to be here,
my darling.

424
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,630
- Are y'all ready to play
the "Snatch Game?"

425
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,332
- Yes!
- All right.

426
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,467
First question for Carson.

427
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,070
Kristin Chenoweth is so tiny

428
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,940
that when she walks
into a restaurant,

429
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,143
the hostess
hands her a blank.

430
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,713
Celebrities, go ahead
and write your answer down.

431
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,315
All right.
What say you, Carson?

432
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,085
- I'm not a doctor, but I'm
gonna say growth hormones.

433
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,054
- [all laugh]
- All right.

434
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,556
Let's go and see
if you have any matches.

435
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,326
All right, Phaedra.
Ooh, oh, hey, Phaedra.

436
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,328
What is that? She's fracking?
Is that what she's doing?

437
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,531
- Girl, you know I had to take
that church stuff off, honey.

438
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,066
- Oh, yes.

439
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,202
- I said a napkin
to wipe up,

440
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,339
'cause clearly
he's the appetizer.

441
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,109
- Oh, okay.

442
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,311
All right. Paul Lynde.

443
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,413
- This is the most queens
I've been surrounded by

444
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,650
since Charles Nelson Reilly's
pool party.

445
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,386
[all laugh]

446
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,688
- Well, I said
a cocktail weenie.

447
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,825
'Cause it's to scale.
- [laughs]

448
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,693
- Sorry, it's not a match,
Carson.

449
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,795
- Not a match.
- Circle gets the square.

450
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,063
- [laughs]

451
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:15,234
- All right. Maya Angelou,
poet, activist, actress.

452
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,270
- Spelling bee winner,
mm-hmm.

453
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,339
- Maya Angelou,
what say you?

454
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,377
- Well, I said that the hostess
hands the poor thing

455
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,612
that same caged bird

456
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,316
fried, died,
and laid to the side.

457
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,753
- Oh. Maya, thank you
for answering my question

458
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,055
from last round
in this round.

459
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,125
Maybe you'll have a good answer
for this question

460
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,994
in the next round.

461
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,031
Let's move on down
to Jenifer Lewis.

462
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,399
- Well, look at little
cute little Kristin.

463
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,800
I love her.
Two Broadway divas.

464
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,769
You know, I've worked with
Kristin way back in the day.

465
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,337
- Did you?
- Yeah. No, I'm lying.

466
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,172
I ain't worked with that bitch.
But anyhow, let's--

467
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,240
[all laugh]

468
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,608
- I think that Kristin
has to fit up

469
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,009
in that little bubble
in "Wicked."

470
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,010
- You saw the show.
- Sure.

471
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,178
- I saw it,
and therefore,

472
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,147
I think that man
handed her a high five

473
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,682
when she walked in.

474
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,150
- That would be apropos.

475
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,851
- What apro-ho?
Who you calling a ho?

476
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,154
I'm about to have
a hot flash up in here.

477
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,855
- Ooh! Oh, yes, yes.

478
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,324
- Yeah. You know,
I'm going through menopause.

479
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:12,625
- Are you?
- Yeah.

480
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,759
I don't know why
they call it menopause.

481
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,029
There ain't no men up in it.
- [laughs]

482
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,366
Kristin Chenoweth, what
did the hostess hand you?

483
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,635
- A booster chair.

484
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,870
- A booster chair.

485
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,739
- Which I actually brought.

486
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,907
- You brought one?

487
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,809
- I travel
with my own booster.

488
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,712
- Oh, wow, that's so smart.

489
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,314
This question
is for Michelle Visage.

490
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,617
I'm coming out
with a RuPaul cookbook.

491
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:44,957
It includes my famous recipe
for spaghetti and blank balls.

492
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,160
- I'm gonna go with spaghetti
and tucked balls.

493
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,228
- Ooh,
those sound delicious.

494
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,529
- Delicious.
- Oh, yes.

495
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,465
- You have to kind of dig
to find them.

496
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,233
All right,
let's go to the stars

497
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,868
and hear
what they have to say.

498
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,536
Grace Jones.
- Yes.

499
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:02,008
- My famous recipe
for spaghetti and blank balls.

500
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,142
What do you think it is?

501
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,811
- Steel vagina.

502
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,146
- Steel vagina?

503
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,749
- Yes. That's the name
of my upcoming perfume.

504
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,117
- I see.

505
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,918
- This is why I don't keep
the company of the ladies.

506
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,488
- Yes, Paul Lynde, yes.

507
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,157
What are those, Grace Jones?
- That's the song.

508
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,126
- Carson, I've meaning
to get these back to you.

509
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,494
My apologies.

510
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,928
I think she's also
wearing your clothes,

511
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,331
but I didn't recognize them
without the Crisco.

512
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,633
[all laugh]

513
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,201
- What say you, RuPaul?

514
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,237
- Well, Michelle, my balls
are tucked so tight

515
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,140
that I blacked out, fell down,
woke up a second ago,

516
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,475
panicked and just wrote

517
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,378
- I'm glad you reminded
everybody of that,

518
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,981
but unfortunately,
that is not a match, RuPaul.

519
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,483
- RuPaul, I wanted
to congratulate you

520
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,086
on your
Hollywood Star of Fame.

521
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,155
- Oh, thank you so much,
my dear.

522
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:54,493
As we say in the industry,
winner winner chicken...dinner.

523
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,565
- Crickets.
Trixie's just kind of like

524
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,201
throwing these little
RuPaul one-liners in,

525
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,569
but they're out of place.

526
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,604
It's just not fitting.

527

it was funny.

spaghetti and blank balls.

Yes. Yes, it was.

- Wow, darling,
tell another one.

537
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,798
- This one's
for Michelle Visage.

538
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,534
Ricky Martin is so hot,

539
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,638
blank melts in his mouth
and in his hand.

540
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,941
- Well, he is of
the Puerto Rican descent.

541
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,910
- Uh-huh.
- I'm going to say flan.

542
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,513
- Flan. Okay.
- Yeah.

543
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,848
- Crystal LaBeija.

544
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,116
Are you having a good time,
Crystal?

545
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,418
- Darling, I'm having
the worst time of my life.

546
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,520
I just want
to walk away so bad.

547
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,222
Darling,
let me tell you something

548
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,656
about my friend Monique.

549
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,591
She's not here
because she's melting

550
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,925
in his mouth
and his hands,

551
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,094
but she called me this morning
and she said, Crystal,

552
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,163
let me tell you about
the "Snatch Game."

553
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,865
None of the true beauties
are gonna be there,

554
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,033
and, darling, she was right.

555

- Okay. [laughs]

556
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,403
Phaedra, what do you have?

557
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,973
Ricky Martin melts--
so damn hot.

558
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:15,674
Do you think he's hot,
Phaedra?

559
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,077
- Ooh.

560
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,478
Ooh.

561
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,514
- That's a yes?

562
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,648
- Mm, mm, mm.

563
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,950
I said my Candy.

564
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,587
- Kennedy won "Snatch Game"
her season,

565
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,189
but she ain't winning
this one.

566
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,958
- You've won an uncomfortable
phone call to your ex

567
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,227
and a half eaten hotdog
from the back of my car.

568
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,497
- Oh, shut up, RuPaul.

569
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,766
- All right. Now, Carson,
this one's for you.

570
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,170
The U.S. Congress
is so dysfunctional,

571
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,139

572
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,142
- They can't pass
the 8th grade.

573

All right, Maya Angelou.

577
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,053
'cause we all know

578
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,756

some uptight asses.

579

in that answer. Yes.

We're gonna move on down
to Kristin Chenoweth.

581

- They can't pass
gun control.

582
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,167
There's only one gun
for all of us,

583
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,002
and it's a bubble gun.

584
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,038
- A bubble gun!
Look at these bubbles.

585
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,074
Nobody can control
those bubbles.

586
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:25,144
Aw, shucks.
Time's up.

"Snatch Game" is...

don't have televisions.

Goodbye, RuPaul.

592

- Coming up...
- I wished it was more

593
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:45,364
than just kind of
the one note that it was.

594
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,266
- I didn't think
it was super one note.

595
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:48,934
- It was like tumbleweed.

Not you. Aah! [laughs]

600
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,349
- It's elimination day.

601
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,717
We're recovering
from "Snatch Game,"

602
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,086
and we had a pretty shocking
elimination last week,

603
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,153
so I think we're all back

604
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,822
into, like,
pins and needles mode.

605
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,624
- Bitch, Trixie.

606
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,826
- It wasn't the best RuPaul,
I'll tell you that.

607
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,029
- And she know that
she wasn't the best.

608
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,564
- How do you feel, Chi Chi?

609
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,366
- Well, I mean, I played

610
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,501
the dumbest Maya Angelou
in the world.

611
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,570
- These challenges
are fucking hard.

612
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,105
Also, "Snatch Game"
is fucking hard.

613
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,573
- It is.

614
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,509
- I really wanted to, like, do
really well in this challenge,

615
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,510
so I'm kind of disappointed.

616
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,911
I expected myself
to do better,

617
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,246
and I think
the other queens here

618
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,515
expected me to come in,
like, guns a-blazing.

619
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,151
But holy fuck,
did it not go good.

620
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,121
- How do you feel?

621
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,757
- As soon as Ru
laughed at my first joke,

622
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,025
I was, like, all right,
I feel good.

623
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,027
- Oh, no, Ru was in it
to win it with you, girl.

624
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,396
- I feel really pleased
and, you know, I mean,

625
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,298
I kind of felt
the other day,

626
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,035
like, I wound up
with Trixie's win.

627
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,373
And that felt weird to me
being in the top two,

628
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,709
because I feel like that
should have gone to Trixie,

629
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,244
and so I was feeling weird
about that.

630
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,313
- Look,
game recognizes game.

631
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:11,150
She's playing it low
because she keeps winning.

And when you keep winning,

start targeting you.

think I deserved to win.

Oh, I wanna
give back the award.

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,199
[RuPaul laughs]

691
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,601
- Welcome, ladies.

692
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,937
I've made some decisions.

693
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,106
When I call your name,
please step forward.

694
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,441
Shangela.

695
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,544
BenDeLaCreme.

696
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,214
Con-drag-ulations.

697
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:57,850
You are the top two
All Stars of the week.

698
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,953
[applause]

699
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:05,858
You've each won a wig wardrobe
from Rock Star Wigs,

700
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,561
and a $1,000 gift card

701
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:13,832
from CoolHaus
Super Premium Ice Cream.

702
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,235
- Ooh.
- [Michelle laughs]

703
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,437
- Please step
to the back of the stage.

704
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,408
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

705
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,711
First up, Aja.

706
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,514
- Your look: Edie Sedgwick
comes to life.

707
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,517
If I don't get that outfit
by the end of this,

708
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,019
then you and I will meet
in a back alley somewhere.

709
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,021
All right?
[all laugh]

710
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:39,725
- You embodied
Crystal LaBeija.

711
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:40,926
- But I wish it was more

712
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,961
than just kind of
the one note that it was.

713
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,863
- I didn't think
it was super one note.

714
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,132
I love
that fucking stank face

715
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,368
you were serving
the whole time.

716
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,370
You did a great job.

717
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,906
- Up next,
BeBe Zahara Benet.

718
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:56,775
- I can't get over
how stunning you look tonight.

719
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,878
- You look like a fudgsicle
dipped in flowers,

720
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,446
and I'm here for it.

721
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:02,981
- Your Grace Jones

722
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:06,618
was just the right amount
of glamour and weirdness.

723
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,854
- But I felt
it kind of lost its way.

724
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,356
I know that you didn't do
a "Snatch Game" in your season.

725
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,524
It's intimidating,
isn't it?

726
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,525
- It is.

727
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,927
- It's about staying
in the character

728
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,663
and being able to deliver
in the character all the time.

729
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,698
- Kennedy Davenport.

730
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,667
- Oh, my God, Phaedra Parks.

731
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,569
She's gonna send you
a cease and desist letter

732
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:24,736
for looking better
than she does.

733
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,871
[RuPaul laughs]

734
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,040
- But you were kind of
in and out of it.

735
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,541
- Ooh.
- We were losing her.

736
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,776
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,711
- You know, my eyes
kept going to other girls,

738
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,646
and they weren't
going to Phaedra.

739
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:38,350
- And this runway look,
the green leaves on the bottom,

740
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,785
the touches in the wig,

741
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:42,421
maybe that's a little
arts and craftsy for me.

742
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:44,356
Maybe up
the sophistication level.

743
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:47,359
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

744
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,694
- What's up, y'all?

745
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:49,962
- I've never seen you
look better.

746
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:51,096
- Thank you.

747
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,532
- You look like
a nice slutty teen

748
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:54,733
who's getting married.

749
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,135
[all laugh]
- Teen?

750
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,504
- So let's talk
about Maya Angelou.

751
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,574
You spelled your name wrong
for starters,

752
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,344
and then Ru asked you if you
knew why the caged bird sings,

753
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,079
and it was like tumbleweed.

754
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,782
- I would have done a little bit
of a later years Maya.

755
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,517
I would have been
fuller figured,

756
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,852
you know,
looked a little older,

757
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,687
because the visual cues
weren't there,

758
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,688
and that is crucial.

759
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:19,157
- Up next, Trixie Mattel.

760
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,258
- Hi, guys.

761
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,427
- Tonight on the runway,
very kawaii,

762
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,062
but there's a lot going on.

763
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,731
- For me, more is more.
- Tch.

764
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:26,932
- I mean, this is great.

765
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,268
Like, I need Claritin
to just look at this.

766
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,436
- Now let's talk about
your "Snatch Game."

767
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,738
The first thing you did,

768
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:35,107
when you landed with the
"American" CD, that was funny.

769
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,375
- Yeah.

770
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,343
- And then I didn't laugh,
like, the whole time.

771
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,446
It was one note literally
through the whole thing.

772
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,282
I know you.

773
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,885
There's something that's
telling me you're not all here.

774
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:48,286
- When I get nervous here,

775
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,188
it's like
I'm at Camp Crystal Lake

776
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,823
and Jason's outside
with a machete.

777
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,459
It's like that level panic
sometimes.

778
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,663
- Why?
- I don't know. It's...

779
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,232
It was harder than it looks.

780
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,334
[sobs] Sorry.

781
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,202
I thought it was gonna be,
like, my challenge.

782
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,905
I was, like, so excited,
and I got in there

783
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,442
and it was just, like--
it's, like, frozen.

784
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,810
It fucking sucks.

785
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,046
- Don't forget
what you have

786
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:16,448
and what you offer
and who you are,

787
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,618
whether this continues
or not, okay?

788
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:20,786
Fight for yourself.

789
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:24,089
- I just want more
of Trixie Mattel.

790
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,726
Invite her back here,
because we want her.

791
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,796
- Thank you, ladies.

792
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,031
Based on
the judges' critiques,

793
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,933
I have made some decisions.

794
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,738
- Chi Chi DeVayne.

795
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,041
Kennedy Davenport.

796
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,344
Trixie Mattel.

797
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,316
You are in the bottom three.

798
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:58,890
That means Aja, BeBe,
you're safe.

799
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,258
- Thank you.

800
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:05,497
- Shangela and DeLa,
each of you needs to decide

801
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,800
which of the bottom three
you'll eliminate

802
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,103
if you win the lip sync.

803
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:13,371
Thank you, ladies.

804
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,374
You may leave the stage.

805
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,944
- All right, sis.

806
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,812
- Careful of that bump.

807
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:21,980
- There she goes.

808
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,915
- I'm disappointed.

809
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,650
I thought I was gonna win
this challenge,

810
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,686
and instead,
I absolutely face planted

811
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,689
in front of the person
I'm impersonating,

812
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,257
so it's worst case scenario.

813
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,993
- Each of the girls, I would
love to have a chat with them.

814
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,696
Who wants to go with me?
Come on, Kens.

815
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,064
- Who wants to go with me?

816
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,932
- I'll go.

817
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,502
- Sis, what's
on your mind right now?

818
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,137
- It was not funny.

819
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,738
- I know, baby.

820
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,206
- It fucking sucked,

821
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,076
Like, I feel like I told
the judges and everyone here,

822
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,813
like, a secret
that, like, I'm so scared,

823
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:57,983
and I didn't want
everybody to know

824
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,785
because I don't think
anybody here

825
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:02,287
saw me being afraid
of "Drag Race,"

826
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,022
because I'm not afraid
of drag in the real world.

827
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,258
I love "Drag Race."
I love being Trixie.

828
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,227
And then to come here
and, like, to not be

829
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,229
the Trixie
I know my fans look for,

830
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,898
it's like, fuck,
you know what I mean?

831
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,135
- Girl,
there's nothing to say.

832
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,005
I mean, just be fair.

833
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,841
I've been here four times,
so just be fair.

834
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:24,476
I'm being real about it.

835
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:26,211
You know, I don't want it
to come off

836
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,914
as all the girls
just keep saving me

837
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,816
because
I'm their good friend.

838
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,117
This is a competition.

839
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,419
It's not
RuPaul's Best Friends Race.

840
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,855
I'm so proud of what I did,
you know what I mean?

841
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,657
And what
I've gotten to show,

842
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,858
and if I go home,
I'm gonna be happy.

843
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,393
And if I stay,
I'm gonna be happy.

844
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,228
So...
- I'm really proud of you

845
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,164
for continuing
to plug away at this.

846
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,199
- Yeah.

847
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,301
- Does Chi Chi
deserve another chance?

848
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:53,572
But she does have
such a charm,

849
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,041
so I wouldn't put it past
anybody to save her again.

850
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,543
- I'll send the next girl
on over.

851
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,112
- First of all, I know tonight's
an emotional night for you.

852
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,113
- Yeah.

853
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,315
- Give me a hug.

854
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,050
- Girl, it fucking sucks.

855
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,220
- Like I told y'all, this is
the Game of Thrones of drag.

856
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,890
The seven kingdoms, baby,
you've gotta have alliances.

857
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,859
So I'm trying to figure out

858
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,262
is Trixie Jon Snow
or is she Cersei Lannister?

859
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:20,665
Because I ain't trying to be up
in a red wedding situation.

860
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,902
I know how talented you are,

861
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:26,037
but you also know
this is a competition,

862
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,673
and all of us want to win,

863
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:33,745
and I have to put my allegiance
where I feel I have allies.

864
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,547
- I feel like
it's behind us,

865
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:38,884
and I don't think it would
come up in a lipstick situation,

866
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,585
but I hope that
what happened yesterday

867
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,088
isn't, like, the reason
you would pick my lipstick.

868
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,390
- No, but even
the whole note thing,

869
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,692
all that kind of stuff
just sits with me

870
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,060
in the fact
when I'm thinking, like,

871
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,362
if I'm in the bottom,

872
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,731
is she gonna
ever save me or not?

873
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,500
Of everybody
in the bottom three,

874
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,535
you're the one
I worry about.

875
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,738
This game
is a game based on trust.

876
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:02,173
Kennedy is my sister,

877
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,609
and, yes, Chi Chi's been
in the bottom four times,

878
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,711
but at least I know
I can trust Chi Chi.

879
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,047
Can I trust Trixie Mattel?

880
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,582
Are you my ally, girl?

881
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,420
- Hi.
- Here we go, girl.

882
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,755
There has to be
somebody at the top,

883
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,223
there gotta be somebody
at the bottom,

884
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,591
there's gotta be
some people in the middle.

885
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,093
And I just feel like
I fell in the middle.

886
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,095
I don't feel like
I did a bad job.

887
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,898
I'm the one that was
the strongest out of the three,

888
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,999
and I'm just being honest.

889
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,601
I do feel that way,

890
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,437
but at the end of the day,
it's your decision.

891
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,773
- This decision
feels impossible.

892
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,008
Chi Chi's wound up in the bottom
a few times now,

893
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:41,379
but she has
this can-do attitude,

894
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,348
which speaks very well
for her continuing.

895
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,550
Kennedy has been
a consistently hard worker,

896
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,553
and she has brought her all
to everything.

897
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,489
But Trixie's
just been landing

898
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,458
in the middle of this
competition over and over.

899
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,427
I know that she has
more to bring.

900
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,529
I want to see it so badly,

901
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:00,365
but I don't know
if we're gonna get it.

902
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:09,674
It's never easy to have
to choose a girl to go home.

903
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,510
It is not comfortable
to feel like

904
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,449
I am in charge of so many
people's fates week after week.

905
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,685
- I know this is gonna
crush someone's dreams,

906
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:23,788
but at the end of the day,
this is the competition,

907
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,092
and I've got to make
some very hard choices.

It's bad.

00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,139
have you chosen
to get the chop?

971

have very different
track records,

973
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,746

who has landed in the bottom
several times,

This person left "RuPaul's Drag

going forward as a winner

for themselves,

00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:40,278

long after this

987
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,447

in their talent.
