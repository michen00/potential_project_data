<i>Previously on All-Stars</i>

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:06,142
I think I would've chosen Thorgy to stay

3
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:10,294
I find Thorgy's concepts much more exciting

4
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:12,431
Fuck my drag, right?

5
00:00:12,432 --> 00:00:16,240
You'll be improving your way through 'The Bitchelor'

6
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:19,211
- Boo you is fine.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,756
Have you ever taken out a catheter?

8
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:26,702
- Aja.
- I didn't get needy girl at all.

9
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:30,652
- Chi Chi DeVayne.
- You were constantly overshadowed.

10
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:33,012
- Milk.
- You were going so fast...

11
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:36,647
- I can't handle it right now!
- You weren't sharing the stage

12
00:00:37,048 --> 00:00:40,568
Kennedy Davenport,
You're a winner baby

13
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,719
Which queen have you chosen to get the chop?

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,224
I had to think about everything that was going on

15
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:53,481
on and off screen, to make my decision

16
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:55,262
so I chose

17
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:58,569
Milk

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,484
Milk, sashay, away

19
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,479
[LOVE U GIRLS BUT YA'LL KNOW THIS IS BOGUS! STAY AMAZING!! MILK]

20
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,355
- Ooh Lord.
- Oh my God.

21
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:19,359
"Love you girls, but y'all know-

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,364
- "This is bogus".
- Bogus?

23
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,031
The girls are getting mighty shady

24
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:27,444
with the mirror this season, aren't they?

25
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:29,183
First I got told to suck it

26
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:32,335
Now Kennedy's getting told that her decision is bogus

27
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:33,936
That was shady, but alright.

28
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:35,337
Bitch, please.

29
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:39,976
How is it bogus if you are getting bad critiques?

30
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:42,551
Let me go on and say why I did what I did

31
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:46,173
Like the judges, I just wasn't enthused at all.

32
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,734
On a personal note I couldn't relate to Milk

33
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:51,844
And then for her to sit and say that she would've sent me home

34
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,245
That hurt my feelings.

35
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,591
I totally understand where she's coming from

36
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:58,302
If someone tried to de-validate my drag

37
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,786
I would send them home too.

38
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,226
Because if milk was in the top, she could've sent home Kennedy.

39
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:06,676
I just didn't feel nothing genuine from Milk

40
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:10,517
Ben, who did you choose to go home?

41
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:11,953
I chose Chi Chi.

42
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:14,910
One of the things that Chi Chi and I talked about was

43
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,588
- That fire.
- It felt like it dimmed.

44
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,203
I'm not mad at y'know, Ben, for picking me

45
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:24,688
Obviously somebody up there is keeping me

46
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:26,196
here for a reason.

47
00:02:26,197 --> 00:02:28,770
Chi Chi can give way more than she is giving

48
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,070
Because guess what now all eyes are on Chi Chi

49
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:32,522
Sorry.

50
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,188
Time to change.

51
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,480
- I was a little gagged but um, I was a little gagged.
- I was totally gagged.

52
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:39,662
It's subjective, at some point it comes down

53
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:44,091
to like what does one person think about a performance.

54
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:46,001
Or even a person.

55
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:49,009
That monologue was about what she thought of Milk as a person.

56
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,024
This elimination was so jarring

57
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:54,356
and it's kinda coming down to personal relationships

58
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,757
But can we get eliminated because we don't talk to someone?

59
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,517
Is that the reality here, like?

60
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:02,244
It's scary because there's no comfort level

61
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:05,202
Everybody could go home at any time for whatever reason

62
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:08,374
Well I don't know what's gonna happen next week, but it's gonna be a great Christmas.

Every season "Snatch Game"

80
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:14,213
separates the 'cans' from the 'cannots'

Lemme guess

85
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:31,935
I'm going to be doing Patricia Arquette
in the television show 'Medium'.

86
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,665
- No, I'm doing RuPaul.
- Mother Ru.

87
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,697
In my season I was so sad

88
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:40,053
Because I didn't get to do "Snatch Game"
and I wanted to do

89
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:42,080
RuPaul in front of RuPaul so bad

90
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,693
and every time I do RuPaul in front of people they think it's hilarious

91
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:46,524
She likes dad jokes, like I do

92
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,925
She likes puns, bad jokes, be great

93
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:52,084
- I'm winning the challenge.
- You sound real confident, sis.
- I am.

94
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,338
You do not play with that.

95
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:57,338
Nobody has been successful doing RuPaul.

96
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,991
I mean just because you do her, on your little show, playing around

97
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:04,152
It's harder doing it for the competition.

98
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,500
- So who you gonna do?
- Miss Maya Angelou.

99
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,234
- What you doing?
- I'm doing Paul Lynde.

100
00:05:12,235 --> 00:05:13,927
- OK?
- Do you know him?
- No

101
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,686
Paul Lynde was this comedian in the 70s

102
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:19,687
He was the centre square on "Hollywood Squares"

103
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:21,559
for a full decade.

104
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:25,223
At this point
Ben has won so many challenges,

105
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:29,053
so now it's like, I'm this horse
but then I see this other horse

106
00:05:29,054 --> 00:05:31,313
like now miles ahead of the rest of us.

107
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:34,057
and it's like, I'm never gonna catch up.

108
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:37,436
So it's just like, I have to get a win,
I have to get a win so bad.

109
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,987
It's my first "Snatch Game",
so I have nothing to live up to, so I feel like

110
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:41,423
What's this?

111
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,026
- The thing of like living up to predecessors
- From Thorgy.

112
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:46,971
- Oh Thorgy wrote this?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:50,379
It says: "Fuck this shady bitch, Shangela"

114
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,960
It has my name crossed out.

115
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,722
I didn't show it to you, because I thought it was not helpful

116
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:58,580
- or appropriate to.
- But you decide to hang it on the wall?

117
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:00,972
Oh boy, here we go.

118
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:03,376
My note from Thorgy,
I put it behind Milk's note.

119
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,577
Yeah but this one
specifically talks about me

120
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,080
And then says:
"Fuck this shady bitch"

121
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:09,772
and then points at my name,
and then you hung it on the wall.

122
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,915
Ooh face crack.

123
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,439
I know Trixie's stomach has fallen out of her ass.

124
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,648
Well I don't care what you think.
She gave it to me because she was sad.

125
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,677
and I'm honouring her.
I like those people.

126
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:26,197
Trixie you can't tell me,
that you read

127
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,253
Thorgy calling Shangela a bitch

128
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,445
and you just saw the goodness in the letter and wanted to put it up

129
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:32,846
cut the shit.

130
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,669
I would not do something-
No! Girl leave it now.

131
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,043
Now I know you feel that, that's the way you really feel about someone like me

132
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,910
I wouldn't put that up against someone because I would not want you to feel bad

133
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:43,771
- like that
- I never ever showed it to you because I didn't want

134
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,801
- But you hung it on the wall, sis
- Oh my God, get out of my station
- But it is what it is

135
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:49,438
Ooh the drama in the pageant

136
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,532
Bitch I better light an incense around here, clear the air.

137
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:03,785
How did Thorgy's feelings about Shangela

138
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:07,258
- make Shangela mad at me now?
- I think she was just upset

139
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,827
because you hung it up and didn't tell her.

140
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:13,311
Thorgy left a really shitty message to me on the mirror

141
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:15,664
I took the high road on that.
Then I found out

142
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:18,246
she double dogged me
in a written note.

143
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,608
Then Trixie hangs the note up on the wall

144
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,830
how much has Shangey got to take?

145
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:26,293
Trixie is a mess and she, she shouldn't even have that up there

146
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:29,657
- She put it up there to be a mess.
- What do you mean by a mess?

147
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,985
- Why would you put it up there?
- I wouldn't, but...

148
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:35,633
That's my point. So her putting it up there, that's being a mess.

149
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,609
I just think maybe she wasn't thinking about it.

150
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,714
- Girl, c'mon Ben.
- Maybe she was just thinking about her friendship

151
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:42,468
Some things you just do not do.

152
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:45,429
If we're all supposed to be this sisterhood and stuff

153
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,360
that type of shit don't supposed to fly.

154
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:52,200
- Hey ladies!
- Hi Ru!

155
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:55,248
- Look who's here!
- Hi girls!

156
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,600
- Marc Jacobs.
- Oh my God yes!

157
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,017
- Are you ready, Marc?
- I'm ready.

158
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,730
Let's go.

159
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,536
- Hi, mother.
- BeBe.

160
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:07,455
- Now this is an interesting getup here.
- Very pointy shoulders.

161
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:10,382
- Any guesses, Marc?
- Oh, I dunno

162
00:08:10,383 --> 00:08:12,035
Grace Jones?

163
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,682
- Oh it is Grace Jones?
-It is Grace Jones.

164
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:18,917
- I guessed?
- Yes!
-Wow!

165
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,272
This is exciting because then I just get to embody somebody else

166
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:25,089
that is not necessarily me, you know as much as I love

167
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,081
the way she would talk and the words that come out of her mouth

168
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:29,885
I'm like 'oh my God did she just say that?' y'know?

169
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:32,008
But you also have to be funny, which is...

170
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,709
- Gotta make Ru laugh.
- I know

171
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,035
and that's what I'm trying to work on.

172
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:38,388
I personally think Grace Jones

173
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:41,260
is a look and an attitude

174
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,661
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

175
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,716
But to make Grace Jones truly funny

176
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:47,120
I wonder if BeBe can do that.

177
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:50,328
- Hi, Shangela.
- Hey, Ru!

178
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,966
- Hi, Shangela.
- Hi!

179
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,637
I see Tarot cards, there's a telephone and a kaftan back there.

180
00:08:56,638 --> 00:08:59,039
- Marc, do you know who this is?
- Who is it?

181
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,454
- This is Miss Cleo. Yes.
- The late, great, Miss Cleo.

182
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,405
That's right, she died a couple of years ago.

183
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,106
- Did she?
- Oh uh, from heart disease.

184
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:08,982
She didn't see that coming?

185
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,437
- That was my joke, Marc.
- I'm sorry.
- That was my joke!

186
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:14,652
Now, were there other people that you considered?

187
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:17,146
For sure. I considered diva Jenifer Lewis

188
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:20,492
- Who I love so very much
- And you know her intimately.

189
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,467
Yes.
This is actually one of Jen's coats

190
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:25,510
She let me go diving in her closet before coming here

191
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:28,369
- and it's Marc Jacobs.
- And you didn't know

192
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,054
- Marc would be here today.
- No, I saw it in the cards though.

193
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,380
- Oh the power of the tarot.
- See the cards never lie.

194
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:35,366
Call me now darling.

195
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:40,221
Well actually your accent sounded a little like Ireland for a minute there.

196
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,821
Wait a minute. Miss Cleo is Jamaican

197
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:46,036
If you thinking she for a four leaf clover fish

198
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:49,047
I'm maybe going home with Cleo.

199
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:53,180
Oh darling no.
That didn't say that in the cards.

200
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:56,258
- But maybe she was Irish...
- Are you hearing an Irish accent?

201
00:09:56,938 --> 00:10:00,195
I've got a lot riding on this, I can't fuck this up.

202
00:10:00,196 --> 00:10:01,996
- Call me.
- Call me now.

203
00:10:01,997 --> 00:10:04,801
I'm going with the backup, Jenifer Lewis.

204
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:08,269
- Hi, Kennedy.
- Hi.
- Hi Kennedy.

205
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,747
So I see a church lady outfit here.

206
00:10:11,748 --> 00:10:14,538
- She have two boys
- Oh, OK, I know.

207
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:16,788
You're a "Housewife of Atlanta."

208
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:19,323
- Yes.
- You're Phaedra Parks.

209
00:10:19,324 --> 00:10:21,173
I love that.

210
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:23,495
She believe in her lord and saviour Jesus Christ

211
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:25,931
gonna pray for you, but behind closed doors

212
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:28,349
she wanna pull out her nasty stuff.

213
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,306
Now, you won as Little Richard

214
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:33,327
Now if you win this one, you're the first queen in history

215
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:36,813
- to win two "Snatch Games".
- Two snatches.

216
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:39,145
Two snatches, I love that.

217
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:43,509
"Snatch Game" is more important than ever

218
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,630
to determine who is a contender

219
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,433
and who is just, roadkill.

220
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,535
Bring on the pressure.

221
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:53,089
The struggle is real on my end.

222
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:57,971
Can I talk to you?

223
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:00,378
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, let's talk.

224
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:03,080
I can't go forward with the "Snatch Game" thinking that Shangela

225
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,557
is like mad at me.

226
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:06,417
I didn't even occur to me it hurt your feelings

227
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:08,969
- It does hurt my feelings.
- I didn't write it.

228
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,612
Alright, sis.

229
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:15,254
I'm used to girls sometimes

230
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,779
me thinking one way about them and then it totally flipped the script.

231
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,150
The lowest moment in my season was when Ru asked

232
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:21,651
who should go home?

233
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:23,286
Who do you think should go home tonight?

234
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,142
I would like to see Shangela go.

235
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,894
She's just a loud mouth, and she's always talking and Hallelu-ing

236
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,653
You should be on season 5 or 6, that's where you should be.

237
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:33,966
These were people I thought were my friends.

238
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,404
Girl, I was cracked.

239
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:37,569
I have absolute respect for you and I'm really sorry.

240
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,111
I should've just torn that section off and kept it positive.

241
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:43,722
I appreciate your apology, I do

242
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:46,057
Lucky you meeting "all-stars 3" me

243
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:48,490
"Season 3" me would've snatched that note off the wall

244
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:50,644
and come for you, but I'm not gonna do that.

245
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,832
Trixie's apology seemed sincere.

246
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,915
But I'm looking at her with this one good eye, like this.

247
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,107
Oh, can I trust you, bitch?

248
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:01,559
'Cos you giving me very flip flop fish right now.

249
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,106
Let's see which way the cookie crumbles.

250
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,488
- Alright, let's do this goddamn challenge.
-Good luck, RuPaul.

251
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:27,824

Give it up for our special guest host:

264
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:10,815
Now, RuPaul, do I call you he, or she?

265
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,950
You can call me he, she, Regis and Cathy Lee

266
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:15,578

00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:26,727
Oh hey, hey, hey, Ru

271
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:29,608

Thank you and God bless.

00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:43,019
Alright.
Straight from the centre square

276
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,567
It's Paul Lynde.

277
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:46,920
Oh hi there Ru, I'm glad it's you

278
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:50,039
for a second I thought somebody had gift wrapped Flip Wilson.

279
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,309
Alright, she's one of Oprah's favourite things.

280

00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:03,108
You know you spelt your name wrong on there

283
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,739
- Oh oh did I?
- Yes.

284
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,816
How you spell Maya?

285
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:09,169
Oh damn, Chi Chi.

286
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,819
How you gonna be one of the world's most beloved poets

287
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,684
and you can't spell your own name?

288
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:15,867
Maya,
I've always wanted to know

289
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,831
Why does a caged bird sing?

290
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:20,893
The caged bird sings, darling

291
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,323
because...

292
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:31,034
I don't know why the caged bird sings, darling.

293
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,816
Alright.

Yes, that's right, RuPaul.

The founder, the mother, the creator.

00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,224
When are we going to fuck?

307
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:19,879
You don't like women?

308
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:24,508
No man can turn down this pussy.

309
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,248
Your Miss Jones was not graceful.

310
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:32,074
Alright.

311
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:35,221

Please welcome the gorgeous,
Kristin Chenoweth.

315
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:47,774
- Hello, Kristin.
- Hello, my darling.

316
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:50,902
I always thought that one of these queens would do me

317
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,005
and no-one ever did, so I decided to come here

318
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:55,281
- and do myself.
- That's right.

319
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:57,265
Yes!

320
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:00,331
Sweetheart, none of these queens are gonna do ya

321
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,611
I'm so happy that you are here.

322
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:06,647
I'm so happy to be here, my darling.

323
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:08,671
Are y'all ready to play the "Snatch Game"?

324
00:16:08,672 --> 00:16:10,288
- Yes!
- Alright.

325
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,451
First question for
Carson.

326
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:15,298
Kristin Chenoweth
is so tiny

327
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,078
that when she walks into a restaurant

328
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,706
the hostess hands her
a "blank"

329
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:24,727
Celebrities, go ahead and write your answer down.

330
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,565
Alright, what say you, Carson?

331
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:30,233
I'm not a doctor, but I'm gonna say growth hormones.

332
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:34,322
Alright, let's go and see if you have any matches

333
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,903
Alright, Phaedra.

334
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:38,220
Oh hey Phaedra, what is that?

335
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:40,129
She's fracking? Is that what she's doing?

336
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,828
Girl, you know I had to take that church stuff off, honey.

337
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,417
Oh yes!#

338
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,883
I said, "a napkin to wipe up"

339
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:50,917
'cos clearly he's an appetizer

340
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:55,066
Oh, OK.

341
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,823
Alright, Paul Lynde.

342
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:59,183
This is the most queens I've been surrounded

343
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,413
by since Charles Nelson Reilly's pool party.

344
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,326
I said, "A cocktail weenie"

345
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,386
'Cos it's to scale.

346
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,057
Sorry, it's not a match, Carson.

347
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:14,247
- Not a match.
- Circle gets a square.

348
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:19,242
Alright, Maya Angelou,
poet, activist, actress

349
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:21,177
Spelling bee winner.

350
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:24,454
Maya Angelou,
what say you?

351
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:28,601
Well I said that the hostess hands the poor thing

352
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,949
that same caged bird

353
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,366
fried, died, and laid to the side.

354
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:38,555
Oh. Maya, thank you for answering my question

355
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:41,927
from last round, in this round, maybe you'll have a good answer

356
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:46,513
answer for this question in the next round.

357
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:48,996
Let's move on down
to Jenifer Lewis.

358
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:52,209
Well look at lost, cute little Kristen, I love her.
Two Broadway divas

359
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,027
- You know I worked with Kristin way back in the day, that's right.
- Did you?

360
00:17:55,028 --> 00:17:57,585
Yeah, no, I'm lying, I ain't worked with that bitch, but anyhow listen

361
00:17:57,586 --> 00:18:00,047
I think that Kristin has to fit up

362
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:03,129
in that little bubble in "Wicked".
You saw the show, I saw it

363
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,763
therefore I think that man handed her a "High five"

364
00:18:05,764 --> 00:18:08,385
- when she walked in.
- That would be apropos.

365
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:11,109
What's a "aproho"?
Who callin' a ho?

366
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,360
I'm about to have a hot flash up in here

367
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,781
Yeah, you know I'm going through menopause

368
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,881
- Are you?
- Yeah, I don't know why they call it menopause

369
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,712
though ain't no man up in here.

370
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:25,118
Kristin Chenoweth,
what did the hostess hand you?

371
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:29,007
- A booster chair.
- A booster chair!

372
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,843
- Which I actually brought.
- You brought one?

373
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,886
I travel with my own booster.

374
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:36,548
Oh wow, that's so smart.

375
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,783
This question is for
Michelle Visage

376
00:18:39,784 --> 00:18:42,744
I'm coming out with a RuPaul cookbook

377
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:45,792
It includes my famous recipe

378
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:49,174
for spaghetti and "blank" balls

379
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:52,385
I'm gonna go with
Spaghetti and tucked balls.

380
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,977
- Those sound delicious.
- Delicious.

381
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,930
You have to kinda dig to find them.

382
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:59,735
Alright, let's go to the stars and hear what they have to say

383
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,298
- Grace Jones.
- Yes.

384
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:06,104
My famous recipe for
spaghetti and "blank" balls

385
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:09,658
- What do you think it is?
- "Steel Vagina"

386
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:11,845
- Steel Vagina?
- Yes.

387
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:15,212
- That's the name of my upcoming perfume.
- I see.

388
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,226
This is why I don't keep the company of the ladies.

389
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:19,980
Yes, Paul Lynde, yes.

390
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:22,471
- What are those, Grace Jones?
- That's the song

391
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:24,551
Carson, I've been meaning to get these back to you.

392
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:26,159
My apologies

393
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,696
I think she's also wearing your gloves

394
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:30,141
but I didn't recognise them
without the Crisco

395
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,517
What say you, RuPaul?

396
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,598
Well, Michelle, my balls are tucked so tight

397
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,325
that I blacked out, fell down,
woke up a second ago

398
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:41,296
panicked and just wrote
"Now available on iTunes"

399
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:43,519
I'm glad you reminded everybody of that

400
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,112
but unfortunately
that is not a match, RuPaul

401
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,636
RuPaul? I wanted to congratulate you

402
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:51,330
on your Hollywood star of fame

403
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:55,011
Oh thank you so much, my dear
as we say in the industry:

404
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:58,384
"Winner winner, chicken...dinner"

405
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,200
Crickets.

406
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,183
Trixie's just like throwing these little RuPaul one-liners

407
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:09,764
but they're out of place.
It's just not fitting.

408
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:11,974
Y'all told her on the internet it was funny

409
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:13,471
I blame y'all.

410
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:16,119
Let's move on down to
Paul Lynde

411
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,423
My famous recipe for
spaghetti and "blank" balls.

412
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:23,312
Well Ru, I just said the ones that I found the most delicious

413
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:25,196
Anonymous.

414
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:30,224
Your answer was an anon miss.

415
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,686
An-anonymous?
Yes, yes it was.

416
00:20:32,687 --> 00:20:34,503
Wow darling, tell another one.

417
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,514
This one's for
Michelle Visage.

418
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:40,145
Ricky Martin is so hot

419
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:43,865
"blank" melts in his mouth
and in his hand

420
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,646
Well, he is of the Puerto Rican descent

421
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:49,039
I'm going to say
flan

422
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,588
- "Flan" OK.
- Yeah.

423
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,426
Crystal LaBeija.
Are you having a good time, Crystal?

424
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,733
Darling,
I'm having the worst time of my life.

425
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,092
I just want to walk away so bad

426
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,766
darling, let me tell you something about my friend, Monique

427
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:04,119
she's not here because she's melting in his mouth and his hands

428
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,949
but she called me this morning
and she said

429
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,337
"Crystal, let me tell you about the 'Snatch Game'

430
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:11,820
none of the true beauties are gonna be there" and darling she was right.

431
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:13,841
OK

432
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,697
Phaedra,
what do you have?

433
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:18,323
Ricky Martin, melts, so damn hot

434
00:21:18,324 --> 00:21:20,263
do you think he's hot,
Phaedra?

435
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:26,142
That's a...yes?

436
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:29,715
I said, "My candy"

437
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:33,064
Kennedy won "Snatch Game" her season

438
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:34,700
but she ain't winning this one.

439
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:37,461
You've won an uncomfortable phone call to your ex

440
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,280
and a half eaten hot dog from the back of my car.

441
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,162
Oh shut up, RuPaul.

442
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:45,551
- Carson, this one's for you.
- Yes.

443
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:48,710
The U.S. Congress is so dysfunctional

444
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,419
they can't pass "blank"

445
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,510
They can't pass, the eight grade.

446
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,361
Alright, Maya Angelou.

447
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:59,353
U.S. Congress is so dysfunctional

448
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:01,013
they can't pass "blank"

449
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:03,901
They can't pass gasses.

450
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:08,651
'Cos we all know, that they are some uptight asses.

451
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:11,513
Oh some poetry in that answer, yes

452
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:15,169
We're gonna move on down to
Kristin Chenoweth

453
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,079
They can't pass "Gun Control"

454
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,959
- Uh huh
- There's only one gun for all of us

455
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,322
- and it's a bubble gun
- A bubble gun!

456
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:25,851
Look at those bubbles! Nobody can control those bubbles!

457
00:22:25,852 --> 00:22:28,733
Aw shucks, time's up

458
00:22:29,262 --> 00:22:33,226
The winner of today's "Snatch Game" is

459
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:37,783
the Amish,
because they don't have televisions.

460
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:42,555
Until next time, I'm everybody

461
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:44,297
Goodbye, RuPaul!

462
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,573
Guess who owns everything!

463
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:06,006
Not you.

464
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:08,961
It's elimination day

465
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:11,019
We're recovering from "Snatch Game"
and we had a pretty

466
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:15,032
shocking elimination last week, so I think we're all back into like, pins and needles mode.

467
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,541
Bitch, Trixie

468
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:19,129
It wasn't the best RuPaul,
I'll tell you that

469
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,162
And she know, that she wasn't the best.

470
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:23,667
How do you feel, Chi Chi?

471
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:27,257
I mean, I played the dumbest Maya Angelou in the world.

472
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:29,563
These challenges are fucking hard.

473
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:31,651
Also "Snatch Game"
is fucking hard.

474
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:33,052
It is.

475
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:36,653
I really wanted to like, do really well in this challenge, so I'm kinda disappointed.

476
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:39,237
I expected myself to do better and I think the other queens

477
00:23:39,238 --> 00:23:41,714
here expected me to come in like, guns a-blazing

478
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:44,112
but holy fuck did it not go good.

479
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,502
How do you feel?

480
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,866
As soon as Ru laughed at my first

481
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:52,467
- joke I was like "Alright, I feel good."
- Oh no, Ru was in it

482
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:55,197
- to win it with you, girl.
- I feel really pleased and

483
00:23:55,198 --> 00:23:58,155
y'know, I mean,
I kind of felt the other day like

484
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:01,348
I wound up with Trixie's win

485
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:06,604
and that felt weird to me,
being in the top two

486
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:10,010
because I felt like that should have gone to Trixie, and so I was feeling weird about it

487
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:12,153
Look, game recognise game

488
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:15,970
she's playing it low because she keeps winning

489
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,542
and when you keep winning

490
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,487
people are gonna start targeting you

491
00:24:19,488 --> 00:24:24,195
so if you are like,
"I didn't think I deserved to win"

492
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:28,057
"Oh, I wanna give back the award"
but does she give it back?

493
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,067
Oh the girls, honey, the girls,
they're playing games

494
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:34,711
over here at the "RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars"

495
00:24:56,255 --> 00:25:00,387
Welcome to the main stage of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars.

496
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:03,794
Snatch maker to the stars,
Michelle Visage.

497
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:06,771
Snatch maker, snatch maker, make me a snatch!

498
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:09,429
Style superstar,
Carson Kressley.

499
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,158
Now this was your first taste of
"Snatch Game"

500
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,013
It was and I'm really starting to like it!

501
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:19,859
She broke the girl code

502
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,950
Drag Race superfan,
Nicole Byer.

503
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:24,513
Thank you.

504
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:27,885
My God I could literally get hit by a bus tonight and I'm good.

505
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:32,772
Oklahoma's number one Kristin Chenoweth impersonator

506
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:34,310
Kristin Chenoweth.

507
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:37,492
- I've been snatched.
- Thanks, Dr. Zizmor.

508
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,541
This week on the main stage
category is:

509
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,199
Flower Power

510
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,437
Gentlemen,
start your engines

511
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:49,200
and may the best all-star win!

512
00:25:51,892 --> 00:25:55,771
- Aja.
- L'il Abner and Daisy hey

513
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,546
Shangela.

514
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:01,147
I love that Beyoncé put the twins back in

515
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:02,549
- for this.
- She did.

516
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,557
BeBe Zahara Benet.

517
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:07,304
Cameroon in bloom.

518
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,720
Kennedy Davenport.

519
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:12,622
This look is really growing on me

520
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:15,621
Chi Chi DeVayne.

521
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:18,128
Hi lily hi lily hi ho

522
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:21,161
Trixie Mattel.

523
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,025
- It's raining flowers.
- Yeah.

524
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,842
BenDeLaCreme.

525
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:28,908
I can't tell if that's her pistil or her stamen

526
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:48,592
Welcome ladies

527
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:51,265
I've made some decisions

528
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:54,596
when I call your name please step forward

529
00:26:54,597 --> 00:26:56,179
Shangela.

530
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,055
BenDeLaCreme.

531
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:04,294
Condragulations, you are the top two all-stars of the week.

532
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:10,344
You've each won a wig wardrobe

533
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:12,130
from Rockstar Wigs

534
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,854
and a $1000 gift card

535
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:19,621
from Coolhaus Super Premium Ice Cream

536
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:25,252
Please step to the back
of the stage

537
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:29,313
Now it's time for the judges critiques

538
00:27:29,763 --> 00:27:31,659
First up, Aja.

539
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,755
Your look,
Edie Sedgwick comes to life

540
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:37,245
If I don't get that outfit by the end of this

541
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:41,392
then you an I will meet in a back alley somewhere, alright?

542
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:45,552
You embodied Crystal LaBeija

543
00:27:45,553 --> 00:27:49,371
But I wish it was more than just kinda the one note that it was

544
00:27:49,372 --> 00:27:51,143
I didn't think it was super one note

545
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:55,797
I love that fucking stank face you were serving the whole time

546
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,225
you did a great job.

547
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:59,816
Up next,
BeBe Zahara Benet.

548
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:03,261
I can't get over
how stunning you look tonight

549
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:06,248
You look like a fudgsicle dipped in flowers

550
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:07,961
and I'm here for it.

551
00:28:07,962 --> 00:28:10,597
Your Grace Jones
was just the right amount

552
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,870
of glamour and weirdness

553
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:15,245
But I felt it kinda lost its way

554
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:17,596
I know that you didn't do a snatch game in your season

555
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:19,416
- It's intimidating, isn't it?
- It is.

556
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:22,506
It's about staying in the character and being able to deliver in the character

557
00:28:22,507 --> 00:28:23,978
all the time.

558
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:27,914
- Kennedy Davenport.
- Oh my God, Phaedra Parks.

559
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:31,336
She's gonna send you a cease and desist letter for looking better than she does

560
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,676
But you were kinda in and out of it

561
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:36,150
We were losing her.

562
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,793
You know my eyes kept going to other girls

563
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:41,088
and they weren't going to Phaedra.

564
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:44,335
And this runway look,
the green leaves on the bottom

565
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,163
the touches in the wig

566
00:28:46,164 --> 00:28:48,704
Maybe that's a little arts and craftsy for me

567
00:28:48,705 --> 00:28:50,817
maybe up the sophistication level

568
00:28:51,306 --> 00:28:54,733
- Up Next, Chi Chi DeVayne.
- What's up y'all

569
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:57,206
- I've never seen you look better.
- Thank you.

570
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:59,950
You look like a nice slutty teen

571
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,486
- who's getting married
- Teen?

572
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,955
So let's talk about
Maya Angelou.

573
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:08,374
you spelt your name wrong
for starters

574
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:11,223
and then Ru asked you if you knew why the caged bird sings

575
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:13,894
and it was like tumbleweed.

576
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:17,014
I would've done a little bit of a later years, Maya

577
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:19,689
I would've been fuller figured, y'know looked a little

578
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,375
older, because the visual cues weren't there, and that is crucial.

579
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:26,346
- Up next Trixie Mattel.
- Hi, guys!

580
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,597
Tonight on the runway, very "kawaii"

581
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:31,482
- but there's a lot going on.
- For me, more is more.

582
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:32,912
I mean this is great

583
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,578
like I need claritin to just look at this

584
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:37,922
Now let's talk about your
"Snatch Game"

585
00:29:37,923 --> 00:29:40,486
First thing you did they way you landed with the "American" CD

586
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,717
that was funny, and then I didn't laugh, like the whole time.

587
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:48,193
It was one note,
literally through the whole thing.

588
00:29:48,782 --> 00:29:51,185
I know you,
there's something that's telling

589
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:52,835
me you're not all here.

590
00:29:52,836 --> 00:29:56,314
When I get nervous here, it's like, I'm at camp Crystal Lake

591
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:58,508
and Jason's outside with the machete.

592
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:00,311
It's like that level panic sometimes.

593
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:03,640
- Why?
- I don't know, it's, it's um...

594
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:07,200
it was like,
it was harder than it looks

595
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:10,672
Sorry.
I thought it was gonna be like, my challenge.

596
00:30:10,673 --> 00:30:13,092
I was like, so excited,
and I got in

597
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:16,033
there and it was just like, it's like, frozen

598
00:30:16,034 --> 00:30:18,756
It was, it fucking sucked.

599
00:30:18,757 --> 00:30:20,647
Don't forget what you have

600
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:23,131
and what you offer,
and who you are

601
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:25,553
whether this continues or not, OK?

602
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:27,207
Fight for yourself.

603
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:30,466
I just want more
of Trixie Mattel.

604
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:33,992
Invite her back here,
because we want her.

605
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:36,951
Thank you, ladies.

606
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:39,388
Based on the judge critiques

607
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:41,566
I've made some decisions

608
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,261
Chi Chi DeVayne.

609
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:49,593
Kennedy Davenport.

610
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:53,064
Trixie Mattel.

611
00:30:55,296 --> 00:30:57,987
You are in the bottom three.

612
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:02,827
That means, Aja, BeBe,

613
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:05,080
you're safe.

614
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:06,712
Thank you, mother.

615
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:10,580
Shangela and DeLa,
each of you

616
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:15,303
needs to decide which of the bottom three you'll eliminate

617
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:17,787
if you win the lip sync.

618
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:21,624
Thank you, ladies,
you may leave the stage.

619
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:25,278
Alright, sis.

620
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,812
- Careful of that bump.
- There she goes, there she goes.

621
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:31,248
I'm disappointed,
I thought I was going to win this challenge

622
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:33,928
and instead I absolutely face-planted.

623
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:35,938
in front of the person I'm impersonating.

624
00:31:35,939 --> 00:31:39,150
so it's worst case scenario.

625
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:41,463
Each of the girls, I would love to have a chat with them.

626
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:43,820
Who wants to go with me?
Come on, Kens.

627
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:46,972
- Who wants to go with me?
- I'll go.

628
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:49,700
Sis, what's on your mind right now?

629
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:52,922
- It was not fun.
- I know baby.

630
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:54,548
It fucking sucked.

631
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:57,456
Like I feel like I told the judges and everyone here

632
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:01,352
like a secret, like I'm so, I'm so scared

633
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,411
and um, I didn't want everybody to know

634
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:08,435
because I don't think anybody here saw me being afraid of "Drag Race"

635
00:32:08,436 --> 00:32:10,418
because I'm not afraid of drag in the real world.

636
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:12,809
I love "Drag Race,"
I love being Trixie.

637
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:17,539
and then to come here and like, to not be the Trixie my fans look for

638
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,917
it's like, fuck, you know what I mean?

639
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:23,519
Girl, there's nothing to say

640
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,145
I mean, just be fair

641
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:29,242
I've been here four times, so just be fair.

642
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:30,852
I'm being real about it

643
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:35,070
you know I don't want it come off as all the girls just keep saving me

644
00:32:35,071 --> 00:32:38,201
because I'm their good friend,
this is a competition

645
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:40,809
it's not RuPaul's best friends race.

646
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,582
I'm so proud of what I did

647
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,521
You know what I mean? And what I've got to show

648
00:32:44,522 --> 00:32:46,032
and if I go home, I'm gonna be happy

649
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:48,209
if I stay, I'm gonna be happy, so

650
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,742
I'm really proud of

651
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:53,390
you for continuing to plug away at this

652
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:56,096
Does Chi Chi deserve another chance?

653
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:59,571
but she does have such a charm

654
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:02,258
so I wouldn't put it past anybody to save her again.

655
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:04,167
I'll send the next girl on over.

656
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,058
- First of all I know tonight's an emotional night for you
- Yeah

657
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:14,408
Like I told y'all,
this is the "Game of Thrones" of drag

658
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,224
The seven kingdoms baby.
You've gotta have alliances.

659
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:20,008
So I'm trying to figure out

660
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:23,572
is Trixie John Snow? Or is she Cersei Lannister?

661
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:26,961
Because I ain't trying to be up in a red weddings situation.

662
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:29,953
I know how talented you are

663
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:32,271
but you also know this is a competition

664
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:34,884
and all of us want to win

665
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:37,789
and I have to put my allegiance

666
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,812
where I feel I have allies

667
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:43,211
I feel like it's behind us
and I don't think it would come

668
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:46,802
up in a lipstick situation,
but I hope that what happened yesterday

669
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:49,294
isn't like the reason

670
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:51,673
- You would pick my lipstick.
- No, but even the whole note thing

671
00:33:51,674 --> 00:33:55,250
all that kind of stuff just sits with me in the fact
when I'm thinking like

672
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:59,253
"If I'm in the bottom,
is she ever gonna save me or not?"

673
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:01,273
of everybody in the bottom three

674
00:34:01,274 --> 00:34:03,233
you're the one I worry about.

675
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:06,018
This game is a game based on trust

676
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:07,864
Kennedy is my sister

677
00:34:07,865 --> 00:34:10,706
and yes, Chi Chi's been in the bottom four times

678
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,939
but at least I know I can trust Chi Chi.

679
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,032
Can I trust Trixie Mattel?

680
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,960
Are you my ally, girl?

681
00:34:19,146 --> 00:34:21,258
- Hi
- What we gotta do girl

682
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,341
there has to be somebody at the top
there gotta be somebody at the bottom

683
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:26,092
- there's gotta be some people in the middle.
- Yeah.

684
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:28,327
and I just feel like I fell in the middle

685
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,393
I don't feel like I did a bad job.

686
00:34:30,394 --> 00:34:33,264
I'm the one that was the strongest out of the three

687
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:36,055
and I'm just being honest,
I do feel that way

688
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:38,906
but at the end of the day, it's your decision.

689
00:34:38,907 --> 00:34:40,934
This decision feels impossible

690
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:43,441
Chi Chi's wound up in the bottom a few times now

691
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:46,811
but she has this can do attitude

692
00:34:46,812 --> 00:34:49,796
which speaks very well for her continuing

693
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,969
Kennedy has been a consistently hard worker

694
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,813
and she has brought her all to everything

695
00:34:54,814 --> 00:34:59,671
but Trixie's just been landing in the middle of this competition over and over

696
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:01,753
I know that she has more to bring

697
00:35:02,212 --> 00:35:06,596
I wanna see it so badly,
but I don't know if we're gonna get it.

698
00:35:11,964 --> 00:35:16,094
It's never easy to have to choose a girl to go home.

699
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:20,939
It is not comfortable to feel like I am
in charge

700
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,782
of so many people's fates week after week

701
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:26,779
I know this is gonna crush someone's dreams

702
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,241
but at the end of the day this is the competition

703
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:33,673
and I've gotta make some very hard choices.

704
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:44,896
Welcome back, ladies

705
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:48,707
Two top all-stars stand before me

706
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:52,594
Ladies, this is your chance to win $10,000

707
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:54,768
and earn the power

708
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:58,313
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

709
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:01,961
The time has come

710
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:03,733
to lip sync

711
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:06,413
for your legacy!

712
00:36:07,187 --> 00:36:08,758
If I don't beat Shangela

713
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:12,438
then I'll be one out of four
that I won

714
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,887
I have to win this.

715
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:18,287
Good luck and don't fuck it up.

716
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:10,572
Ladies, I've made my decision.

717
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,106
Shangela.

718
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:20,551
You're a winner baby.

719
00:38:20,552 --> 00:38:22,408
Yay!
Thank you!

720
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,840
BenDeLaCreme.

721
00:38:31,398 --> 00:38:33,924
You are also a winner baby.

722
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:42,227
You've both won a cash prize of $5000

723
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:45,934
- Alright.
- And you've each won the power

724
00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:50,114
to send one of the bottom queens home.

725
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:54,796
Oh my God!

726
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,251
What!?

727
00:38:56,252 --> 00:39:00,685
There's three of us up for elimination
and there's two lipsticks.

728
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:02,187
It's bad.

729
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:04,312
BenDeLaCreme,

730
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:08,444
which queen have you chosen to get
the chop?

731
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:11,856
Well, the queens on stage

732
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,599
have very different track records

733
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,349
But Chi Chi is someone

734
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,862
who has landed in the bottom several times

735
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:21,241
but also somebody who is going to leave this

736
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:24,077
place ready to set the world on fire.

737
00:39:24,522 --> 00:39:26,047
I chose Chi Chi.

738
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:29,290
Shangela, it's your turn.

739
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,878
It's a difficult decision

740
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:34,916
the person I've chosen, I don't want them to feel like

741
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,875
it's anything personal in any way

742
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:40,291
this person left "RuPaul's Drag Race"
not winning the crown

743
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:42,424
but definitely going forward as a winner

744
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:44,452
and creating a career for themselves

745
00:39:44,453 --> 00:39:47,244
and I know they will do that long after this

746
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:48,881
because I believe in their talent.

747
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,743
But...

748
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:55,910
I also chose Chi Chi.

749
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:05,817
Chi Chi, you are and will always be, an all-star.

750
00:40:05,818 --> 00:40:09,456
Now, sashay away.

751
00:40:10,261 --> 00:40:12,700
- Thank you. It's right.
- You're a superstar. You're a superstar.

752
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,792
Thank you guys so much.

753
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:19,367
- Love you Chi Chi!
- Bye!

754
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:27,406
I'm sad to go, but I think I did the best that I could

755
00:40:27,407 --> 00:40:30,036
All Stars 3 was so hard!

756
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:32,184
Thank you!

757
00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:38,101
Blessed be, kitty girl

758
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,885
whatever you do,
don't look behind you.

759
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,762
[Sigh] Why don't they ever listen?

760
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:52,571
