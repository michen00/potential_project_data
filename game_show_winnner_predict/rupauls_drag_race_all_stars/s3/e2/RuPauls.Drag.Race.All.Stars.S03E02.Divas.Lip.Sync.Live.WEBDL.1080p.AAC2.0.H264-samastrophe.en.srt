00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:01,903
- [RuPaul] Previously
on All Stars...

3
00:00:01,903 --> 00:00:04,405
Each week the winner
will eliminate

4
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:07,809
one of her fellow queens.

5
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:11,813
- How do you feel about
the whole elimination set up?

6
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,014
- I'm just gonna send
the bitch home

7
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,416
that I think is the strongest.

8
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:19,287
- [RuPaul] Welcome to "RuPaul's
All Star Variety Show".

9
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:22,023
Aja.
- You really brought it.

10
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,692
That jump, it was just insane.

11
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:25,693
- [RuPaul]
BenDeLaCreme.

12
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,361
- You look stunning,
head to toe,

13
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,430
and then you give us comedy.

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,365
- [RuPaul]
Morgan McMichaels.

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,201
- Any self doubt,
knock it off.

16
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,770
Because anything less than
a hundred is not good enough.

17
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,305
- [RuPaul]
Chi Chi DeVayne.

18
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:39,540
- All I kept doing was
looking at the shoe.

19
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,908
It was almost like down here,

20
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,611
when the rest of the girls
were taking it up there.

21
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:46,380
- BenDeLaCreme,
you're a winner, baby.

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,784
- Thank you.

23
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:53,488
- Which queen have you
chosen to get the chop?

24
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,191
- When we, as a group,
talked about why we might

25
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:58,826
eliminate somebody
moving forward,

26
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:02,730
we talked about that we would
not want to make that decision,

27
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,933
pretty much unanimously,
based on knocking somebody

28
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,702
that we saw as fierce
competition out of the way.

29
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,737
And that is something
that you would do,

30
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,006
so I chose Morgan McMichaels.

31
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,612
- I think DeLa believes that
we're set on a group consensus.

32
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:19,814
Baby, that's a completely
different TV show.

33
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,950
- Morgan McMichaels,
sashay away.

34
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,162
- Oh, my goodness.
- Bitch.

35
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,230
- Somebody really fierce,
Morgan McMichaels,

36
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,798
has sashayed away.

37
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,334
Next week it could be me.
It could be Shangela.

38
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,870
It's probably Chi Chi.

39
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,207
- "Keep rocking and
slay fabulous."

40
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,275
- Ben, how shitty
do you feel?

41
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,609
- Really shitty.

42
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,912
It's just like these
are impossible decisions.

43
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:54,348
The reality of what this
competition is gonna feel like

44
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,917
is really sinking in.

45
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,753
I don't want it to be up
to me who goes home.

46
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,822
This sucks.

47
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:06,127
- Ugh. Wake up, bitch.
You had to make a decision.

48
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:09,096
Nobody envied you,
but you made it, move forward.

49
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,766
- But you got $10,000, girl.
Halleloo.

50
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,267
- Congratulations.

51
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,404
- But it's like not winning.

52
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:18,606
It's like--it feels
really bad.

53
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,144
- Mama, girl, oh.

54
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:25,479
Ms. BenDeLa is giving
y'all you boo-hoo fish

55
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,148
over here at the mirror.

56
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,818
Girl, she sent Morgan home
because Morgan was saying,

57
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,053
"Oh, let's get rid of
the strong competition",

58
00:02:32,053 --> 00:02:33,721
and BenDeLa's a
strong competitor.

59
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,323
That's the reason
she sent her home.

60
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:38,159
Miss DeLa is playing the game
just like the rest of us.

61
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,329
- Well, I just want you
to know that

62
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:44,365
you didn't make
the wrong decision,

63
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,535
and I'm just gonna try
to rock it out for you, baby.

64
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,804
- Spritz, spritz, bish.

65
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:52,440
- So here's to Morgan,
everybody.

66
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,475
- Here's to Morgan.

67
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,645
- So if you, Miss Thing,
had won that lip sync,

68
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,180
what is in your titty?

69
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,118
- I chose, uh, Chi Chi.

70
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,586
- Oh, there it is.

71
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,856
- It's uncomfortable because
Chi Chi's right there.

72
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,926
- It was really just based on
the judges giving her a harder,

73
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:14,362
like, critique for everything.

74
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,597
- Really?
Okay.

75
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:20,735
Well, trust me, don't--don't--
don't--don't--don't ever sleep

76
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,871
on Chi Chi DeVayne, boo, because
I got something for that ass.

77
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,441
- So Chi Chi, you're taking
Aja out next time?

78
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,077
- Let's get the fuck

79
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,077
out of this!

80
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,312
- I'm getting all
these body suits

81
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,713
and I'm gonna go burn them.

82
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,216
I'm thankful that I wasn't
in the bottom two

83
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,718
this first challenge,
and so my goal now

84
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,520
is to try to get
in that top two.

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,456
Live to fight another day.
- Yes, we do.

86
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,625
- I'm coming at this like
"Game of Thrones," okay?

87
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,762
I am the Daenerys Targaryen
of drag.

88
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,764
Shangela Stormborn.

89
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,967
Baby, I'm the mother of dragons,
I'm the breaker of chains.

90
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,402
I'm coming for the crown.

91
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,004
[chuckles]

92
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:01,142
Y'all, give me some powder
'cause I feel sweaty. Oh!

93
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,079
- [RuPaul] The winner of
"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars"

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,574
- We survived.
- Ahh!

103
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,509
- We made it!
- We did it!

104
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,645
- Good mernt'ing!

105
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,948
It is a new day, honey, yes.
Ha-ha!

106
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,385
- After last week,
I just think, bitch, the competition

107
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,619
has really turned, um--

108
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,055
- Everybody came to play.

109
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:49,924
The variety show was,
I thought, amazing.

110
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:51,058
- Yeah.

111
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,526
- I had no idea who was
gonna be in the bottom.

112
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:56,063
- I thought about it
and actually there were

113
00:04:56,063 --> 00:05:00,901
other people that didn't
show as much talent.

114
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,304
- Do you have any opinions,
if you want to share them?

115
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,373
- Milk.

116
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,641
- Oh, she done shook
the table, honey.

117
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,244
[laughs]

118
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:14,548
- I just felt like it really
wasn't much talent there

119
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,784
besides that it was
your original song.

120
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,486
- Oh, God.

121
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,822
My performance was killer,
and the original song

122
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:26,394
is gonna become a bigger hit
than "Supermodel."

123
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:31,132
I thought I had a wonderful
mix of talents in there.

124
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:34,402
- Milk, your talent
can't be Velcro.

125
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:37,304
- I would've loved to come on
and skate for all y'all,

126
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:40,007
but ice is hard to come by.

127
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:43,144
[sirens]
- Whoa!

128
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:45,880
- She done already
done had herses.

129
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,881
- Hey, All Stars.

130
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,215
- Hi!
- Hey!

131
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:51,952
- My first name ain't Baby,
so call me Miss Ross

132
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:57,224
and get a new attitude
'cause a she-ro lies in you.

133
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,461
Y'all come back now, you hear?

134
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,229
[laughing]

135
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,664
- Oh, my God.

136
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,367
- Hello, hello, hello, ladies.

137
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,836
- Hi!

138
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:12,339
- All Stars, I have
some exciting news.

139
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,841
- Oh!

140
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:19,447
- For one night only, we're
bringing back some classic TV

141
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:24,318
as we throw our
very own "VH1 Divas Live".

142
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:28,122
[cheering]

143
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:33,294
- And this year, get this,
it's a salute to Mama Ru.

144
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:36,230
[cheering]

145
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,965
- I mean, it's really
just an honor

146
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,000
to be nominated by yourself.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,535
[laughing]

148
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,371
- You'll be performing
some of my greatest hits

149
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:48,275
in a lip sync extravaganza.

150
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,510
- Whoo!

151
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,481
- Each of you will portray
a different iconic diva.

152
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:57,251
So, Milk,
you'll be Celine Dion.

153
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,920
- Yes!

154
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,723
- Kennedy,
you'll be Janet Jackson.

155
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,291
- Oh!

156
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,260
- Come on, Janet.

157
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,864
- Aja, you'll be
Amy Winehouse.

158
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:11,398
- Yes!

159
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,368
- Chi Chi, you'll be
Miss Patti LaBelle.

160
00:07:14,368 --> 00:07:16,303
- Ooh!

161
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,006
- Trixie, you'll
be Dolly Parton.

162
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,808
- Oh!

163
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,343
- Stretch, what a stretch.

164
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:26,146
- Shangela, you'll be
the elusive chanteuse--

165
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,915
- Oh, yes.
- Mariah Carey.

166
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,350
- Darling.
Darling.

167
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,851
[laughs]

168
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:34,722
- Thorgy, you shall
be Stevie Nicks.

169
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,257
- Yes!

170
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,225
- Thorgy.
- Come on, Witchy Woman.

171
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:42,696
- BenDeLaCreme,
you'll be Dame Julie Andrews.

172
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,932
- Oh, yes.

173
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:48,369
- And last but not least BeBe,
you shall be

174
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,170
Miss Diana Ross.

175
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,706
- All right, Mother.

176
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,942
- #AllStars3.

177
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,711
Ladies, in a moment,
you'll be rehearsing

178
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,981
with the ridiculously
talented Todrick Hall.

179
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,051
[cheering]

180
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,321
- And tomorrow on
the main stage, we'll be joined

181
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,024
by one of my all time
favorite divas...

182
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,694
Vanessa Williams.

183
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,496
[cheering]

184
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,997
- Oh, my God.

185
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,234
- All right, Mother,
all right.

186
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,038
- And for this week's runway,
the category is Ru-demption.

187
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:27,408
We're giving you
a chance to do over

188
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:31,679
your most infamous Drag Race
fashion fails.

189
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,980
- Oh.

190
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,016
- I've got a lot of those.
- Uh-huh.

191
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,120
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best All Star win.

192
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,990
- Thank you, Ru!
- Love you, Mother.

193
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,925
- Ladies and gentlemen,

194
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:49,597
welcome to "VH1 Divas Live".

195
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,765
- There's different levels of
lip sync artistry in the room.

196
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,400
Some people are
professional lip syncers.

197
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,237
- ♪ I don't care
if people stare ♪

198
00:08:57,237 --> 00:09:00,274
- Some people can actually
do their character better.

199
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:04,678
So it's hard to say
what's really gonna happen.

200
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,748
- All of these sections really
give us a huge chance to shine.

201
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,216
- Yeah.

202
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,619
- Like the cards aren't stacked
by what we have been given.

203
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,154
- Well, I feel like
everybody's diva

204
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,190
is a representative of
a little bit of them.

205
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,392
- Stevie Nicks could not be
more perfect for me,

206
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:21,595
however, when have you ever
seen Stevie Nicks do something

207
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:24,865
where some gay is in
the front row of her show

208
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,533
going like, "Work, Stevie.
You better fucking work!"

209
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,937
No. That's not Stevie.

210
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,705
I'm lucky that
I have less lyrics,

211
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,042
however, I think mine
was less funny.

212
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,877
It's really not fair.

213
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,879
There is no way,
because I'm Stevie,

214
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,180
I'm ever gonna win this.

215
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,482
And I come right after you,

216
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:45,085
and you literally are
set up to just win.

217
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,954
- Oh, no.
- Just face it, girl.

218
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:47,955
- Mine--let me tell you--no.
- All right.

219
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,289
- Let me tell you though.

220
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,491
- If you're gonna
argue that, you're crazy.

221
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:52,693
- I could take Amy Winehouse--
- Oh, I know.

222
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,228
- Dolly, and
make them all funny.

223
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,363
- I'm trying not to be like
a conspiracy theorist

224
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,532
because that's what
I was in Season 8.

225
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:03,103
It's just hard because I feel
like I'm being set up to fail.

226
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,738
- I love my part.
- Okay.

227
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:10,344
- When it comes to impersonating
Celine, I am feeling good.

228
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,846
These other girls will have
a tough act to follow.

229
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,281
- What are you wearing?

230
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,951
- I'm wearing her Met Gala
outfit from this past year,

231
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,553
which is like a
silver leotard

232
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,889
with like a Versace dress
over top of it.

233
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,190
- Do you think everybody's
gonna recognize that?

234
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,191
Like I don't know how
iconic that was

235
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,392
because I didn't pay attention.

236
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,393
- I--I can't think of
anything she wears

237
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,728
except that backward suit.

238
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,997
- The reason I want to choose
the Met Gala thing was

239
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:33,634
because this year her
fashion star is on the rise.

240
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:37,037
- Girl, nobody knows what
Celine wore to the Met Gala.

241
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,372
That's such a weird choice.

242
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,174
A really weird choice.

243
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,876
- I did this one event where
I performed Celine in front of--

244
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,478
- Oh, you've done Celine before?

245
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,047
- Yeah. In front of the guy

246
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,983
that was the event planner
for her wedding.

247
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,152
And so as soon as he saw
me perform it, he was like,

248
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,221
"Oh, my God, that
is the best Celine."

249
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,123
- Well, good luck, because
I think Ariana Grande

250
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,326
does the best Celine, but
you can be a close second.

251
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,794
Ahh!

252
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,263
Honey, the big and Milky,
she is mighty confident, Mama,

253
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,632
because the friend of a friend
of a friend who was a friend

254
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,835
of a friend of a friend
of Celine's had told her

255
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,403
it was lovely, girl.

256
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:12,239
Oh, she's about to throw the
diamond into the ocean, honey.

257
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,542
She's about to give it to y'all.
Well, all right.

258
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,677
- Coming up...

259
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,879
- Five, six, Kennedy,
where you at?

260
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,180
- I got lost.

261
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,218
- Shangela is pissing me off,
pissing Todrick off,

262
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,520
practically
pissing off everyone.

263
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,955
- Ah!

264
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,090
Okay.

265
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,194
[RuPaul laughing]

266
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,031
- Hi.
- Hello.

267
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,500
- Hi!

268
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,736
- Our maxi challenge this week
is to perform in our very own

269
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:46,306
version of "VH1's Divas Live".

270
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,443
It's time to rehearse
with Todrick Hall.

271
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,745
I hope the other girls
are ready, 'cause I am.

272
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,614
- How y'all doing?
- Good.

273
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:57,785
- We about to bring it with the
diva's--oh, Lord, here we go.

274
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:01,155
[laughter]

275
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,856
- She's already
in full character.

276
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,895
- Bitch, excuse me?

277
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,096
Are you ready?

278
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:12,833
- I'm sorry, darling.

279
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,035
I'm a method actress, okay?

280
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,770
I'm giving y'all

281
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,473
very Meryl Streep
in this moment.

282
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,179
- This is the "Divas" episode,
and you guys are gonna be

283
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,114
impersonating some of the
most iconic,

284
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,183
legendary performers
of all time,

285
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,051
so we definitely want
to represent them well.

286
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,152
Are you guys ready?

287
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,520
- Yes.
- Okay.

288
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,988
Well, we're gonna
start with Kennedy,

289
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,223
and everybody else
please have a seat.

290
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,493
Okay. You're gonna go
five, four, three,

291
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,829
you just bend
your leg, two, walk.

292
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,998
Five, four, three, two.

293
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,733
- Do I step my leg back out?

294
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,968
- Yeah, let me see it.

295
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,937
Five, six, seven, eight.

296
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,540
And five, four, three...

297
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,677
- Kennedy Davenport is known
for being a fierce queen

298
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,478
that can dance the house down,

299
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,414
but right now
the house is still up.

300
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,216
No chance of it
even shattering.

301
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,051
Don't need insurance because
it's not gonna come down.

302
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,653
And da, da, three, four,
and five.

303
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,522
Okay.

304
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,790
Are you gonna be able
to get that?

305
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,024
- I'll get it.

306
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,926
You have to understand
I am a dancer,

307
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,494
but I freestyle everything.

308
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,731
I don't choreograph anything, so
it's just tough on me right now.

309
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,068
- Can we move on?
- Yeah.

310
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,336
- Let's go slow.

311
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,371
Five, six, seven, eight.

312
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,340
And one, two, three, four--
- I'm lost.

313
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,575
- Kennedy, where you at?
- I got lost.

314
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,410
- Is this gonna be
too complicated?

315
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,347
- I mean, I can get it, but
I'm having trouble right now.

316
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,116
- Are you telling me
you're giving up already?

317
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,885
- Well, don't ask me--
I'm gonna give you my honest--

318
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,219
give you my honest answer.

319
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,021
- I just wanted--I--I want
you to say "Yes, I can get it."

320
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,456
- I can get it.
- Okay.

321
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,991
- Right now it's
not registering.

322
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,826
- Okay.
Tomorrow, no matter what,

323
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,861
you can't let your back-up
dancers upstage you.

324
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,030
- 'Cause I'm coming
for you back here, baby.

325
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,832
- Ooh!

326
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,634
- We'll be ready.

327
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,235
Okay, Thorgy Thor.

328
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,603
- I want to win
a challenge

329
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,739
'cause I never won one
on Season 8.

330
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:01,041
Fuck you, Bob.

331
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,010
- I am not gonna give you
that much choreography.

332
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,177
We're gonna collaborate.

333
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,612
So I want to know
if there are any things

334
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,148
that you specifically want to do
or that you had in mind to do?

335
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,683
- Sure.

336
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,986
♪ Tell me one thing, do you
like where you're going ♪

337
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:16,490
♪ I said who do you think
you are? ♪

338
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,225
- Okay.

339
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,761
Um, who is Stevie Nicks
to you?

340
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:24,097
- Stevie Nicks is one of
my biggest inspirational divas

341
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,232
throughout my entire life.

342
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,667
I love her.
I love her.

343
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,435
The stereotype is
that she's this witch,

344
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,003
but she actually
is not a witch.

345
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,571
She's just an eccentric Gemini.

346
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,942
- Girl, if you're gonna bring
it, you have to bring it.

347
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:38,011
With the rumor that Stevie's
a witch, you can do so much.

348
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,714
Like, bitch, I would've came
out with a pot, a broom.

349
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,150
I would've came out like,
with a--with a wand,

350
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,818
like whoo! Whoo!

351
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,120
- So I think we
should incorporate

352
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,855
some of the stuff that
you're naturally doing

353
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,890
and make it choreography.

354
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,525
So when it gets
to the chorus, can you,

355
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:54,795
like, lean this way
a little bit?

356
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:58,699
- She's not a very, like,
active, acrobatic, you know.

357
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,167
- Person, yeah.
I just wanna see--

358
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,668
- She's just so strong.

359
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:02,869
There's usually a wind machine
underneath her or something.

360
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,604
- Yeah. We gave our
wind machine to Beyonce,

361
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,605
so we're not gonna
have that today.

362
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,940
- Oops.

363
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,042
- But we will pretend that
the wind machine is here.

364
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,878
Thorgy is such a Stevie Nicks
purist that he kept saying,

365
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,413
"Stevie Nicks doesn't
really do this.

366
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,915
She doesn't really dance."

367
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,718
And I think that's great to
know your character so well,

368
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:21,455
but what can you do to make
a drag version of Stevie Nicks?

369
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,423
- She's at a microphone
and she's--

370
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,292
it's all internal and like...
- Yeah.

371
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,094
But I think that it's a kind
of a touchy situation,

372
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,364
because I don't want you
to get lost in the shuffle.

373
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,800
- Stevie Nicks is difficult
to do because

374
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,937
next to divas like Diana Ross
and Patti LaBelle

375
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,505
and Janet Jackson,

376
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,974
she is not like, work,
you know what I mean?

377
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,976
It just doesn't feel fair.

378
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,882
Because it's gonna seem a
little too subdued, right?

379
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:51,685
- What, you mean, like levels?
What are you doing--

380
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,154
- When I'm spinning
like, I don't--

381
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,990
It's incredibly important
to stand out amongst

382
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,359
all these girls because
we're all so talented,

383
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,229
but how do you stand out
performing as Stevie Nicks?

384
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:03,830
That's my problem.

385
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,767
- All right. Let's bring up
Ms. Mariah Carey.

386
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,469
- She is on another level today.
Oh, my God.

387
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,640
Shangela doing her whole
Mariah fantasy...

388
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,010
Girl, she's pissing me off,
she's pissing Todrick off,

389
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,645
practically
pissing off everyone.

390
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,847
- Ah!

391
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,450
Okay.

392
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,353
Jealousy is a killer
in this industry, Mama.

393
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,155
- Let's play the music--
- Okay.

394
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,322
- --and hear what
Mariah's gonna do.

395
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,857
- Is it in my ear?
Hold on, baby.

396
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:31,925
- Oh, Lord.

397
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:35,495
- Ew.
I cannot--I cannot with this.

398
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,098
- Oh, my God, the girls
are so hateful this season.

399
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:40,233
Why they so hateful?

400
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,069
[laughs]
- Okay, I'm ready.

401
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,437
- The girls are shading me.

402
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,705
They're like, oh, she really
thinks she is the diva.

403
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,508
And some are joking,
but some are serious.

404
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,544
- You're gonna cover her up
with the fans.

405
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,879
- Okay.
- So everybody take a fan.

406
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,914
- Oh!
- Whoo!

407
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:55,282
- Sister.

408
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:59,419
Oh, girl, the big and
Milky, honey, oh, girl.

409
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,755
She's throwing shade and
then she plays it off

410
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,690
that she's just trying to be
loose and fun with the girls.

411
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,592
She's not being loose and fun.

412
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,662
Honey, she thinks she's better
than everyone in this room.

413
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,230
- And then she's
gonna walk forward.

414
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,399
I'm not gonna be here
to hold your hand.

415
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,134
- I'm sorry.
I saw the hand.

416
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,202
- You might have to walk
on your own.

417
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,903
- I'm sorry.
I saw the hand.

418
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:20,974
- Shangela, step down from your
high horse and just chill.

419
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,111
- All right. Ms. Ross?

420
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,680
- Yes.
- It's your time, darling.

421
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,148
- Thank you.

422
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,318
- I don't want to pressure you,
but you do know that Diana Ross

423
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,753
is RuPaul's, like,
diva of all time?

424
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,391
This is a very Bianca Del Rio/
Judge Judy situation--

425
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,227
- I know.
- --but to the umpteenth power.

426
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,028
You understand that?
- Yeah.

427
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,864
- And if you don't
fully embody Diana Ross,

428
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,132
he's gonna for sure know.

429
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,934
- Okay, Todrick, just keep
adding that pressure on.

430
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,739
No, no, no.
I really--I feel--I'm excited.

431
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:57,344
I'm excited that I get
to play the real diva.

432
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,345
- Just show me
what you would do.

433
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,780
Just take the stage, own it.

434
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,590
- BeBe does nothing.
Nothing.

435
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,294
Just walks out as Diana Ross,
but that's what BeBe does.

436
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,363
It's who BeBe is.

437
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,965
Okay. Okay.

438
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,638
- Diana is known to steal
the party, steal the show,

439
00:18:24,638 --> 00:18:27,541
and this show
was far from stolen.

440
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,379
- That's great.
I love it.

441
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,850
So we're gonna do
you, BenDeLaCreme.

442
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,052
This is the thing,
the juxtaposition of you

443
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,855
rapping this as Julie Andrews
is what makes this funny,

444
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,357
so it has to be
a mixture of swag

445
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,959
and then some
pixie dust, okay?

446
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,828
Like, dun da da,
body like boom.

447
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,165
- Like that kind of thing?

448
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,034
- But with a little bit
more swag juice in it, okay?

449
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,268
- Okay.

450
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,636
- So you're gonna take
three steps, one--

451
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,004
- One, two, three.

452
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,739
- One, two, three, and four,
and you're gonna touch

453
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,175
your vagina with
one hand at a time.

454
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,743
- On four.
- Yeah.

455
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,779
Can I see you all do that?
Three and four.

456
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,215
And you gotta make
sure you go three and four.

457
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:11,551
Two, three--
- Okay, sorry.

458
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,887
- DeLa, there's a
lot of footwork going on

459
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,889
that is not the footwork
that we need.

460
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:19,826
I'm very, very worried.
Can she handle it?

461
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,895
I don't damn know.

462
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,997
I know you're coming off of
a good win, but I can't express

463
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,533
to you enough that it has to,
has to, has to be, like,

464
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,169
swag, it has to be the lyrics,
it has to be still in character.

465
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,403
- I totally hear that.

466
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:33,306
- If you slip up
one step, you're fucked.

467
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,641
- Yeah.

468
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,310
Todrick stares straight into
your soul

469
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,113
with those crazy,
honey-colored eyes,

470
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:42,849
and finds whatever you're
most insecure about,

471
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,484
and is like, don't do it.

472
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,087
He is terrifying.

473
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,996
- Okay. Chi Chi DeVayne.

474
00:19:55,996 --> 00:19:57,731
And we're also gonna
have Dolly Parton

475
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:00,100
and Celine Dion in this part.

476
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,802
- Okay.

477
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,938
Todrick is randomly
choosing divas

478
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,740
to be part of other
divas' solo numbers,

479
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,174
and I noticed that
he wasn't choosing me.

480
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,577
- And BeBe should be in this.

481
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,580
- So I was like, this is
my chance to stand out.

482
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,383
- Shangela should be in this,
and Kennedy should be in it.

483
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,684
- Todrick?
- Yes.

484
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,185
- I haven't been
part of anything.

485
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,754
I feel like I'm the only one
who hasn't done anything.

486
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:22,255
- Come.

487
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,991
- I will seize the day in order
to kick everyone's ass and win.

488
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:26,426
- Thank you.
I--I love that.

489
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,595
Sure.

490
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,865
- I can tell that Thorgy really
wants to try and do more,

491
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:35,001
but I'm thinking she should
be focusing more on making

492
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,870
her character bigger,
not necessarily

493
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,872
in being in so
many people's numbers.

494
00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:43,109
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, and pose.

495
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,844
Okay.
We can move on to the next girl.

496
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,279
Can I have Trixie?

497
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,548
- Thanks for including me.

498
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,216
- Honestly, I think
the competition

499
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,585
sometimes becomes
too much for Thorgy,

500
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,555
because she really compares
herself to other people,

501
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,824
and then she starts
to pick apart herself.

502
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,929
- Mamacita is in her head.

503
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,030
Good luck, sis.

504
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,566
- [RuPaul] Coming up...

505
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,767
- Watching yourself,
you see things

506
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,103
about yourself that you
may not have realized.

507
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,338
- Yeah, girl.

508
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,906
I didn't know I had
a resting bitch face.

509
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,742
- What?
- [laughs]

510
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:18,812
- You're gonna get
two good double blinks.

511
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:20,347
[laughs]

512
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,917
[RuPaul laughing]

513
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,054
- Whoo!

514
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:33,927
- We are here. Oh!

515
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:36,629
- Come on, divas.
- Good morning, everybody.

516
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,833
- This week's runway
is Ru-demption, where we get

517
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:44,037
to remake our worst fashion
faux pas,

518
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,205
and this is gonna be
really interesting

519
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:46,539
because a lot of these
girls have had some

520
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,975
real ugly fashions,
including myself.

521
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,978
Shangela.
- Yes, baby.

522
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,113
- How you feeling, boo?

523
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,314
- You know what?

524
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,315
I'm less concerned
about the divas thing.

525
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,583
- Uh-huh.

526
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,986
- And more concerned about
the Ru-demption look,

527
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:05,125
because not only is this a look
that I failed at last time,

528
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:09,763
but also, Vanessa Williams was
the judge on the episode I got--

529
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,231
- Gag!
- Yeah.

530
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:12,766
When--of the fail
that I'm doing today.

531
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,734
- So, if you fuck up,
she's gonna--

532
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:15,735
- Twice in front
of Ms. Vanessa.

533
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,003
- She's gonna see it.

534
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,239
- I was actually a little
disappointed at first

535
00:22:19,239 --> 00:22:22,275
because your number
and Kennedy's number

536
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:25,578
and Ben's number and
Chi Chi's number--

537
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,013
- Everybody's number?

538
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,215
- --all are, like, super high
energy numbers, and I love--

539
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:30,450
- Do you think my number
is high energy?

540
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,684
- Girl, you're doing
Amy Winehouse.

541
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:32,986
You have dancers,
you have two backup dancers.

542
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,488
I live for backup dancers.

543
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,589
- You know, we did
a similar challenge

544
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,057
like this on my season.

545
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,527
We did Glamazonian Airways,
which was a lip sync challenge,

546
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:43,029
and I did fine then and
wasn't scared,

547
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,098
but there was also like twice
the number of people here,

548
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,232
so I think that
was part of it.

549
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,500
- Well, was the dancing
as intense?

550
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,737
- God, no.
- This dance is--

551
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:51,838
- Bananas.

552
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,173
- I mean, I wasn't here
for All Stars 2,

553
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:55,708
but I feel like this dance
seems to me like

554
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,677
the most intense dance that
has been on this competition.

555
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:58,845
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

556
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,280
- I feel like
the Herstory of the World,

557
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,681
they were like truly
lip syncing.

558
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,317
This is like choreography.
- Yeah.

559
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:05,452
- Do you think they're
gonna be looking

560
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,921
for a full transformation
into the diva?

561
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:09,422
- Absolutely.
- I think yes.

562
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,957
I think they're looking
for likeness big time.

563
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,459
- Really?
- Absolutely.

564
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,694
Do you remember last season
when they clocked Katya's wig

565
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,530
for not being perfectly
Diana's iconic hair?

566
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,531
- Yeah.

567
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,599
- He went home that episode.

568
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,937
- Trixie, how do you
think you came off

569
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:25,505
on your season, because--

570
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,173
- I came off as
pretty talentless.

571
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,342
- I disagree.
- I think it's pretty fair.

572
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:32,111
I never won any challenges,
and I went home twice.

573
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,849
- Shangela, how do you think you
were perceived on your season?

574
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,417
- It was mixed.

575
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,752
I mean, honestly, I would meet
people and they would be like,

576
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,821
"Oh, my God, I love you,
and during your season

577
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:45,124
"my boyfriend hated you,
but it's so nice to meet you

578
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,993
in person because now
we both love you."

579
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,696
And I'm like, "thank you."
- I get the same thing.

580
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:54,200
It's like being thrown in a room
with people that you don't know.

581
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,502
- Mm-hmm.

582
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:56,603
- Somebody's gonna
get on your nerves.

583
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,071
- Yes.

584
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,174
- And then on top of that,
I'm very vocal about my feelings

585
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:02,642
and how I feel about
a lot of things.

586
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,043
- Yeah.

587
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,179
But I take you different because
I know you and I know, like,

588
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,414
that's a southern way of drag.

589
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:10,450
Like, the girls get you
together in the room.

590
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,888
Kennedy and I go way back, and
she is straight up not edited,

591
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,623
not filtered, not watered down,

592
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,358
and those lips are
gonna be pressed together

593
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,659
and the eyes are
gonna be clocked,

594
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,628
and you're gonna get
two good double blinks.

595
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,265
I think that also watching
yourself--

596
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,266
- Yeah.

597
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:27,433
- --you see things
about yourself

598
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,536
that you may not have realized.
- Yeah, girl.

599
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,404
I didn't know I had
a resting bitch face.

600
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,573
- You didn't know?
- No, I did not.

601
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,108
- She didn't know.
Y'all, she didn't know.

602
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:38,378
- And I was like, bitch,
I was not even looking like--

603
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:42,248
like that at that time,
but I guess I was.

604
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,083
- Kennedy's just like
a grumpy old man.

605
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,886
She's like a grandpa, like
a grandpa who, you know,

606
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:50,123
can't hear well,
and is just kind of angry,

607
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:51,624
but is just your grandpa.

608
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:54,127
It's your grandpa in a wig.

609
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,162
- How do you guys think
I came off on my season?

610
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,198
- I thought you came off
like quirky, friendly, fun.

611
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,700
- That's exactly who I am.

612
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,836
- I did think you were,
like, jealous of Bob.

613
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,006
- I was the first person to say
he is the funniest person alive.

614
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,608
- You were always like,
"It's the Bob show."

615
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,310
- It's the Bob Show.
- You know what I mean?

616
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,477
Yeah.
- Every second.

617
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,545
There was just no room
for anybody else

618
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:13,980
because his personality
was so big.

619
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,882
That's what I was so, like,
eye roll about, you know?

620
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:16,883
- Yeah.

621
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,319
- With that said,
I hope he dies.

622
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,655
I probably was competitive
with Bob in my mind only,

623
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,624
which is what Bob
kept telling me, like,

624
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,326
"Girl, why you
comparing yourself to me?

625
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:27,827
Like, I'm not trying
to come for you."

626
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:31,264
I'm like, "I know,
but I'm just as good as you."

627
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,499
I was just so, like,
always in my head.

628
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,368
This is my thing.
It's who I am.

629
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,403
- You was like one of
my top picks.

630
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:40,206
I was like, damn,
I mean, she is so good.

631
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,541
- Thank you.

632
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,278
- But I also felt that you
just was like so defeated.

633
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:47,747
- Like within my own self?
- Yes.

634
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,882
- I feel like I'm much more
talented and much better

635
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,251
than people give me credit for,
and I'm always talked over.

636
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,921
- Why do you feel like
people over talk you?

637
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,522
I want to make sure I'm
not doing that to you

638
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,091
because I would hate
to make you feel like--

639
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,893
- Girl, tell her ass
to shut up, you're talking.

640
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,228
- I--I just don't--

641
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:03,262
- Please do that
to Kennedy

642
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,764
because she over talks
everybody.

643
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,399
- No, I over talk you.
- What?

644
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,967
- I over talk you.

645
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,235
- You should be
the last one to talk.

646
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,536
Shangela, you talk
so goddamn much.

647
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,971
- I do.

648

860
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,312
- [RuPaul] I think she's pinning

861
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:56,582
all of her hopes
on this outfit.

862
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,783
Aja.
Fairy tale princess disaster,

863
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,855
Season 9, and this is the remix.
- [Michelle] Ahh.

864
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:06,458
- [RuPaul] You're beautiful.

865
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:09,395
- [Aja] This look is probably
where I felt the ugliest

866
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,063
and the lowest on Season 9,

867
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:14,667
and that's when the Aja
transformation truly began.

868
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,969
- [RuPaul]
Finally some disaster relief.

869
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:19,271
Thank you, FEMA.

870
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,973
Chi Chi DeVayne.

871
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:23,409
Neon realness, Season 8.

872
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,311
- [Carson]
It's a Janet Jackson Pollack.

873
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,379
[laughing]

874
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,648
- [Chi Chi] I got so many
harsh critiques about

875
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:32,685
not wearing pads or boobs,

876
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:36,255
so I got to show Michelle that
I can suck my waist in

877
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:39,625
and wear big boobs
and do all that too.

878
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:40,993
- [RuPaul]
Why it gotta be black light?

879
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:46,398
Why it gotta be black light?
I love it.

880
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:47,900
- [RuPaul] Trixie Mattel.

881
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,072
The ugliest dress ever,
Season 7, and this is the remix.

882
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:54,873
- Whatever happened
to Baby Jane?

883
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,475
That looks like one of hers.

884
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:57,609
- [Trixie] I know
I'm nailing it because

885
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,644
Vanessa Williams is like...

886
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:02,247
I don't even know if she knows
that I'm redoing an ugly dress.

887
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,849
So she probably thinks
I'm supposed to be gorgeous,

888
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,784
and she's like "sure,

889
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,420
you're really painting with
all the colors of the wind."

890
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,222
- [RuPaul] You know, this outfit
reminds me I have pots

891
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,991
in the sink
I need to scrub.

892
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:16,428
Kennedy.
Death becomes her, Season 7.

893
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,197
Oh, honey, rigor mortis
done set in.

894
00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:19,998
- Yes.
- Ooh.

895
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:23,435
- What?
Uh-oh, oh!

896
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,671
- [Carson] You know, she's
always so hot and cold with me.

897
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,272
- [Vanessa] She is!

898
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:29,141
- [Kennedy] So it's the
same story from Season 7,

899
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:31,310
a night after hooking.

900
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,278
Tre threw me in the fire,
but in the process,

901
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,147
I was crystallized.

902
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,917
- [Carson] You know, if you
can't beat them--

903
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,853
- [Michelle] Stone them.
- [Carson] Stone them.

904
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:42,187
[laughs]

905
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:46,558
- [RuPaul] Thorgy Thor.
Neon queen realness, Season 8.

906
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:48,894
- [Vanessa] All of a sudden
I'm craving a salad.

907
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:49,995
[laughs]

908
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,797
- [Thorgy] I live for
what I wore,

909
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,399
but I feel like that
was the child,

910
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:55,300
and this is like the mother.

911
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,102
- [Carson] I've heard of hammer
toe, but never hammer head.

912
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,103
- Yes.

913
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,405
[laughing]

914
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:02,674
- [RuPaul] Reclaiming my lime.
Reclaiming my lime.

915
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,810
BenDeLaCreme.

916
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,446
Dripping in jewels, Season 6.

917
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:10,449
Oh, my God,
it's Jewelry Andrews.

918
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,084
[laughing]

919
00:39:12,084 --> 00:39:15,454
- [BenDeLaCreme] I feel
stunning in this outfit.

920
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,756
Anybody who says that
I am not currently

921
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:21,994
dripping in jewels is
just a flat-out liar.

922
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:25,397
- [Vanessa] Does the rug match
the beaded curtain?

923
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,533
- [Carson] That's what you
call vajazzled.

924
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,067
- Yes!

925
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,702
- [RuPaul] BeBe Zahara Benet.

926
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,938
Season 1 entrance look.

927
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:34,106
- [Todrick] Ooh!

928
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,841
- [Michelle] I love a power
bottom suit.

929
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,810
- Yes.

930
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,014
- [BeBe] Season 1 I was giving
you very secretary, honey.

931
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,615
But now, she actually owns
the company.

932
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:47,319
Very Wilhelmina Slater,
very that.

933
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:50,823
- [RuPaul] She serves at
the President's pleather.

934
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,925
[laughing]

935
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:56,728
- Oh, my God.
Shangela.

936
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,665
Christmas eleganza, Season 3.

937
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,633
Wow.
- Fantastic.

938
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,402
- [Shangela] First of all,
Ms. Vanessa ain't aged

939
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,471
or moved since Season 3.

940
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:09,074
Numero dos, to see the smile,
is just total validation

941
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,576
for this moment.

942
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,879
- [Carson] We're gonna get you
out of there, Shangela, hold on.

943
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,380
[laughs]

944
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,748
- [RuPaul]
Shangela, if you can hear me,

945
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,751
there's only 30 more seconds of
oxygen left in there.

946
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,987
- Good luck!

947
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:22,988
- [RuPaul] Coming up...

948
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:24,623
- She could have worked
a little harder.

949
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,859
- It's a tiny bit basic.

950
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,494
- You didn't know the words.

951
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:30,028
If you did,
then you missed them.

952
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,633
[RuPaul laughing]

953
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,536
- Welcome, ladies.

954
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:41,807
Based on your performance
in the lip sync extravaganza,

955
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:44,943
and your Ru-demption
Runway look,

956
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,179
I've made some decisions.

957
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:50,716
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward.

958
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:55,521
Shangela, BenDeLaCreme,

959
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:57,189
BeBe Zahara Benet.

960
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:01,460
You are the top three this week.

961
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,629
- All right.

962
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:10,869
- Chi Chi DeVayne,
Thorgy Thor,

963
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,838
Kennedy Davenport.

964
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:17,910
You are the bottom
three of the week.

965
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:25,851
Aja, Milk, Trixie Mattel,

966
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,185
you are safe.

967
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,657
Please step to
the back of the stage.

968
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:48,473
- Now it's time for
the Judges' critiques,

969
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,409
starting with Kennedy.

970
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:51,777
- I liked the runway look.

971
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:54,880
I loved the covered face,
and then this look, the makeup,

972
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,683
the contact lenses, the white
lip, I think it's really fun.

973
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,651
- But I'm afraid
with your performance,

974
00:41:59,651 --> 00:42:01,253
you didn't know the words.

975
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:03,255
And if you did,
then you missed them.

976
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:05,257
And I didn't get any
Janet Jackson,

977
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:06,892
I got all Kennedy.

978
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,394
- I wasn't getting it in
the moves, I wasn't getting it

979
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,063
in the makeup, I wasn't
getting it in the wig.

980
00:42:11,063 --> 00:42:13,832
- I do know Sean Cheeseman
who did the original "Control"

981
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:16,902
and "Rhythm Nation," 'cause
he left me to do Janet, so--

982
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:18,303
[laughing]

983
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:21,673
- Janet is a very specific kind
of move, very kind of staccato.

984
00:42:21,673 --> 00:42:23,375
You could've worked
a little harder

985
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,978
in terms of making
it really crisp.

986
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:27,379
- With that being said,
I gave you

987
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,881
the most difficult choreography
out of everybody that was here,

988
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,351
and that should
be accounted for.

989
00:42:32,351 --> 00:42:34,386
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

990
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,954
- When I first saw
you come out,

991
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:38,724
I knew instantly that
you were Patti LaBelle.

992
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:41,226
- Chi Chi, I was sold
on your Patti.

993
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,362
You got the flicks,
which is very Patti.

994
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:46,498
- And tonight on the runway
you have your neon challenge.

995
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:48,333
- Mm-hmm.
- Which for you and I, we--

996
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:50,936
- Yeah.
- Yes.

997
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:52,571
And you look
beautiful tonight.

998
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:54,172
I don't think you need
that coat though.

999
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,641
Yes, girl, look.

1000
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:57,442
We get to see
your shape, beautiful.

1001
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:59,311
- But it's a tiny bit basic.

1002
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:01,413
Like, even with the hair,
the makeup,

1003
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,714
like, it just needs
a little tweak.

1004
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,751
- Can I just say, I just
loved you in "Eraser".

1005
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:06,918
- Oh, wow.

1006
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,154
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

1007
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:12,290
- "Eraser", baby.
"Eraser".

1008
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,725
- Next up, Shangela.

1009
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,994
- I love this look.

1010
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:18,263
The original look was
like Beyonce when she was

1011
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:21,166
in Destiny's Child and sometimes
wore questionable outfits.

1012
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,935
And then when she was Beyonce,
that's you right now.

1013
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,170
You're slaying.

1014
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,206
And I love that you
captured the Mariah

1015
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,475
that we know and love,
which is a wonderful

1016
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:33,712
and quizzical blend of
confusion and confidence.

1017
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,614
[laughing]

1018
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,917
- It's just so awesome to watch
you work from beginning to end.

1019
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,952
From the moment you walked out
onto the stage yesterday,

1020
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,421
you were in character.

1021
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:44,489
Sometimes a little too
in character,

1022
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,559
but I loved the fact that
you owned the role

1023
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,628
and elevated the movements
that I gave you.

1024
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,530
- This is a full circle moment,

1025
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,533
because Vanessa judged
Shangela before.

1026
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:56,468
- Yes, I did, and you've
come a long way

1027
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:58,804
from when I saw you years ago.

1028
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:00,539
You are a superstar.

1029
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:01,840
- Thank you, Ms. Williams.

1030
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,308
- Shangela, are you
a Mariah fan?

1031
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,977
- I'm a huge Mariah fan,
and I hope when she meets me,

1032
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,112
she won't know me.

1033
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:10,182
[laughing]

1034
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,617
- Up next, Thorgy Thor.

1035
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:14,319
- Tonight on the runway,
I like this a lot

1036
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,055
better than the one
on your season,

1037
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:18,657
but it feels disjointed.

1038
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:21,193
The wedge and the eyebrows
seem like one part,

1039
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:23,495
and the dress feels
like a different part.

1040
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,363
And then tonight
the challenge was to embody

1041
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,899
and become these diva women.
- Okay.

1042
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,869
- And I felt like I was looking
at Thorgy with a blonde wig on.

1043
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,104
- Oh.

1044
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:33,572
- Yeah. I got the same thing
that Michelle did.

1045
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:35,040
I think it's about those
visual cues, and you gave us

1046
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,608
that with the hat
and the costuming,

1047
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:39,277
but the make-up
wasn't as Stevie.

1048
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,913
It's a fine line to still
put yourself in it,

1049
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,815
but also make somebody
that does know you

1050
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,016
know who you're impersonating.

1051
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,685
So that was a miss for me.

1052
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:50,255
- I think Stevie Nicks was a
hard diva to do because it's--

1053
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:51,690
- I'm trying to keep my mouth
shut because I don't--

1054
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,925
I don't want
to make any excuses.

1055
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:55,360
- Yeah, it's clearly not what--

1056
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,662
- But it's not a gay--
it's not like a gay icon.

1057
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:00,832
- Stevie Nicks is
definitely a gay icon.

1058
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:02,100
- The words came out
of my mouth,

1059
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,635
and I was like,
she is to me.

1060
00:45:03,635 --> 00:45:05,470
I thought I did a
really good job.

1061
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,205
I'm a little surprised
I'm the bottom, to be honest.

1062
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,807
- You are all All Stars.

1063
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:12,778
Honestly, we have to pick up
on the slightest infraction

1064
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:16,615
on the challenge,
do you know what I mean?

1065
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:18,049
All right, thanks Thorgy.

1066
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,152
Up next, BenDeLaCreme.

1067
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:21,820
Jazz hot.

1068
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,556
- I gave you probably the most
difficult challenge because

1069
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:27,225
you had to be Julie Andrews, but
you also had to have swagger,

1070
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,560
but then you also
had to know

1071
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,529
every single one
of these lyrics.

1072
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,764
And I think that you just
knocked it out of the park.

1073
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:35,500
- How do you solve a problem
like "Call Me Mother,"

1074
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,637
because I don't even
know the lyrics.

1075
00:45:38,637 --> 00:45:41,373
True story. It took me
five days to record that song.

1076
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:42,774
- Really?
- To get the lyrics right?

1077
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,142
- Yep.

1078
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,311
- And it terms of the outfit,
you're a dream in pink.

1079
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:49,981
Very artistic
in the 1930s, art deco.

1080
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:52,417
- These are actually the
earrings that were given to us

1081
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,053
for that challenge
in Season 6.

1082
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:56,454
- I've been looking for those.

1083
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:58,557
[laughing]

1084
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:00,258
- Cameroon!

1085
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:01,693
- Hello, Mother.

1086
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:05,363
- BeBe Zahara Benet, have you
met the first lady of Cameroon?

1087
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,732
- I have not met her,
but she's heard of me, honey.

1088
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:09,634
[laughing]

1089
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:13,972
- Baby, you were Diana Ross.
It was amazing to me.

1090
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,240
And here's the key
that everybody

1091
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,341
should look at for that.

1092
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:19,077
You didn't do much
to embody Diana.

1093
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:20,645
- There wasn't a lot to do.

1094
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,581
There weren't a lot of lyrics,
but it was just

1095
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:24,816
a couple of those gestures,
the wardrobe.

1096
00:46:24,816 --> 00:46:27,152
- And you even got
the hair bounce, girl.

1097
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:28,887
- It was a real homerun.

1098
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,523
- And then with this runway
look, I just love it.

1099
00:46:31,523 --> 00:46:34,059
This was like BeBe Priestly,
"Devil Wears Prada,"

1100
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,493
the black version.

1101
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:37,295
- Can we just say the black
version of "Devil Wears Prada"

1102
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,365
is Wilhelmina Slater?
Hello? Thank you very much.

1103
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:42,934
- Thank you, ladies.

1104
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:46,905
Based on the judges critiques,
I've made some decisions.

1105
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:54,713
Shangela, BenDeLaCreme,

1106
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,114
condragulations,

1107
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:58,149
you are the top two
All Stars of the week.

1108
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:01,253
- Yes.

1109
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:07,092
- You've each won a $1,000 gift
card from Sparkles Rhinestones,

1110
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:12,697
and a $1,000 gift card
from Fierce Queen Heels.

1111
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:15,967
BeBe Zahara Benet.
- Yes, Mother.

1112
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,402
- Chi Chi DeVayne...

1113
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:20,372
You are safe.

1114
00:47:21,907 --> 00:47:25,277
That means, Kennedy Davenport
and Thorgy Thor,

1115
00:47:25,277 --> 00:47:28,513
you are in the bottom two.

1116
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:33,251
Shangela, BenDeLa,
each of you needs to decide

1117
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:37,422
which of the bottom queens
you will eliminate

1118
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:40,725
if you win the lip sync.

1119
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,161
So while you and the queens
deliberate in the workroom,

1120
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:48,033
the judges and I will play
a friendly game of strip poker.

1121
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,335
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.

1122
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:53,204
Coming up...

1123
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,439
- My mind's not made up.

1124
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,441
I want to know is Thorgy
going to be

1125
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:59,411
a reliable strong ally for me.

1126
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:01,813
If I throw you a bone,
I'm gonna expect a bone

1127
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,014
thrown back to me later on.

1128
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,323
[RuPaul laughing]

1129
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:17,395
- Thorgy and Kennedy, one
of these bitches is going home,

1130
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:21,599
but at this point I'm not
sure how this is gonna go down.

1131
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,869
It seems like the girls
all have their own opinion

1132
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,838
of how people
should get sent home,

1133
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:31,109
so it's up to DeLa
and Shangela to decide.

1134
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,813
- So how is everybody feeling?

1135
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:37,082
- I'm just trying not to cry.
I'm like really holding it in.

1136
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:39,150
Like, it really
doesn't feel good.

1137
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,519
I'm like really trying--

1138
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,255
- I would be crying right now.
- --to, like, get words out.

1139
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,524
Just give me a second.

1140
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,026
- Sorry, girl.

1141
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:51,329
- I don't feel like it made
any sense to me, to be honest.

1142
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,464
I'm nervous to go home.

1143
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,402
I worked really hard
to get here.

1144
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:59,237
- I want to chat with you
if that's okay.

1145
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,405
- I'd love to chat with you.

1146
00:49:00,405 --> 00:49:02,674
- Should we go chat?
- Yes.

1147
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:04,342
- Wish I could have a refill.

1148
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,977
- Yeah, we all need a refill.

1149
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,146
I told y'all, "Game of Thrones."

1150
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:10,415
If I'm gonna take over
the Seven Kingdoms, honey,

1151
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:12,417
I'm gonna have to
have some allies.

1152
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:15,020
I want to know, is Thorgy
going to be

1153
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,789
a reliable strong ally for me?

1154
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,158
- Do I sit here and like beg?
- No.

1155
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:21,393
- Is it even worth it?

1156
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:22,994
- You know, I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

1157
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:24,262
Yes, Kennedy is my friend.

1158
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:26,097
I have known her for
a while, but also--

1159
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:27,499
- I know.
It kind of like terrifies me.

1160
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:30,035
- What I want to say is
that my mind's not made up.

1161
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,336
- Okay.

1162
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,338
- But she knows as well as I do,
this is a competition.

1163
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:35,140
I respect you.

1164
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,075
I know what kind
of a competitor you are,

1165
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,676
and you know how I am.
- Yeah.

1166
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,845
- If I throw you a bone,
I'm gonna expect

1167
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:42,447
a bone thrown back
to me later on.

1168
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,915
- I've been saying
since day one...

1169
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,619
- That's how this game
is played, Mamacita.

1170
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:49,220
- But it's a different game.
- Yeah.

1171
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,456
- If you win and you save me
and you keep me, oh, my God,

1172
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:53,224
I'm like--I want to--
I cannot leave.

1173
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:55,860
I cannot go home.
I am not ready to go home.

1174
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:59,898
- Thorgy. Pros:
she's here to play the game

1175
00:49:59,898 --> 00:50:04,569
and she is a fierce,
creative, talented queen.

1176
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:08,440
Cons: it's no secret
that Thorgy sometimes

1177
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,841
really gets in her head.

1178
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,776
Is that gonna be a handicap
to her

1179
00:50:11,776 --> 00:50:14,045
moving forward in
this competition?

1180
00:50:15,914 --> 00:50:18,183
- I don't make excuses.

1181
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:19,717
I'm very transparent.

1182
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:25,390
This was a stumbling block, but
I have so much more to give.

1183
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,725
I mean, that's my whole focus
of being here is

1184
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:30,728
to let people see through
this and see my heart.

1185
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:34,666
Not so much on stage, because
you can see my heart on stage.

1186
00:50:34,666 --> 00:50:36,000
- Right.

1187
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,702
- But it's off stage that
I want you to see it.

1188
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,237
- I see it, girl.

1189
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:42,140
- Since Season 7,
I think mentally

1190
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,842
I've grown to be a better me,

1191
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:46,911
to be a more sickening
and ferocious me, honey.

1192
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,714
So leaving is not an option.

1193
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,217
So don't tell me nothing,
you know.

1194
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,652
You make your decision based
on what you have seen,

1195
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,921
but, I mean,
I don't want to go home.

1196
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,958
- When I look at the full scope
of who's here, I can see

1197
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:02,727
Kennedy in that final three,
but the biggest thing

1198
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,429
working against Kennedy
is that,

1199
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,132
yes, she had some
intense choreography,

1200
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:09,434
but what I heard
from the judges

1201
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:13,004
was she didn't fully
embody Janet

1202
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:16,641
and she was a huge part
of this challenge.

1203
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,042
- You seemed like you
really thought

1204
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:18,977
you were gonna be in the top.

1205
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:25,717
- I was in character
the entire time, and...

1206
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:30,255
to be standing on
that stage and not--

1207
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:32,824
not be commended for it...

1208
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:39,664
- I think that's a lot
of emotion for safe.

1209
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:41,966
- It's stupid.

1210
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,535
- Girl, do you want Celine
to come over here

1211
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:44,836
and sing you a song?

1212
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:47,672
Girl.

1213
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:50,074
- I was in eight of
the ten numbers,

1214
00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,410
and I did the goddamn thing.

1215
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,747
When I know I did a really
great job, call me selfish,

1216
00:51:55,747 --> 00:51:58,016
but I want--
I want to hear it.

1217
00:51:58,016 --> 00:52:00,018
I was so excited
to get up there

1218
00:52:00,018 --> 00:52:03,755
and hear what they thought
of my performance,

1219
00:52:03,755 --> 00:52:07,158
and what they thought of
my Ru-demption look

1220
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:11,396
because in Season 6 all
they wanted to see was glamour.

1221
00:52:11,396 --> 00:52:13,331
- I feel like you've been
giving a lot of glamour.

1222
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,900
- I--I can assume that
that's what they think,

1223
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,169
but I want them
to congratulate me.

1224
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:22,340
- Milk's perception of
his performance

1225
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,975
is obviously different
than the reality.

1226
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,977
Her Ru-demption Runway
was something

1227
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:29,147
that didn't really reflect
why we like Milk.

1228
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,416
It was like a safe,
pretty choice.

1229
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:34,018
Plus the Celine look
was not very Celine.

1230
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,591
- Do you have an idea of like
why I should choose you

1231
00:52:39,591 --> 00:52:40,992
and Kennedy, you
know what I mean?

1232
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,694
Because right now
I'm just like, I don't know.

1233
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:43,962
- Here it is.

1234
00:52:43,962 --> 00:52:45,496
When you win this lip sync
and you save me,

1235
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,165
I'll owe you one.

1236
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,333
Can I ask you an
honest question?

1237
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,534
- Yeah.

1238
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:50,702
- Do you think I should be
in the bottom two?

1239
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:52,870
- Uh, I--

1240
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:55,139
- I actually thought
I did a great job.

1241
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:57,542
- I was--I didn't see anybody,
you know what I mean?

1242
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:58,843
- Yeah, yeah.

1243
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,278
I just have so many thoughts
going through my head.

1244
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:02,947
Like, when you're given
Diana Ross and, like,

1245
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,550
every comment is like,
"It's Diana Ross, so..."

1246
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,285
- Yeah.

1247
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:09,520
- "You did less and
that was so much more."

1248
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,689
I'm like, to me that means
you did nothing.

1249
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,859
You just--it's Diana Ross.

1250
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:18,329
I don't know, but that's why
in the rehearsal I was like,

1251
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,864
use me more.

1252
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,699
- I know that Thorgy feels
like she was focused

1253
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,036
in the rehearsal process,
but she'd be like in the back,

1254
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:27,372
like, frustrated because she
feels like she's being derailed.

1255
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:30,108
It was like a weird subconscious
thing happening, I think.

1256
00:53:30,108 --> 00:53:32,844
- I'd like to say no matter
who you choose on that runway,

1257
00:53:32,844 --> 00:53:35,546
like, I love you,

1258
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,382
but I can't predict
the way I'm gonna react.

1259
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,053
I--I would not feel
right going home.

1260
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,621
- I actually really love

1261
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:45,723
what Thorgy has to offer
as a drag queen.

1262
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,860
I think she's a total weirdo
in a way that I love,

1263
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,130
but Thorgy gets upset
fairly easily.

1264
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:57,035
I'm worried that she would
get in her own way eventually.

1265
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:59,871
- So here's the tea.
You know we can talk real.

1266
00:53:59,871 --> 00:54:02,407
When I talk to Kennedy,
I want to make sure

1267
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:04,575
that her heart is still
in this competition

1268
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,943
because she's gotta be
in that top

1269
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:09,380
or else I would've
just wasted a save.

1270
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,350
If I win, why don't I have
your name in my hand?

1271
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,918
- You know in your heart--
- Mm-hmm.

1272
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,054
- --where my dedication was.

1273
00:54:16,054 --> 00:54:18,723
I put a lot into this.

1274
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,625
- Yeah.
- And I--

1275
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,593
- Oh, I saw you stoning
that wig for hours.

1276
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,263
- I wouldn't have
did this Season 7.

1277
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:27,832
That's why I feel like
I belong here,

1278
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:31,302
because I have so much to give
and so much to present.

1279
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:32,970
- Let me ask you this.

1280
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,774
If given the opportunity, would
you send me to the house?

1281
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:40,011
- There's certain boundaries
that you just do not cross.

1282
00:54:40,011 --> 00:54:44,215
$100,000 is not worth
losing a relationship.

1283
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:45,750
It's just not.

1284
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,585
And that's the type
of person that I am.

1285
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,721
- There's a lot to think about.

1286
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:52,290
Right now I'm feeling torn.

1287
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,059
When you base decisions
just on your friendships,

1288
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:58,029
then you make decisions that
you might end up regretting.

1289
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:04,168
- I'll raise you 20.
- I'm in.

1290
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,470
- I've got four queens.

1291
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,738
[laughs]

1292
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:09,040
- I hate this game.

1293
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,177
These have always
brought me luck.

1294
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:14,612
- I'll take them.

1295
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:15,947
- Just your size.

1296
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:17,281
- Silence.

1297
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,150
Bring back my girls.

[laughing]

1299
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:28,292
- This is not
an easy decision.

1300
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:32,463
Each of these queens has
a lot more to offer,

1301
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,133
but they both had
trouble delivering

1302
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:36,968
what the judges
needed from them.

1303
00:55:36,968 --> 00:55:40,738
So I genuinely have no idea
what to do here.

1304
00:55:44,142 --> 00:55:48,112
- I made a decision, but am
I making the right choice?

1305
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:51,649
Is this queen going to push
herself to be in the top,

1306
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:54,318
and when she's there,
can I count on her?

Prior to tonight,

a lip sync performance of "Jump"

This your chance to impress me,

She's a sneaky ho, okay?

She ain't taking my $10,000.
No, ma'am.

00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:29,133
Shangela, with great power
comes great responsibility.

1364
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:33,871
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

1365
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,107
- I know what it's like to
come back to this competition

1366
00:59:36,107 --> 00:59:39,844
and be sent home again
without getting the crown.

1367
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:42,413
I know how that feels.

1368
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,948
The person I've chosen
to send home...

1369
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:47,718
is Thorgy.

1370
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:51,222
- Oh, Jesus. Gross.

1371
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:56,160
- Thorgy, you are, and will
always be, an All Star.

1372
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,697
Now, sashay away.

1373
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:01,532
- Gotcha.

1374
01:00:01,532 --> 01:00:02,767
I love you guys.

1375
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:04,235
- Love you, too.
- I love you, Thorgy.

1376
01:00:04,235 --> 01:00:06,137
I really mean that.
I really do love you.

1377
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:08,706
- Bye, guys.

1378
01:00:10,508 --> 01:00:12,009
Whoo!

1379
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,548
I am not ready to leave
this competition at all.

1380
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:19,650
I have so much to give.

1381
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,752
In comparison to some of
the other girls here,

1382
01:00:21,752 --> 01:00:23,554
I think I deserve to stay
a lot more.

1383
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:27,291
"Drag is fun," and then because
I'm gonna hate Shangela

1384
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,895
for life, how about
"Suck it Shangella,"

1385
01:00:30,895 --> 01:00:35,366
and I'm gonna spell it with
two Ls because she hates that,

1386
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:39,203
and then she can suck this,

1387
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:42,106
'cause it's going that way.

1388
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,774
Yeah, that's pretty disgusting.

1389
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,142
Have a good time without me.

1390
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,477
Bye.
It's gonna be boring TV.

1391
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:49,080
[bell ringing]
I don't know what that means.

1392
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:54,719
- Under his eye, kitty girl.
- Jesus Christmas.

1393
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:56,954
- Today you've been
given a gift.

1394
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,724
Well, it's actually
more like a Groupon.

1395
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,195
- What the hell is going on?

1396
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:09,467
Is this gonna explode?

1397
01:01:09,467 --> 01:01:11,569
Please don't explode.

1398
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,608
- [RuPaul]
Next time on "All Stars"...

1399
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:21,212
You'll be improving your
way through The Bitchelor.

1400
01:01:21,212 --> 01:01:22,546
[laughing]

1401
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:24,215
- There's something different
about these girls,

1402
01:01:24,215 --> 01:01:26,650
but I can't quite figure out
what it is.

1403
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,352
- I don't think I'm psychotic,

1404
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,688
I just think I'm really
passionate about finding love.

1405
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:31,689
- Yeah.
- While the leaves--

1406
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:32,957
- And that's why I'm here.

1407
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:35,559
- And you were constantly
overshadowed.

1408
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:38,129
- If you're gonna be a bottom,
at least be a power bottom.

1409
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:40,631
- Season 3 Shange,
you would've picked up

1410
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:42,399
my cocktail and
threw it on that ho.

1411
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:44,135
- Fuck my drag, right?

1412
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:49,673
Every week is just
like turd city.

1413
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,242
[laughs]
