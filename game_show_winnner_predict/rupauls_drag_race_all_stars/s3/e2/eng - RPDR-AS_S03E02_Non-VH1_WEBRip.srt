00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,703
- [RuPaul] Previously
on All Stars,,,

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,205
Each week the winner
will eliminate

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,609
one of her fellow queens,

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:12,613
- How do you feel about
the whole elimination set up?

5
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,814
- I'm just gonna send
the bitch home

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,216
that I think is the strongest,

7
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:20,087
- [RuPaul] Welcome to "RuPaul's
All Star Variety Show",

8
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:22,823
Aja,
- You really brought it,

9
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,492
That jump, it was just insane,

10
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,493
- [RuPaul]
BenDeLaCreme,

11
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,161
- You look stunning,
head to toe,

12
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,230
and then you give us comedy,

13
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,165
- [RuPaul]
Morgan McMichaels,

14
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,001
- Any self doubt,
knock it off,

15
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,570
Because anything less than
a hundred is not good enough,

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,105
- [RuPaul]
Chi Chi DeVayne,

17
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,340
- All I kept doing was
looking at the shoe,

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,708
It was almost like down here,

19
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,411
when the rest of the girls
were taking it up there,

20
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,180
- BenDeLaCreme,
you're a winner, baby,

21
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,584
- Thank you,

22
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:54,288
- Which queen have you
chosen to get the chop?

23
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:57,991
- When we, as a group,
talked about why we might

24
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,626
eliminate somebody
moving forward,

25
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,530
we talked about that we would
not want to make that decision,

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,733
pretty much unanimously,
based on knocking somebody

27
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,502
that we saw as fierce
competition out of the way,

28
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,537
And that is something
that you would do,

29
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:12,806
so I chose Morgan McMichaels,

30
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,412
- I think DeLa believes that
we're set on a group consensus,

31
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,614
Baby, that's a completely
different TV show,

32
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,750
- Morgan McMichaels,
sashay away,

33
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,962
- Oh, my goodness,
- Bitch,

34
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,030
- Somebody really fierce,
Morgan McMichaels,

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,598
has sashayed away,

36
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,134
Next week it could be me,
It could be Shangela,

37
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,670
It's probably Chi Chi,

38
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,007
- "Keep rocking and
slay fabulous,"

39
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,075
- Ben, how shitty
do you feel?

40
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,409
- Really shitty,

41
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,712
It's just like these
are impossible decisions,

42
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,148
The reality of what this
competition is gonna feel like

43
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,717
is really sinking in,

44
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,553
I don't want it to be up
to me who goes home,

45
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,622
This sucks,

46
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,927
- Ugh, Wake up, bitch,
You had to make a decision,

47
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,896
Nobody envied you,
but you made it, move forward,

48
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,566
- But you got $10,000, girl,
Halleloo,

49
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,067
- Congratulations,

50
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,204
- But it's like not winning,

51
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,406
It's like--it feels
really bad,

52
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,944
- Mama, girl, oh,

53
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,279
Ms, BenDeLa is giving
y'all you boo-hoo fish

54
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,948
over here at the mirror,

55
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:31,618
Girl, she sent Morgan home
because Morgan was saying,

56
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,853
"Oh, let's get rid of
the strong competition",

57
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,521
and BenDeLa's a
strong competitor,

58
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,123
That's the reason
she sent her home,

59
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,959
Miss DeLa is playing the game
just like the rest of us,

60
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,129
- Well, I just want you
to know that

61
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,165
you didn't make
the wrong decision,

62
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,335
and I'm just gonna try
to rock it out for you, baby,

63
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,604
- Spritz, spritz, bish,

64
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,240
- So here's to Morgan,
everybody,

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,275
- Here's to Morgan,

66
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,445
- So if you, Miss Thing,
had won that lip sync,

67
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,980
what is in your kitty?

68
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,918
- I chose, uh, Chi Chi,

69
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,386
- Oh Lordy,

70
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,656
- It's uncomfortable because
Chi Chi's right there,

71
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,726
- It was really just based on
the judges giving her a harder,

72
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,162
like, critique for everything,

73
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,397
- Really?
Okay,

74
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,535
Well, trust me, don't--don't--
don't--don't--don't ever sleep

75
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,671
on Chi Chi DeVayne, boo, because
I got something for that ass,

76
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,241
- So Chi Chi, you're taking
Aja out next time?

77
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,877
out of this!
- Let's get the fuck

78
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,112
- I'm getting all
these body suits

79
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,513
and I'm gonna go burn them,

80
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,016
I'm thankful that I wasn't
in the bottom two

81
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,518
this first challenge,
and so my goal now

82
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,320
is to try to get
in that top two,

83
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,256
Live to fight another day,
- Yes, we do,

84
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,425
- I'm coming at this like
"Game of Thrones," okay?

85
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,562
I am the Daenerys Targaryen
of drag,

86
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,564
Shangela Stormborn,

87
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,767
Baby, I'm the mother of dragons,
I'm the breaker of chains,

88
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,202
I'm coming for the crown,

89
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,804
[chuckles]

90
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,942
Y'all, give me some powder
'cause I feel sweaty, Oh!

91
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,879
- [RuPaul] The winner of
"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars"

92
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,481
receives a one-year supply

93
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,916
of Anastasia
Beverly Hills cosmetics,

94
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,552

Drag Race Hall of Fame,

95
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:16,323
and a cash prize of $100,000,

96
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,326

00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,294
and Vanessa Williams,

98
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,529
- ? RuPaul's Drag Race

99
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,966
- ? May the best woman
best woman, win ?

100
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,374
- We survived,
- Ahh!

101
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,309
- We made it!
- We did it!

102
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,445
- Good morning,

103
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,748
It is a new day, honey, yes,
Ha-ha!

104
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,185
- After last week,
I just think the competition

105
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,419
has really turned, um--

106
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,855
- Everybody came to play,

107
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,724
The variety show was,
I thought, amazing,

108
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,858
- Yeah,

109
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,326
- I had no idea who was
gonna be in the bottom,

110
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,863
- I thought about it
and actually there were

111
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,701
other people that didn't
show as much talent,

112
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,104
- Do you have any opinions,
if you want to share them?

113
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,173
- Milk,

114
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,441
- Oh, she done shook
the table, honey,

115
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,044
[laughs]

116
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,348
- I just felt like it really
wasn't much talent there

117
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,584
besides that it was
your original song,

118
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,286
- Oh, God,

119
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,622
My performance was killer,
and the original song

120
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:27,194
is gonna become a bigger hit
than "Supermodel,"

121
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:31,932
I thought I had a wonderful
mix of talents in there,

122
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,202
- Milk, your talent
can't be Velcro,

123
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,104
- I would've loved to come on
and skate for all y'all,

124
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,807
but ice is hard to come by,

125
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,944
[sirens]
- Whoa!

126
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,680
- She done already
done had hers,

127
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,681
- Hey, All Stars,

128
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,015
- Hi!
- Hey!

129
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,752
- My first name ain't Baby,
so call me Miss Ross

130
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:58,024
and get a new attitude
'cause a she-ro lies in you,

131
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,261
Y'all come back now, you hear?

132
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,029
[laughing]

133
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,464
- Oh, my God,

134
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,167
- Hello, hello, hello, ladies,

135
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,636
- Hi!

136
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:13,139
- All Stars, I have
some exciting news,

137
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,641
- Oh!

138
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:20,247
- For one night only, we're
bringing back some classic TV

139
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:25,118
as we throw our
very own "VH1 Divas Live",

140
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,922
[cheering]

141
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:34,094
- And this year, get this,
it's a salute to Mama Ru,

142
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:37,030
[cheering]

143
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,765
- I mean, it's really
just an honor

144
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,800
to be nominated by yourself,

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,335
[laughing]

146
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,171
- You'll be performing
some of my greatest hits

147
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,075
in a lip sync extravaganza,

148
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,310
- Whoo!

149
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,281
- Each of you will portray
a different iconic diva,

150
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:58,051
So, Milk,
you'll be Celine Dion,

151
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,720
- Yes!

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,523
- Kennedy,
you'll be Janet Jackson,

153
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,091
- Oh!

154
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,060
- Come on, Janet,

155
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,664
- Aja, you'll be
Amy Winehouse,

156
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,198
- Yes!

157
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,168
- Chi Chi, you'll be
Miss Patti LaBelle,

158
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,103
- Ooh!

159
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,806
- Trixie, you'll
be Dolly Parton,

160
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,608
- Oh!

161
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,143
- Stretch, what a stretch,

162
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,946
- Shangela, you'll be
the elusive chanteuse--

163
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,715
- Oh, yes,
- Mariah Carey,

164
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,150
- Darling,
Darling,

165
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,651
[laughs]

166
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:35,522
- Thorgy, you shall
be Stevie Nicks,

167
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,057
- Yes!

168
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,025
- Thorgy,
- Go on, Witchy Woman,

169
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:43,496
- BenDeLaCreme,
you'll be Dame Julie Andrews,

170
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,732
- Oh, yes,

171
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:49,169
- And last but not least BeBe,
you shall be

172
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,970
Miss Diana Ross,

173
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,506
- All right, Mother,

174
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,742
- #AllStars3,

175
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,511
Ladies, in a moment,
you'll be rehearsing

176
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,781
with the ridiculously
talented Todrick Hall,

177
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,851
[cheering]

178
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,121
- And tomorrow on
the main stage, we'll be joined

179
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,824
by one of my all time
favorite divas,,,

180
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,494
Vanessa Williams,

181
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,296
[cheering]

182
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,797
- Oh, my God,

183
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,034
- All right, Mother,
all right,

184
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,838
- And for this week's runway,
the category is Ru-demption,

185
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,208
We're giving you
a chance to do over

186
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:32,479
your most infamous Drag Race
fashion fails,

187
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,780
- Oh,

188
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,816
- I've got a lot of those,
- Uh-huh,

189
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,920
- Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best All Star win,

190
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,790
- Thank you!
- Love you, Mother,

191
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,725
- Ladies and gentlemen,

192
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,397
welcome to "VH1 Divas Live",

193
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,565
- There's different levels of
lip sync artistry in the room,

194
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,200
Some people are
professional lip syncers,

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,037
- ? I don't care
if people stare ?

196
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,074
- Some people can actually
do their character better,

197
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,478
So it's hard to say
what's really gonna happen,

198
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,548
- All of these sections really
give us a huge chance to shine,

199
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,016
- Yeah,

200
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,419
- Like the cards aren't stacked
by what we have been given,

201
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,954
- Well, I feel like
everybody's diva

202
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,990
is a representative of
a little bit of them,

203
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,192
- Stevie Nicks could not be
more perfect for me,

204
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,395
however, when have you ever
seen Stevie Nicks do something

205
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,665
where some gay is in
the front row of her show

206
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,333
going like, "Work, Stevie,
You better fucking work!"

207
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,737
No, That's not Stevie,

208
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,505
I'm lucky that
I have less lyrics,

209
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,842
however, I think mine
was less funny,

210
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,677
It's really not fair,

211
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,679
There is no way,
because I'm Stevie,

212
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,980
I'm ever gonna win this,

213
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,282
And I come right after you,

214
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,885
and you literally are
set up to just win,

215
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,754
- Oh, no,
- Just face it, girl,

216
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,755
- Mine--let me tell you--no,
- All right,

217
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,089
- Let me tell you though,

218
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,291
- If you're gonna
argue that, you're crazy,

219
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,493
- I could take Amy Winehouse--
- Oh, I know,

220
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,028
- Dolly, and
make them all funny,

221
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,163
- I'm trying not to be like
a conspiracy theorist

222
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,332
because that's what
I was in Season 8,

223
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,903
It's just hard because I feel
like I'm being set up to fail,

224
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,538
- I love my part,
- Okay,

225
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:11,144
- When it comes to impersonating
Celine, I am feeling good,

226
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,646
These other girls will have
a tough act to follow,

227
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,081
- What are you wearing?

228
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,751
- I'm wearing her Met Gala
outfit from this past year,

229
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,353
which is like a
silver leotard

230
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,689
with like a Versace dress
over top of it,

231
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,990
- Do you think everybody's
gonna recognize that?

232
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,991
Like I don't know how
iconic that was

233
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,192
because I didn't pay attention,

234
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,193
- I--I can't think of
anything she wears

235
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,528
except that backward suit,

236
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,797
- The reason I want to choose
the Met Gala thing was

237
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,434
because this year her
fashion star is on the rise,

238
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,837
- Girl, nobody knows what
Celine wore to the Met Gala,

239
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,172
That's such a weird choice,

240
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,974
A really weird choice,

241
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,676
- I did this one event where
I performed Celine in front of--

242
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,278
- Oh, you've done Celine before?

243
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,847
- Yeah, In front of the guy

244
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,783
that was the event planner
for her wedding,

245
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,952
And so as soon as he saw
me perform it, he was like,

246
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,021
"Oh, my God, that
is the best Celine,"

247
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,923
- Well, good luck, because
I think Ariana Grande

248
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,126
does the best Celine, but
you can be a close second,

249
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,594
Ahh!

250
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,063
Honey, the big and Milky,
she is mighty confident, Mama,

251
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,432
because the friend of a friend
of a friend who was a friend

252
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,635
of a friend of a friend
of Celine's had told her

253
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,203
it was lovely, girl,

254
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,039
Oh, she's about to throw the
diamond into the ocean, honey,

255
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,342
She's about to give it to y'all,
Well, all right,

256
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,477
- Coming up,,,

257
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,679
- Five, six, Kennedy,
where you at?

258
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,980
- I got lost,

259
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,018
- Shangela is pissing me off,
pissing Todrick off,

260
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,320
practically
pissing off everyone,

261
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,755
- Ah!

262
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,890
Okay,

263
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,994
[RuPaul laughing]

264
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,831
- Hi,
- Hello,

265
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,300
- Hi!

266
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,536
- Our maxi challenge this week
is to perform in our very own

267
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,106
version of "VH1's Divas Live",

268
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,243
It's time to rehearse
with Todrick Hall,

269
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,545
I hope the other girls
are ready, 'cause I am,

270
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,414
- How y'all doing?
- Good,

271
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:58,585
- We about to bring it with the
diva's--oh, Lord, here we go,

272
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,955
[laughter]

273
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,656
- She's already
in full character,

274
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,695
- Bitch, excuse me?

275
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:09,896
Are you ready?

276
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,633
- I'm sorry, darling,

277
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,835
I'm a method actress, okay?

278
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,570
I'm giving y'all

279
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,273
very Meryl Streep
in this moment,

280
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,979
- This is the "Divas" episode,
and you guys are gonna be

281
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,914
impersonating some of the
most iconic,

282
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,983
legendary performers
of all time,

283
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,851
so we definitely want
to represent them well,

284
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,952
Are you guys ready?

285
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,320
- Yes,
- Okay,

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,788
Well, we're gonna
start with Kennedy,

287
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,023
and everybody else
please have a seat,

288
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,293
Okay, You're gonna go
five, four, three,

289
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,629
you just bend
your leg, two, walk,

290
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,798
Five, four, three, two,

291
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,533
- Do I step my leg back out?

292
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,768
- Yeah, let me see it,

293
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,737
Five, six, seven, eight,

294
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:54,340
And five, four, three,,,

295
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,477
- Kennedy Davenport is known
for being a fierce queen

296
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,278
that can dance the house down,

297
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,214
but right now
the house is still up,

298
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,016
No chance of it
even shattering,

299
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,851
Don't need insurance because
it's not gonna come down,

300
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,453
And da, da, three, four,
and five,

301
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,322
Okay,

302
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,590
Are you gonna be able
to get that?

303
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,824
- I'll get it,

304
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,726
You have to understand
I am a dancer,

305
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,294
but I freestyle everything,

306
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,531
I don't choreograph anything, so
it's just tough on me right now,

307
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,868
- Can we move on?
- Yeah,

308
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,136
- Let's go slow,

309
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,171
Five, six, seven, eight,

310
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,140
And one, two, three, four--
- I'm lost,

311
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,375
- Kennedy, where you at?
- I got lost,

312
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,210
- Is this gonna be
too complicated?

313
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,147
- I mean, I can get it, but
I'm having trouble right now,

314
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,916
- Are you telling me
you're giving up already?

315
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,685
- Well, don't ask me--
I'm gonna give you my honest--

316
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,019
give you my honest answer,

317
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,821
- I just wanted--I--I want
you to say "Yes, I can get it,"

318
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,256
- I can get it,
- Okay,

319
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,791
- Right now it's
not registering,

320
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,626
- Okay,
Tomorrow, no matter what,

321
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,661
you can't let your back-up
dancers upstage you,

322
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,830
- 'Cause I'm coming
for you back here, baby,

323
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,632
- Ooh!

324
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,434
- We'll be ready,

325
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,035
Okay, Thorgy Thor,

326
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,403
- I want to win
a challenge

327
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,539
'cause I never won one
on Season 8,

328
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,841
Fuck you, Bob,

329
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,810
- I am not gonna give you
that much choreography,

330
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,977
We're gonna collaborate,

331
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,412
So I want to know
if there are any things

332
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,948
that you specifically want to do
or that you had in mind to do?

333
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,483
- Sure,

334
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,786
? Tell me one thing, do you
like where you're going ?

335
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,290
? I said who do you think
you are? ?

336
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,025
- Okay,

337
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,561
Um, who is Stevie Nicks
to you?

338
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,897
- Stevie Nicks is one of
my biggest inspirational divas

339
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,032
throughout my entire life,

340
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,467
I love her,
I love her,

341
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,235
The stereotype is
that she's this witch,

342
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,803
but she actually
is not a witch,

343
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,371
She's just an eccentric Gemini,

344
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,742
- Girl, if you're gonna bring
it, you have to bring it,

345
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,811
With the rumor that Stevie's
a witch, you can do so much,

346
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,514
Like, bitch, I would've came
out with a pot, a broom,

347
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,950
I would've came out like,
with a--with a wand,

348
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,618
like whoo! Whoo!

349
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,920
- So I think we
should incorporate

350
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,655
some of the stuff that
you're naturally doing

351
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,690
and make it choreography,

352
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,325
So when it gets
to the chorus, can you,

353
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:55,595
like, lean this way
a little bit?

354
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:59,499
- She's not a very, like,
active, acrobatic, you know,

355
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:00,967
- Person, yeah,
I just wanna see--

356
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,468
- She's just so strong,

357
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,669
There's usually a wind machine
underneath her or something,

358
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,404
- Yeah, We gave our
wind machine to Beyonce,

359
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,405
so we're not gonna
have that today,

360
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,740
- Oops,

361
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,842
- But we will pretend that
the wind machine is here,

362
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,678
Thorgy is such a Stevie Nicks
purist that he kept saying,

363
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,213
"Stevie Nicks doesn't
really do this,

364
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,715
She doesn't really dance,"

365
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,518
And I think that's great to
know your character so well,

366
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:22,255
but what can you do to make
a drag version of Stevie Nicks?

367
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,223
- She's at a microphone
and she's--

368
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,092
it's all internal and like,,,
- Yeah,

369
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,894
But I think that it's a kind
of a touchy situation,

370
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:31,164
because I don't want you
to get lost in the shuffle,

371
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,600
- Stevie Nicks is difficult
to do because

372
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,737
next to divas like Diana Ross
and Patti LaBelle

373
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,305
and Janet Jackson,

374
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,774
she is not like, work,
you know what I mean?

375
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,776
It just doesn't feel fair,

376
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,682
Because it's gonna seem a
little too subdued, right?

377
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,485
- What, you mean, like levels?
What are you doing--

378
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,954
- When I'm spinning
like, I don't--

379
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,790
It's incredibly important
to stand out amongst

380
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,159
all these girls because
we're all so talented,

381
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,029
but how do you stand out
performing as Stevie Nicks?

382
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,630
That's my problem,

383
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,567
- All right, Let's bring up
Ms, Mariah Carey,

384
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,269
- She is on another level today,
Oh, my God,

385
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,440
Shangela doing her whole
Mariah fantasy,,,

386
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,810
Girl, she's pissing me off,
she's pissing Todrick off,

387
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,445
practically
pissing off everyone,

388
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,647
- Ah!

389
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,250
Okay,

390
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,153
Jealousy is a killer
in this industry, Mama,

391
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,955
- Let's play the music--
- Okay,

392
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,122
- --and hear what
Mariah's gonna do,

393
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,657
- Is it in my ear?
Hold on, baby,

394
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,725
- Oh, Lord,

395
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,295
- Ew,
I cannot--I cannot with this,

396
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,898
- Oh, my God, the girls
are so hateful this season,

397
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,033
Why they so hateful?

398
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,869
[laughs]
- Okay, I'm ready,

399
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,237
- The girls are shading me,

400
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,505
They're like, oh, she really
thinks she is the diva,

401
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,308
And some are joking,
but some are serious,

402
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,344
- You're gonna cover her up
with the fans,

403
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,679
- Okay,
- So everybody take a fan,

404
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,714
- Oh!
- Whoo!

405
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,082
- Sister,

406
00:16:56,082 --> 00:17:00,219
Oh, girl, the big and
Milky, honey, oh, girl,

407
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,555
She's throwing shade and
then she plays it off

408
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,490
that she's just trying to be
loose and fun with the girls,

409
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,392
She's not being loose and fun,

410
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,462
Honey, she thinks she's better
than everyone in this room,

411
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,030
- And then she's
gonna walk forward,

412
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,199
I'm not gonna be here
to hold your hand,

413
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,934
- I'm sorry,
I saw the hand,

414
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,002
- You might have to walk
on your own,

415
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,703
- I'm sorry,
I saw the hand,

416
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,774
- Shangela, step down from your
high horse and just chill,

417
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,911
- All right, Ms, Ross?

418
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,480
- Yes,
- It's your time, darling,

419
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,948
- Thank you,

420
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:32,118
- I don't want to pressure you,
but you do know that Diana Ross

421
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,553
is RuPaul's, like,
diva of all time?

422
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,191
This is a very Bianca Del Rio/
Judge Judy situation--

423
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,027
- I know,
- --but to the umpteenth power,

424
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,828
You understand that?
- Yeah,

425
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,664
- And if you don't
fully embody Diana Ross,

426
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,932
he's gonna for sure know,

427
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,734
- Okay, Todrick, just keep
adding that pressure on,

428
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,539
No, no, no,
I really--I feel--I'm excited,

429
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,144
I'm excited that I get
to play the real diva,

430
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,145
- Just show me
what you would do,

431
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,580
Just take the stage, own it,

432
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,390
- BeBe does nothing,
Nothing,

433
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,094
Just walks out as Diana Ross,
but that's what BeBe does,

434
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,163
It's who BeBe is,

435
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,765
Okay, Okay,

436
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:25,438
- Diana is known to steal
the party, steal the show,

437
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,341
and this show
was far from stolen,

438
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,179
- That's great,
I love it,

439
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,650
So we're gonna do
you, BenDeLaCreme,

440
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,852
This is the thing,
the juxtaposition of you

441
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,655
rapping this as Julie Andrews
is what makes this funny,

442
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,157
so it has to be
a mixture of swag

443
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,759
and then some
pixie dust, okay?

444
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,628
Like, dun da da,
body like boom,

445
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,965
- Like that kind of thing?

446
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,834
- But with a little bit
more swag juice in it, okay?

447
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,068
- Okay,

448
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,436
- So you're gonna take
three steps, one--

449
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,804
- One, two, three,

450
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,539
- One, two, three, and four,
and you're gonna touch

451
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,975
your vagina with
one hand at a time,

452
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,543
- On four,
- Yeah,

453
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,579
Can I see you all do that?
Three and four,

454
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,015
And you gotta make
sure you go three and four,

455
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,351
Two, three--
- Okay, sorry,

456
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,687
- DeLa, there's a
lot of footwork going on

457
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,689
that is not the footwork
that we need,

458
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,626
I'm very, very worried,
Can she handle it?

459
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,695
I don't damn know,

460
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,797
I know you're coming off of
a good win, but I can't express

461
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:27,333
to you enough that it has to,
has to, has to be, like,

462
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,969
swag, it has to be the lyrics,
it has to be still in character,

463
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,203
- I totally hear that,

464
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,106
- If you slip up
one step, you're fucked,

465
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,441
- Yeah,

466
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:38,110
Todrick stares straight into
your soul

467
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,913
with those crazy,
honey-colored eyes,

468
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,649
and finds whatever you're
most insecure about,

469
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,284
and is like, don't do it,

470
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,887
He is terrifying,

471
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,796
- Okay, Chi Chi DeVayne,

472
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,531
And we're also gonna
have Dolly Parton

473
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,900
and Celine Dion in this part,

474
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,602
- Okay,

475
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,738
Todrick is randomly
choosing divas

476
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,540
to be part of other
divas' solo numbers,

477
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,974
and I noticed that
he wasn't choosing me,

478
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,377
- And BeBe should be in this,

479
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,380
- So I was like, this is
my chance to stand out,

480
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,183
- Shangela should be in this,
and Kennedy should be in it,

481
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,484
- Todrick?
- Yes,

482
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:19,985
- I haven't been
part of anything,

483
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,554
I feel like I'm the only one
who hasn't done anything,

484
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,055
- Come,

485
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,791
- I will seize the day in order
to kick everyone's ass and win,

486
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,226
- Thank you,
I--I love that,

487
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,395
Sure,

488
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,665
- I can tell that Thorgy really
wants to try and do more,

489
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,801
but I'm thinking she should
be focusing more on making

490
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,670
her character bigger,
not necessarily

491
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,672
in being in so
many people's numbers,

492
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:43,909
- One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, and pose,

493
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,644
Okay,
We can move on to the next girl,

494
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,079
Can I have Trixie?

495
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,348
- Thanks for including me,

496
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,016
- Honestly, I think
the competition

497
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,385
sometimes becomes
too much for Thorgy,

498
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,355
because she really compares
herself to other people,

499
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,624
and then she starts
to pick apart herself,

500
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,729
- Mamacita is in her head,

501
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,830
Good luck, sis,

502
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,366
- [RuPaul] Coming up,,,

503
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,567
- Watching yourself,
you see things

504
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,903
about yourself that you
may not have realized,

505
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,138
- Yeah, girl,

506
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,706
I didn't know I had
a resting bitch face,

507
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,542
- What?
- [laughs]

508
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,612
- You're gonna get
two good double blinks,

509
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,147
[laughs]

510
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,717
[RuPaul laughing]

511
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,854
- Whoo!

512
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:34,727
- We are here, Oh!

513
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,429
- Come on, divas,
- Good morning, everybody,

514
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,633
- This week's runway
is Ru-demption, where we get

515
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:44,837
to remake our worst fashion
faux pas,

516
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,005
and this is gonna be
really interesting

517
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,339
because a lot of these
girls have had some

518
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,775
real ugly fashions,
including myself,

519
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,778
Shangela,
- Yes, baby,

520
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,913
- How you feeling, boo?

521
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:55,114
- You know what?

522
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,115
I'm less concerned
about the divas thing,

523
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,383
- Uh-huh,

524
00:21:57,383 --> 00:22:00,786
- And more concerned about
the Ru-demption look,

525
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:05,925
because not only is this a look
that I failed at last time,

526
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:10,563
but also, Vanessa Williams was
the judge on the episode I got--

527
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,031
- Gag!
- Yeah,

528
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,566
When--of the fail
that I'm doing today,

529
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,534
- So, if you [bleep] up,
she's gonna--

530
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,535
- Twice in front
of Ms, Vanessa,

531
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,803
- She's gonna see it,

532
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,039
- I was actually a little
disappointed at first

533
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,075
because your number
and Kennedy's number

534
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,378
and Ben's number and
Chi Chi's number--

535
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:27,813
- Everybody's number?

536
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,015
- --all are, like, super high
energy numbers, and I love--

537
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,250
- Do you think my number
is high energy?

538
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,484
- Girl, you're doing
Amy Winehouse,

539
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,786
You have dancers,
you have two backup dancers,

540
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,288
I live for backup dancers,

541
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,389
- You know, we did
a similar challenge

542
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,857
like this on my season,

543
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,327
We did Glamazonian Airways,
which was a lip sync challenge,

544
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,829
and I did fine then and
wasn't scared,

545
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,898
but there was also like twice
the number of people here,

546
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,032
so I think that
was part of it,

547
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,300
- Well, was the dancing
as intense?

548
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,537
- God, no,
- This dance is--

549
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,638
- Bananas,

550
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:53,973
- I mean, I wasn't here
for All Stars 2,

551
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,508
but I feel like this dance
seems to me like

552
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,477
the most intense dance that
has been on this competition,

553
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,645
- Oh, my God,
- Yeah,

554
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,080
- I feel like
the Herstory of the World,

555
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,481
they were like truly
lip syncing,

556
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,117
This is like choreography,
- Yeah,

557
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,252
- Do you think they're
gonna be looking

558
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,721
for a full transformation
into the diva?

559
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,222
- Absolutely,
- I think yes,

560
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,757
I think they're looking
for likeness big time,

561
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,259
- Really?
- Absolutely,

562
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,494
Do you remember last season
when they clocked Katya's wig

563
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,330
for not being perfectly
Diana's iconic hair?

564
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,331
- Yeah,

565
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,399
- He went home that episode,

566
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,737
- Trixie, how do you
think you came off

567
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,305
on your season, because--

568
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:27,973
- I came off as
pretty talentless,

569
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,142
- I disagree,
- I think it's pretty fair,

570
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,911
I never won any challenges,
and I went home twice,

571
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,649
- Shangela, how do you think you
were perceived on your season?

572
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,217
- It was mixed,

573
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,552
I mean, honestly, I would meet
people and they would be like,

574
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,621
"Oh, my God, I love you,
and during your season

575
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,924
"my boyfriend hated you,
but it's so nice to meet you

576
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,793
in person because now
we both love you,"

577
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,496
And I'm like, "thank you,"
- I get the same thing,

578
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:55,000
It's like being thrown in a room
with people that you don't know,

579
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,302
- Mm-hmm,

580
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,403
- Somebody's gonna
get on your nerves,

581
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,871
- Yes,

582
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,974
- And then on top of that,
I'm very vocal about my feelings

583
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,442
and how I feel about
a lot of things,

584
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,843
- Yeah,

585
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,979
But I take you different because
I know you and I know, like,

586
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,214
that's a southern way of drag,

587
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,250
Like, the girls get you
together in the room,

588
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,688
Kennedy and I go way back, and
she is straight up not edited,

589
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,423
not filtered, not watered down,

590
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,158
and those lips are
gonna be pressed together

591
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:20,459
and the eyes are
gonna be clocked,

592
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,428
and you're gonna get
two good double blinks,

593
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,065
I think that also watching
yourself--

594
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,066
- Yeah,

595
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,233
- --you see things
about yourself

596
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,336
that you may not have realized,
- Yeah, girl,

597
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,204
I didn't know I had
a resting bitch face,

598
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,373
- You didn't know?
- No, I did not,

599
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,908
- She didn't know,
Y'all, she didn't know,

600
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:39,178
- And I was like, bitch,
I was not even looking like--

601
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:43,048
like that at that time,
but I guess I was,

602
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:44,883
- Kennedy's just like
a grumpy old man,

603
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,686
She's like a grandpa, like
a grandpa who, you know,

604
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:50,923
can't hear well,
and is just kind of angry,

605
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,424
but is just your grandpa,

606
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,927
It's your grandpa in a wig,

607
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,962
- How do you guys think
I came off on my season?

608
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,998
- I thought you came off
like quirky, friendly, fun,

609
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,500
- That's exactly who I am,

610
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,636
- I did think you were,
like, jealous of Bob,

611
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,806
- I was the first person to say
he is the funniest person alive,

612
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,408
- You were always like,
"It's the Bob show,"

613
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,110
- It's the Bob Show,
- You know what I mean?

614
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,277
Yeah,
- Every second,

615
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,345
There was just no room
for anybody else

616
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,780
because his personality
was so big,

617
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,682
That's what I was so, like,
eye roll about, you know?

618
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,683
- Yeah,

619
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,119
- With that said,
I hope he dies,

620
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,455
I probably was competitive
with Bob in my mind only,

621
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,424
which is what Bob
kept telling me, like,

622
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,126
"Girl, why you
comparing yourself to me?

623
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,627
Like, I'm not trying
to come for you,"

624
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:32,064
I'm like, "I know,
but I'm just as good as you,"

625
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,299
I was just so, like,
always in my head,

626
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,168
This is my thing,
It's who I am,

627
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,203
- You was like one of
my top picks,

628
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,006
I was like, damn,
I mean, she is so good,

629
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,341
- Thank you,

630
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:46,078
- But I also felt that you
just was like so defeated,

631
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,547
- Like within my own self?
- Yes,

632
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,682
- I feel like I'm much more
talented and much better

633
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,051
than people give me credit for,
and I'm always talked over,

634
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,721
- Why do you feel like
people over talk you?

635
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,322
I want to make sure I'm
not doing that to you

636
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,891
because I would hate
to make you feel like--

637
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,693
- Girl, tell her ass
to shut up, you're talking,

638
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,028
- I--I just don't--

639
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,062
- Please do that
to Kennedy

640
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,564
because she over talks
everybody,

641
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,199
- No, I over talk you,
- What?

642
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,767
- I over talk you,

643
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,035
- You should be
the last one to talk,

644
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,336
Shangela, you talk
so goddamn much,

645
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,771
- I do,

646
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,610
- [RuPaul] Coming up,,,

647
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,448
- ? Divas VH1

648
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:25,751
- ? VH1

649
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,420
- It was like
the wonderful

650
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,690
and quizzical blend of
confusion and confidence,

651
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,425
[laughing]

652
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,228
[RuPaul laughing]

653
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,402
- ? Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ?

654
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,943
? Cover girl, put the bass
in your walk ?

655
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:54,613
? Head to toe, let
your whole body talk ?

656
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,081
? Cover girl

657
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,588
- Welcome to the main stage of
"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars",

658
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:05,591
When it comes to divas,
she wrote the book,

659
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:07,626
Michelle Visage,

660
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,161
- What? Oh, this?

661
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,829
[laughs]

662
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,231
- Go on,

663
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,966
- I really wish I could read,

664
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,734
[laughing]

665
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,203
- Style superstar,
Carson Kressley,

666
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,673
Are you ready for some
All Star Enter-taint-ment?

667
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,476
- Oh, yeah, I thought I
recognized that smell, Ru,

668
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,811
[laughs]

669
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,347
And the incredible Todrick Hall,

670
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:30,415
Did my divas wipe you out?

671
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,451
- Oh, girl, I can go all night,

672
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:34,753
- Ooh, okay,

673
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,723
And the forever soul of VH1,

674
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:40,792
my queen, Vanessa Williams,

675
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,694
Now, what made you come back?

676
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,830
- I can't get enough
of divaliciousness,

677
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,999
[laughs]

678
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,369
- This week we challenged our
All Stars to serve

679
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,840
diva performances in
a lip sync extravaganza,

680
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,742
and on the catwalk,

681
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,511
category
is Ru-demption Runway,

682
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,649
a chance for my girls to do

683
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:08,220
Gentlemen, start your engine,
and may the best All Star win,

684
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,526
Michelle, I had no idea
they were honoring me,

685
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,194
- I mean, of course,
Who else would they be honoring?

686
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,563
- Okay, shut up,
Here they are,

687
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:25,771

688
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,476

this for you,

689
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,846
- ? They're all coming back

690
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:40,085

00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,370
Ru, I bet it all on black,

730
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,372
- Why it gotta be black?

731
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,741
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Patti LaBelle,

732
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,111
[RuPaul laughing]

733
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,117
- ? Hey, there girl,
walk away ?

734
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:55,654
? I lose my inhibitions
when you spin ?

00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,824
? I don't care
if people stare ?

736
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:01,960
? I brought my booty
and I'm trying to fit in ?

737
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,864
? Don't be jealous of my booty,
jealous of my booty ?

738
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,568
? You can say that you were not
but I always see you looking ?

739
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,738
? Don't be jealous of my booty,

Ladies and gentlemen,
Dolly Parton,

743
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,985
- Well, howdy, Ru,

744
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,288
It takes a lot of money to look
that cheap, and I should know,

745
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,924
? Give me one shot

746
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:37,162
? One shot of adrenaline

747
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:39,097
? Whoo

748
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:43,201
And to the ones I love, know
that y'all are the reason why,

749
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:47,506
I dare to live my life,
dare to liberate my mind,

750
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,475
? You're running
through my veins ?

751
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,545
? Make me come alive

752
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,714
? One, two, three

753
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:59,184

? Adrenaline

755
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,822

759
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,931
Whoo!

760
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,967
Can I get it to go, Ru?

761
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mariah Carey,

762
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,205

- Happy New Year, everybody,

764
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,575
[laughs]

765
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:27,445
- You made this song number one,

766
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,683
Can I get more of me?

767
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,853
I guess we're going over here,

768
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,122
[singing]

769
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,690
Nope,

770
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,059
Someone's getting fired,

771
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,931
Let's let the audience
sing along,

772
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,066
You sound good,

773
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:54,472
Cut the track,

774
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,441
RuPaul, I think you know
to get it right

775
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:00,212
sometimes a diva has
to do things on her own,

776
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:10,355
? I love you

777
00:33:11,857 --> 00:33:13,925
Ta-da,

? Always looking but you
never find, never find ?

782

00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,491
? I'll tell you
the truth now ?

787
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:50,028
? All born naked and
the rest is drag ?

788
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,830

- Whoo!

842
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,077
- [RuPaul] Coming up,,,

843
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,512

846
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,251
- Ooh, is that a read?

847
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,489
[RuPaul laughing]

848
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,391
? Sexy sexy drag queen

Crazy, sexy, cool, Season 6,

851
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:42,600
- [Carson] Apparently
it's skim Milk,

852
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,302
- [RuPaul] Yes,

853
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,304
- [Milk] With the original,
the judges wanted

854
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,872
to see glamorous Milk,

855
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,009
and so I want to shove it
in the judges' face,

856
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,844
what they thought
I could never do,

857

- [RuPaul] I think she's pinning

858
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:57,382
all of her hopes
on this outfit,

859
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,583
Aja,
Fairy tale princess disaster,

860
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,655
Season 9, and this is the remix,
- [Michelle] Ahh,

861
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:07,258
- [RuPaul] You're beautiful,

862
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,195
- [Aja] This look is probably
where I felt the ugliest

863
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:11,863
and the lowest on Season 9,

864
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:15,467
and that's when the Aja
transformation truly began,

865
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,769
- [RuPaul]
Finally some disaster relief,

866
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,071
Thank you, FEMA,

867
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,773
Chi Chi DeVayne,

868
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:24,209
Neon realness, Season 8,

869
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,111
- [Carson]
It's a Janet Jackson Pollack,

870
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:28,179
[laughing]

871
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,448
- [Chi Chi] I got so many
harsh critiques about

872
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,485
not wearing pads or boobs,

873
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:37,055
so I got to show Michelle that
I can suck my waist in

874
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,425
and wear big boobs
and do all that too,

875
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,793
- [Todrick]
Why it gotta be black light?

876
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,198
Why it gotta be black light?
I love it,

877
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,700
- [RuPaul] Trixie Mattel,

878
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,872
The ugliest dress ever,
Season 7, and this is the remix,

879
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,673
- Whatever happened
to Baby Jane?

880
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,275
That looks like one of hers,

881
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,409
- [Trixie] I know
I'm nailing it because

882
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,444
Vanessa Williams is like,,,

883
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,047
I don't even know if she knows
that I'm redoing an ugly dress,

884
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,649
So she probably thinks
I'm supposed to be gorgeous,

885
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,584
and she's like "sure,

886
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,220
you're really painting with
all the colors of the wind,"

887
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,022
- [RuPaul] You know, this outfit
reminds me I have pots

888
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,791
in the sink
I need to scrub,

889
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,228
Kennedy,
Death becomes her, Season 7,

890
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,997
Oh, honey, rigor mortis
done set in,

891
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,798
- Yes,
- Ooh,

892
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,235
- What?
Uh-oh, oh!

893
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,471
- [Carson] You know, she's
always so hot and cold with me,

894
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,072
- [Vanessa] She is!

895
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,941
- [Kennedy] So it's the
same story from Season 7,

896
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,110
a night after hooking,

897
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,078
Tre threw me in the fire,
but in the process,

898
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,947
I was crystallized,

899
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,717
- [Carson] You know, if you
can't beat them--

900
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,653
- [Michelle] Stone them,
- [Carson] Stone them,

901
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:42,987
[laughs]

902
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:47,358
- [RuPaul] Thorgy Thor,
Neon queen realness, Season 8,

903
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,694
- [Vanessa] All of a sudden
I'm craving a salad,

904
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,795
[laughs]

905
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,597
- [Thorgy] I live for
what I wore,

906
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:54,199
but I feel like that
was the child,

907
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,100
and this is like the mother,

908
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,902
- [Carson] I've heard of hammer
toe, but never hammer head,

909
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:58,903
- Yes,

910
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,205
[laughing]

911
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:03,474
- [RuPaul] Reclaiming my lime,
Reclaiming my lime,

912
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,610
BenDeLaCreme,

913
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,246
Dripping in jewels, Season 6,

914
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:11,249
Oh, my God,
it's Jewelry Andrews,

915
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,884
[laughing]

916
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:16,254
- [BenDeLaCreme] I feel
stunning in this outfit,

917
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,556
Anybody who says that
I am not currently

918
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:22,794
dripping in jewels is
just a flat-out liar,

919
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,197
- [Vanessa] Does the rug match
the beaded curtain?

920
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,333
- [Carson] That's what you
call vajazzled,

921
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,867
- Yes!

922
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,502
- [RuPaul] BeBe Zahara Benet,

923
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,738
Season 1 entrance look,

924
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,906
- [Todrick] Ooh!

925
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,641
- [Michelle] I love a power
bottom suit,

926
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,610
- Yes,

927
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:42,814
- [BeBe] Season 1 I was giving
you very secretary, honey,

928
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,415
But now, she actually owns
the company,

929
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:48,119
Very Wilhelmina Slater,
very that,

930
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,623
- [RuPaul] She serves at
the President's pleather,

931
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,725
[laughing]

932
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,528
- Oh, my God,
Shangela,

933
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,465
Christmas eleganza, Season 3,

934
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,433
Wow,
- Fantastic,

935
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,202
- [Shangela] First of all,
Ms, Vanessa ain't aged

936
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,271
or moved since Season 3,

937
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:09,874
Numero dos, to see the smile,
is just total validation

938
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,376
for this moment,

939
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,679
- [Carson] We're gonna get you
out of there, Shangela, hold on,

940
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,180
[laughs]

941
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,548
- [RuPaul]
Shangela, if you can hear me,

942
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,551
there's only 30 more seconds of
oxygen left in there,

943
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,787
- Good luck!

944
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:23,788
- [RuPaul] Coming up,,,

945
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,423
- She could have worked
a little harder,

946
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,659
- It's a tiny bit basic,

947
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,294
- You didn't know the words,

948
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:30,828
If you did,
then you missed them,

949
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,433
[RuPaul laughing]

950
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,336
- Welcome, ladies,

951
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:42,607
Based on your performance
in the lip sync extravaganza,

952
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,743
and your Ru-demption
Runway look,

953
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,979
I've made some decisions,

954
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,516
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward,

955
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:56,321
Shangela, BenDeLaCreme,

956
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,989
BeBe Zahara Benet,

957
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:02,260
You are the top three this week,

958
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,429
- All right,

959
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:11,669
- Chi Chi DeVayne,
Thorgy Thor,

960
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,638
Kennedy Davenport,

961
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,710
You are the bottom
three of the week,

962
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:26,651
Aja, Milk, Trixie Mattel,

963
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,985
you are safe,

964
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,457
Please step to
the back of the stage,

965
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:49,273
- Now it's time for
the Judges' critiques,

966
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,209
starting with Kennedy,

967
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:52,577
- I liked the runway look,

968
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,680
I loved the covered face,
and then this look, the makeup,

969
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,483
the contact lenses, the white
lip, I think it's really fun,

970
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,451
- But I'm afraid
with your performance,

971
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,053
you didn't know the words,

972
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,055
And if you did,
then you missed them,

973
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,057
And I didn't get any
Janet Jackson,

974
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,692
I got all Kennedy,

975
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,194
- I wasn't getting it in
the moves, I wasn't getting it

976
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,863
in the makeup, I wasn't
getting it in the wig,

977
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,632
- I do know Sean Cheeseman
who did the original "Control"

978
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,702
and "Rhythm Nation," 'cause
he left me to do Janet, so--

979
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,103
[laughing]

980
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,473
- Janet is a very specific kind
of move, very kind of staccato,

981
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,175
You could've worked
a little harder

982
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,778
in terms of making
it really crisp,

983
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:28,179
- With that being said,
I gave you

984
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:30,681
the most difficult choreography
out of everybody that was here,

985
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,151
and that should
be accounted for,

986
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,186
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne,

987
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,754
- When I first saw
you come out,

988
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,524
I knew instantly that
you were Patti LaBelle,

989
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,026
- Chi Chi, I was sold
on your Patti,

990
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,162
You got the flicks,
which is very Patti,

991
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:47,298
- And tonight on the runway
you have your neon challenge,

992
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:49,133
- Mm-hmm,
- Which for you and I, we--

993
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,736
- Yeah,
- Yes,

994
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,371
And you look
beautiful tonight,

995
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:54,972
I don't think you need
that coat though,

996
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,441
Yes, girl, look,

997
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,242
We get to see
your shape, beautiful,

998
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,111
- But it's a tiny bit basic,

999
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,213
Like, even with the hair,
the makeup,

1000
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,514
like, it just needs
a little tweak,

1001
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:06,551
- Can I just say, I just
loved you in "Eraser",

1002
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,718
- Oh, wow,

1003
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,954
- Oh, my God,
- Thank you,

1004
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,090
- "Eraser", baby,
"Eraser",

1005
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,525
- Next up, Shangela,

1006
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,794
- I love this look,

1007
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,063
The original look was
like Beyonce when she was

1008
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:21,966
in Destiny's Child and sometimes
wore questionable outfits,

1009
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,735
And then when she was Beyonce,
that's you right now,

1010
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:25,970
You're slaying,

1011
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,006
And I love that you
captured the Mariah

1012
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,275
that we know and love,
which is a wonderful

1013
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,512
and quizzical blend of
confusion and confidence,

1014
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:36,414
[laughing]

1015
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:39,717
- It's just so awesome to watch
you work from beginning to end,

1016
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,752
From the moment you walked out
onto the stage yesterday,

1017
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,221
you were in character,

1018
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:45,289
Sometimes a little too
in character,

1019
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,359
but I loved the fact that
you owned the role

1020
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,428
and elevated the movements
that I gave you,

1021
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,330
- This is a full circle moment,

1022
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,333
because Vanessa judged
Shangela before,

1023
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,268
- Yes, I did, and you've
come a long way

1024
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,604
from when I saw you years ago,

1025
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,339
You are a superstar,

1026
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:02,640
- Thank you, Ms, Williams,

1027
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,108
- Shangela, are you
a Mariah fan?

1028
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,777
- I'm a huge Mariah fan,
and I hope when she meets me,

1029
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:07,912
she won't know me,

1030
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:10,982
[laughing]

1031
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,417
- Up next, Thorgy Thor,

1032
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,119
- Tonight on the runway,
I like this a lot

1033
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,855
better than the one
on your season,

1034
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,457
but it feels disjointed,

1035
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,993
The wedge and the eyebrows
seem like one part,

1036
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,295
and the dress feels
like a different part,

1037
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,163
And then tonight
the challenge was to embody

1038
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,699
and become these diva women,
- Okay,

1039
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,669
- And I felt like I was looking
at Thorgy with a blonde wig on,

1040
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,904
- Oh,

1041
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:34,372
- Yeah, I got the same thing
that Michelle did,

1042
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,840
I think it's about those
visual cues, and you gave us

1043
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,408
that with the hat
and the costuming,

1044
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,077
but the make-up
wasn't as Stevie,

1045
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,713
It's a fine line to still
put yourself in it,

1046
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,615
but also make somebody
that does know you

1047
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:45,816
know who you're impersonating,

1048
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,485
So that was a miss for me,

1049
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:51,055
- I think Stevie Nicks was a
hard diva to do because it's--

1050
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,490
- I'm trying to keep my mouth
shut because I don't--

1051
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,725
I don't want
to make any excuses,

1052
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,160
- Yeah, it's clearly not what--

1053
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,462
- But it's not a gay--
it's not like a gay icon,

1054
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:01,632
- Stevie Nicks is
definitely a gay icon,

1055
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,900
- The words came out
of my mouth,

1056
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,435
and I was like,
she is to me,

1057
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,270
I thought I did a
really good job,

1058
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,005
I'm a little surprised
I'm the bottom, to be honest,

1059
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,607
- You are all All Stars,

1060
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:13,578
Honestly, we have to pick up
on the slightest infraction

1061
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:17,415
on the challenge,
do you know what I mean?

1062
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:18,849
All right, thanks Thorgy,

1063
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,952
Up next, BenDeLaCreme,

1064
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,620
Jazz hot,

1065
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,356
- I gave you probably the most
difficult challenge because

1066
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:28,025
you had to be Julie Andrews, but
you also had to have swagger,

1067
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,360
but then you also
had to know

1068
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,329
every single one
of these lyrics,

1069
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,564
And I think that you just
knocked it out of the park,

1070
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,300
- How do you solve a problem
like "Call Me Mother,"

1071
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,437
because I don't even
know the lyrics,

1072
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:42,173
True story, It took me
five days to record that song,

1073
00:45:42,173 --> 00:45:43,574
- Really?
- To get the lyrics right?

1074
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,942
- Yep,

1075
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,111
- And it terms of the outfit,
you're a dream in pink,

1076
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:50,781
Very artistic
in the 1930s, art deco,

1077
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,217
- These are actually the
earrings that were given to us

1078
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,853
for that challenge
in Season 6,

1079
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,254
- I've been looking for those,

1080
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,357
[laughing]

1081
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:01,058
- Cameroon!

1082
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,493
- Hello, Mother,

1083
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:06,163
- BeBe Zahara Benet, have you
met the first lady of Cameroon?

1084
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,532
- I have not met her,
but she's heard of me, honey,

1085
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,434
[laughing]

1086
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,772
- Baby, you were Diana Ross,
It was amazing to me,

1087
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,040
And here's the key
that everybody

1088
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,141
should look at for that,

1089
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,877
You didn't do much
to embody Diana,

1090
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,445
- There wasn't a lot to do,

1091
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,381
There weren't a lot of lyrics,
but it was just

1092
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,616
a couple of those gestures,
the wardrobe,

1093
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,952
- And you even got
the hair bounce, girl,

1094
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,687
- It was a real homerun,

1095
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:32,323
- And then with this runway
look, I just love it,

1096
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:34,859
This was like BeBe Priestly,
"Devil Wears Prada,"

1097
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,293
the black version,

1098
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,095
- Can we just say the black
version of "Devil Wears Prada"

1099
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:41,165
is Wilhelmina Slater?
Hello? Thank you very much,

1100
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,734
- Thank you, ladies,

1101
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:47,705
Based on the judges critiques,
I've made some decisions,

1102
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:55,513
Shangela, BenDeLaCreme,

1103
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,914
condragulations,

1104
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,949
you are the top two
All Stars of the week,

1105
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:02,053
- Yes,

1106
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:07,892
- You've each won a $1,000 gift
card from Sparkles Rhinestones,

1107
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:13,497
and a $1,000 gift card
from Fierce Queen Heels,

1108
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,767
BeBe Zahara Benet,
- Yes, Mother,

1109
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,202
- Chi Chi DeVayne,,,

1110
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,172
You are safe,

1111
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:26,077
That means, Kennedy Davenport
and Thorgy Thor,

1112
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,313
you are in the bottom two,

1113
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:34,051
Shangela, BenDeLa,
each of you needs to decide

1114
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:38,222
which of the bottom queens
you will eliminate

1115
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,525
if you win the lip sync,

1116
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,961
So while you and the queens
deliberate in the workroom,

1117
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:48,833
the judges and I will play
a friendly game of strip poker,

1118
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,135
Thank you, ladies,
You may leave the stage,

1119
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:54,004
Coming up,,,

1120
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,239
- My mind's not made up,

1121
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,241
I want to know is Thorgy
going to be

1122
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,211
a reliable strong ally for me,

1123
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,613
If I throw you a bone,
I'm gonna expect a bone

1124
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,814
thrown back to me later on,

1125
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,123
[RuPaul laughing]

1126
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:18,195
- Thorgy and Kennedy, one
of these bitches is going home,

1127
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:22,399
but at this point I'm not
sure how this is gonna go down,

1128
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,669
It seems like the girls
all have their own opinion

1129
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,638
of how people
should get sent home,

1130
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:31,909
so it's up to DeLa
and Shangela to decide,

1131
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,613
- So how is everybody feeling?

1132
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,882
- I'm just trying not to cry,
I'm like really holding it in,

1133
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,950
Like, it really
doesn't feel good,

1134
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,319
I'm like really trying--

1135
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,055
- I would be crying right now,
- --to, like, get words out,

1136
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,324
Just give me a second,

1137
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:48,826
- Sorry, girl,

1138
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:52,129
- I don't feel like it made
any sense to me, to be honest,

1139
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,264
I'm nervous to go home,

1140
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,202
I worked really hard
to get here,

1141
00:48:58,202 --> 00:49:00,037
- I want to chat with you
if that's okay,

1142
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,205
- I'd love to chat with you,

1143
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:03,474
- Should we go chat?
- Yes,

1144
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,142
- Wish I could have a refill,

1145
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,777
- Yeah, we all need a refill,

1146
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,946
I told y'all, "Game of Thrones,"

1147
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,215
If I'm gonna take over
the Seven Kingdoms, honey,

1148
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:13,217
I'm gonna have to
have some allies,

1149
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:15,820
I want to know, is Thorgy
going to be

1150
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,589
a reliable strong ally for me?

1151
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,958
- Do I sit here and like beg?
- No,

1152
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,193
- Is it even worth it?

1153
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:23,794
- You know, I'm gonna
tell you the truth,

1154
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,062
Yes, Kennedy is my friend,

1155
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,897
I have known her for
a while, but also--

1156
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,299
- I know,
It kind of like terrifies me,

1157
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:30,835
- What I want to say is
that my mind's not made up,

1158
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,136
- Okay,

1159
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,138
- But she knows as well as I do,
this is a competition,

1160
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,940
I respect you,

1161
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,875
I know what kind
of a competitor you are,

1162
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,476
and you know how I am,
- Yeah,

1163
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,645
- If I throw you a bone,
I'm gonna expect

1164
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,247
a bone thrown back
to me later on,

1165
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:44,715
- I've been saying
since day one,,,

1166
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,419
- That's how this game
is played, Mamacita,

1167
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:50,020
- But it's a different game,
- Yeah,

1168
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,256
- If you win and you save me
and you keep me, oh, my God,

1169
00:49:52,256 --> 00:49:54,024
I'm like--I want to--
I cannot leave,

1170
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,660
I cannot go home,
I am not ready to go home,

1171
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,698
- Thorgy, Pros:
she's here to play the game

1172
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:05,369
and she is a fierce,
creative, talented queen,

1173
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,240
Cons: it's no secret
that Thorgy sometimes

1174
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,641
really gets in her head,

1175
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,576
Is that gonna be a handicap
to her

1176
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,845
moving forward in
this competition?

1177
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:18,983
- I don't make excuses,

1178
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:20,517
I'm very transparent,

1179
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:26,190
This was a stumbling block, but
I have so much more to give,

1180
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,525
I mean, that's my whole focus
of being here is

1181
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,528
to let people see through
this and see my heart,

1182
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:35,466
Not so much on stage, because
you can see my heart on stage,

1183
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:36,800
- Right,

1184
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,502
- But it's off stage that
I want you to see it,

1185
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,037
- I see it, girl,

1186
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,940
- Since Season 7,
I think mentally

1187
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,642
I've grown to be a better me,

1188
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,711
to be a more sickening
and ferocious me, honey,

1189
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,514
So leaving is not an option,

1190
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,017
So don't tell me nothing,
you know,

1191
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:55,452
You make your decision based
on what you have seen,

1192
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,721
but, I mean,
I don't want to go home,

1193
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,758
- When I look at the full scope
of who's here, I can see

1194
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:03,527
Kennedy in that final three,
but the biggest thing

1195
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,229
working against Kennedy
is that,

1196
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,932
yes, she had some
intense choreography,

1197
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,234
but what I heard
from the judges

1198
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,804
was she didn't fully
embody Janet

1199
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:17,441
and she was a huge part
of this challenge,

1200
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,842
- You seemed like you
really thought

1201
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:19,777
you were gonna be in the top,

1202
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:26,517
- I was in character
the entire time, and,,,

1203
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:31,055
to be standing on
that stage and not--

1204
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:33,624
not be commended for it,,,

1205
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:40,464
- I think that's a lot
of emotion for safe,

1206
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,766
- It's stupid,

1207
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,335
- Girl, do you want Celine
to come over here

1208
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,636
and sing you a song?

1209
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:48,472
Girl,

1210
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,874
- I was in eight of
the ten numbers,

1211
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:53,210
and I did the goddamn thing,

1212
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,547
When I know I did a really
great job, call me selfish,

1213
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,816
but I want--
I want to hear it,

1214
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:00,818
I was so excited
to get up there

1215
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:04,555
and hear what they thought
of my performance,

1216
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,958
and what they thought of
my Ru-demption look

1217
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:12,196
because in Season 6 all
they wanted to see was glamour,

1218
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:14,131
- I feel like you've been
giving a lot of glamour,

1219
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,700
- I--I can assume that
that's what they think,

1220
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,969
but I want them
to congratulate me,

1221
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,140
- Milk's perception of
his performance

1222
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,775
is obviously different
than the reality,

1223
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,777
Her Ru-demption Runway
was something

1224
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:29,947
that didn't really reflect
why we like Milk,

1225
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:32,216
It was like a safe,
pretty choice,

1226
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:34,818
Plus the Celine look
was not very Celine,

1227
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,391
- Do you have an idea of like
why I should choose you

1228
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:41,792
and Kennedy, you
know what I mean?

1229
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,494
Because right now
I'm just like, I don't know,

1230
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,762
- Here it is,

1231
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,296
When you win this lip sync
and you save me,

1232
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,965
I'll owe you one,

1233
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:49,133
Can I ask you an
honest question?

1234
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:50,334
- Yeah,

1235
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,502
- Do you think I should be
in the bottom two?

1236
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,670
- Uh, I--

1237
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,939
- I actually thought
I did a great job,

1238
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,342
- I was--I didn't see anybody,
you know what I mean?

1239
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,643
- Yeah, yeah,

1240
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,078
I just have so many thoughts
going through my head,

1241
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:03,747
Like, when you're given
Diana Ross and, like,

1242
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,350
every comment is like,
"It's Diana Ross, so,,,"

1243
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,085
- Yeah,

1244
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:10,320
- "You did less and
that was so much more,"

1245
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,489
I'm like, to me that means
you did nothing,

1246
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,659
You just--it's Diana Ross,

1247
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:19,129
I don't know, but that's why
in the rehearsal I was like,

1248
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,664
use me more,

1249
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,499
- I know that Thorgy feels
like she was focused

1250
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:25,836
in the rehearsal process,
but she'd be like in the back,

1251
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:28,172
like, frustrated because she
feels like she's being derailed,

1252
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:30,908
It was like a weird subconscious
thing happening, I think,

1253
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,644
- I'd like to say no matter
who you choose on that runway,

1254
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:36,346
like, I love you,

1255
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,182
but I can't predict
the way I'm gonna react,

1256
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,853
I--I would not feel
right going home,

1257
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,421
- I actually really love

1258
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,523
what Thorgy has to offer
as a drag queen,

1259
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,660
I think she's a total weirdo
in a way that I love,

1260
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,930
but Thorgy gets upset
fairly easily,

1261
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,835
I'm worried that she would
get in her own way eventually,

1262
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:00,671
- So here's the tea,
You know we can talk real,

1263
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:03,207
When I talk to Kennedy,
I want to make sure

1264
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,375
that her heart is still
in this competition

1265
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,743
because she's gotta be
in that top

1266
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:10,180
or else I would've
just wasted a save,

1267
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,150
If I win, why don't I have
your name in my hand?

1268
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,718
- You know in your heart--
- Mm-hmm,

1269
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,854
- --where my dedication was,

1270
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:19,523
I put a lot into this,

1271
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:21,425
- Yeah,
- And I--

1272
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,393
- Oh, I saw you stoning
that wig for hours,

1273
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,063
- I wouldn't have
did this Season 7,

1274
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:28,632
That's why I feel like
I belong here,

1275
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:32,102
because I have so much to give
and so much to present,

1276
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,770
- Let me ask you this,

1277
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,574
If given the opportunity, would
you send me to the house?

1278
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,811
- There's certain boundaries
that you just do not cross,

1279
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:45,015
$100,000 is not worth
losing a relationship,

1280
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:46,550
It's just not,

1281
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,385
And that's the type
of person that I am,

1282
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,521
- There's a lot to think about,

1283
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:53,090
Right now I'm feeling torn,

1284
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,859
When you base decisions
just on your friendships,

1285
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,829
then you make decisions that
you might end up regretting,

1286
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,968
- I'll raise you 20,
- I'm in,

1287
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,270
- I've got four queens,

1288
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,538
[laughs]

1289
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,840
- I hate this game,

1290
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,977
These have always
brought me luck,

1291
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,412
- I'll take them,

1292
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:16,747
- Just your size,

1293
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:18,081
- Silence,

1294
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,950
Bring back my girls,

1295
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,187
[laughing]

1296
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,092
- This is not
an easy decision,

1297
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:33,263
Each of these queens has
a lot more to offer,

1298
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:35,933
but they both had
trouble delivering

1299
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,768
what the judges
needed from them,

1300
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:41,538
So I genuinely have no idea
what to do here,

1301
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:48,912
- I made a decision, but am
I making the right choice?

1302
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:52,449
Is this queen going to push
herself to be in the top,

1303
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,118
and when she's there,
can I count on her?

1304
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,791
[RuPaul laughing]

1305
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:06,363
- Welcome back, ladies,

1306
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,433
Two top All Stars
stand before me,

1307
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:12,336
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare

1308
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:16,740
a lip sync performance of "Jump"
by the Pointer Sisters,

1309
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:21,945
This your chance to impress me,
win $10,000,

1310
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:27,784
and earn the power to give one
of the bottom queens the chop,

1311
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,222
The time has come,,,
[thunder]

1312
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:37,294
to lip sync for your legacy,

1313
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:40,163
- Now BenDeLa, she's won
two challenges at this point,

1314
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,466
She's a sneaky ho, okay?

1315
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:45,135
She ain't taking my $10,000,
No, ma'am,

1316
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:50,140
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up,

1317
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,677
[music plays]

1318
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:56,446
- ? Your eyes

1319
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,816
? Tell me
how you want me ?

1320
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:03,186
? I can feel it
in your heart beat ?

1321
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:06,490
? You're so excited I can
feel you getting hotter ?

1322
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,025
? Oh baby

1323
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:12,963
? I'll take you down,
I'll take you down ?

1324
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:15,599
? Where no one's
ever gone before ?

1325
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,801
? And if you want more

1326
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:22,039
? If you want more,
more, more ?

1327
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,508
? Then jump
- Yes!

1328
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:25,542
- ? For my love

1329
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:29,112
? Jump in
And feel my touch ?

1330
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:33,417
? Jump if you want to taste
my kisses in the night then ?

1331
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:36,720
? Jump, jump for my love

1332
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,557
? You are the one,
you are the one ?

1333
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:43,260
? And heaven waits
here at my door ?

1334
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,162
? And if you want more

1335
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:49,733
? If you want more,
more, more ?

1336
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,668
? Then jump

1337
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,937
? For my love

1338
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:00,010
? When you are next to me

1339
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:03,680
? Oh, I come alive

1340
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:10,821
? Your love burns inside

1341
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:16,626
? Oh it feels so right

1342
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,462
? Come to me

1343
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:23,667
? If you want me tonight

1344

? Jump

1345
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,137
? Jump for my love

1346

? Jump

? Come on and jump for me

00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:43,086
- Yes!

1354
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:50,160
- Ladies, I've made
my decision,

1355
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,570
Shangela, you're
a winner, baby,

- Yay, thank you!

please step forward,

comes great responsibility,

00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:34,671
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

1362
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,907
- I know what it's like to
come back to this competition

1363
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:40,644
and be sent home again
without getting the crown,

1364
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:43,213
I know how that feels,

1365
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:44,748
The person I've chosen
to send home,,,

1366
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:48,518
is Thorgy,

1367
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:52,022
- Oh, Jesus, Gross,

1368
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:56,960
- Thorgy, you are, and will
always be, an All Star,

1369
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,497
Now, sashay away,

1370
01:00:00,497 --> 01:00:02,332
- Gotcha,

1371
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,567
I love you guys,

1372
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:05,035
- Love you, too,
- I love you, Thorgy,

1373
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:06,937
I really mean that,
I really do love you,

1374
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,506
- Bye, guys,

1375
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:12,809
Whoo!

1376
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:18,348
I am not ready to leave
this competition at all,

1377
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,450
I have so much to give,

1378
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,552
In comparison to some of
the other girls here,

1379
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,354
I think I deserve to stay
a lot more,

1380
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:28,091
"Drag is fun," and then because
I'm gonna hate Shangela

1381
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:31,695
for life, how about
"Suck it Shangella,"

1382
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:36,166
and I'm gonna spell it with
two Ls because she hates that,

1383
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:40,003
and then she can suck this,

1384
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,906
'cause it's going that way,

1385
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:44,574
Yeah, that's pretty disgusting,

1386
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,942
Have a good time without me,

1387
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,277
Bye,
It's gonna be boring TV,

1388
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,880
[bell ringing]
I don't know what that means,

1389
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:55,519
- Under his eye, kitty girl,
- Jesus Christmas,

1390
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:57,754
- Today you've been
given a gift,

1391
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,524
Well, it's actually
more like a Groupon,

1392
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,995
- What the hell is going on?

1393
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,267
Is this gonna explode?

1394
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,369
Please don't explode,

1395
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,408
- [RuPaul]
Next time on "All Stars",,,

1396
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:22,012
You'll be improving your
way through The Bitchelor,

1397
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:23,346
[laughing]

1398
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,015
- There's something different
about these girls,

1399
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,450
but I can't quite figure out
what it is,

1400
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,152
- I don't think I'm psychotic,

1401
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,488
I just think I'm really
passionate about finding love,

1402
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:32,489
- Yeah,
- While the leaves--

1403
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,757
- And that's why I'm here,

1404
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:36,359
- And you were constantly
overshadowed,

1405
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,929
- If you're gonna be a bottom,
at least be a power bottom,

1406
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,431
- Season 3 Shange,
you would've picked up

1407
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,199
my cocktail and
threw it on that ho,

1408
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,935
- Fuck my drag, right?

1409
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:50,473
Every week is just
like turd city,

1410
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,042
[laughs]
