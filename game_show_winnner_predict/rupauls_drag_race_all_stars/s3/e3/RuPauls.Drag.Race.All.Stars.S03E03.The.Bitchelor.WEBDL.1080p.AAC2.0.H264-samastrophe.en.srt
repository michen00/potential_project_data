- Janet is a very
specific kind of move.

You could have worked
a little harder.

at Thorgy with a blonde wig on.

It's stupid. [ sobs ]

to get the chop?

It's a joke, obviously.

I thought Thorgy could.

That just means, I guess,

Kennedy will have to be
sent home next week.

56
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,931

are hurt right now,

if that's how she feels,

your decision on?

a really hard decision.

at the final moment,

determining factor, um...

She's calculating.

She's careful about
every word she says

81
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,721
because she has a reputation
to uphold.

82
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,956
- I don't know.

83
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,424
Did you even say what your
determining factor was?

00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,226
- Oh, why it's gotta be me?
I was happy it was on you.

85
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:14,161
- You get $10,000, so you
have to say it first.

86
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,198
- There's a lot of reasons,

87
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:20,267
but, Thorgy, yes,
she did have a smaller role,

88
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,504
but there was opportunity
for her, in my eyes,

89
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,406
like mine, I had Mariah--

- But--
- Let me finish.

91
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:30,644
When I saw what I had, I put
my own elements in there.

- Stevie is not current.

93
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,716
It's difficult
to compare that to Mariah.

94
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,618
- Oh, I'm not comparing her
to Mariah.

95

of Stevie Nicks.

I should be a more evolved,

So tell me what choice
would you have made?

chosen Thorgy to stay.

108
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:14,822
I find Thorgy's concepts
and her looks

109
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,557
much more exciting.

110
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,726

from my first

178
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,009
- You'll be doing unscripted
comedy with our bitchelor

179
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,546
played by the dreamy star
of "UnREAL,"

180
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,615
Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman.

181
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,417
- Ooh, yes!

182
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,551
- Oh, yeah.

183
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,354
Now, to make things
extra twisted,

184
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,990
I'm going to assign
each of you a date partner

185
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,062
and a funny personality type
to play.

186
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:12,166
Aja and Kennedy, you'll be
going on a two-on-one date.

187
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,267
- All right.

188
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,602
- Kennedy,
you'll be the party girl,

189
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,473
and Aja, you'll be playing
the super needy girl,

190
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,142
so insecure it hurts.

191
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,510
- Oh.

192
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,146
- Trixie and Milk,
you'll be working together.

193
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:29,249
Trixie, you'll be
the fake bitch.

194
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,651
- All right.

195
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:33,487
- Milk, you'll be
the psycho stalker.

196
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,391
- BeBe and BenDeLa, you'll
go on a date with Jeffrey.

197
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:39,827
BenDeLaCreme,
you'll be the cougar.

198
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,061
- Naturally.

199
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,497
- BeBe, you'll be
the shy virgin.

200
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,498
- Oh.

201
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,033
- You tell everybody
you're pure,

202
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,068
but you secretly
want to lose it.

203
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,672
And finally,
Chi Chi and Shangela,

204
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,209
you are our polyamorous duo.

205
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,311
[ all laugh ]

206
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,947
- Chi Chi, you're
more into the bitchelor,

207
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,951
and Shangela,
you're more into Chi Chi.

208
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,252
- Hi, Boo.

209
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,855
- Now, remember,
the first rule of improv

210
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:11,859
is to always agree,
to say yes to everything.

211
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:16,497
For example, when I ask "Does
this Klein Epstein Parker suit

212
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,732
make my ass look juicy?"
You say...

213
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:19,867
All: Yes.

214
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,535
- You got it.

215
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,637
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

216
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:26,473
and may
the best All Star win.

217
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,676
[ cheers and applause ]

218
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,478
- How do you feel
about improv?

219
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:35,115
- I do not consider myself,
like, a comedian per se.

220
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,517
I'm excited.

221
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,219
In Season 1, we never had
the opportunity to do improv.

222
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,688
The character I'm playing
is the virgin,

223
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,689
and I was, like,
what about

224
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,392
if this girl
is an African princess?

225
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,595
Come on, now. You can
just make her really funny.

226
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,830
I would like to approach
my character

227
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,667
like somebody fresh
off the boat from Africa.

228
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,135
- Yeah.
- Because in our culture,

229
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,538
it's like you have to be married
to be able to, you know--

230
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,540
You have to be married
to be able to have...

231
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,441
[ laughs ]
I mean, it's--

232
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,876
I can't even spell out
the words

233
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,445
because
it's like this girl--

234
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,182
- But how would you establish
the idea specifically

235
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,617
of virginity other than
that you're not married?

236
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:14,788
I think that what they're
gonna be looking for in here

237
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,990
is gonna be like being
so over the top with it.

238
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,158
- Right.

239
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,127
- What they want here
is like campy, you know?

240
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,962
- Yeah. But this is hard
to go extreme

241
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,999
being a virgin
and being shy.

242
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,668
- I'm feeling
really worried

243
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,003
about BeBe's choices
around her character.

244
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,305
BeBe, up to this point,

245
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,841
has just been
kind of poised and regal,

246
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:37,211
so we'll see if she can
get down with being goofy.

247
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,478
If it were me,

248
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,481
I would go with the more
traditional kind of like...

249
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,383
like, buttoned-up Catholic,

250
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,185
kind of like,
"I only do anal

251
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,221
because that still makes me
a virgin" kind of thing.

252
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,958
- That would be very funny,
honey, but no.

253
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,194
- I want my character
to be so fucking crazy

254
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,597
that she's like

255
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,597
bat shit crazy,

256
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,699
that she will do anything.

257
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,734
- And don't forget
insecurity, too.

258
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,135
- Well, yeah,
she's insecure.

259
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,637
- Yeah.
- But that's the point.

260
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,339
You're so insecure
you become crazy.

261
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,773
- Okay.
- Like I will fake cry.

262
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,543
I will put some
Visine tears. [ cries ]

263
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:10,978
A needy girl
is easy for me.

264
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,214
My strategy is to give you
a lot of moaning,

265
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,683
aww, and a lot of, like,
crying sounds.

266
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,718
Aah!

267
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,686
I'm just gonna be crazy
and needy,

268
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,623
kind of like a rich bitch,
like, vibe.

269
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,658
- Ugh. I don't think

270
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,995
she understands her character
not one bit.

271
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,864
- Rich bitch,
religious fish.

272
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:34,668
I used to be a Christian
for attention fish.

273
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,837
- [ sighs ]

274
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,740
- We don't know
what he's gonna give us.

275
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,941
But whatever he says,

276
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:41,942
we will think of the right
response.

277
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,243
- Right.
And he's super dreamy.

278
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,344
- Oh, my God.

279
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,413
- And so I would stalk him,
actually.

280
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,649
- Yeah. No kidding.
- Psychotically.

281
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,051
I feel good about playing
the stalker bitch

282
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,053
because it's sort of like

283
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,821
an easy transition
into this role,

284
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,257
because before I started
dating my boyfriend,

285
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,293
I stalked him on MySpace,

286
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:02,529
and just, like, check out
who his friends were,

287
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,299
and that sort of
led me to, like,

288
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,634
becoming friends
with his friends,

289
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,170
and then being friends
with his friends

290
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,173
led me to meeting him.

291
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,741
So I'm very confident

292
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:19,513
about my role
as psycho stalker number one.

293
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,948
- Hi, what's your name?

294
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:24,451
- Hi, I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,

295
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,986
and, yeah.

296
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,755
I mean, I'm just--girl,
I don't know how to do it.

297
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,590
- Come on,
you got it, you got it.

298
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,160
- I don't consider myself
to be a comedian

299
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,695
or an actress and all that.

300
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,532
So looking at the other girls,
I'm getting so intimidated.

301
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:43,236
Like, girl, are you going to be
able to perform at that level?

302
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,439
- How are you gonna
play your character?

303
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,375
- What do you mean?
You--I mean--

304
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,010
- How's she gonna talk?
How's she gonna act?

305
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,913
- I am shittin bricks.

306
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:57,284
I don't know if I can come up
with that kind of funny

307
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,885
just right off the bat.

308
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:03,190
Hi, I'm, you know,
Chi Chi DeVayne, and--

309
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,992
- Oh, she's
the proper English.

310
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,927
- She might be from England,

311
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,930
but she still sound like
she from Crenshaw, too.

312
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,900
- Shangela's super funny
and good at improv.

313
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,336
If anything, I can see her
bulldozing Chi Chi.

314
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,537
I would not want to be
in a group with Shangela

315
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,672
to be honest with you.
- Yeah.

316
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:20,907
Do you think people say that
about you and I?

317
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,442
- [ laughs ]

318
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,610
Probably not.

319
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,413
When Celine doesn't win,
she cries.

320
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,415
- After last week,
I think I've learned

321
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,985
that being safe
is clearly not okay for me.

322
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,388
Even though I thought I was
really impressive last week,

323
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:37,691
I'm--now is the time
to prove myself,

324
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,426
and if I don't,
and if I'm safe,

325
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,195
then I'm probably
gonna cry about it again.

326
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:44,631
- Coming up...

327
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,834
- Are you ready for the romantic
adventure of your life?

328
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,903
- Oh.
- Ooh, we here.

329
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,138
- Ooh.

330
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,908
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

331
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,411
[RuPaul laughs]

332
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,882
- Okay, places, everyone!
Places, everyone!

333
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,617
fuck it up.

334
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,617
Oh, and don't

335
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,390
- I'm Jeffrey, and I'm here
to find the love of my life.

336
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,792
This is not gonna be easy,

337
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,461
but it never is
in this game we call love.

338
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,636
- Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman,
are you ready

339
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,605
for the romantic adventure
of your life?

340
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,575
- Oh, I just want this to be
real, you know what I mean?

341
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,645
- Oh, yeah. I know
exactly what you mean.

342
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,353
- Do I have something
on my face?

343
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,323
- Oh, look, here comes
the first girl.

344
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,558
Good luck.

345
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,259
- Thanks, Ru.

346
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,534
- My name
is BeBe Zahara Benet.

347
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,836
- Hi.

348
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,605
- And I'm all the way
from Africa.

349
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,975
And I came to America
to find my prince.

350
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,777
Hi, Jeffrey.

351
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:05,078
- You can look me
in the eye, you know?

352
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,348
- [ laughs ]
Ooh, he's a handsome man,

353
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,951
and I bet you
he has the big...

355
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,488
Oh.

356
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,123
Can I tell you
a little secret?

357
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,324
- Please, yes.

358
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,693
- I'm still a virgin.

359
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,528
I have a special flower.

360
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,330
- Well, maybe I can take
a little sniff later.

361
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,631
- [ chuckles ]

362
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,199
- We'll see you inside.
Thank you.

363
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,501
That's totally unnecessary.

364
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:28,802
Wildly unnecessary.

365
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,170
Thank you very much, BeBe.

366
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:36,109
- Well, hello there,
handsome.

367
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,178
- Whoa. Wow.

368
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,113
- My name is BenDeLaCreme.

369
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,682
Who's a big boy?
You're a big boy.

370
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:47,387
And I'm here
to land me a boy-man.

371
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,788
I'm BenDeLaCreme.

372
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,157
- Nice to meet you BenDeLa.
Thank you.

373
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,892
- You don't have to call me
BenDeLa.

374
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,893
- Okay.
What should I call you?

375
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,428
- My friends
call me Bedtime BD,

376
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,131
because I like to tuck
a big boy in night-night.

377
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,267
- [ laughs ]

378
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,302
- You can just go on inside
to the house.

379
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,603
I'll meet you inside
in a few minutes, all right?

380
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,838
- Thank you so much!

381
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,907
You're a beautiful driver.
I really appreciate it.

382
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,576
Oh, my God,
that taxi was disgusting.

383
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,810
It smelled like a barn.

384
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,513
He was gross, he was late,
he drove like a maniac.

385
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,549
Hi, I'm Trixie Mattel.
I'm 27 years old,

386
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,184
and I'm from
sunny West Hollywood.

387
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,885
And some people
might say I'm fake,

388
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,987
but those people
are alcoholics.

389
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,489
He's not even
that good looking.

390
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,791
I have to go. Hi.
- Hi.

391
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,960
- Oh, my God, you're even cuter
in person than you are on TV.

392
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,029
- Oh, that's
very sweet of you.

393
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,430
- You kind of have,
like, this sexy,

394
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,600
like, Denzel,
like, Gilbert Godfried,

do you know what I mean?

396
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,037
- Uh...

397
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,439
- I like my men
like I like my coffee...

398
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,808
incapable of loving me back.

399
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,842
[ sighs ]

400
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,077
Bye, Jason!

401
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,545
Sorry, it's Jared.

402
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,447
- Jeff. Jeffrey.

403
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,452
- I'm Milk.
I'm from New York City.

404
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,956
I kind of move around a lot
in life for legal reasons.

405
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:57,657
Is it okay if I step out?

406
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,492
I know
this is less than 500 feet.

407
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,596
Some people say
I'm, like, psycho,

408
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:05,098
but I just say I'm really
passionate about love.

409
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,333
[ giggles ]

410
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:09,236
- Nice to meet you--
Ooh, okay.

411
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,204
- I'm his biggest fan,
and it's unreal

412
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,273
to see the star
of "UnREAL."

413
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,274
I'm in love.

414
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,648
- I have to open it myself.

415
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,450
My name is Aja,
and this is Woofy.

416
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,185
Woof. Oh.

417
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:28,755
He's the only person who
actually stays by my side.

418
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,123
Oh, my God!

419
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,360
When I first saw Jeffrey,
I just knew from that moment

420
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,397
that I would do anything
to have him.

421
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,899
I will kill someone.

422
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,270
Can you believe they made me
open the door by myself?

423
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,572
I didn't even close it.
Should I go close it?

424
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,674
- I think maybe
you better close it.

425
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,044
- I don't do anything
for myself,

426
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,279
but for you
I'll do anything.

427
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,747
- Thank you, Aja.
It's a pleasure.

428
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,582
- You don't love me.

429
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,417
I'm gonna make you love me.

430
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,520
- Ooh, we here.

431
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,756
Ooh! Ooh, it's big.

Ooh, I hope he cute.

- My name is Kennedy.

436
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,700
I'm from West Dallas,
and I'm here to meet my man.

437

Ooh, you is fine.

- Thank you.
- Ooh, yes, honey.

I love to party, too.
Hold on one second.

- Okay. Okay, all right.

441
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,777
You come prepared.

442

- As I'm looking
into Jeffrey's eyes,

443
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,849
I just get so moist inside.

444
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,084
I gotta have his baby.

445
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:32,419
You better be watching.

446
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,087
Keep watching.

Honey, look at the sperm count
on this one!

Come on out here, baby.

- I'm Shangela.

- And I'm Chi Chi.

454
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,169
- I am looking for love
with my partner

455
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:51,671
because we like
to be polyamorous.

456
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,740
- I love limos.

457
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,042
- This is a very progressive
coupling that's going on here.

458
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,178
- Oh, you have insurance?
You said "Progressive."

459
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,212
- No, I do.

460
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,314
- Now look at the size
on this one.

461
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,083
- Ooh, he look like
he got a big one, too.

00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,085
- Yes, he does.
Let's measure it.

by the way?

467
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,958
- Oh, you have
to ask my wife.

468
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,762
- Chi Chi and I usually
have very good luck.

00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,197
I mean, look at Chi Chi.

It's time for
your two-on-one dates.

485
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,367
Stay in character,
go with the flow,

486
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,503
and don't talk
over each other.

487

- This is the weirdest group
of girls I have ever seen,

00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,779

- Oh, my goodness.

00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,646
- I thought we could get to know
each other over a couple snacks.

500
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:43,283
Oh, that's totally
unnecessary, but thank you.

501
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,652
Would you like to try
a chocolate-covered strawberry?

502
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,920
This is one of my favorite
delicacies.

503
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,188
- Let me just
pull off my shoes,

00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,824
because a man cannot feed me
with shoes on.

00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,664
That is a dirty woman.

525
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,566
Mm-mm.

526
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,769
I don't know if you're
looking for a woman like me,

527
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,571
like the woman
who is clean,

528
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,673
clean down there.

529
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,275
- Are you looking
for a woman that's clean

530
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,612
or are you looking for
a woman that's dirty?

531
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,780
- Um...

532
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,316
- Remember, I already
ate this once before.

533
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,317
- Yeah.
- [ laughs ]

534
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,686
- If Jeffrey
needs a warm bosom

535
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,822
to press himself against
at night,

536
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,257
I'm the wrong gal

537
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,959
because these
don't feel temperature.

538
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,995
We'll have
a lot more opportunities

539
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,129
to get to know each other
later.

540
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,130
- I can't wait.

541
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,466
- Just don't come after 9:30

542
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,202
because that's when
my Xanax kicks in.

543
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,203
- [ laughs ]

544
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,440
- My God, you are so funny.
Stop.

545
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,676
- Oh, ladies.
- Stop. I said stop!

546
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:19,112
You're literally killing me,
you're so funny.

547
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,847
- I want to get to know you both
a little bit better.

548
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,448
- [ laughs ]
- Is this your house?

549
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,416
- Yes.

550
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,517
- Wait, Jeffrey,
Jeffrey, Jeffrey.

551
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,452
- This is, like,
the prettiest refurbished,

552
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,423
like, Cheesecake Factory
mall kiosk I have ever been to.

553
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:31,791
- Thank you very much.

554
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,260
- Do you remember when you wore
these shirts on "UnREAL?"

555
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,461
- Uh...

556
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,030
- You know this style.
- Wow.

557
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,898
- Yeah. I've seen
every episode of "UnREAL."

558
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,033
I have like every--

559
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,802
- You don't know Jeffrey
like I know Jeffrey.

560
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,370
[ whispering ]

561
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,805
The date's
going really well.

562
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,841
Like, Jeffrey seems,
like, really into me.

563
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,411
[ laughs ]

564
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:52,378
- Hold on. I have
to have to take this.

565
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,413
Yeah, I'm here now.

566
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,647
No. She's like
a weird forest girl.

567
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,182
- Do I come across
as, like, crazy though?

568
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,984
- Oh.
- Like, do I look crazy?

569
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,352
- That's just
a really strong word.

570
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,820
- He's like five--

571
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,788
- I can't handle it
right now.

572
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:02,956
I can't handle it.

573
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,024
- You look different.
- Yeah?

574
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,126
- I know Trixie
is playing a fake bitch,

575
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,263
but, baby, those facial
expressions are real.

576
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:12,732
- Don't--
- [ laughs ]

577
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,934
- No, he's like a five.
He's like an L.A. two.

578
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,469
- Stop talking to me.

579
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,305
What? [ sighs ]
Oh, my God.

580
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:22,976
- If steam
could come off a wig,

581
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,144
she would have those
little lines above her head

582
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,245
where the heat is rising.

583
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,614
Miss Thing is hot

584
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:30,483
that Milky
is cutting her off.

585
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,718
[ laughs ]

586
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,019
- People call me psycho,

587
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,787
but I don't think
I'm psychotic.

588
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,856
I just think I'm really
passionate about finding love.

589
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,991
- Yeah.
- While the leaves--

590
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:39,792
- And that's why I'm here.
- Me, too.

591
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,294
- The leaves in your hair
are so fun,

592
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:43,096
I wish you would leave.

593
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:47,967
- Milk is just going
way overboard.

594
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,369
- It's been great, ladies.

595
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,305
It's been
an incredible pleasure.

596
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:56,409
- [ sobs ]

597
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,344
Bye, Jerald.

598
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,514
- It's Jeffrey.

599
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,385
- We're gonna go on a date.

600
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,253
- This has been so much fun.

601
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,254
- Well, this ain't no party.

602
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,422
- No.
You know what , ladies?

603
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,790
I thought we could take
some time to chill out.

604
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,659
- That's so nice.
- Yeah.

605
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:13,660
- But you know what?

606
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,894
I got the party right here.
Hold on.

607
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:15,895
- I don't get it.

608
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,096
- She does
a lot of partying.

609
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,831
- Hold that.
- Yes, ma'am.

610
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,134
- You have one too, crazy.
- All right.

611
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,135
- [ babbles ]

612
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,302
- Don't be looking, boy.

613
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,337
- Oh.

614
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:25,505
- She brought drinks.
Oh, my God.

615
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:26,839
You're good for something.

616
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,274
- Hey, we have a party.

617
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,476
- You are a girl
who knows how to party.

618
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:32,278
- We're gonna get drunk
together.

619
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:35,882
- Can we propose to me

620
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,251
finding the love
I couldn't find within myself?

621
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,688
Nobody's ever loved me like
you before, and I'm so happy.

622
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:45,224
- That's really,
really, really sad.

623
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,560
- [ cries ]
You think it's sad?

624
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,529
- Oh, my God.
It's supposed to be insecure.

625
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,664
It's like a needy girl,
not just crying.

626
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,232
- [ cries ]

627
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:56,436
- The only thing Aja's
insecure about is this scene.

628
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,405
- We gonna make
a toast to love.

629
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,473
- Yes.

630
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,041
- And your nice ass.

631
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,012
Jeffrey is so sexy.
Oh, my God.

632
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,880
If this doesn't work out,

633
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,349
I'm probably gonna
whoop the bitch that won

634
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,018
and just take Jeffrey.

635
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:13,419
You is fine, boy.

636
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,689
Just being honest.

637
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:17,824
Baby, hold on.

638
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,192
- Your hands are greasy--
- You do this.

639
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:20,626
- Aah!

640
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,794
- Oh.

- [ laughs ]

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,465
- What about
your past relationships?

644
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,066
- All I had was a--

645
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,402
he turned out
to be a crackhead.

646
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:32,305
And he stole all my shit

647
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:32,305
out of my apartment,

648
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,107
but I found him, though,

649
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,208
and shot his ass.

- What's your favorite part
of my body?

My favorite part of your body

- It's hot.

- Don't you have
another bottle of alcohol?

- It's hot, bitch.

It's hotter than shit.

- Is she okay?
- I'm a man.

00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,684
- Ladies, I thought
we would just take a little time

669
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,788
to relax and unwind
and take our clothes off.

670
00:25:21,788 --> 00:25:24,323
- Are you into the whole
polyamorous thing?

671
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,359
- I'm open to everything.
- Oh, are you?

672
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,728
We've been looking for somebody
to be a little more open.

673
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:30,596
- I mean, how wide
are you willing to go?

00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:33,199
So how did you two
come together?

675
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,601
- I think it was fate,
right, Chi Chi?

676
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:39,972
- Well, Mama found me,
you know, at a strip club.

00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,808
That's Mama.

678

- Yeah.

I could have real meat now.

My mission while I'm here

is to get me a nice,
strong, firm plastic cup

and get me some
of that Jeffrey sperm in it

692

- Oh, now those are balls!

699
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,821
Those are big balls!

700
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:32,191
- Shangela is so over the top
with her persona, you know,

701
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,259
and she's
cracking her jokes.

702
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,627
- One of y'all
needs to shave.

703
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,263
Nobody told me
Bush was back in office.

704
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,232
- [ laughs ]

705
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,400
- Chi Chi's just drowning
in the tub, honey.

706
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,137
- My dream date is...

707
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,474
whatever
mother wants me to have.

708
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,642
- Ugh.

709
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,410
- We're a two-piece combo
over here.

710
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,212
- All right.
- You wanna hang out with Sugar,

711
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,849
then you gotta
come through me.

712
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:57,884
- [ laughs ]

713
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:59,652
- If Jeffrey
gets me and Shangela

714
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:03,322
in the fantasy suite,
it's going down.

715
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,824
[ laughs ]

716
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,327
- Chi Chi had
a special question for you

717
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,495
that she wanted to ask you.

718
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,496
- Go for it, Chi Chi.

719
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,265
- Chi Chi?

720
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:14,433
- [ deep voice ]
Do you wanna have my baby?

721
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,903
- Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

722
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,072
- Ladies, it's time

723
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:25,211
for the most dramatic
eggplant ceremony in herstory.

724
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:29,382
- Ladies, I just really
want this love to be real,

725
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:32,418
and, frankly, most of y'all
scare the hell out of me.

726
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,690
Which is why I've decided
to give this eggplant...

727
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,560
To Ru.

728
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,131
Will you accept
my eggplant, Ru?

729
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:49,902
- I will take
all your eggplants.

730
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,839
- What?
- No!

731
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,846
- Way to go, RuPaul,
way to go!

732
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,149
- Bye-ee!

733
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:06,585
Finally, this is
my happily ever after.

734
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,187
Next stop,
"Good Morning America."

735
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,456
We'll do
"Dancing with the Stars,"

736
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:12,525
and then we'll get divorced.

737
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,063
- Coming up...

738
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,198
- Milk, Milk, Milk.

739
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,466
It's just hurtful

740
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,601
because I thought we were
all better than that.

741
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,370
But y'all feelings
is really hurt.

742
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,005
- I'm paying no attention.

743
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,807
That's dumb.

744
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,976
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

745
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:32,311
[RuPaul laughs]

746
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:37,016
Hi, guys. Good morning.

747
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:40,953
- This week's runway
is Wigs On Wigs On Wigs,

748
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,655
inspired by Roxxxy Andrews.

749
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,957
- Welcome to another day
at the office.

750
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,425
Aren't you feeling gorgeous?

751
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,694
Aren't you feeling
technically amazing?

752
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,030
- Milk someday wants to have
a challenge inspired by her,

753
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,331
and I bet you next season

754
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,166
there will be, like,
this week on the runway

755
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,369
you'll be crying
because you're only safe.

756
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:58,738
[ laughs ]

757
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,740
- New day.
- New day.

758
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,907
- New day, sis.

759
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,509
- Y'all can't handle
all this cuteness.

760
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,445
I'm about to feel real cute.

761
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,614
- I'm going through it.

762
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,683
I'm going through it
in my head.

763
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:13,486
I mean, yesterday was bad.

764
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,655
On Season 8, I just
doubted myself so much.

765
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,724
I often asked myself, like,

766
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:21,027
what the hell
are you doing here?

767
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:24,363
And, like, how could I compete
with girls like this,

768
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:25,431
you know what I mean?

769
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,199
These bitches
have fabulous costumes,

770
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:31,203
and I'm gonna walk out
in a neon bathing suit.

771
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,906
So if it seems like
I'm a little worried, I am.

772
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,441
That's why I'm quiet.

773
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,177
I'm distancing myself
from the girls.

774
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:43,015
I thought that
I had elevated my drag,

775
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,817
but here we go again.

776
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,752
Like,
what are you gonna say,

777
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,387
like, what are you gonna do

778
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:53,192
to, like, match these girls'
energy and funniness?

779
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,860
I'm just trying
to keep a positive head.

780
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,162
I'm trying to keep smiling,

781
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,899
but at the same time,
I am nervous.

782
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,400
I don't want to go home.

783
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,035
I'm gonna show them that,
you know,

784
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,138
I have what it takes
to go all the way.

785
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:08,507
- How are you?

786
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,142
- I really, really
wanna win a challenge.

787
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,744
I've never even
been in the top,

788
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:13,879
so I really hope today
it can happen.

789
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,448
The first time
I was on "Drag Race,"

790
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:17,616
I kinda just floated
until I got flushed.

791
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,784
All people knew about me

792
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:21,921
was that I did not excel
at "Drag Race"

793
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,756
and didn't win
any challenges,

794
00:30:23,756 --> 00:30:25,491
and I never had
my star moments.

795
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,926
This time I, like,
have to change that.

796
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,928
I don't really, like,
need validation,

797
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,564
but, like, to have
one good week here

798
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,332
would really help the momentum
for the rest, you know.

799
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,700
- I feel you.

800
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,069
- Being safe all the time
you start to feel invisible.

801
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,371
In the real world,
I'm Beyonce,

802
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,707
but in the "Drag Race" world,
I'm just a LaTavia.

803
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,075
It doesn't matter
on "Drag Race"

804
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,577
what you've done
in the real world.

805
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,579
In these four
fake brick walls,

806
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,381
you are garbage
until proven otherwise.

807
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,917
- Is there anybody

808
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,186
that either of you
are, like, concerned about?

809
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,389
It's kind of hard to figure out
who the bottom two are.

810
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,757
Like. I feel like--
- Oh, let's say three.

811
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,826
Who would you think
the three are?

812
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:03,362
- I mean,
if I were gonna say three,

813
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,899
I would say Aja, Chi Chi,
and possibly BeBe.

814
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,734
- What do you feel, Milk?

815
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:10,136
- I'd have
to agree with Ben.

816
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:12,538
- I feel like two out of three
of those are correct,

817
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,306
and my third variable one

818
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:15,708
that I kept going
back and forth on

819
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:19,812
was between Aja's and yours.

820
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:22,648
- I'm not fazed by Shangela

821
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:25,184
thinking that I may be
in the bottom.

822
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,585
That's dumb.

823
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,655
So I'm just gonna turn my
hearing aid down a little bit

824
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,257
and just, like,
let her speak,

825
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,526
but I'm paying no attention.

826
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,361
I thought I killed it.

827
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:39,131
The idea of being in the top
is so exciting.

828
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,599
- Well, halle-loo.

829
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,568
Oh, Miss Thing,
I'm looking at her, like,

830
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,771
you don't see
the writing on the wall?

831
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,840
Mama, she really thinks

832
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,209
that she's in the top two
on this one.

833
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:54,680
I'm cracked. [ laughs ]

834
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:00,886
- Shit.

835
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,154
It's just hurtful

836
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,156
because I thought
we were all better than that.

837
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,258
- I think I would've chosen
Thorgy to stay.

838
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:12,231
I find Thorgy's concepts
and her look much more exciting.

839
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,732
- Fuck my drag, right?

840
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:15,367
- Bitch, your feelings
is really hurt.

841
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,368
- Yep.

842
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,003
- Kennedy is really upset

843
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,371
because it wasn't right
for Milk to say

844
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,240
that Kennedy
should have gone home

845
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,675
because her looks
weren't on point,

846
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:25,010
because this is a competition
about more than just your looks.

847
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,146
And Kennedy proved this week

848
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:30,549
that she deserves
to be here 100%.

849
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,151
- If you don't care about me

850
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,352
and you don't care
about my style of drag,

851
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,920
you're entitled to that.

852
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,822
I'm upset at the fact
that we work together

853
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,891
a lot of times,

854
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:41,193
and what's hurtful
is when you feel like

855
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,895
you have
this certain relationship

856
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,564
with your so-called sister,

857
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,400
and you come to find out
it's something else.

858
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,903
And they end up reading you
like a dog and stuff,

859
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,671
throwing you under the bus.

860
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,107
We stopped conversation
after that.

861
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,711
- No.

862
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:00,512
Not even talk to me.

863
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:03,215
That's how I know
when people ain't real.

864
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,417
I've worked
with Milk before.

865
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,653
We've been on tour together,

866
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,956
and I've never had a problem
with Milk ever.

867
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:12,992
I've always liked
working with her,

868
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,762
but now you're treating me
like you don't even know me.

869
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:20,065
I value people's friendship,
I value sisterhood,

870
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:23,002
and when
I really like a person

00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:14,946
- Thank you.

1047
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,450
- The rest of you

1048
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,553
represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1049
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,422
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1050
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,490
First up, BenDeLaCreme.

1051
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,625
- Hi.

1052
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:30,262
- I loved the surprise
wig skirt reveal.

1053
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:31,863
It's tough to, like,
shock us

1054
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,465
when we know it's Wigs
On Wigs On Wigs.

1055
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,466
We know what's gonna happen.

1056
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:35,901
There's gonna be
a wig under there.

1057
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,135
But somehow
you managed to shock me.

1058
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,704
- Every piece
you stripped off

1059
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:41,673
revealed another layer
and another layer,

1060
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,375
and that's what you did
in your performance, too.

1061
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:44,576
You gave layers.

1062
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,812
I laughed so hard I cried.

1063
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:50,682
- As an actor, you gave me
a lot to play with.

1064
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:51,983
I had so much fun with you.

1065
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,387
I was equally disgusted by you
as I was turned on.

1066
00:40:55,387 --> 00:40:58,190
- I keep waiting for you
to drop the ball,

1067
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,424
and you haven't
dropped it yet.

1068
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:02,227
- Those are really lovely words
of encouragement.

1069
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:05,497
- I wish nothing more than
you shutting me up each time

1070
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:08,433
by not letting that ball
or balls drop.

1071
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,469
- Thank you, DeLa.
- Thank you.

1072
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,204
- Up next, Trixie Mattel.

1073
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:13,438
- Hi, guys.

1074
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:15,173
- When you came out,
I was feeling immediately

1075
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:17,676
like if Lady Bunny
and Kesha had a baby.

1076
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,878
- Were you doing Lady Bunny?
What was that about?

1077
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:22,247
- I thought, can Lady Bunny
become Naomi's balls?

1078
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:24,015
Turns out yes.
[ all laugh ]

1079
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:27,919
- In "The Bitchelor,"
your character was so spot on.

1080
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,222
It was basically
Paris Hilton.

1081
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:33,024
- I was very impressed from
the second you walked out.

1082
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,960
You were on the phone and
you weren't paying attention,

1083
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,262
and it was like, oh,
we know exactly who you are,

1084
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:39,364
and it was
everything I wanted.

1085
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:40,532
- But I felt like

1086
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,701
you were getting talked over
a little bit.

1087
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:45,370
- We were advised to try
not to talk over each other.

1088
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,638
It was kind of like
jump roping.

1089
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,874
I was kind of waiting
sometimes for the moment.

1090
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:50,008
- I felt you waiting.

1091
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,644
- However, when you did
get those lines in,

1092
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,346
they were hilarious.

1093
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,615
- All right,
well, thanks Trixie.

1094
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,049
Up next, Milk.

1095
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,518
- Hi.

1096
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:00,986
- You look gorgeous tonight.

1097
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:02,020
- Thank you.

1098
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,021
- This is a great look
for you.

1099
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,890
- Thank you.
- In the wig reveal,

1100
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,359
I liked that there was
another sort of reveal

1101
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,693
when you pulled the pony,

1102
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,895
like those dolls that
I always that I always wanted

1103
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,062
that my parents
wouldn't get me.

1104
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,230
- Crissy Doll.
- Yeah, Crissy Doll.

1105
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,232
- Crissy Doll's
my favorite doll of all time,

1106
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,668
but we could see
the black cup holder

1107
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:18,370
underneath the blonde hair.

1108
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,205
- Yeah, it's dark root.

1109
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,041
- In the challenge,
you were terrifying.

1110
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,843
- I know. [ laughs ]

1111
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:27,045
I was--
I was actually psycho.

1112
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:31,183
- But it was the same note
the whole time.

1113
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:33,385
I kept hoping that
you were going to pretend

1114
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,020
like you weren't a stalker

1115
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,389
and there wasn't anything wrong
with what you were doing,

1116
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,558
and you're just
a really nice, friendly person

1117
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:42,093
who happens to know
everything about you.

1118
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,695
Because there are times
when less is more.

1119
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:46,331
- Your foot was on the gas
the whole time.

1120
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:49,634
You were going so fast,
you weren't sharing the stage.

1121
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:52,037
- Up next, Aja.

1122
00:42:52,037 --> 00:42:53,872
- Hi.
- Tonight on the runway,

1123
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,674
I'm going to go
out on a limb

1124
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:58,944
and say this right now was
the best Aja has ever looked.

1125
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:00,412
- Oh, thank you.

1126
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,113
- From the second
you walked out,

1127
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:05,150
I just said, what is that,
and I need more.

1128
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:08,153
- You're giving me
street fighter couture,

1129
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,855
and it's incredible.

1130
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:11,857
Yes, hyah.
- Win.

1131
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:12,858
- So in "The Bitchelor,"

1132
00:43:12,858 --> 00:43:15,560
I didn't get needy girl
at all,

1133
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,629
not even a little.

1134
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:18,630
- Oh, my God.

1135
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,298
- What I got
was a whiny brat,

1136
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,334
and that
is not the character.

1137
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,871
- You were giving me
more Cher Horowitz than Tai.

1138
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,740
- Oh. To me, needy
has always been spoiled,

1139
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,775
but maybe I guess
there is a difference.

1140
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,777
- Needy is not spoiled.
- Yeah.

1141
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,045
- They're
two different things.

1142
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:37,349
Needy is constantly needing
somebody to be approving

1143
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:38,650
or to tell you
how beautiful you are.

1144
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,219
- Please love me,
please tell me I'm pretty,

1145
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:44,122
that kind of insecure girl.

1146
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,891
- It's exhausting
to the person.

1147
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:46,992
- Mm-hmm.

1148
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:47,993
- I feel like
I need to reevaluate

1149
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:48,994
the definition of needy now.

1150
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:50,562
I was trying to give you,
like,

1151
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:52,030
a little bit of, like,
Farrah Moan

1152
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,498
meets, like, Kim Kardashian

1153
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,868
meets, like, kind of like
crazy girlfriend. Wah.

1154
00:43:56,868 --> 00:44:00,572
Like, that's
what I was going for.

1155
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:02,641
- Up next,
Kennedy Davenport.

1156
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:04,676
Helleer.
- Hi.

1157
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:06,411
- On the runway tonight,
it was gorgeous,

1158
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,947
and I think
it was truly Davenport.

1159
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:11,049
- It was spectacular.

1160
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:13,184
The absolute polar opposite

1161
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,220
of the character
you played on the show.

1162
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,522
- The challenge,
out of all of the girls,

1163
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:20,725
I had the hardest time keeping
a straight face with you.

1164
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,694
From the teeth to the tits
to the ass,

1165
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:25,263
you were
absolutely hilarious.

1166
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:26,431
- I never think of you

1167
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,867
as like really a comedy queen,
but you are.

1168
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:31,136
- Well, she did win Snatch Game
on her season.

1169
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:32,404
- That's right.

1170
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:33,605
- Why don't I think of you
as comedy?

1171
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:35,974
- It's probably because
of her criminal record.

1172
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,610
[ all laugh ]

1173
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,145
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1174
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:42,147
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

1175
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,415
- Hey, y'all.

1176
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:44,983
- You look beautiful
tonight.

1177
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:46,217
You took my breath away

1178
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,619
from the moment that you
stepped out on the runway.

1179
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:48,887
You just have an aura
about you

1180
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:52,123
that is just so bright,
it's really quite stunning.

1181
00:44:52,123 --> 00:44:56,061
- You have presence just
standing here right now,

1182
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,263
but then in "The Bitchelor,"

1183
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:01,132
you were constantly
overshadowed.

1184
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:03,368
- Shangela had joke
after joke after joke,

1185
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,271
but you sort of were
a spectator in the scene.

1186
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:08,139
- In that hot tub,

1187
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,474
I wouldn't even have noticed
that you were there

1188
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:10,909
until you were kissing up
on his boobies.

1189
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:13,144
- You gave it all away
to Shangela.

1190
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,580
I understand
you were playing the bottom,

1191
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,849
but if you're gonna be a bottom,
at least be a power bottom.

1192
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:18,850
- Uh-huh.

1193
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,852
- When you did have
a moment,

1194
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,755
when you leaned over
into his ear and said...

1195
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,256
- [ deep voice ]
You wanna have my baby?

1196
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:26,925
- I mean,
that was incredible.

1197
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:29,194
Where was that
for the rest of the show?

1198
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:31,162
- I don't know.

1199
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:32,197
I don't--I don't know.

1200
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:34,833
I went
and I just felt like crap

1201
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,534
compared to
all of these comedy queens,

1202
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:38,303
and I let it get to me.

1203
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:42,040
I just got so intimidated,
and it's frustrating

1204
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,441
because I don't want you
to think

1205
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:45,176
that I don't want to be here
and that I'm not trying.

1206
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,379
I don't want to upset you
for bringing me back.

1207
00:45:47,379 --> 00:45:49,848
I'm sorry, y'all.

1208
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:53,118
I'm just so sorry
that I'm not giving my 100.

1209
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:56,621
I'm letting
what they're doing affect me

1210
00:45:56,621 --> 00:46:00,425
and just me not thinking
that I'm worth it.

1211
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,927
- Chi Chi, you're worth it.
You're worth it.

1212
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,764
- Thank you, Chi Chi.

1213
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:08,733
Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

1214
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,668
I've made some decisions.

1215
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:15,306
Kennedy Davenport,

1216
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:18,576
BenDeLaCreme,

1217
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:21,146
you are the top two All Stars
of the week.

1218
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,281
[ applause ]
Con-drag-ulations.

1219
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:27,218
You've each won
a suite of jewelry

1220
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:29,888
from Fierce! Drag Jewels

1221
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:35,326
and a $1,000 gift card
from Nailed by Cristy.

1222
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:41,966
Trixie Mattel,
you are a totally fake bitch.

1223
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,804
- [ chuckles ]
- And I loved it.

1224
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,605
You are safe.

1225
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:53,545
Milk, Aja, Chi Chi,
you are in the bottom three.

1226
00:46:56,414 --> 00:46:58,550
DeLa and Kennedy,

1227
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,785
each of you
needs to decide

1228
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:04,689
which of the bottom three
you'll eliminate

1229
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,491
if you win the lip sync.

1230
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:10,595
So while you queens deliberate
in the workroom,

1231
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:15,066
the judges and I will be
twisting balloon animals.

1232
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,136
You may leave the stage.

1233
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:20,004
- Coming up...

1234
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,173
- I did not see this coming.

1235
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,508
- Girl...

1236
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,510
- I just don't think
it's my time to go.

1237
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,147
- Every week is just like...

1239
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,083
- I know what I have to do.

[RuPaul laughs]

1242

- Lord. Lord.

1243
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,560
- A cocktail, please, Jesus.

1244
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,230
- I've never been an alcoholic,
but today I'm going in.

1245
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,564
- Oh, I'm full on.

1246
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:48,066
If I could black out
right now, I would.

1247
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:51,069
Well, here we are again
with another elimination,

1248
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:54,005
and it's always
a difficult decision.

1249
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:57,242
I can attest to that
more than anyone.

1250
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:59,677
- I thought I would win,
but that's okay.

1251
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,146
- You thought
you were gonna win?

1252
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:02,514
- I did. I thought
I would be in the top,

1253
00:48:02,514 --> 00:48:04,182
and I was ready to do
my little lip sync,

1254
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:06,084
do my little song,
but I'll get, you know.

1255
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,019
I thought
I would be in the top,

1256
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:11,656
so I'm kind of trying to
wrap my head around that.

1257
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:12,991
I'm not gonna be safe
and cry

1258
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,659
because that would be,
you know, inappropriate, but...

1259
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,294
- [ laughs ]

1260
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:18,596
- Kennedy,
the full redemption, sis.

1261
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,031
- Yes, ma'am.
- Cheers.

1262
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,599
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1263
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,501
- Ben, you're also
in the top two.

1264
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,603
- Ben has won every single
challenge since we got here.

1265
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:26,604
- She going home next week.

1266

[ all laugh ]

1267
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:29,574
- Milk,
you seem really quiet.

1268
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:30,608
What's going through
your head?

1269
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,243
- I'm crying about--

1270
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,179
now I'm crying
for a legit reason,

1271
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:39,584
being in the bottom, but I did
not see this coming at all.

1272
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:42,053
- Girl...

1273
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:44,422
I think, like, Milk
in a weird way,

1274
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,058
she works
so much in her mind,

1275
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,294
almost like you convince
yourself of something

1276
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,129
even if
it's not the reality.

1277
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:53,198
I don't know,
maybe that's how she copes.

1278
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:55,166
I mean, that performance,

1279
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,068
it's, like,
how can you not tell?

1280
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:01,839
- I'm being penalized
for going 100% full throttle,

1281
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,211
and I don't 100% agree
with the critiques.

1282
00:49:06,211 --> 00:49:10,481
I thought Trixie and I had
an amazing back and forth.

1283
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,584
I really thought
I killed that challenge.

1284
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:15,486
- I don't know
how she's this delusional.

1285
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:18,056
How--somebody put something
in her cocktail.

1286
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,825
Cosby? [ laughs ]

1287
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,994
- My question
to the top two,

1288
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,763
we have three now
in the bottom.

1289
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,232
That's the gag
of the season.

1290
00:49:27,232 --> 00:49:29,767
- They did it
last season, too.

1291
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,236
- Well, to me this is a gag.

1292
00:49:31,236 --> 00:49:32,804
[ all laugh ]

1293
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:34,539
How are you going to assess
the situation?

1294
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:35,573
The two of you, are you guys

1295
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,942
gonna do one on ones
with the girls?

1296
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:39,944
- I decided not to.

1297
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:46,017
I'm just gonna do what I've said
from the beginning,

1298
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,920
and that's just
assess the whole thing.

1299
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,121
- Right.

1300
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,923
- And just make my own
professional decision.

1301
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:55,560
I do feel like
playing a fair game,

1302
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,929
and y'all already been crying

1303
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,929
and shit.

1304
00:49:57,929 --> 00:50:01,132
- That sort of
comes as a shock.

1305
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,867
Is it 'cause she's
already made up her mind?

1306
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:05,436
Is it 'cause
she doesn't want to allude

1307
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,939
to what she's about to do?

1308
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:10,008
I mean, it doesn't scare me

1309
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:14,545
because she's a smart individual
who sees it as a whole.

1310
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:18,216
- M'lady, how you feeling?

1311
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:20,518
- You know, it doesn't
feel great to be in the bottom,

1312
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,520
but I feel like I've been doing
well in the competition so far,

1313
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,056
so I feel like this is
just, like, a minor slip,

1314
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:26,357
and it happens.

1315
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,159
- Yeah. I mean, I think
you've been phenomenal.

1316
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,927
- I just don't think
it's my time to go.

1317
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:33,865
I think DeLa is going
to judge the bottom three

1318
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,199
based on our track records.

1319
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,869
So I know I'm safe because
I won the first challenge.

1320
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,305
Milk has been safe
the whole time,

1321
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:43,107
but Chi Chi has been
statistically doing the worst

1322
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:44,609
every single week.

1323
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:46,110
I mean, you put it together.

1324
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,713
- When I got here,
I thought I had this in the bag,

1325
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,081
you know what I mean?

1326
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:53,384
Like, ain't none of these
bitches gonna to upstage me,

1327
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,419
you know what I mean?

1328
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:56,554
Like, I got these looks
together, baby.

1329
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,389
I'm going back in this thing,
you know what I mean?

1330
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:03,227

1332
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:08,132
I let this challenge,
like, diminish my spark

1333
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:12,003
and question myself
whether I can do this or not.

1334
00:51:12,003 --> 00:51:14,806
I know shit bring me down,
you know what I mean?

1335
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:15,940
- But it happens
to all of us.

1336
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,642
You just gotta--
it's how quickly

1337
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:18,943
you can turn it around
and get back up.

1338
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:22,113
- I've been in the bottom
three times,

1339
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:24,916
and I'm beginning
to question

1340
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:27,251
is this
the right time for me?

1341
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,554
Maybe I should have
been on All Stars 4,

1342
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:30,722
you know what I mean?

1343
00:51:30,722 --> 00:51:32,757
Or maybe I should have
popped out of a box

1344
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,392
like Shangela on Season 10.

1345
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:38,062
I don't think I'm ready
to be here at All Stars.

1346
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:40,965
- Hi, Chi Chi.
How you feeling?

1347
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,368
- Girl, I mean--

1348
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:44,369
- Here we are again.

1349
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:45,703
- Here we go again,
you know,

1350
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,705
and, like, I don't know.

1351
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,208
I don't know if I have
what it takes to go all the way.

1352
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,342
- Yeah.

1353
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,244
- And I hate to say that,
you know.

1354
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:55,780
I want to be here just as bad
as everybody else does.

1355
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,315
- Yeah.

1356
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:59,550
- But I'm so friggin'
intimidated right now.

1357
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:04,222
I feel like the life
has been sucked out of Chi Chi,

1358
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:07,692
and, like, me personally,
I don't care what they say,

1359
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:09,260
don't say this
and don't say that,

1360
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,230
but to me, the right decision
is to be fair,

1361
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,965
you know what I mean?

1362
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:18,636
- The reality is
that the only thing

1363
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:22,240
that dampens
your confidence is--

1364
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,876
- Accepting what
somebody else is saying.

1365
00:52:24,876 --> 00:52:26,244
- Exactly.

Just make
the right decision.

1367

- Deciding who to send home
is always super hard.

00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,257
No matter what anybody says

1369
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:42,326
about whether they're ready
for their time to go,

1370
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,296
there's nobody who didn't
fight very hard to be here

1371
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:46,664
and doesn't
continue to fight

1372
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,166
once they walk through
that door.

1373
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,968
- Big and Milky.

1374
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,537
- Fire me up.

1375
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:54,939
- Well, the thing is,
I'd like to be very honest

1376
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,507
about the whole
situation, guys.

to be so, like, sugar coat,

1379

Milk is saying, like, I thought
I was going to be in the top.

1380
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,618
To me,
I thought that the top

00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,587
was going to be
you and Kennedy.

1382
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:10,822
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1383
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:11,989
- But you are
the fakest bitch alive.

1384
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,124
- Yeah.
- And to be fair,

1385
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:15,259
you probably would have
been in the top two

1386
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,028
had you been able
to land all the things

1387
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,396
that you were looking
to land.

1388
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:19,864
- Right.
- Yeah.

1389
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:20,998
It was so hard, you guys,
because he was just--

1390
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:23,034
he was, like,
yelling the whole time.

1391
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:24,368
- Yeah.
- He's, like, big

1392
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:27,405
and I'm like, ba da ba da.
It doesn't, like--

1393
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:29,040
And I could feel you guys'
energy in the moment.

1394
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,609
I was, like, fuck.

1395
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,144
- How are you?

1396
00:53:33,144 --> 00:53:34,579
- I'm in the bottom three.

1397
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:37,381
Like, what the fuck?

1398
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,549
- Yeah.

1399
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,917
- It's--I don't know.

1400
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,520
It's a shitty, shitty
situation.

1401
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,855
To be in the bottom three

1402
00:53:43,855 --> 00:53:47,925
with two queens
that didn't give a 100%,

1403
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:50,661
that were bulldozed
by their scene partner,

1404
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:51,829
and then there's me.

1405
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:54,298
I haven't made sense
of it all yet.

1406
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:56,367
Obviously
this isn't my thing.

1407
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,736
I'm not super into comedy,

1408
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,405
and so I thought
that being that way

1409
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,441
and succeeding in a way,

1410
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:06,010
that it would be, like,
wow, Milk, you did it.

1411
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,578
Just know
that I want to be here,

1412
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,280
know that
I want to continue.

1413
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,185
The judges actually want me to
continue in this competition.

1414
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:19,290
The other queens respect me
and they want me to be here.

1415
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:23,794
I am not on the level
of these bottom queens,

1416
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:27,598
and to be compared to them,
it pisses me off.

1417
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,768
But I'm feeling confident.

1418
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,969
Make good decisions.

1419
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,971
- Nope.
Never have, never will.

1420
00:54:35,673 --> 00:54:37,975
- Oh, my God,
this is so much fun.

1421
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:39,644
- Oh, my God, I love it.

1422
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:42,113
I made a dog.
- [ laughs ]

1423
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:44,248
- I got lip and I got lips.

1424
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,517
- Oh, wow,
that is hilarious.

1425
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:50,354
- [ normal voice ]
Whee, this is so fun.

1426
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,890
- I didn't know the balloons
had helium in them.

1427
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,592
- They don't.

1428
00:54:57,161 --> 00:54:58,963
- Well, that's awkward.

1429
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,932
Silence.

1430
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:02,233
[ pop ] Oh.

1431
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:04,168
- Bring back my All Stars.

1432
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:14,011
- Having to eliminate somebody
is not a good feeling,

1433
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,314
but this
is part of the game.

1434
00:55:16,314 --> 00:55:18,749
I look at the whole picture.

1435
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:21,152
I just don't look at
the performance

1436
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,187
or just
what the judge's say.

1437
00:55:23,187 --> 00:55:25,556
You gotta take everything
into account,

1438
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,358
so I know what I have to do.

1439
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:31,963
- Tonight the decision
is between three people,

1440
00:55:31,963 --> 00:55:35,600
and that just
complicates things more.

1441
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,838
There are reasons
that every girl has to stay

1442
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,808
and there are ways
in which every girl

1443
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:46,677
didn't show up for
the competition this week.

1444
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,916
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

1445
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,285
[RuPaul laughs]

1446
00:55:57,254 --> 00:55:58,422
- Welcome back, ladies.

1447
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:02,827
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

1448
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:05,529
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

1449
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:09,634
win $10,000
and earn the power

1450
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:13,904
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

1451
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,808
The time has come...
[ thunder ]

1452
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:20,311
to lip sync...

1453
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,947
[ echoing ]
for your legacy.

1454
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:26,250
- I know that
I shouldn't camp this one up

1455
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,319
because I need
to show the judges

1456
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,187
that I can do
different things.

1457
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:34,258
This is my third lip sync,
and if I don't win this one,

1458
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:38,162
then I'm at a negative
two to one ratio.

1459
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:43,000
- Good luck

1460
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:43,000
and don't fuck it up.

1461
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,872
- ? I do my makeup
in somebody else's car ?

1462
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:54,512
? We order different drinks
at the same bars ?

1463
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:56,080
? I know about
what you did ?

1464
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,618
? And I wanna scream
the truth ?

1465
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:02,053
? She thinks
you love the beach ?

1466
00:57:02,053 --> 00:57:04,488
? You're such a damn liar

1467
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:10,094
? Those great whites,
they have big teeth ?

1468
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,462
? Oh, they bite you

1469
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:14,532
? Thought you said that
you would always be in love ?

1470
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:17,368
? But you're not in love
no more ?

1471
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:18,969
? Did it frighten you

1472
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,706
? How we kissed when we danced
on the light up floor? ?

1473
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:24,075
? On the light up floor

1474
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:29,246
? Sometimes I wake up
in a different bedroom ?

1475
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:36,721
? I whisper things,
the city sings 'em back to you ?

1476
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:42,193
? All those rumors,
they have big teeth ?

1477
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:46,197
? But I hear sounds
in my mind ?

1478
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:48,532
- Whoo! All right.

1479
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:55,840
- ? Brand new sounds
in my mind ?

1480
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:01,278
? But, honey, I'll be seein' you
down every road ?

1481
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,413
- ? I'm waiting for it

1482
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,748
? That green light,
I want it ?

1483
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:06,517
- ?'Cause, honey,
I'll come get my things ?

1484
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:08,719
? But I can't let go

1485
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,020
- ? I'm waiting for it

1486
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,489
? That green light,
I want it ?

1487
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,625
- ? 'Cause, honey,
I'll come get my things ?

[ cheers and applause ]

1498
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,355
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.

1499
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,830
Kennedy Davenport...

1500
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,131
you're a winner, baby.

1501
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,800
- Whoo!

1502
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,968
- Whoo-hoo!

1503
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,904
- Con-drag-ulations.

1504

You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

1505

- Thank you.

- BenDeLaCreme,
you are safe.

- Good job, Ben.

1508
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:16,287
- Will the bottom three
please step forward?

1509
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:26,597
Kennedy, with great power
comes great responsibility.

1510
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:31,802
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

1511
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:34,805
- Oh. It was very hard.

1512
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:39,810
I had to really think about
everything that was going on

1513
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:43,080
on and off screen
to make my decision,

1514
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:47,718
and I take that wholeheartedly
as a professional.

1515
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:50,087
So I chose...

1516
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:53,958
Milk.

1517
00:59:56,861 --> 01:00:01,265
- Milk, as it is written,
so it shall be done.

1518
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:05,803
You are and will always be
an All Star.

- Thank you so much
for bringing me back.

I will continue
to make you proud.

1522
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:25,890
I will do things that
nobody else has ever done.

It's stupid.

The fact
that I was eliminated

had been in the bottom
three times...

them to be going home, but...

01:01:41,966 --> 01:01:44,201
- Well, can I trust you,

1553
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,904
- Ooh, this is so juicy!

1554
01:01:46,904 --> 01:01:48,372
- At the end of the day,

1555
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,207

don't supposed to fly.

1556
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:54,845
The struggle was real
on my end.
