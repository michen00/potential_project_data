00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,749
- ? Should be criminal

00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:18,285

00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,956
- Janet is a very
specific kind of move,

You could have worked
a little harder,

- Thorgy Thor,

00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,563
- I felt like I was looking
at Thorgy with a blonde wig on,

00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:33,133
- I was in character
the entire time,

00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,701
It's stupid, [ sobs ]

00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,204
- I think that's a lot
of emotion for safe,

- Shangela,
you're a winner, baby,

00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,543
- Yay! Thank you,

- Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:50,651
- I know what it's like to
come back to this competition

00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,487
and be sent home again
without getting the crown,

00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,389
The person I've chosen
to send home,,,

00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,825
Is Thorgy,

- Halle-loo,
am I right, ladies?

00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,212

a halle-loo moment,

She put a penis and balls,

00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,623

- Wow,

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,800
- I don't like that,

00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,801
No, that--
see, that makes me mad,

00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,002
I don't like that,

00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,170
That's just not right,

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,571
- She's a clown,

00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,540
She's--
It's a joke, obviously,

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,975
- No, I don't get it,

00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,544
- But because
you're not a clown,

00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,946
Well, you look like a clown
right now, but--

00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,681
- No, no, no,

00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,250
That's not right at all,

00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,221
- I'm devastated because
I don't quite see Kennedy

00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,057
taking drag
to an all star level

00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,559
quite like
I thought Thorgy could,

00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,693
That just means, I guess,

00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,896
Kennedy will have to be
sent home next week,

00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,531
- Maybe her feelings
are hurt right now,

00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,667
so, you know,
if that's how she feels,

00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,635
I don't hold it
against her at all,

00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,670
- I do,

00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,606
- Here's to Thorgy,
everybody,

00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,241
We love you, Thorgy,
- Love you, Thorgy,

00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,576
- Drag is fun!

00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,810
Drag is fun,

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,879
Thorgy was a sheet
in the wind, Mama,

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,982
Whatever way it could've blown,
she would've gone,

00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,119
I need loyal people
on my team,

00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,520
because, baby, if Daenerys

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,588
is gonna conquer
the seven kingdoms,

00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,656
she's gonna need allies,

00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,525
Me and my dragons
can't do it alone,

00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,193
- All right, Ben,

00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,528
Show us some lipstick,

00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,697
- I also chose Thorgy,

00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,365
- What did you base
your decision on?

00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,769
- [ sighs ] It was
a really hard decision,

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,440
I mean, it was, like,
at the final moment,

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,780
like, the final
determining factor, um,,,

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,149
- Oh, BenDeLa,
I see the wheels turning,

00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,850
She's calculating,

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,152
She's careful about
every word she says

00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,321
because she has a reputation
to uphold,

00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,556
- I don't know,

00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,024
Did you even say what your
determining factor was?

00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,826
- Oh, why it's gotta be me?
I was happy it was on you,

00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,761
- You get $10,000, so you
have to say it first,

00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,798
- There's a lot of reasons,

00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,867
but, Thorgy, yes,
she did have a smaller role,

00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,104
but there was opportunity
for her, in my eyes,

00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:26,006
like mine, I had Mariah--

00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,808
- But--
- Let me finish,

00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:31,244
When I saw what I had, I put
my own elements in there,

00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,046
- Stevie is not current,

00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,316
It's difficult
to compare that to Mariah,

00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,218
- Oh, I'm not comparing her
to Mariah,

00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,120
- I feel there were no gags

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,458
in the music part
of Stevie Nicks,

00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,326
- Oh, Miss Big and Milky,
honey,

00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,462
Season 3, Shangy would have
picked up my cocktail

00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,629
and threw it on that ho,

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,965
but as Beyonce
has taught me,

00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,735
I should be a more evolved,
grown woman,

00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,903
I just feel like

00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,041
I'm having to defend,
not explain, my decision

00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,909
specifically to you,

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,512
Correct me if I'm wrong,
Just let me know,

00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,716
So tell me what choice
would you have made?

00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,618
- I think I would have
chosen Thorgy to stay,

00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,422
I find Thorgy's concepts
and her looks

00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,157
much more exciting,

00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,326
- I mean,
let's just not sit here

00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,128
and act like

00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,128
I didn't do shit

00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,096
to deserve to be called,

00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,998
- I'm not saying that,

00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,166
- Fuck my drag, right?

00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,901
Because basically
that's what you saying,

00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,103
and you talking
like I'm not even here,

00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,438
If I'm not your cup of tea,

00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:35,075
then, baby, don't drink it,
Miss Milk,

00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,343
- Everybody's gonna go home
basically,

00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,278
and we can't be sitting here
getting mad

00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,113
about who's going home,
who's not going home,

00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,249
- It's not about mad,
it's about being an adult,

00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,585
- Step your pussy down,
Kennedy,

Take a breath, [ inhales ]

is tight,

I'm so happy
I'm not in this feud,

00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,331

You get up, you walk in,

is what I've learned

from my first
experience here

00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,253
is that every time you hear
that you're in the top,

00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,822
that is the sound
of that rollercoaster

00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,091

00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,633
- You tell everybody
you're pure,

00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,668
but you secretly
want to lose it,

00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:52,272
And finally,
Chi Chi and Shangela,

00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,809
you are our polyamorous duo,

00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,911
[ all laugh ]

00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,547
- Chi Chi, you're
more into the bitchelor,

00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,551
and Shangela,
you're more into Chi Chi,

00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,852
- Hi, Boo,

00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,455
- Now, remember,
the first rule of improv

00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:12,459
is to always agree,
to say yes to everything,

00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:17,097
For example, when I ask "Does
this Klein Epstein Parker suit

00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,332
make my ass look juicy?"
You say,,,

00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,467
All: Yes,

00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,135
- You got it,

00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,237
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,073
and may
the best All Star win,

00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,276
[ cheers and applause ]

00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,078
- How do you feel
about improv?

00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,715
- I do not consider myself,
like, a comedian per se,

00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,117
I'm excited,

00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,819
In Season 1, we never had
the opportunity to do improv,

00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,288
The character I'm playing
is the virgin,

00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,289
and I was, like,
what about

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,992
if this girl
is an African princess?

00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,195
Come on, now, You can
just make her really funny,

00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,430
I would like to approach
my character

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,267
like somebody fresh
off the boat from Africa,

00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,735
- Yeah,
- Because in our culture,

00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,138
it's like you have to be married
to be able to, you know--

00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,140
You have to be married
to be able to have,,,

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,041
[ laughs ]
I mean, it's--

00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,476
I can't even spell out
the words

00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,045
because
it's like this girl--

00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,782
- But how would you establish
the idea specifically

00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,217
of virginity other than
that you're not married?

00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,388
I think that what they're
gonna be looking for in here

00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,590
is gonna be like being
so over the top with it,

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,758
- Right,

00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,727
- What they want here
is like campy, you know?

00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,562
- Yeah, But this is hard
to go extreme

00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,599
being a virgin
and being shy,

00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,268
- I'm feeling
really worried

00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,603
about BeBe's choices
around her character,

00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,905
BeBe, up to this point,

00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,441
has just been
kind of poised and regal,

00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,811
so we'll see if she can
get down with being goofy,

00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,078
If it were me,

00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,081
I would go with the more
traditional kind of like,,,

00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,983
like, buttoned-up Catholic,

00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,785
kind of like,
"I only do anal

00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,821
because that still makes me
a virgin" kind of thing,

00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:51,558
- That would be very funny,
honey, but no,

00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,794
- I want my character
to be so fucking crazy

00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,197
that she's like

00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,197
bat shit crazy,

00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,299
that she will do anything,

00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,334
- And don't forget
insecurity, too,

00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,735
- Well, yeah,
she's insecure,

00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,237
- Yeah,
- But that's the point,

00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,939
You're so insecure
you become crazy,

00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,373
- Okay,
- Like I will fake cry,

00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,143
I will put some
Visine tears, [ cries ]

00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,578
A needy girl
is easy for me,

00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,814
My strategy is to give you
a lot of moaning,

00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,283
aww, and a lot of, like,
crying sounds,

00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,318
Aah!

00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,286
I'm just gonna be crazy
and needy,

00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,223
kind of like a rich bitch,
like, vibe,

00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,258
- Ugh, I don't think

00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,595
she understands her character
not one bit,

00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,464
- Rich bitch,
religious fish,

00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,268
I used to be a Christian
for attention fish,

00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,437
- [ sighs ]

00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,340
- We don't know
what he's gonna give us,

00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,541
But whatever he says,

00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,542
we will think of the right
response,

00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,843
- Right,
And he's super dreamy,

00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:44,944
- Oh, my God,

00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,013
- And so I would stalk him,
actually,

00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,249
- Yeah, No kidding,
- Psychotically,

00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,651
I feel good about playing
the stalker bitch

00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,653
because it's sort of like

00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,421
an easy transition
into this role,

00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,857
because before I started
dating my boyfriend,

00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,893
I stalked him on MySpace,

00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,129
and just, like, check out
who his friends were,

00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,899
and that sort of
led me to, like,

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,234
becoming friends
with his friends,

00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,770
and then being friends
with his friends

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,773
led me to meeting him,

00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,341
So I'm very confident

00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:20,113
about my role
as psycho stalker number one,

00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,548
- Hi, what's your name?

00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:25,051
- Hi, I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,

00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,586
and, yeah,

00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,355
I mean, I'm just--girl,
I don't know how to do it,

00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,190
- Come on,
you got it, you got it,

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,760
- I don't consider myself
to be a comedian

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,295
or an actress and all that,

00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,132
So looking at the other girls,
I'm getting so intimidated,

00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:43,836
Like, girl, are you going to be
able to perform at that level?

00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,039
- How are you gonna
play your character?

00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,975
- What do you mean?
You--I mean--

00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,610
- How's she gonna talk?
How's she gonna act?

00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,513
- I am shittin bricks,

00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,884
I don't know if I can come up
with that kind of funny

00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,485
just right off the bat,

00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,790
Hi, I'm, you know,
Chi Chi DeVayne, and--

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,592
- Oh, she's
the proper English,

00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,527
- She might be from England,

00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,530
but she still sound like
she from Crenshaw, too,

00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,500
- Shangela's super funny
and good at improv,

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,936
If anything, I can see her
bulldozing Chi Chi,

00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,137
I would not want to be
in a group with Shangela

00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,272
to be honest with you,
- Yeah,

00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,507
Do you think people say that
about you and I?

00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,042
- [ laughs ]

00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,210
Probably not,

When Celine doesn't win,
she cries,

00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,015
- After last week,
I think I've learned

00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,585
that being safe
is clearly not okay for me,

00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,988
Even though I thought I was
really impressive last week,

00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:38,291
I'm--now is the time
to prove myself,

00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,026
and if I don't,
and if I'm safe,

00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,795
then I'm probably
gonna cry about it again,

00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,231
- Coming up,,,

00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,434
- Are you ready for the romantic
adventure of your life?

00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,503
- Oh,
- Ooh, we here,

00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,738
- Ooh,

[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,011
[RuPaul laughs]

00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,482
- Okay, places, everyone!
Places, everyone!

00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,217
fuck it up,

00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,217
Oh, and don't

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,990
- I'm Jeffrey, and I'm here
to find the love of my life,

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,392
This is not gonna be easy,

00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,061
but it never is
in this game we call love,

00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,236

are you ready

00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,205
for the romantic adventure
of your life?

- Oh, I just want this to be
real, you know what I mean?

00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,245
- Oh, yeah, I know
exactly what you mean,

00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,953
- Do I have something
on my face?

00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,923
- Oh, look, here comes
the first girl,

00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,158
Good luck,

00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,859
- Thanks, Ru,

- Hi,

00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:59,205
- And I'm all the way
from Africa,

00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,575
And I came to America
to find my prince,

Hi, Jeffrey,

00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,678

Can I tell you
a little secret?

00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,924
- Please, yes,

00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,293
- I'm still a virgin,

00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,128
I have a special flower,

00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,930

a little sniff later,

- You don't have to call me
BenDeLa,

00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,493
- Okay,
What should I call you?

00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,028
- My friends
call me Bedtime BD,

00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,731
because I like to tuck
a big boy in night-night,

I'll meet you inside
in a few minutes, all right?

You're a beautiful driver,
I really appreciate it,

00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,176
Oh, my God,
that taxi was disgusting,

00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,410
It smelled like a barn,

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,113
He was gross, he was late,
he drove like a maniac,

00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,149
Hi, I'm Trixie Mattel,
I'm 27 years old,

and I'm from
sunny West Hollywood,

00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:19,485
And some people
might say I'm fake,

00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,587
but those people
are alcoholics,

00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,089
He's not even
that good looking,

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,391
I have to go, Hi,
- Hi,

00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,560
- Oh, my God, you're even cuter
in person than you are on TV,

00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,629
- Oh, that's
very sweet of you,

00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,030
- You kind of have,
like, this sexy,

I'm from New York City,

I kind of move around a lot
in life for legal reasons,

Is it okay if I step out?

I know
this is less than 500 feet,

Some people say
I'm, like, psycho,

00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,698

passionate about love,

to see the star
of "UnREAL,"

Oh, my God!

00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,960
When I first saw Jeffrey,
I just knew from that moment

00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,997
that I would do anything
to have him,

00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,499
I will kill someone,

00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,870
Can you believe they made me
open the door by myself?

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,172
I didn't even close it,
Should I go close it?

00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,274
- I think maybe
you better close it,

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,644
- I don't do anything
for myself,

00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,879
but for you
I'll do anything,

00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,347
- Thank you, Aja,
It's a pleasure,

- I am looking for love
with my partner

because we like
to be polyamorous,

I'm going through it
in my head,

00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:14,086
I mean, yesterday was bad,

00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,255
On Season 8, I just
doubted myself so much,

00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,324
I often asked myself, like,

00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,627
what the hell
are you doing here?

00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,963
And, like, how could I compete
with girls like this,

00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,031
you know what I mean?

00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,799
These bitches
have fabulous costumes,

00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,803
and I'm gonna walk out
in a neon bathing suit,

00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:34,506
So if it seems like
I'm a little worried, I am,

00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,041
That's why I'm quiet,

00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,777
I'm distancing myself
from the girls,

00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,615
I thought that
I had elevated my drag,

00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,417
but here we go again,

00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,352
Like,
what are you gonna say,

00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:48,987
like, what are you gonna do

00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:53,792
to, like, match these girls'
energy and funniness?

00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,460
I'm just trying
to keep a positive head,

00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,762
I'm trying to keep smiling,

00:29:56,762 --> 00:30:00,499
but at the same time,
I am nervous,

00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't want to go home,

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,635
I'm gonna show them that,
you know,

00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,738
I have what it takes
to go all the way,

00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,107
- How are you?

00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,742
- I really, really
wanna win a challenge,

00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,344
I've never even
been in the top,

00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,479
so I really hope today
it can happen,

00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,048
The first time
I was on "Drag Race,"

00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,216
I kinda just floated
until I got flushed,

00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,384
All people knew about me

00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,521
was that I did not excel
at "Drag Race"

00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,356
and didn't win
any challenges,

00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,091
and I never had
my star moments,

00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,526
This time I, like,
have to change that,

00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,528
I don't really, like,
need validation,

00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,164
but, like, to have
one good week here

00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,932
would really help the momentum
for the rest, you know,

00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,300
- I feel you,

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,669
- Being safe all the time
you start to feel invisible,

00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,971
In the real world,
I'm Beyonce,

00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,307
but in the "Drag Race" world,
I'm just a LaTavia,

00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:43,675
It doesn't matter
on "Drag Race"

00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,177
what you've done
in the real world,

00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,179
In these four
fake brick walls,

00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,981
you are garbage
until proven otherwise,

00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,517
- Is there anybody

00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,786
that either of you
are, like, concerned about?

00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,989
It's kind of hard to figure out
who the bottom two are,

00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,357
Like, I feel like--
- Oh, let's say three,

00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,426
Who would you think
the three are?

00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,962
- I mean,
if I were gonna say three,

00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,499
I would say Aja, Chi Chi,
and possibly BeBe,

00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,334
- What do you feel, Milk?

00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,736
- I'd have
to agree with Ben,

00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:13,138
- I feel like two out of three
of those are correct,

00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,906
and my third variable one

00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,308
that I kept going
back and forth on

00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:20,412
was between Aja's and yours,

00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,248
- I'm not fazed by Shangela

00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,784
thinking that I may be
in the bottom,

00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,185
That's dumb,

00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:30,255
So I'm just gonna turn my
hearing aid down a little bit

00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,857
and just, like,
let her speak,

00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,126
but I'm paying no attention,

00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,961
I thought I killed it,

00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,731
The idea of being in the top
is so exciting,

00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,199
- Well, halle-loo,

00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,168
Oh, Miss Thing,
I'm looking at her, like,

00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,371
you don't see
the writing on the wall?

00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,440
Mama, she really thinks

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,809
that she's in the top two
on this one,

00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,280
I'm cracked, [ laughs ]

00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,486
- Shit,

00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:02,754
It's just hurtful

00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,756
because I thought
we were all better than that,

00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,858
- I think I would've chosen
Thorgy to stay,

00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:12,831
I find Thorgy's concepts
and her look much more exciting,

00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:14,332
- Fuck my drag, right?

00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,967
- Bitch, your feelings
is really hurt,

00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:16,968
- Yep,

00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,603
- Kennedy is really upset

00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,971
because it wasn't right
for Milk to say

00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,840
that Kennedy
should have gone home

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,275
because her looks
weren't on point,

00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,610
because this is a competition
about more than just your looks,

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,746
And Kennedy proved this week

00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:31,149
that she deserves
to be here 100%,

00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,751
- If you don't care about me

00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:33,952
and you don't care
about my style of drag,

00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,520
you're entitled to that,

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,422
I'm upset at the fact
that we work together

00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,491
a lot of times,

00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,793
and what's hurtful
is when you feel like

00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,495
you have
this certain relationship

00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,164
with your so-called sister,

00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,000
and you come to find out
it's something else,

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,503
And they end up reading you
like a dog and stuff,

00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,271
throwing you under the bus,

00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,707
We stopped conversation
after that,

00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,311
- No,

00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,112
Not even talk to me,

00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,815
That's how I know
when people ain't real,

00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,017
I've worked
with Milk before,

00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,253
We've been on tour together,

00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,556
and I've never had a problem
with Milk ever,

00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,592
I've always liked
working with her,

00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:17,362
but now you're treating me
like you don't even know me,

00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,665
I value people's friendship,
I value sisterhood,

00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,602
and when
I really like a person

00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:28,373
and then they really show me
who they are, it's hurtful,

00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,774
- What goes around
always comes around,

00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,710
- And that's what I believe,
You're right,

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,777
- I also feel, like,
she's been, like,

00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,880
the most, like,
kind of rude,

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,947
I just feel like sometimes

00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,883
she just doesn't give,
like, some of us

00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,284
the time of the day,
you know what I mean?

00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:40,785
- Mm-hmm,
- And I'm just like--

00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,187
like, I think more so,
like--

00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,589
- Well, at least you notice it
and saying it and not me,

00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,590
- Yeah,

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,892
- I look at it like this,

00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:50,962
I'm gonna still walk this runway
in my dated as shit

00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,665

help me go on and win this,

00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,133
- Yeah,

00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,134
- And that's how I see it,

00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,813
- Your character
was so spot on,

00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,316
- If you're gonna be a bottom,
at least be a power bottom,

- What's a better way
to reveal a wig under a wig

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,699
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne,

00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,334
- Do I have something
on my face?

00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,037
- If you like it, you better
put a ring through it,

00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,038
[ all laugh ]

00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,240
- This outfit
totally represents

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,443
the new direction
that Chi Chi is going,

00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,578
- Hey,

00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:35,914
- Oh, maintain,
- Oh, okay,

00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:38,683
- I'm bringing you
all this bayou princess,

00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,752
I just hope the judges
are eating it up,

00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,587
- These have always
brought me luck,

00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,489
- Eyes up here,

00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,990
- Where do you go?
Oh, okay,

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,692
- Bye-ee,
- She's going that way,

00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,727
- Shangela,

00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,029
- Corn,

00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,864
- Ru, is it me,
or is she looking a bit husky?

00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,366
- I don't remember
eating corn,

00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,834
[ all laugh ]

00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,938
- Corn is something that will
forever be associated with me,

00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,873
Look, I'm from the country,
and I keep it real,

00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,108
Nothing says that
better than corn,

00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,044
- Ooh,

00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,779
- Oh, my goodness, popcorn,

00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,247
- You want some boy butter
on that?

00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,748
[ all laugh ]

00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,151
- You don't have
to ask me twice,

00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,787
- There may be a kernel of truth
to this dress,

00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,955
- That's right, honey,

00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,057
You better pop the corn
and feed the children,

00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,626
- G-M-Oh, no,
you better don't,

00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,296
[ all laugh ]

00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,365
- Oh, that's so stupid,

00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:30,702
- Coming up,,,

00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,204
- You were constantly
overshadowed,

00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,672
- You were terrifying,

00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,342
- What I got
was a whiny brat,

00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:39,744
- Those are really lovely words
of encouragement,

00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,580
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,949
[RuPaul laughs]

00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,451
- Welcome, All Stars,

00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,754
Based on
your improv performances,

00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:55,159
and your "unbeweavable"
main stage presentations,

00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,527
I've made some decisions,

00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,798
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward,

00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,401
Shangela,

00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,170
BeBe Zahara Benet,

00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,574
You are safe,

00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,479
Please step
to the back of the stage,

00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,546
- Thank you,

00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,050
- The rest of you

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,153
represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week,

00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,022
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,090
First up, BenDeLaCreme,

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,225
- Hi,

00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:30,862
- I loved the surprise
wig skirt reveal,

00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,463
It's tough to, like,
shock us

00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,065
when we know it's Wigs
On Wigs On Wigs,

00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,066
We know what's gonna happen,

00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,501
There's gonna be
a wig under there,

00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,735
But somehow
you managed to shock me,

00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,304
- Every piece
you stripped off

00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,273
revealed another layer
and another layer,

00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,975
and that's what you did
in your performance, too,

00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,176
You gave layers,

00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,412
I laughed so hard I cried,

00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:51,282
- As an actor, you gave me
a lot to play with,

00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,583
I had so much fun with you,

00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,987
I was equally disgusted by you
as I was turned on,

00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,790
- I keep waiting for you
to drop the ball,

00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,024
and you haven't
dropped it yet,

00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,827
- Those are really lovely words
of encouragement,

00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,097
- I wish nothing more than
you shutting me up each time

00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:09,033
by not letting that ball
or balls drop,

00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,069
- Thank you, DeLa,
- Thank you,

00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,804
- Up next, Trixie Mattel,

00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,038
- Hi, guys,

00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,773
- When you came out,
I was feeling immediately

00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,276
like if Lady Bunny
and Kesha had a baby,

00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:20,478
- Were you doing Lady Bunny?
What was that about?

00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,847
- I thought, can Lady Bunny
become Naomi's balls?

00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,615
Turns out yes,
[ all laugh ]

00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:28,519
- In "The Bitchelor,"
your character was so spot on,

00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,822
It was basically
Paris Hilton,

00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,624
- I was very impressed from
the second you walked out,

00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,560
You were on the phone and
you weren't paying attention,

00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,862
and it was like, oh,
we know exactly who you are,

00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:39,964
and it was
everything I wanted,

00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,132
- But I felt like

00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,301
you were getting talked over
a little bit,

00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,970
- We were advised to try
not to talk over each other,

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,238
It was kind of like
jump roping,

00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,474
I was kind of waiting
sometimes for the moment,

00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,608
- I felt you waiting,

00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,244
- However, when you did
get those lines in,

00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,946
they were hilarious,

00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:57,215
- All right,
well, thanks Trixie,

00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,649
Up next, Milk,

00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,118
- Hi,

00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,586
- You look gorgeous tonight,

00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:02,620
- Thank you,

00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,621
- This is a great look
for you,

00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,490
- Thank you,
- In the wig reveal,

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,959
I liked that there was
another sort of reveal

00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,293
when you pulled the pony,

00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,495
like those dolls that
I always that I always wanted

00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:11,662
that my parents
wouldn't get me,

00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,830
- Crissy Doll,
- Yeah, Crissy Doll,

00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,832
- Crissy Doll's
my favorite doll of all time,

00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,268
but we could see
the black cup holder

00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,970
underneath the blonde hair,

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,805
- Yeah, it's dark root,

00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,641
- In the challenge,
you were terrifying,

00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,443
- I know, [ laughs ]

00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,645
I was--
I was actually psycho,

00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:31,783
- But it was the same note
the whole time,

00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,985
I kept hoping that
you were going to pretend

00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,620
like you weren't a stalker

00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,989
and there wasn't anything wrong
with what you were doing,

00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,158
and you're just
a really nice, friendly person

00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,693
who happens to know
everything about you,

00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,295
Because there are times
when less is more,

00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,931
- Your foot was on the gas
the whole time,

00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,234
You were going so fast,
you weren't sharing the stage,

00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,637
- Up next, Aja,

00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,472
- Hi,
- Tonight on the runway,

00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,274
I'm going to go
out on a limb

00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:59,544
and say this right now was
the best Aja has ever looked,

00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:01,012
- Oh, thank you,

00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,713
- From the second
you walked out,

00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,750
I just said, what is that,
and I need more,

00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,753
- You're giving me
street fighter couture,

00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,455
and it's incredible,

00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,457
Yes, hyah,
- Win,

00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:13,458
- So in "The Bitchelor,"

00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:16,160
I didn't get needy girl
at all,

00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,229
not even a little,

00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,230
- Oh, my God,

00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,898
- What I got
was a whiny brat,

00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,934
and that
is not the character,

00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,471
- You were giving me
more Cher Horowitz than Tai,

00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:29,340
- Oh, To me, needy
has always been spoiled,

00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,375
but maybe I guess
there is a difference,

00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,377
- Needy is not spoiled,
- Yeah,

00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,645
- They're
two different things,

00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,949
Needy is constantly needing
somebody to be approving

00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,250
or to tell you
how beautiful you are,

00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,819
- Please love me,
please tell me I'm pretty,

00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,722
that kind of insecure girl,

00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,491
- It's exhausting
to the person,

00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:47,592
- Mm-hmm,

00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:48,593
- I feel like
I need to reevaluate

00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:49,594
the definition of needy now,

00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,162
I was trying to give you,
like,

00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:52,630
a little bit of, like,
Farrah Moan

00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,098
meets, like, Kim Kardashian

00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,468
meets, like, kind of like
crazy girlfriend, Wah,

00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,172
Like, that's
what I was going for,

00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,241
- Up next,
Kennedy Davenport,

00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:05,276
Helleer,
- Hi,

00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,011
- On the runway tonight,
it was gorgeous,

00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,547
and I think
it was truly Davenport,

00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,649
- It was spectacular,

00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,784
The absolute polar opposite

00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,820
of the character
you played on the show,

00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,122
- The challenge,
out of all of the girls,

00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:21,325
I had the hardest time keeping
a straight face with you,

00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,294
From the teeth to the tits
to the ass,

00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:25,863
you were
absolutely hilarious,

00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,031
- I never think of you

00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,467
as like really a comedy queen,
but you are,

00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,736
- Well, she did win Snatch Game
on her season,

00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,004
- That's right,

00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,205
- Why don't I think of you
as comedy?

00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,574
- It's probably because
of her criminal record,

00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:39,210
[ all laugh ]

00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,745
Thank you,
- Thank you,

00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,747
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne,

00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:44,015
- Hey, y'all,

00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,583
- You look beautiful
tonight,

00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,817
You took my breath away

00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,219
from the moment that you
stepped out on the runway,

00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,487
You just have an aura
about you

00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:52,723
that is just so bright,
it's really quite stunning,

00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:56,661
- You have presence just
standing here right now,

00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,863
but then in "The Bitchelor,"

00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,732
you were constantly
overshadowed,

00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,968
- Shangela had joke
after joke after joke,

00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:06,871
but you sort of were
a spectator in the scene,

00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,739
- In that hot tub,

00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,074
I wouldn't even have noticed
that you were there

00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,509
until you were kissing up
on his boobies,

00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,744
- You gave it all away
to Shangela,

00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,180
I understand
you were playing the bottom,

00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,449
but if you're gonna be a bottom,
at least be a power bottom,

00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,450
- Uh-huh,

00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,452
- When you did have
a moment,

00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,355
when you leaned over
into his ear and said,,,

00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,856
- [ deep voice ]
You wanna have my baby?

00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,525
- I mean,
that was incredible,

00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,794
Where was that
for the rest of the show?

00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:31,762
- I don't know,

00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:32,797
I don't--I don't know,

00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:35,433
I went
and I just felt like crap

00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,134
compared to
all of these comedy queens,

00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,903
and I let it get to me,

00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,640
I just got so intimidated,
and it's frustrating

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,041
because I don't want you
to think

00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,776
that I don't want to be here
and that I'm not trying,

00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,979
I don't want to upset you
for bringing me back,

00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,448
I'm sorry, y'all,

00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:53,718
I'm just so sorry
that I'm not giving my 100,

00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:57,221
I'm letting
what they're doing affect me

00:45:57,221 --> 00:46:01,025
and just me not thinking
that I'm worth it,

00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,527
- Chi Chi, you're worth it,
You're worth it,

00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,364
- Thank you, Chi Chi,

00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:09,333
Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,268
I've made some decisions,

Kennedy Davenport,

00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:19,176
BenDeLaCreme,

00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,746
you are the top two All Stars

Con-drag-ulations,

00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:27,818
You've each won
a suite of jewelry

00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,488
from Fierce! Drag Jewels

00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:35,926
and a $1,000 gift card
from Nailed by Cristy,

00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:42,566
Trixie Mattel,
you are a totally fake bitch,

00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,404
- [ chuckles ]
- And I loved it,

00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,205
You are safe,

00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:54,145
Milk, Aja, Chi Chi,
you are in the bottom three,

00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,150
DeLa and Kennedy,

00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,385
each of you
needs to decide

00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:05,289
which of the bottom three
you'll eliminate

00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,091
if you win the lip sync,

00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:11,195
So while you queens deliberate
in the workroom,

00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:15,666
the judges and I will be
twisting balloon animals,

00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,736
You may leave the stage,

00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,604
- Coming up,,,

00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,773
- I did not see this coming,

00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,108
- Girl,,,

00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:26,110
- I just don't think
it's my time to go,

00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,747
- Every week is just like,,,

[RuPaul laughs]

00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,492
- Lord, Lord,

00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,160
- A cocktail, please, Jesus,

00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,830
- I've never been an alcoholic,
but today I'm going in,

00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,164
- Oh, I'm full on,

00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,666
If I could black out
right now, I would,

00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,669
Well, here we are again
with another elimination,

00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:54,605
and it's always
a difficult decision,

00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,842
I can attest to that
more than anyone,

00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:00,277
- I thought I would win,
but that's okay,

00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,746
- You thought
you were gonna win?

00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:03,114
- I did, I thought
I would be in the top,

00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,782
and I was ready to do
my little lip sync,

00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,684
do my little song,
but I'll get, you know,

00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:08,619
I thought
I would be in the top,

00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:12,256
so I'm kind of trying to
wrap my head around that,

00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:13,591
I'm not gonna be safe
and cry

00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:15,259

you know, inappropriate, but,,,

in the top two,

What's going through
your head?

00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,843
- I'm crying about--

00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,779
now I'm crying
for a legit reason,

00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:40,184
being in the bottom, but I did
not see this coming at all,

00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,022
I think, like, Milk
in a weird way,

00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,658
she works
so much in her mind,

00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,894
almost like you convince
yourself of something

00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,729
even if
it's not the reality,

00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,798
I don't know,
maybe that's how she copes,

00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:55,766
I mean, that performance,

00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,668
it's, like,
how can you not tell?

00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:02,439
- I'm being penalized
for going 100% full throttle,

00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:06,811
and I don't 100% agree
with the critiques,

an amazing back and forth,

I killed that challenge,

how she's this delusional,

to the top two,

00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:26,363
we have three now
in the bottom,

00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,832
That's the gag
of the season,

00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:30,367
- They did it
last season, too,

00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,836

the situation?

The two of you, are you guys

00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,542
gonna do one on ones
with the girls?

00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,544
- I decided not to,

00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:46,617
I'm just gonna do what I've said
from the beginning,

00:49:46,617 --> 00:49:49,520
and that's just
assess the whole thing,

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,721
- Right,

00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,523
- And just make my own
professional decision,

00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:56,160
I do feel like
playing a fair game,

00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,529

00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,529
and shit,

00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:01,732
- That sort of
comes as a shock,

00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,467
Is it 'cause she's
already made up her mind?

00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:06,036
Is it 'cause
she doesn't want to allude

00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,539
to what she's about to do?

00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,608
I mean, it doesn't scare me

00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:15,145
because she's a smart individual
who sees it as a whole,

00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,816
- M'lady, how you feeling?

00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,118
- You know, it doesn't
feel great to be in the bottom,

00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,120
but I feel like I've been doing
well in the competition so far,

00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,656
so I feel like this is
just, like, a minor slip,

00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:26,957
and it happens,

00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,759
- Yeah, I mean, I think
you've been phenomenal,

00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,527
- I just don't think
it's my time to go,

00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:34,465
I think DeLa is going
to judge the bottom three

00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,799
based on our track records,

00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,469
So I know I'm safe because
I won the first challenge,

00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,905
Milk has been safe
the whole time,

00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:43,707
but Chi Chi has been
statistically doing the worst

- When I got here,
I thought I had this in the bag,

00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,681

I let this challenge,
like, diminish my spark

00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:12,603
and question myself
whether I can do this or not,

00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:15,406

is this
the right time for me?

- Here we go again,

and, like, I don't know,

00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,808
I don't know if I have
what it takes to go all the way,

00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:51,942
- Yeah,

00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,844
- And I hate to say that,

00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,380
I want to be here just as bad
as everybody else does,

00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,915

- But I'm so friggin'

I feel like the life
has been sucked out of Chi Chi,

00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:08,292

I don't care what they say,

don't say this
and don't say that,

00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,830

is to be fair,

that the only thing

that dampens

No matter what anybody says

00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,926
about whether they're ready
for their time to go,

00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:45,896

Milk is saying, like, I thought
I was going to be in the top,

To me,
I thought that the top

00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,187
was going to be

- Yeah,
- And to be fair,

00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,859
you probably would have
been in the top two

00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,628
had you been able
to land all the things

00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:18,996
that you were looking
to land,

- Right,
- Yeah,

he was, like,
yelling the whole time,

00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:24,968
- Yeah,
- He's, like, big

00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,005
and I'm like, ba da ba da,
It doesn't, like--

00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,640
And I could feel you guys'
energy in the moment,

00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,209
I was, like, fuck,

00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,744
- How are you?

00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:35,179
- I'm in the bottom three,

00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:37,981
Like, what the fuck?

00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,149
- Yeah,

00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,517
- It's--I don't know,

00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,120
It's a shitty, shitty
situation,

00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,455
To be in the bottom three

00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:48,525
with two queens
that didn't give a 100%,

00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,261
that were bulldozed
by their scene partner,

00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,429
and then there's me,

00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,898
I haven't made sense
of it all yet,

00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,967
Obviously
this isn't my thing,

00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,336
I'm not super into comedy,

00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:02,005
and so I thought
that being that way

00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,041
and succeeding in a way,

00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,610
that it would be, like,
wow, Milk, you did it,

00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,178
Just know
that I want to be here,

00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,880
know that
I want to continue,

00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,785
The judges actually want me to
continue in this competition,

00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:19,890
The other queens respect me
and they want me to be here,

00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:24,394
I am not on the level
of these bottom queens,

00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:28,198
and to be compared to them,
it pisses me off,

00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:31,368
But I'm feeling confident,

00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:32,569
Make good decisions,

00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,571
- Nope,
Never have, never will,

00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,575
- Oh, my God,
this is so much fun,

00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,244
- Oh, my God, I love it,

00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,713
I made a dog,
- [ laughs ]

00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,848
- I got lip and I got lips,

00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,117
- Oh, wow,
that is hilarious,

00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,954
- [ normal voice ]
Whee, this is so fun,

00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,490
- I didn't know the balloons
had helium in them,

00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,192
- They don't,

00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,563
- Well, that's awkward,

00:54:59,563 --> 00:55:01,532

- Bring back my All Stars,

00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:14,611
- Having to eliminate somebody
is not a good feeling,

00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,914
but this
is part of the game,

00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:19,349
I look at the whole picture,

00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,752
I just don't look at
the performance

00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,787
or just
what the judge's say,

00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,156
You gotta take everything
into account,

00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,958
so I know what I have to do,

00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,563
- Tonight the decision
is between three people,

00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:36,200
and that just
complicates things more,

00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,438
There are reasons
that every girl has to stay

00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:44,408
and there are ways
in which every girl

00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:47,277
didn't show up for
the competition this week,

00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,516
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

[RuPaul laughs]

00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,022
- Welcome back, ladies,

00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:03,427
Two top All Stars
stand before me,

00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:06,129
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:10,234
win $10,000
and earn the power

00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:14,504
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop,

00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,408
The time has come,,,
[ thunder ]

00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,911

[ echoing ]
for your legacy,

00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,850
- I know that
I shouldn't camp this one up

00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,919
because I need
to show the judges

00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:30,787
that I can do
different things,

00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:34,858
This is my third lip sync,
and if I don't win this one,

00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:38,762
then I'm at a negative
two to one ratio,

00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:43,600
- Good luck

00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:43,600

you would always be in love ?

00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,968
? But you're not in love

? Did it frighten you

? How we kissed when we danced
on the light up floor? ?

00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:24,675
? On the light up floor

00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:29,846

? I whisper things,

? All those rumors,
they have big teeth ?

? But I hear sounds
in my mind ?

Kennedy, with great power
comes great responsibility,

00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:32,402
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

- Oh, It was very hard,

00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:40,410
I had to really think about
everything that was going on

00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:43,680
on and off screen
to make my decision,

00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,318
and I take that wholeheartedly
as a professional,

00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,687
So I chose,,,
