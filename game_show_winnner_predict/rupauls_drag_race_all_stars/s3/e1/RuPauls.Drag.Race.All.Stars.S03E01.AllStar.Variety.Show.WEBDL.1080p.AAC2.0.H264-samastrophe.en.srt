00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,541
- Hey, kitty girl.
- Hello.

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,776
- Blessed weather
we're having today.

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,245
- Indeed.

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,147
Can you believe
it's already "All Stars 3?"

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,116
- Oh, blessed be.

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,652
- Do you think there will be
lots of twists and turns

7
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,255
and shocks and surprises
this season?

8
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,689
- Oh, bitch.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,925
- And do you think
some of the eliminated queens

10
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,693
will get to Ru-turn
for their Ru-venge?

11
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,028
- Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,697
Oh, my God, they're not
gonna know what hit 'em.

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,034

- Child, the Drag Race
Hall of Fame

16
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,310
really isn't what
I thought it was gonna be.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,379
- Girl, you're telling me.

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,314
[both sigh]

19
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,085
- You look really nice
in red, though.

20
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,086
- Thanks, girl.

21
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,421
- It's your color.

- Oh, honey. Whoo.

32
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,590
That's how I roll.

33
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,361
That is such
a fucking waste.

34
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,929
That would've killed
if someone was here.

35
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,764
I'm Trixie Mattel,

36
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,701
and I am the crownless drag
superstar from Season 7.

37
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,869
I came here to eclipse
people with my talent,

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,338
but also with my hair.

39
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,806
There's nobody in here.

40
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,774
It's like a Morgan McMichaels
meet-and-greet.

41
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,044
I feel like in the real world
I've been a real all star,

42
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,913
but on "Drag Race"
I was not an all star.

43
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,147
Howdy, y'all.

44
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,083
- You went
for the comedy gold,

45
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,118
but all we got was bronze.

46
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,688
- I need to make amends
for the fact that I came in here

47
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,789
and just hit the cement

48
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,092
and got dragged out
like a dead body.

49
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,326
Twice.

50
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,627
It's not about falling.

51
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,496
It's about getting back up.

52
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,871
- I..

53
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,906
just farted.

54
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,675
- [laughs]

55
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,144
- Hey, kids, Zaddy's home.

56
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,246
- Slay me, my dairy queen.

57
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,648
- Ooh!

58
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,886
The Milk fans will remember
my outside of the carton--

59
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,954
See the joke there?

60
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,023
Outside of the carton
thinking.

61
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,291
- She's got
a real nose for fashion.

62
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,626
- Hello, hello, hello.

63
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,561
I'm thinking about
wearing facial hair.

64
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,929
- Hope you're packed.

65
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,365
- I don't regret
anything that I did

66
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,535
because it got me into
a Marc Jacobs ad campaign,

67
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,537
and it got me notoriety.

68
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,840
She was cover girl,
French Vogue.

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,376
I cannot believe you
fucking showed up here.

70
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,911
Don't touch me.
- Good to see you.

71
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,648
- I very much expected
to see Trixie here.

72
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,050
- Whoo!

73
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,152
- Like myself,
she really proved

74
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,787
that she was an all star
off the show,

75
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,523
but she sort of sucks
in comparison to me.

76
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,859
- Wake up, wake up, wake up!

77
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,261
This ain't no dream.

78
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,963
I'm back, the bayou queen.

79
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,801
- Did it just get swampy
in here?

80
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,969
I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,

81
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,971
and y'all girls
better get ready

82
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,006
'cause I'm ready.

83
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,041
I told you I stay ready.

84
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,242
My mama ready.

85
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,644
Who's into glamour?

86
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,212
Who doesn't like a old
smoked turkey neck back?

87
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,748
- You turned it
completely out.

88
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,049
- Tell me why
you're out here

89
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,051
in a bathing suit
with no corset and a belt.

90
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,187
- I don't have the expenses

91
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,755
to pay
for something like this.

92
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,023
- You don't need money,
girl.

93
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,591
That's never an excuse.

94
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,326
- Hey! [laughs]

95
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,994
- Hey, baby!

96
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,565
- I was the trash bag queen
that had a heart of gold.

97
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,166
I just wasn't
polished enough.

98
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,602
But this time I got
my mind together,

99
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,270
I got my drag together.

100
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,472
It's all together, girl.

101
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,941
Oh, oh, hat coming off.

102
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,742
- Is this trash?
- Trash bags.

103
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
- I thought garbage day
was Tuesday.

104
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,547
- Chi Chi's here,
and she wore garbage again,

105
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,217
And also trash bags.

106
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,251
- Uh-oh.

107
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,519
- That hat
is your inner saboteur,

108
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,287
and I want you to let it go.

109
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,956
- [laughs]

110
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,892
Whoo!

111
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,993
- Oh, shit.

112
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,895
- [hums] Ow.

113
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,164
I think I just broke
my ankle doing that.

114
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,499
- My name is Thorgy Thor.

115
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:29,136
I was on Season 8,
and I made top six,

116
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,204
or as some of my enemies
like to say, bottom seven.

117
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,773
I'm colorful, I'm fun,
and I'm the fashion clown.

118
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,309
Whoo! I love everyone.
- [laughs]

119
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,147
- Bob, please shut up.

120
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,815
[all laugh]

121
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,216
- An issue I dealt with
on Season 8

122
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,651
is that I'm constantly
distracted by everything,

123
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,520
but I think 50% of it

124
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,788
was just because
Bob never shuts up.

125
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,425
And since the show,
I've found ways to focus.

126
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,760
Ooh.

127
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,596
I think I'm going crazy.

128
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,131
Oh, there is one.

129
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,634
Sorry. That's gonna
drive me ♪ insane

130
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,236
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes!

131
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,871
- Oh, God.

132
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,640
- All Season 8,

133
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,910
Thorgy complained
that she didn't win

134
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,512
because it was The Bob Show.

135
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,848
Okay, girl,
ain't no Bob here.

136
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,049
Let's see what you got.

137
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,384
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

138
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,652
- Can I try this?

139
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,786
- That's what
you should have come in.

140
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,388
- Oh, can I have this?
[laughs]

141
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:26,126
- Miss Thorgy Thor,
made top four, you didn't.

142
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,094
[laughs]

143
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,467
- I look pretty good
for a dead bitch.

144
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,835
- She's alive!

145
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,270
- My name
is Morgan McMichaels.

146
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,371
I'm from Season 2,

147
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,073
and I'm here
to rock the shit

148
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,142
out of "All Stars Season 3,"
babe.

149
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,411
You can't kill evil
that easy.

150
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,247
- She's a punk dude.
- Rock 'n' roll, baby.

151
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,815
I wonder what everyone's
gonna look like out of drag.

152
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,651
I hope some of you are
attractive boys like me.

153
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,087
Go fix your hair,
fix your mug.

154
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,355
- I don't need
to fix my mug, bitch.

155
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,890
- Honey, you do need
to fix your mug.

156
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,793
On Season 2, I was very blunt
with my opinions,

157
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,195
and I still kind of
have that to this day.

158
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,231
You know me, sharp-tongued.

159
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,466
- Hi!
- How you doing?

160
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,101
- Hello, beautiful.

161
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,470
- Morgan being here is
definitely intimidating.

162
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,771
She's a workhorse.

163
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,772
She probably
is the only girl

164
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,674
that works seven days a week

165
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,110
in Hollywood at every club,

166
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,546
so she's definitely
gonna be one to beat.

167
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,282
- I feel like I'm thanking
a veteran for their service,

168
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,516
because we wouldn't be here
if you weren't here.

169
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,952
- I fought for my country.
Now, what is this look?

170
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,188
- It' s my denim
Pinocchio look.

171
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,924
I'm here to inspire
future challenges.

172
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,593
- One thing I'm not a big fan of
is diva-dom.

173
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,962
I think I'm gonna have to smack
that bitch down a little bit.

174
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,297
- Good cast so far.

175
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,599
Who's gonna fuck it up?

176
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,001
[bell rings]

177
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,636
- Ayo, sis.

178
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,737
- Oh, Lord.

179
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,273
- I have some
unfinished business.

180
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,341
- Trixie,
she stole your act.

181
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,677
- No, you have
to wait there.

182
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,346
- I fuck it up
every time.

183
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,716
My name is Aja,
and I'm here to fuck shit up.

184
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,485
I'm sorry, I am.

185
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,354
- Your makeup is very dark.

186
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,456
- She could walk out there
in a fucking diaper

187
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:09,162
and they're like, Valentina,
your smile is beautiful.

188
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,330
I just don't feel like

189
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,232
you should be
Miss Congeniality.

190
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,536
- Oh, my God, hi.

191
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,138
Walking into Season 9,
I was thinking

192
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,439
and I was gonna win,

193
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,439
I was the shit

194
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,308
and I was, like,
oh, yes, I got this.

195
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,610
And then the challenges
and the runways came along,

196
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,612
and I was, like,
I don't look that good.

197
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,547
I'm not doing that good.
I'm not feeling that good.

198
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,782
And then I went home.

199
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,684
- She got
her lips done, too.

200
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,286
- I had my lips, my cheeks,
my chin, my skin.

201
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,388
I had Botox in my forehead.

202
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,290
- You're a drag queen
who got more chin?

203
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,292
- Well, bitch, I didn't
have one to begin with.

204
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,462
I was having like the Alyssa
Edwards, like, Season 5 chin,

205
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,264
like, the nonexistent one.

206
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,734
I kind of felt like
the ugly duckling of Season 9,

207
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,669
but I think in a weird way

208
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,806
it really did benefit me
to get criticized by the world.

209
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,309
I mean, look at her.
I am HD ready.

210
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,944
There is no face tune here.

211
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,012
Bitch, they're
gonna be telling me

212
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,380
my smile is beautiful.
Watch.

213
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,748
[laughs]

214
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,820
- Hi, everyone.
It's me, BenDeLaCreme.

215
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,356
Again.
[all laugh]

216
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,592
My name is BenDeLaCreme,
and I placed fifth on Season 6.

217
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,363
I am wearing
a repurposed version

218
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,932
of the gown that I wore

219
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,501
where I was crowned
Season 6 Miss Congeniality.

220
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,869
I've just been
sleeping in it

221
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,739
and spooning
my Miss Congeniality sash

222
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,974
and weeping into my
Overstock gift certificate

223
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,175
for the last four years.

224
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,810
Aah!

225
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,546
BenDeLaCreme
is terminally delightful.

226
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,349
Excuse me, we originated
the language.

227
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,084
- Bitch stole your look.
- [laughs]

228
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,953
- BenDeLaCreme Visage.

229
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,888
- This time I'm here
to get that crown

230
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,523
that I didn't get
the first time,

231
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,891
but I'm also here to show

232
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,327
that you can win
with kindness and integrity

233
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,295
rather than be a bitch.

234
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,698
Oh, crap,
is this an intervention?

235
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,699
- How you doing?

236
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,768
- Good, how are you?
- I'm very good.

237
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,202
- Ben, you're still alive.

238
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,406
She sort of fell off the face
of the earth for a while.

239
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,974
I thought
she just grew a beard,

240
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,375
ran into the woods,

241
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,078
was sort of just terminally
delightful to the squirrels.

242
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,147
- How do you feel
being back?

243
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,249
- I was super nervous
to come back.

244
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,650
- Wait.
Why were you nervous?

245
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,918
- Because I was so fantastic
the first time,

246
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,453
it was, like,
how do I live up to that?

247
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,621
[all laugh]

248
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,990
- BenDeLaCreme's
a little recycled.

249
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,258
You know, we've seen it.

250
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,093
I mean,
the Miss Congeniality dress?

251
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,294
That shit
is out the door.

252
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,896
That was
how many seasons ago?

253
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,498
Like, don't worry about
trying to be that.

254
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,866
Try to get the crown.

255
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,437
- Uh-oh.

256
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,339
- Round two, bitches.

257
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,774
Ha-ha!

258
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,609
- Yes.
[applause]

259
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,879
- I'm Kennedy Davenport
from Season 7.

260
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,415
The dancing diva of Texas
is back, baby,

261
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,151
and I'm dancing my way
to the top.

262
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,252
[pop]

263
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,923
- Newark, LaGuardia,
Kennedy Davenport.

264
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,461
- Aah! Shut up.
- [laughs]

265
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:59,232
- I've been in this business
for 17 long years.

266
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,101
I don't think
the other girls are ready.

267
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,269
That is a fucking opinion.

268
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,538
You either take it
or you don't.

269
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,041
You know what?
I can be an adult

270
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,710
and say that I may have been
a little bitchy sometimes,

271
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,879
but since the season,
things have changed.

272
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,248
I've grown.
Where are my sisters at?

273
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,951
[cheering]

274
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,219
- Yes!

275
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,788
Kennedy Davenport.

276
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,389
Male bitch.
- Hey!

277
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,626
- We have developed kind of
a mother/daughter relationship.

278
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,497
I get compared to Kennedy
all the time.

279
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,065
- You better come through,
Whoville.

280
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:36,169
- Oh, my God, the look
is white noise of ugly.

281
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,637
In fact, it's very Chi Chi.

282
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,073
I think Kennedy
is Chi Chi from the future

283
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,609
coming back to tell her
she's not gonna win "All Stars."

284
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,178
Bitch,
they are the same person.

285
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,180
- What's going on,
everybody?

286
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,515
- I'm sorry, I am just staring
at my reflection.

287
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,749
- So many mirrors.
- I know.

288
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,217
- So vain.

289
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,253
- Don't get too blind,
honey. [laughs]

290
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,821
[doorbell rings]

291
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,260
- Well, halle-who
could this be?

292
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,331
- It looks like the box
got an upgrade and so did I.

293
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,734
Halleloo, I'm back, bitches.

294
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,136
Again. Hey!

295
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,304
I'm Shangela.

296
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,639
Baby,
I'm a double kind of ho.

297
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,575
I was on Season 2 and 3.

298
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,111
You know what they say:
third time's the charm.

299
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,579
Halleloo.
Halleloo.

300
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,247
Halleloo, ladies.

301
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,816
He's so gay,
and he's so good.

302
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,219
They always say," LaQuifa,"
I say, "What?"

303
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,054
- You have
an irrepressible energy,

304
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:34,093
but can energy make up
for a lack of experience?

305
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,696
- I think the biggest
misconception about my drag

306
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,765
was that
I wasn't trying hard.

307
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,534
And I swear, girl, y'all,
I was trying my hardest,

308
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,036
but come to find out,

309
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,604
you actually
do need to know something

310
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,105
about makeup and hair
and costumes

311
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,875
in order to be a full,
well-rounded queen.

312
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,076
Oh.

313
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,744
What's up, bitches?

314
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,380
[cheering]
Halleloo to you.

315
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,317
- Oh, God.
If I fucking hear "halleloo"

316
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,818
one more damn time...

317
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,987
I cannot stand it.

318
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,288
She's a halle-lunatic.

319
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,756
- Season 2's in the house.

320
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,425
I was there, too, one day,
but I was there.

321
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,026
- Very briefly.
[all laugh]

322
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,561
- You are back again.

323
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,897
- Again.
- 47th time.

324
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,899
- 47th?
- Well, 47th.

325
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,868
Since Season 3, y'all know
I've stepped it into high gear

326
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,904
and became
a true professional.

327
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,273
I've worked in television.
I've worked in film.

328
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,308
I have been able to headline
my own show

329
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,243
on the Las Vegas strip.

330
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,612
I'm not baby Shangie
anymore.

331
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,813
Chad and Alaska,

332
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,482
baby, make room for me
in that Hall of Fame.

333
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,084
- There's our two Season 2s.

334
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,151
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,519
- Let's do
some more Season 5 girls.

336
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,654
- Eew.

337
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,755
- I feel like
there hasn't been enough.

338
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,924
[siren]

339
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,992
- Yes!

340
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,360
- Whoo, girl.

341
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,728
- What the fuck is it?

342
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,463
- No, it can't be.

343
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,399
- She done
already done had hers.

344
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,467
- Well, come on, girl.

345
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,570
- Welcome, All Stars.
[cheering]

346
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,340
This season is all about
my comeback kids.

347
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,277
Prove you've got what it takes
to go all the way,

348
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,780
and the last thing
you'll hear me say

349
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,851
is welcome to
the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

350
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,586
Henny.

351
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,888
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo!

352
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,258
- Hello, hello, hello!

353
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,826
[cheering]

354
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,728
I see
all the hookers are here.

355
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,930
[all laugh]

356
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,400
My legendary children.

357
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,835
Now, since last we met,

358
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,705
your careers have taken you
across the country,

359
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,373
around the world,

360
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,710
and today you're back
where it all started.

361
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,347
This is your chance
to make a killer comeback,

362
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,282
to rewrite herstory,

363
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,818
and to earn
your rightful place

364
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,088
in the Drag Race
Hall of Fame.

365
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,089
Y'all ready?

366
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,224
- Yes!
- Yes!

367
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,527
- Oh, oh, oh, but wait.

368
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,664
Before the race
starts officially,

369
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,635
I have just one more queen

370
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,906
I'd like to introduce
into the competition.

371
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,075
- Shangela's right there.

372
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,910
- Lock the door.

373
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,878
- Are they seriously
doing this?

374
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,347
- [laughs]
- Say what?

375
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,016
- Whoo!

376
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,352
- It's somewhere.

377
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,353
Whatever.

378
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,356
What were you saying?

379
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,393
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

380
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,995
[RuPaul laughs]

381
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,066
- I have just one more queen

382
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,502
I'd like to introduce
into the competition.

383
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,837
- What?

384
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:35,742
- All hail America's
OG drag superstar,

385
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,178
all the way from Cameroon,

386
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,682
BeBe Zahara Benet.

387
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,551
[cheers and applause]

388
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,086
- Hello, my beauties.

389
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,788
My name
is BeBe Zahara Benet,

390
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:49,856
and you may not
recognize me,

391
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,225
but I am the very first

392
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,093
crowned queen
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

393
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,663
♪ Face, face, face,
I give face, beauty face ♪

394
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,599
Cameroon!

395
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,770
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race" is BeBe.

396
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,973
- Cameroon is back.

397
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,375
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.

398
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,376
Didn't she already win?

399
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,012
- I know
what you're thinking.

400
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,114
She done already
done had hers.

401
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,182
- Exactly.

402
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,185
- But 2009
was a very different time.

403
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,488
BeBe had to deal
with that Season 1 filter.

404
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,023
Remember that?

405
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:28,060
The grand prize
was a measly $20,000.

406
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,264
Hell, the Internet hadn't
even been invented yet.

407
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,133
BeBe,
are you ready to inspire

408
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,569
a whole new generation
of "Drag Race" fans?

409
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,239
- Mother, another day,
another slay.

410
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,340
Who's first?

411
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,842
- Ooh.
- Oh.

412
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,076
- [laughs]

413
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,779
- I am completely
intimidated.

414
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,415
That's like
if Ru just was like,

415
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,850
I'm gonna throw my hat
in the ring.

416
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,451
I'm competing
this year, too.

417
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,353
- She's already
had the crown.

418
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:55,721
Why does she need
another one?

419
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,789
Grandma, sit down.

420
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,858
Let us other bitches
have a crown.

421
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,396
- Ladies, if BeBe
goes all the way,

422
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,932
she'll be the first queen
in "Drag Race" herstory

423
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,001
to snatch two crowns.

424
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,471
But who stays and who goes,
well, that's up to you.

425
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,775
"All Star" rules
are in full effect.

426
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:20,646
Each week the top two queens
will lip sync for their legacy.

427
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,783
The winner will receive
a $10,000 tip,

428
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:28,921
plus the power to eliminate
one of her fellow queens.

429
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,992
- Baby,
this is "All Stars 3."

430
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,427
The rules are rough.

431
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,796
You don't have the opportunity
to save yourself.

432
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,331
You rely on other people.

433
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,400
So there's no space
for mistake. None.

434
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,438
- Keep your friends close
and your enemies even closer.

435
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:48,474
Because when it comes
to "All Stars,"

436
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,110
it do get shady up in here,
am I right?

437
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,445
- Hello.

438
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,348
- Now let's take a moment
to get reacquainted.

439
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,049
Oh, pit crew.

440
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,552
- Oh!
- Hey!

441
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:04,624
- That's right, ladies,
the library is open,

442
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,559
because reading is what?

443
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,728
[All] Fundamental.

444
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,764
- I can't wait to see
how this turns out.

445
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,635
First up, Thorgy Thor,
come on down.

446
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,903
- Whoo!

447
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,105
- Wait. Do you know
where my wallet is?

448
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,706
- What?
- Chi Chi, didn't you take it

449
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,642
when you stole my spot
in the top five of Season 8?

450
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,144
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

451
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,979
- Shangela is the most annoying
thing I've ever met in my life.

452
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,248
She's like a pull-up toy
that says Halleloo,

453
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,583
but the only thing
more annoying than Shangela

454
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,151
is Bob the Drag Queen.

455
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,120
- Oh.

456
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,388
- Just my opinion.

457
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,390
- By the way, Ru,
do you know me and Aja

458
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,624
used to work together
in Brooklyn?

459
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,759
- No, I didn't know that.

460
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,460
- Do you know
she's a straight-up witch?

461
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,762
She cast a spell
on the producers.

462
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,263
How else do you think
she ended up on "All Stars?"

463
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,198
- Oh!
- Oh!

464
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,267
- Miss Thorgy Thor.

465
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,969
Girl, what the fuck
you got on your head?

466
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,337
[all laugh]

467
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,805
- Christmas with the Kranks,
honey.

468
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,740
[all laugh]

469
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,809
- Big and milky,

470
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,045
girl, just like the drink,
you give me the shits.

471
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,579
[all laugh]

472
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,814
- Me, too.

473
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,750
- Aja, welcome
to the big leagues,

474
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,320
where Charlotte Russe
and Forever 21

475
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,888
won't cut it, little girl.

476
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,990
[all laugh]

477
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,693
- BenDeLaCreme,
where you been?

478
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,861
- Ooh.
- [laughs]

479
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,163
- Like, literally,
where you been?

480
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,698
- Oh, Seattle.

481
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,932
- [laughs]

482
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,068
- It's okay.
I'm gonna Sia this bitch.

483
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,337
[all laugh]

484
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,973
Kennedy Davenport,

485
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,742
the only queen
that doesn't have to turn

486
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,478
to look both ways
before crossing the street.

487
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,580
[all laugh]

488
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,848
- I hate you.

489
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,652
- Shangela. I always thought
her name was Angela,

490
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,088
and people were just
telling her to shut up.

491
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,624
[all laugh]

492
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,494
- Chi Chi DeVayne,
girl, with that mouth,

493
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,463
you could've put Black & Decker
out of business, bitch,

494
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,198
'cause you a mouthful
of tools, honey.

495
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:54,266
[all laugh]

496
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,334
- Kennedy Davenport.

497
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,969
- Be gentle, sister.

498
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,071
- You seem a little offended
by our little jokes.

499
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,674
We weren't offended
by your parents' little joke.

500
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,543
- Aah
- Ooh!

501
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,545
- Thorgy Thor,
you know, I love clowns.

502
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,913
- Uh-huh.

503
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,149
- And I never met an unfunny one
till I heard you read it.

504
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,617
- Oh!

505
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,952
- The low-rent
Michelle Visage,

506
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,653
sister,
it's nice to see you here.

507
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,955
It's nice
to see you anywhere

508
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,923
considering you've been
unemployed since Season 6.

509
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,058
[all laugh]

510
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,761
Morgan McMichaels,
sister, I know

511
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,963
you love to perform
hard rock music,

512
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,499
and that's good because
that face is also a hard rock.

513
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,701
[all laugh]

514
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,236
- Aja.
- Oh.

515
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,804
- You're beautiful,
you're gorgeous,

516
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,872
you look like Seal.

517
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:36,509
[all laugh]

518
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,077
Wow, Milk, you put a lot
into this look.

519
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,613
What, 2%?

520
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,549
Shangela.
- Hey!

521
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,184
- What if this season
we put you in a box?

522
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,153
'Cause you're gonna
halle-lose.

523
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,522
[all laugh]

524
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,357
- BeBe Zahara Benet,

525
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,325
you look like
an overweight Naomi Campbell.

526
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,461
- Aah!
[all laugh]

527
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,164
- Morgan McMichaels, I would
take the A out of your name

528
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,432
and replace it with an O

529
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,333
because I'm pretty sure
we'd like you Mor-gone.

530
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,269
- [gasps]
- What?

531
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,138
- Trixie, you look like
a Lisa Frank serial killer.

532
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,940
- I will take that.

533
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,175
I'm from Wisconsin.

534
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,911
- It's an aesthetic.
- Oh, Lord.

535
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,914
- Well, I'm very excited
to read all of my sisters.

536
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,516
Oh, Thorgy,
I love this full outfit.

537
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,485
I usually only get to see
about this much

538
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,387
when you're handing out balloons
from that sewer grate.

539
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,322
[all laugh]
- Oh, my God.

540
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,526
- Shangela,
you have come so far.

541
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,662
Initially your makeup
was kind of busted

542
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,163
and your outfits
were a mess

543
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,965
and your personality
was super grating,

544
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,867
but look at how far
you've come now.

545
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,202
You are much older.

546
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,237
[all laugh]

547
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,674
Trixie, you know, a lot
of people clock your makeup,

548
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:43,409
but I totally get it.

549
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,444
You know, you're just painting
for the back of the room,

550
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,414
which makes sense because that's
where your audience collects

551
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,949
if you remember
to lock the door.

552
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,450
[all laugh]

553
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,720
- And, BeBe, I hear
that this is the year

554
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,722
that you might
get two crowns,

555
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,058
which is really not
a lot of dental work

556
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,460
as far as those early seasons
are concerned.

557
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,729
[all laugh]

558
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,164
- Thanks, Mother.

559
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,966
[clears throat]

560
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,068
Thorgy Thor.

561
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,770
Mother, she looks homeless.

562
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,473
You know, I'm not gonna read
Morgan McMichaels.

563
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,775
Life already has.

564
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,980
Everybody,
I'm the only African here,

565
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,182
but why it does look like
with Kennedy Davenport

566
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,751
you can sponsor her
for 30 cents a day?

567
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,587
[all laugh]

568
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,556
- Ooh, somebody burned out
a light.

569
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:31,824
It's shady in here.

570
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,926
- [laughs]

571
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,162
- The library
is closed officially.

572
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,696
- Thank you.

573
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:41,467
- The winner of today's
mini challenge is...

574
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,835
BenDeLaCreme.

575
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,970
[cheers and applause]

576
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,140
You've won
a $3,000 gift certificate

577
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,676
from l.a. Eyeworks.
- Oh.

578
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,046
- So Miss Congeniality
won the reading challenge.

579
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,549
Some of the queens
are underestimating

580
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,883
what I'm bringing
to this competition,

581
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,386
and I'm gonna
prove them wrong.

582
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:05,224
- And I will be posting more
of your reads at VH1.com.

583
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,760
All right. Ladies,
it's time to get ready

584
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,162
for your big comeback
to the main stage.

585
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,264
For this week's
maxi challenge,

586
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,501
you'll be headlining
an All Star Variety Show.

587
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,170
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

588
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,273
- Tomorrow, in front of
a live studio audience,

589
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,676
you need to show that
your charisma, uniqueness,

590
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:28,847
nerve and talent, is bigger,
fresher, and better than ever.

591
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,716
#AllStars3.

592
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,652
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

593
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,622
and may the best
All Star win.

594
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,557
[cheers and applause]

595
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,461
- I need to get
the fuck outta drag.

596
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,997
- This was Pearl's spot,
and she skated by,

597
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:48,534
so I'm looking to inherit
that energy.

598
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,436
- [laughs]
Bitch, you got jokes.

599
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,038
- Guys, BeBe's back.
- Mother.

600
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,206
- Winner, winner
chicken dinner.

601
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,443
More great things
are happening for you.

602
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,578
- Do you think you have a good
chance of winning this season?

603
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,614
- Everybody's competition,
but I'm here

604
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,716
to really, really
get to share my gifts,

605
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,850
and also
to be able to learn

606
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,652
from the all other girls
I have not worked with,

607
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:09,355
because everybody
has something special.

608
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,590
That sounds like
an Oprah moment, but it's true.

609
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,692
- BeBe's never really
experienced a hardship

610
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,927
on "Drag Race."

611
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,862
She hasn't had a bad moment.

612
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,063
It's actually scary
to be her.

613
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,532
- If you have a good experience
on "Drag Race,"

614
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,502
it's like so terrifying
to come back.

615
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,737
- Oh, there's more to lose.

616
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,505
- Absolutely.
And I have to say

617
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,641
that I really thought
Valentina was gonna be here.

618
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,709
- Me, too.
- And I am disappointed,

619
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,613
because I am now like
the Miss Congeniality

620
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,348
who, like,
if I'm like a bitch,

621
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,183
that's gonna look terrible.

622
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,785
But if Valentina was here,
she's just like already

623
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,154
automatically the worst
about that.

624
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,656
- I like Ben.

625
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,825
I just think
she can come across

626
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,862
as trying to be congenial,

627
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,998
but I don't think that
that's actually who she is.

628
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,601
I think
she will be congenial

629
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,202
to get
exactly what she wants.

630
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:06,111
- Trixie, are you making
a porno for your talent?

631
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,247
- No, I'm gonna play violin
in a red clown wig.

632
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,382
It's kind of my thing.
- Very funny.

633
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,718
The first challenge
is very, very important

634
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:13,852
because in "All Stars,"

635
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,388
it's about impressing
your competition,

636
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,691
so you really have to come out
as a front runner right away.

637
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,125
- What are you doing
for talent?

638
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,127
- I'm drag dancing it out.
What are you doing?

639
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,064
- Come through.

640
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,632
- I've never done it
before, so...

641
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,633
- Very good.
- And what are you doing?

642
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,101
- Just one of my songs.

643
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,469
- She's also
performing a song.

644
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,006
- A lot of the queens are doing
basically the same thing,

645
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,342
lip syncing or dancing

646
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,377
or singing
one of their original songs.

647
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,146
As long as I do well
with the violin playing

648
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,383
and my strings don't explode,
I'm gonna win. Whoo!

649
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:49,021
- How do you feel about
the whole elimination setup?

650
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,556
- I like it.
- Do you?

651
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:51,890
- I'm just gonna
send the bitch home

652
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,359
that I think
is the strongest.

653
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,593
- Really?

654
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,262
- That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

655
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,831
- That is terrifying.

656
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,399
- Well, the thing is,
I mean, why lie about it?

657
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:03,402
Like, you know, everybody
played Kumbaya last year,

658
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:07,906
and it was like, oh, here.
Tch, tch, tch, tch.

659
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,975
We are all friends,
we are all sisters,

660
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,445
but, like, at the end
of the day, $100,000.

661
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,848
My strategy
for sending girls home--

662
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,016
it isn't shady,
it is honest.

663
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,118
This is a game.

664
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,552
You have to play it
to win it,

665
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,255
and I love the girls,
but I want to win.

666
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,857
- I feel like it would be
like career suicide

667
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,158
to look
straight in the camera

668
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,060
and say, that person
is my biggest threat, go home.

669
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,495
- But you don't
just have to deal with,

670
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,696
like, what other people's
response is.

671
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,897
You have to deal with, like,

672
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,899
how you feel about how you won
or didn't win.

673
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,134
- But if you're honest,

674
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,636
then there's no fast one
being pulled.

675
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,305
If you're straight up
from the jump,

676
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,908
then there's no--
there's no mincing of words,

677
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,443
there's no mixup
in your communication.

678
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,644
- It's hard, though,

679
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,446
because it's like a room
full of fan favorites.

680
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:48,981
- With the exception of me.

681
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,116
- That's true.
- [laughs]

682
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,084
- But it is. I mean--

683
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,185
- No, like the T, yeah.

684
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,220
- Everybody in here
is a fan favorite,

685
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,456
except I'm not worried
about that.

686
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,624
- Morgan is talking about

687
00:25:58,624 --> 00:25:59,992
she's gonna eliminate
the strongest queens

688
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,326
to knock out
the competition.

689
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,695
Sweetie,
that's a great strategy

690
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,063
that you should not
have said out loud

691
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,498
in front of
all these queens.

692
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,700
- Would you say that it's not
"RuPaul's Best Friend Race"?

693
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,502
- Well, LaShauwn said it,
I didn't.

694
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,138
- Coming up...

695
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,007
- Everybody
is getting along.

696
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,342
Oh, I love you,
kissy, kissy, kissy.

705
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,828
- Today's maxi challenge

706
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:38,897

Stars" Variety Extravaganza.

tongue popping. Don't worry.

- How are you doing?

709
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,338
- Of course everybody
is getting along.

710
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,773
Everybody is Kumbaya,

711
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,242
everybody is Mother Teresa,
Gandhi.

712
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,878
Oh, I love you,
kissy, kissy, kissy.

713
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,379
But we all know
how this works.

714
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,315
It will be very interesting

715
00:26:56,315 --> 00:27:00,552
to see if all of this
sisterly love stays.

716
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,057
- Well, I'm just hoping
that I am not in the bottom

717
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:07,259
because every season
I've been on,

718
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,261
I was in the bottom
on the first episode.

719
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,797
- But one person
has to go home today.

720
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,299
I mean, it's always scary
like the very first elimination.

721
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,667
- [gasps] I'm shook.

722
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,403
- It sucks, but somebody
gotta do it, bitch.

723
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,306
Tonight
is the first elimination,

724
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,909
and it's all up
to the girls.

725
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,411
Right now you just don't know
how it's gonna go.

726
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,213
There's no set guidelines.

727
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,516
And then what if
we set the guidelines

728
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,418
and somebody steps
outside of those guidelines?

729
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,188
It just...
it wrecks my nerves.

730
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,359
- I think that we as a group

731
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,194
have generally gotten along
really, really well so far,

732
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:45,163
but I think people's true colors
will start to show

733
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,666
the minute the top
and the bottom are announced.

734
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,902
I think the claws
are gonna come out tonight.

735
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,103
- I want the claws
to come out.

736
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,237
- Me, too.
I like the drama.

737
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,539
- I think it'll be so fun.
I love drama.

738
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,607
- I'm always intrigued
because the fans are, like,

739
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,543
oh, you're the nice one,
you're the bitchy one.

740
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,011
I'm, like, baby, you realize

741
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,246
that drag queens
encompass everything, right?

742
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,583
Like, yes, I'm a little more
viper-tongued.

743
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,086
- You're such a meanie,

744
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,988
but I don't think
you are at all.

745
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,456
- Morgan is one of the nicest
people I've ever met.

746
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,458
- I really, like,
love you, Morgan.

747
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,693
- Oh, thanks, babe.

748
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,694
I'm just me.

749
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,298
- Do you know what?
I actually think

750
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,466
"Drag Race"
is more stressful

751
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,236
than any drag experience
I've ever had in the real world.

752
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,638
I think I spent the whole time
the first time on "Drag Race"

753
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:29,408
saying "I'm not scared,"
even though I was.

754
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,511
- Last time
I got really in my head,

755
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,713
and when I didn't do as well
as I thought I was gonna do,

756
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,815
I thought it was, like,
a reflection of my worth.

757
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:40,719
And Milk saw me, like, before
the show aired after our season.

758
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,220
- Yeah, she was in a mood.

759
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,655
- I was shook.

760
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:47,192
When I was eliminated,
I was devastated.

761
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:51,730
I felt like the air was
being sucked out of my lungs.

762
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,865
But this time around
I'm here to prove

763
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,835
that I can get through
anything that's thrown at me

764
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,337
without getting rattled
by it.

765
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,610
- Who did you gag on coming
into this room, honey?

766
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,845
- Aja, because
she just left the season.

767
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,146
So it was like--

768
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,481
- Are you surprised
to see me?

769
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,515
- Yeah.

770
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,750

you were just so new.

got off the boat, bitch.

Bitch, you fresh meat,
bitch, so...

773
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,390
- But she just got off
the "Drag Race" boat,

774
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,492
but she's been doing drag
for like six-and-a-half years.

775

- We're not talking
about that.

a little piece in there.

about that, Miss Thang.

- Be nice, bitch.

I'm mean, girl.

782
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,940
- You still mean, girl.
You're still mean.

783
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,676

are gonna underestimate me,

is underestimate me

00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:21,425
- Consider it burnt.
[all laugh]

1046
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,028
- Up next, Thorgy Thor.

1047
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,563
- Hi, guys.

1048
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,965
- You look amazing.
I love this jumpsuit.

1049
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,001
It's so chic and beautiful.

1050
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,136
- It's very Halston, Liza.

1051
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,871
It's gorgeous.

1052
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,073
- And a Phyllis Diller wig.

1053
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,442
- I had never heard "Sissy
That Walk" played on the violin.

1054
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,144
- [laughs]
- That was incredible.

1055
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,480
- It's absolutely amazing

1056
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,949
to see you marry
classical music and drag.

1057
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,618
- But at the same time,
you seemed a little bashful,

1058
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,819
kind of like, well...

1059
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:51,622
And I want to see you,
like, own it more.

1060
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,926
Like, I want to see
your fierceness a little more

1061
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,427
'cause I know
that you have it in you.

1062
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,462
- All right. Thank you
for that challenge.

1063
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:01,032
- Up next, Aja.

1064
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,466
You look like a model.

1065
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,403
- Did you stone
those tights?

1066
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:08,039
- [laughs]
- I like the many reveals.

1067
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,473
I thought it was beautiful,

1068
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,875
and it was just
really good drag.

1069
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,811
- Aja, I remember being
very frustrated in Season 9

1070
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,680
because I felt like I wasn't
getting enough of you.

1071
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,249
You raised the bar today,

1072
00:45:18,249 --> 00:45:19,784
and then
you jumped off of it.

1073
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:22,219
- Aah!
- You really brought it.

1074
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,287
I'm so into vogueing
right now,

1075
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,157
so that gave me life,

1076
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:28,526
and that jump,
it was just insane.

1077
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,861
- This is what I was waiting for
all of Season 9.

1078
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,229
- What's changed?

1079
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,631
- I don't give a fuck
what anybody thinks about me.

1080
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:36,534
This is me, and if somebody
has a problem with it,

1081
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:38,970
then that's a you problem
and not a me problem.

1082
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,905
- That's right.
You just jump on their ass.

1083
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,239
[all laugh]

1084
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,041
Thank you, Aja.

1085
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,476
All right, next up,
BenDeLaCreme.

1086
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,510
- Hi.

1087
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,945
- You're so beautiful.

1088
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,281
- I know, right?
[all laugh]

1089
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,650
- You look stunning
head to toe.

1090
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,086
The little fascinator, the
jewelry, the color you chose,

1091
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,288
and then you give us comedy

1092
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,690
when you did the Ukrainian
nesting dolls of bras

1093
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,626
that kept coming.

1094
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,160
I was waiting
for one of Gorbachev.

1095
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,096
- I think
you're just the tits.

1096
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,564
I do.

1097
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,065
You know, there are
certain queens come up here

1098
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,867
and you go, I cannot wait
to see what they do.

1099
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,136
You're one of them.
- Thank you.

1100
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:13,437
Tch, tch.

1101
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,239
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

1102
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,507
- Hey, y'all.

1103
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,676
- You look beautiful.
Your face looks beautiful,

1104
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:22,213
but all I kept doing
was looking at the shoes.

1105
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:25,182
You have to have
some kind of a heel,

1106
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,952
because it immediately
crunches you.

1107
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,087
- I have to agree
with Michelle.

1108
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,355
Those shoes were killing me.

1109
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,290
I know you have to have
a certain kind of shoe

1110
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,592
to do what you were doing.
- Yeah.

1111
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:35,993
- But I've seen
you do acrobatics.

1112
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,395
- In heels.
- Yeah, girl.

1113
00:46:37,395 --> 00:46:40,131
- And I could've just easily
just put on a six-inch heel

1114
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,732
and still
worked something out.

1115
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,134
It was just a bad decision.

1116
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,169
- I was not in love
with the hair.

1117
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,871
I felt like
it was getting in the way

1118
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:49,106
of the performance a lot.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1119
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,141
- I think
for the performance,

1120
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,475
you gotta amp it up
a little bit.

1121
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,277
- It was almost like
down here

1122
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:54,879
when the rest of the girls
were taking it up there.

1123
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:57,148
And I know that
you have what it takes,

1124
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,251
so I want you
to push it there.

1125
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:03,220
- Up next,
Morgan McMichaels.

1126
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,290
- Finally I get to get judged by
the notorious Michelle Visage.

1127
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,693
- Notorious, yes, darling.

1128
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,127
You look amazing.

1129
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:12,663
Out of the four
spangled bodysuits,

1130
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,799
yours is above and beyond
my favorite.

1131
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:17,935
- I mean, the shoulder details,
all of the embellishment,

1132
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,104
the colors, the iridescence.

1133
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,806
Really well done.
- Thank you.

1134
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:23,274
- But when
you were performing,

1135
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,042
I felt like your nerves got
a little bit too good of you.

1136
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,777
Because I found you

1137
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,714
almost doing the entire thing
over to the girls.

1138
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:31,749
- Um, I had never recorded
a track before,

1139
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,617
so I was shitting it
a little.

1140
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,319
- I get to see you
in Palm Springs all the time,

1141
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,623
and nobody owns a room
like Morgan McMichaels.

1142
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,692
It's like everybody
in the club disappears

1143
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,261
and I see is you because
you're in charge of me.

1144
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,464
- I charge for that.
[all laugh]

1145
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,666
- So any self doubt,
knock it off,

1146
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,168
because anything less than 100
is not good enough.

1147
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,637
- You heard it here.
Don't take less than 100.

1148
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:57,341
[all laugh]

1149
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,177
Thank you, ladies.

1150
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,713
Based on
the judges' critiques,

1151
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,749
I've made some decisions.

1152
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:08,686
Aja,

1153
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,287
BenDeLaCreme...

1154
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,092
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

1155
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,628
Con-drag-ulations.

1156
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:21,832
You've each won airfare
and a five-night stay

1157
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:26,270
at the Grand Resort Hotel
and Spa in Fort Lauderdale.

1158
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,005
Clothing optional.

1159
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,441
- Perfect.
[all laugh]

1160
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,643
- Shangela,

1161
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:33,677
Thorgy Thor...

1162
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,615
You are safe.

1163
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:42,119
That means Chi Chi DeVayne
and Morgan McMichaels,

1164
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,555
you are in the bottom two.

1165
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:45,656
- Oh, shit.

1166
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,591
First episode,
in the bottom.

1167
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,961
I've worked so hard
to be here on "All Stars,"

1168
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,197
and I do not want to go home,
like, at all.

1169
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:55,466
Like...

1170
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:57,468
Oh, God.

1171
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,870
- Aja and BenDeLaCreme,

1172
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,406
each of you needs to decide

1173
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,243
which of the bottom two
you will eliminate

1174
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,846
if you win the lip sync.

1175
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:12,716
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

1176
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:17,021
the judges and I will watch
Vanessa and Pork Chop

1177
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,856
lip sync for their lives.

1178
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:20,925
[all laugh]

1179
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,293
You may leave the stage.

1180
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,128
Coming up...

1181
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,497
- I really wish you would
have gave Morgan--

1182
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,365
- Yeah.
- Like 1,000%.

1183
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,834
I'm about
to ruin somebody life.

1184
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:31,502
- I know that you're capable
of stronger work

1185
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:32,536
than you did tonight.

1186
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,639
- Yeah.
- But sometimes you're done.

1187
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,741
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

1188
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,544
[RuPaul laughs]

1189
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,080
- Whew.
Thank you.

1190
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,348
- This is "All Stars."

1191
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:47,351
The lip sync for your legacy
rules are in effect,

1192
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,254
and we have to eliminate
one of these queens already,

1193
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:53,457
and I don't think anyone's
really ready for it.

1194
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,226
- Well, first,
congratulations.

1195
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:56,560
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1196
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,329
- Cheers, top two.

1197
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,664
- It feels insane because
I never was even in the top.

1198
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,534
In my season, like,
I never went past safe.

1199
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:04,935
- You're only gonna get it once,
so enjoy it.

1200
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,203
- Fuck off.
[laughs]

1201
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,439
- You're in a horrible position
right now, you guys.

1202
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:09,607
- I mean,
it's not great, right?

1203
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,743
Like, this is the worst
double-edged sword.

1204
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,613
It is really exciting
to win this challenge.

1205
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:19,416
However,
I wanna judge fairly,

1206
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:22,553
and playing fair
does not involve eliminations

1207
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,955
that you think are just
gonna help you personally.

1208
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:28,292
This sucks.
- You have to pick somebody.

1209
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,294
- We have to because it's like
we'll never get anywhere

1210
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:32,696
if we're just like
hugging each other.

1211
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,331
Girl, I'm okay
with sending people home

1212
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,634
because
it's a part of the gig.

1213
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,868
We signed up for it.

1214
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,037
- Just think of it
as like a business decision.

1215
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,405
- So as this goes on,

1216
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,208
are you guys gonna go on,
like, the performance that day,

1217
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,442
the performance
on the show overall?

1218
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,577
- It should be
a combination.

1219
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,678
- I'd like to know

1220
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:51,482
if we all have any system
or code in place

1221
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,350
for how we would like
to make our decisions

1222
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,418
from this night on.

1223
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,487
Are we going off
the judges' critiques?

1224
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:58,055
Like, they sort of came

1225
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,624
to a little bit
of a consensus last season.

1226
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,927
- Okay.
So Miss DeLa apparently

1227
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:05,129
is suffering from
the short-term memory loss.

1228
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:07,064
Did you see "All Stars 2?"

1229
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,133
The whole group consensus thing
didn't work out.

1230
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:12,036
Yes, we would all love
to be fair,

1231
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:13,070
and I think
we should be fair.

1232
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,772
I will respect
the choice you make,

1233
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:16,373
and you should do
the same for me.

1234
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,409
- Underlying, we agree with
the judges most of the time.

1235
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,576
- Yes.
- No.

1236
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,745
- I think everything
has to come into play.

1237
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,248
We should look at
the whole picture.

1238
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,383
- As of now,
the elimination strategy

1239
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,585
is definitely
a free-for-all.

1240
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,421
Who knows
what's gonna happen?

1241
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,090
- Can we all agree
that if one of us

1242
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,093
lets the other borrow their
gross rhinestone tank top,

1243
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,761
that we won't save them?

1244
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,663
- Aah!
[all laugh]

1245
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,901
- I would like to take a moment
with Morgan and Chi Chi.

1246
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:45,002
- If that's okay with y'all.

1247
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,003
- Yeah, that's cool.

1248
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,104
- Unless y'all wanna fight.

1249
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,073
If y'all wanna fight,
we'll fight.

1250
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,344
- All right.

1251
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:55,279
- Hi, how are you?

1252
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,780
- It is what it is.
- Yeah.

1253
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,149
- Somebody gotta go home first,
you know what I mean?

1254
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,453
When it all boils down to it,
I fucked up,

1255
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,756
but I don't want you
to feel like I'm giving up.

1256
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,325
I've always been a fighter.
I've fought my whole life.

1257
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,760
I fought to get here.

1258
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,962
- I do think you're
a super fierce competitor,

1259
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,897
and I know
that you're capable

1260
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:15,265
of stronger work
than you did tonight.

1261
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,267
- Yeah.
- But sometimes you're done,

1262
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,103
and that's okay,
you know what I mean?

1263
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:21,305
Because you have a full career
ahead of you no matter what.

1264
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,906
- I don't want to go home

1265
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:25,642
because I feel like I still
have something to prove,

1266
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,846
but I'm really not counting
on DeLa to have my back.

1267
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:35,185
- I haven't been on "Drag Race"
since 2010.

1268
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,154
I've wanted this
for so long

1269
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,323
because I have
so much more to give

1270
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,624
and so much more to show,

1271
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,460
and now the chance
that I might be going home,

1272
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,095
that's the kick in the tits.

1273
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,397
- This is the T.

1274
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:47,498
You're such a bitch.

1275
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,066
Like, you could literally
point at someone

1276
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,934
and make them feel like
they're gonna fucking die.

1277
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:56,140
But I really wish you would
have gave Morgan, like, 1,000%.

1278
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,175
- The reason why
I was reserved

1279
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,510
was because it was something

1280
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,345
that I had recorded
and done myself.

1281
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,515
- I've seen Morgan perform
several times.

1282
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:08,719
I've had Morgan
force-feed me vodka in a bar.

1283
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,055
I know she can give me
so much more than that.

1284
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:18,228

This is gonna be

- You were saying that you
would be strategic about--

1309
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,049
- Absolutely.

1310
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:13,050
- About possibly
eliminating girls

1311
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,051
that you saw
as big competition.

1312
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:16,687
- Uh-huh.
- And it is hard for me

1313
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:20,290
not to think about,
like, if you stay--

1314
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,892
- Is that what I'm gonna do?

1315
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,927
- Would you knock me out,
you know what I mean?

1316
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,162
Like, that's obviously
on my mind.

1317
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:26,730
I can't pretend
that's not there.

1318
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,699
- We talk about, oh,
we're family, we're sisters.

That's fine.
We are those things.

- Yeah.

1321
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,971
- But like straight-up
honesty,

1322
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,772
I would send
the stronger girl home,

1323
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,108
and that's just the truth.

1324
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,244
I guess you have to look
at how you think.

1325
00:54:40,244 --> 00:54:42,579
If you want to go
with what the judges said,

1326
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,649
I think that they picked on
her hair and her shoes

1327
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,185
and the kind of
all-around appearance,

1328
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:51,288
and they just picked on
my, you know,

1329
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:55,859
lack of effervescence,
you know.

1330
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,895
- Yeah.

1331
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,565
- It's clear
that DeLa does not agree

1332
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,367
with the way
I want to send people home.

1333

She's, you know,
Miss Congeniality.

1334
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:09,506
But if DeLa's making her
decision based on the critiques,

Just because I want
to send somebody home

I don't like you

- All right.

1411
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:52,496
Ladies,
I have made my decision.

1412
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,371
BenDeLaCreme,

1413
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,506
you're a winner, baby.

1414
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:06,910
[applause]

1415
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,944
- Thank you.

1416
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,980
I'm the first winner.

1417
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,748
I won
my first lip sync ever.

1418
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,884
I feel incredible.

1419
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,018
Like,
I'm on top of the world.

1420
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:20,257
- And you've earned
a cash tip of $10,000.

1421
00:59:20,257 --> 00:59:21,792
- I'll take it.

1422
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:24,294
- [laughs]

1423
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,830
- Aja, you are safe.

1424
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,331
- Thank you so much.

1425
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:35,639
- Will the bottom two
please step forward?

1426
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:45,949
BenDeLaCreme, with great power
comes great responsibility.

1427
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:51,021
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

1428
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:53,190
- I think you guys are both
super fierce queens,

1429
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,292
but Chi Chi,
I know that you know

1430
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:57,694
that you didn't bring your
strongest performance tonight.

1431
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,896
Morgan, I think
that you took a risk

1432
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,731
and you tried
something new tonight,

1433
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,733
and I don't think that
it was a perfect payoff,

1434
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:04,768
and you know that.

1435
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:07,270
And when we as a group
talked about

1436
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,640
why we might eliminate somebody
moving forward,

1437
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,643
we talked about that we would
not want to make that decision,

1438
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,178
pretty much unanimously,

1439
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,714
based on knocking somebody
that we saw

1440
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,115
as fierce competition
out of the way.

1441
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,784
And you were very forthright
in saying

1442
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,552
that that is something
that you would do,

1443
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:28,024
and in the interest
of everyone moving forward,

1444
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,693
I chose Morgan McMichaels.

1445
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:34,231
- Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes.

1446
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:37,501
- You are and will always be
an All Star.

1447
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:38,935
- Thank you.

1448
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,338
- Now sashay away.

1449
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:42,739
- Thank you, guys.

1450
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,376
[applause]

1451
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,712
- I'm confused by DeLa.

1452
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:52,215
I think she believes that
we're set on a group consensus

1453
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,551
of how we're gonna actually
send the girls home,

1454
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:55,785
but nope.

1455
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:58,922
Baby, that's a completely
different TV show.

1456
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,892
- Performing my own track,
I think,

1457
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,494
was a little,
you know, risqué.

1458
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,196
But I think that
it's a little contradictory

1459
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:07,564
that DeLa sent me home,

1460
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:10,100
because I wasn't the worst
out of the two.

1461
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,134
But I'm grateful to be here.

1462
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,536
Even though
I'm the first to go,

1463
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:15,672
I'm still part of a legacy,
so I'm excited about that.

1464
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,673
If I had to say anything--
[bell rings]

1465
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,008
Oh, shit.

1466
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,146
- Blessed be, kitty girl.

1467
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,981
Don't be scared.

1468
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,716
I got your back.

1469
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:30,287
[evil laugh]

1470
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,924
- I don't know
what that means.

1471
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,725
Like, seriously though,

1472
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:39,696
does anyone want
to tell a bitch? No?

1473
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:45,869
- Next time on
"All Stars..."

1474
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:50,941
You'll be performing
our very own VH1 Divas Live.

1475
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:52,075
[cheering]

1476
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:54,844
- Five, six--
Kennedy, where you at?

1477
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,112
- I got lost.

1478
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,914
- You can't let your backup
dancers upstage you.

1479
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,716
- 'Cause I'm coming for you
back here, baby.

1480
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,152
- Ooh.
- You didn't know the words,

1481
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:03,987
and if you did,
then you missed them.

1482
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:06,890
- Okay.

1483
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,159
- I'm being set up to fail.

1484
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:11,928
- Don't ever sleep
on Chi Chi DeVayne, boo.

1485
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,831
- I was in character
the entire time.

1486
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,566
It's stupid.

1487
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,035
- [chuckles] Girl...
