00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:07,541
- Hey, kitty girl.
- Hello.

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,776
- Blessed weather
we're having today.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,245
- Indeed.

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,147
Can you believe
it's already "All Stars 3?"

6
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,116
- Oh, blessed be.

7
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,652
- Do you think there will be
lots of twists and turns

8
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,255
and shocks and surprises
this season?

9
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:22,689
- Oh, bitch.

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,925
- And do you think
some of the eliminated queens

11
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,693
will get to Ru-turn
for their Ru-venge?

12
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,028
- Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,697
Oh, my God, they're not
gonna know what hit 'em.

14

Hall of Fame

17
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,310
really isn't what
I thought it was gonna be.

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,379
- Girl, you're telling me.

19
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,314
[both sigh]

20
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,085
- You look really nice
in red, though.

21
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,086
- Thanks, girl.

22
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,421
- It's your color.

- Oh, honey. Whoo.

33
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,590
That's how I roll.

34
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,361
That is such
a fucking waste.

35
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,929
That would've killed
if someone was here.

36
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,764
I'm Trixie Mattel,

37
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,701
and I am the crownless drag
superstar from Season 7.

38
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,869
I came here to eclipse
people with my talent,

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,338
but also with my hair.

40
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:45,806
There's nobody in here.

41
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,774
It's like a Morgan McMichaels
meet-and-greet.

42
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,044
I feel like in the real world
I've been a real all star,

43
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,913
but on "Drag Race"
I was not an all star.

44
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,147
Howdy, y'all.

45
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,083
- You went
for the comedy gold,

46
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,118
but all we got was bronze.

47
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,688
- I need to make amends
for the fact that I came in here

48
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,789
and just hit the cement

49
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,092
and got dragged out
like a dead body.

50
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:06,326
Twice.

51
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,627
It's not about falling.

52
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,496
It's about getting back up.

53
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,871
- I..

54
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,906
just farted.

55
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,675
- [laughs]

56
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,144
- Hey, kids, Zaddy's home.

57
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,246
- Slay me, my dairy queen.

58
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,648
- Ooh!

59
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,886
The Milk fans will remember
my outside of the carton--

60
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,954
See the joke there?

61
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,023
Outside of the carton
thinking.

62
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,291
- She's got
a real nose for fashion.

63
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,626
- Hello, hello, hello.

64
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,561
I'm thinking about
wearing facial hair.

65
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,929
- Hope you're packed.

66
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,365
- I don't regret
anything that I did

67
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,535
because it got me into
a Marc Jacobs ad campaign,

68
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,537
and it got me notoriety.

69
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,840
She was cover girl,
French Vogue.

70
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,376
I cannot believe you
fucking showed up here.

71
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,911
Don't touch me.
- Good to see you.

72
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,648
- I very much expected
to see Trixie here.

73
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,050
- Whoo!

74
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,152
- Like myself,
she really proved

75
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,787
that she was an all star
off the show,

76
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,523
but she sort of sucks
in comparison to me.

77
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,859
- Wake up, wake up, wake up!

78
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,261
This ain't no dream.

79
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,963
I'm back, the bayou queen.

80
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,801
- Did it just get swampy
in here?

81
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,969
I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,

82
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,971
and y'all girls
better get ready

83
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,006
'cause I'm ready.

84
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,041
I told you I stay ready.

85
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,242
My mama ready.

86
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,644
Who's into glamour?

87
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,212
Who doesn't like a old
smoked turkey neck back?

88
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,748
- You turned it
completely out.

89
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,049
- Tell me why
you're out here

90
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,051
in a bathing suit
with no corset and a belt.

91
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,187
- I don't have the expenses

92
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,755
to pay
for something like this.

93
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,023
- You don't need money,
girl.

94
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,591
That's never an excuse.

95
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,326
- Hey! [laughs]

96
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,994
- Hey, baby!

97
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,565
- I was the trash bag queen
that had a heart of gold.

98
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,166
I just wasn't
polished enough.

99
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,602
But this time I got
my mind together,

100
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,270
I got my drag together.

101
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,472
It's all together, girl.

102
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,941
Oh, oh, hat coming off.

103
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,742
- Is this trash?
- Trash bags.

104
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,744
- I thought garbage day
was Tuesday.

105
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,547
- Chi Chi's here,
and she wore garbage again,

106
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,217
And also trash bags.

107
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,251
- Uh-oh.

108
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,519
- That hat
is your inner saboteur,

109
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,287
and I want you to let it go.

110
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,956
- [laughs]

111
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,892
Whoo!

112
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,993
- Oh, shit.

113
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,895
- [hums] Ow.

114
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,164
I think I just broke
my ankle doing that.

115
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,499
- My name is Thorgy Thor.

116
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:29,136
I was on Season 8,
and I made top six,

117
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,204
or as some of my enemies
like to say, bottom seven.

118
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,773
I'm colorful, I'm fun,
and I'm the fashion clown.

119
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,309
Whoo! I love everyone.
- [laughs]

120
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,147
- Bob, please shut up.

121
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,815
[all laugh]

122
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,216
- An issue I dealt with
on Season 8

123
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,651
is that I'm constantly
distracted by everything,

124
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,520
but I think 50% of it

125
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,788
was just because
Bob never shuts up.

126
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,425
And since the show,
I've found ways to focus.

127
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,760
Ooh.

128
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,596
I think I'm going crazy.

129
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,131
Oh, there is one.

130
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,634
Sorry. That's gonna
drive me ♪ insane

131
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,236
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes!

132
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,871
- Oh, God.

133
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,640
- All Season 8,

134
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,910
Thorgy complained
that she didn't win

135
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,512
because it was The Bob Show.

136
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,848
Okay, girl,
ain't no Bob here.

137
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,049
Let's see what you got.

138
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,384
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

139
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,652
- Can I try this?

140
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,786
- That's what
you should have come in.

141
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,388
- Oh, can I have this?
[laughs]

142
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:26,126
- Miss Thorgy Thor,
made top four, you didn't.

143
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,094
[laughs]

144
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,467
- I look pretty good
for a dead bitch.

145
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,835
- She's alive!

146
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,270
- My name
is Morgan McMichaels.

147
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,371
I'm from Season 2,

148
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,073
and I'm here
to rock the shit

149
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,142
out of "All Stars Season 3,"
babe.

150
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,411
You can't kill evil
that easy.

151
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,247
- She's a punk dude.
- Rock 'n' roll, baby.

152
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,815
I wonder what everyone's
gonna look like out of drag.

153
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,651
I hope some of you are
attractive boys like me.

154
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,087
Go fix your hair,
fix your mug.

155
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,355
- I don't need
to fix my mug, bitch.

156
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,890
- Honey, you do need
to fix your mug.

157
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,793
On Season 2, I was very blunt
with my opinions,

158
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:02,195
and I still kind of
have that to this day.

159
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,231
You know me, sharp-tongued.

160
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,466
- Hi!
- How you doing?

161
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,101
- Hello, beautiful.

162
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,470
- Morgan being here is
definitely intimidating.

163
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,771
She's a workhorse.

164
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,772
She probably
is the only girl

165
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,674
that works seven days a week

166
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,110
in Hollywood at every club,

167
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,546
so she's definitely
gonna be one to beat.

168
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,282
- I feel like I'm thanking
a veteran for their service,

169
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,516
because we wouldn't be here
if you weren't here.

170
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,952
- I fought for my country.
Now, what is this look?

171
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,188
- It' s my denim
Pinocchio look.

172
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,924
I'm here to inspire
future challenges.

173
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,593
- One thing I'm not a big fan of
is diva-dom.

174
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,962
I think I'm gonna have to smack
that bitch down a little bit.

175
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,297
- Good cast so far.

176
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,599
Who's gonna fuck it up?

177
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,001
[bell rings]

178
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,636
- Ayo, sis.

179
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:43,737
- Oh, Lord.

180
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,273
- I have some
unfinished business.

181
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,341
- Trixie,
she stole your act.

182
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,677
- No, you have
to wait there.

183
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:53,346
- I fuck it up
every time.

184
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,716
My name is Aja,
and I'm here to fuck shit up.

185
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,485
I'm sorry, I am.

186
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,354
- Your makeup is very dark.

187
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,456
- She could walk out there
in a fucking diaper

188
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:09,162
and they're like, Valentina,
your smile is beautiful.

189
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,330
I just don't feel like

190
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,232
you should be
Miss Congeniality.

191
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,536
- Oh, my God, hi.

192
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,138
Walking into Season 9,
I was thinking

193
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,439
and I was gonna win,

194
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,439
I was the shit

195
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,308
and I was, like,
oh, yes, I got this.

196
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,610
And then the challenges
and the runways came along,

197
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,612
and I was, like,
I don't look that good.

198
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,547
I'm not doing that good.
I'm not feeling that good.

199
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,782
And then I went home.

200
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,684
- She got
her lips done, too.

201
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,286
- I had my lips, my cheeks,
my chin, my skin.

202
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,388
I had Botox in my forehead.

203
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,290
- You're a drag queen
who got more chin?

204
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,292
- Well, bitch, I didn't
have one to begin with.

205
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,462
I was having like the Alyssa
Edwards, like, Season 5 chin,

206
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,264
like, the nonexistent one.

207
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:47,734
I kind of felt like
the ugly duckling of Season 9,

208
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,669
but I think in a weird way

209
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,806
it really did benefit me
to get criticized by the world.

210
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,309
I mean, look at her.
I am HD ready.

211
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,944
There is no face tune here.

212
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,012
Bitch, they're
gonna be telling me

213
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,380
my smile is beautiful.
Watch.

214
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,748
[laughs]

215
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,820
- Hi, everyone.
It's me, BenDeLaCreme.

216
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,356
Again.
[all laugh]

217
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:12,592
My name is BenDeLaCreme,
and I placed fifth on Season 6.

218
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,363
I am wearing
a repurposed version

219
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,932
of the gown that I wore

220
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,501
where I was crowned
Season 6 Miss Congeniality.

221
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,869
I've just been
sleeping in it

222
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,739
and spooning
my Miss Congeniality sash

223
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,974
and weeping into my
Overstock gift certificate

224
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,175
for the last four years.

225
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,810
Aah!

226
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,546
BenDeLaCreme
is terminally delightful.

227
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,349
Excuse me, we originated
the language.

228
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,084
- Bitch stole your look.
- [laughs]

229
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,953
- BenDeLaCreme Visage.

230
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,888
- This time I'm here
to get that crown

231
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,523
that I didn't get
the first time,

232
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,891
but I'm also here to show

233
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,327
that you can win
with kindness and integrity

234
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,295
rather than be a bitch.

235
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,698
Oh, crap,
is this an intervention?

236
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,699
- How you doing?

237
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,768
- Good, how are you?
- I'm very good.

238
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,202
- Ben, you're still alive.

239
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,406
She sort of fell off the face
of the earth for a while.

240
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:00,974
I thought
she just grew a beard,

241
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,375
ran into the woods,

242
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,078
was sort of just terminally
delightful to the squirrels.

243
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,147
- How do you feel
being back?

244
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,249
- I was super nervous
to come back.

245
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,650
- Wait.
Why were you nervous?

246
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,918
- Because I was so fantastic
the first time,

247
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,453
it was, like,
how do I live up to that?

248
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,621
[all laugh]

249
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,990
- BenDeLaCreme's
a little recycled.

250
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,258
You know, we've seen it.

251
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,093
I mean,
the Miss Congeniality dress?

252
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,294
That shit
is out the door.

253
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,896
That was
how many seasons ago?

254
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,498
Like, don't worry about
trying to be that.

255
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,866
Try to get the crown.

256
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:30,437
- Uh-oh.

257
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,339
- Round two, bitches.

258
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,774
Ha-ha!

259
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,609
- Yes.
[applause]

260
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,879
- I'm Kennedy Davenport
from Season 7.

261
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,415
The dancing diva of Texas
is back, baby,

262
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,151
and I'm dancing my way
to the top.

263
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,252
[pop]

264
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,923
- Newark, LaGuardia,
Kennedy Davenport.

265
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,461
- Aah! Shut up.
- [laughs]

266
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:59,232
- I've been in this business
for 17 long years.

267
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,101
I don't think
the other girls are ready.

268
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,269
That is a fucking opinion.

269
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,538
You either take it
or you don't.

270
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,041
You know what?
I can be an adult

271
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,710
and say that I may have been
a little bitchy sometimes,

272
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,879
but since the season,
things have changed.

273
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,248
I've grown.
Where are my sisters at?

274
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,951
[cheering]

275
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,219
- Yes!

276
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,788
Kennedy Davenport.

277
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,389
Male bitch.
- Hey!

278
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,626
- We have developed kind of
a mother/daughter relationship.

279
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,497
I get compared to Kennedy
all the time.

280
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,065
- You better come through,
Whoville.

281
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:36,169
- Oh, my God, the look
is white noise of ugly.

282
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,637
In fact, it's very Chi Chi.

283
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,073
I think Kennedy
is Chi Chi from the future

284
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,609
coming back to tell her
she's not gonna win "All Stars."

285
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,178
Bitch,
they are the same person.

286
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,180
- What's going on,
everybody?

287
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,515
- I'm sorry, I am just staring
at my reflection.

288
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,749
- So many mirrors.
- I know.

289
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,217
- So vain.

290
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,253
- Don't get too blind,
honey. [laughs]

291
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,821
[doorbell rings]

292
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,260
- Well, halle-who
could this be?

293
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:05,331
- It looks like the box
got an upgrade and so did I.

294
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,734
Halleloo, I'm back, bitches.

295
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,136
Again. Hey!

296
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,304
I'm Shangela.

297
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,639
Baby,
I'm a double kind of ho.

298
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,575
I was on Season 2 and 3.

299
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,111
You know what they say:
third time's the charm.

300
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,579
Halleloo.
Halleloo.

301
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,247
Halleloo, ladies.

302
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,816
He's so gay,
and he's so good.

303
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,219
They always say," LaQuifa,"
I say, "What?"

304
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,054
- You have
an irrepressible energy,

305
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:34,093
but can energy make up
for a lack of experience?

306
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,696
- I think the biggest
misconception about my drag

307
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,765
was that
I wasn't trying hard.

308
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:41,534
And I swear, girl, y'all,
I was trying my hardest,

309
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,036
but come to find out,

310
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,604
you actually
do need to know something

311
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,105
about makeup and hair
and costumes

312
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,875
in order to be a full,
well-rounded queen.

313
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,076
Oh.

314
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,744
What's up, bitches?

315
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,380
[cheering]
Halleloo to you.

316
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,317
- Oh, God.
If I fucking hear "halleloo"

317
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,818
one more damn time...

318
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,987
I cannot stand it.

319
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,288
She's a halle-lunatic.

320
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,756
- Season 2's in the house.

321
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,425
I was there, too, one day,
but I was there.

322
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,026
- Very briefly.
[all laugh]

323
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,561
- You are back again.

324
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,897
- Again.
- 47th time.

325
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,899
- 47th?
- Well, 47th.

326
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,868
Since Season 3, y'all know
I've stepped it into high gear

327
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,904
and became
a true professional.

328
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,273
I've worked in television.
I've worked in film.

329
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,308
I have been able to headline
my own show

330
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,243
on the Las Vegas strip.

331
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,612
I'm not baby Shangie
anymore.

332
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,813
Chad and Alaska,

333
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,482
baby, make room for me
in that Hall of Fame.

334
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,084
- There's our two Season 2s.

335
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,151
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

336
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,519
- Let's do
some more Season 5 girls.

337
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,654
- Eew.

338
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:35,755
- I feel like
there hasn't been enough.

339
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,924
[siren]

340
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,992
- Yes!

341
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,360
- Whoo, girl.

342
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,728
- What the fuck is it?

343
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,463
- No, it can't be.

344
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,399
- She done
already done had hers.

345
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,467
- Well, come on, girl.

346
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,570
- Welcome, All Stars.
[cheering]

347
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,340
This season is all about
my comeback kids.

348
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,277
Prove you've got what it takes
to go all the way,

349
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,780
and the last thing
you'll hear me say

350
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,851
is welcome to
the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

351
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,586
Henny.

352
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,888
[cheers and applause]
- Whoo!

353
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,258
- Hello, hello, hello!

354
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,826
[cheering]

355
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,728
I see
all the hookers are here.

356
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,930
[all laugh]

357
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,400
My legendary children.

358
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,835
Now, since last we met,

359
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,705
your careers have taken you
across the country,

360
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,373
around the world,

361
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,710
and today you're back
where it all started.

362
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,347
This is your chance
to make a killer comeback,

363
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,282
to rewrite herstory,

364
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,818
and to earn
your rightful place

365
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,088
in the Drag Race
Hall of Fame.

366
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,089
Y'all ready?

367
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,224
- Yes!
- Yes!

368
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,527
- Oh, oh, oh, but wait.

369
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,664
Before the race
starts officially,

370
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,635
I have just one more queen

371
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:59,906
I'd like to introduce
into the competition.

372
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,075
- Shangela's right there.

373
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,910
- Lock the door.

374
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,878
- Are they seriously
doing this?

375
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,347
- [laughs]
- Say what?

376
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,016
- Whoo!

377
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,352
- It's somewhere.

378
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,353
Whatever.

379
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:17,356
What were you saying?

380
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,393
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

381
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,995
[RuPaul laughs]

382
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,066
- I have just one more queen

383
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,502
I'd like to introduce
into the competition.

384
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,837
- What?

385
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:35,742
- All hail America's
OG drag superstar,

386
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,178
all the way from Cameroon,

387
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,682
BeBe Zahara Benet.

388
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,551
[cheers and applause]

389
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,086
- Hello, my beauties.

390
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,788
My name
is BeBe Zahara Benet,

391
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:49,856
and you may not
recognize me,

392
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,225
but I am the very first

393
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,093
crowned queen
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

394
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,663
♪ Face, face, face,
I give face, beauty face ♪

395
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,599
Cameroon!

396
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,770
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race" is BeBe.

397
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,973
- Cameroon is back.

398
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:06,375
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.

399
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,376
Didn't she already win?

400
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:10,012
- I know
what you're thinking.

401
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,114
She done already
done had hers.

402
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:13,182
- Exactly.

403
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:16,185
- But 2009
was a very different time.

404
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:19,488
BeBe had to deal
with that Season 1 filter.

405
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:21,023
Remember that?

406
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:25,060
The grand prize
was a measly $20,000.

407
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,264
Hell, the Internet hadn't
even been invented yet.

408
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:31,133
BeBe,
are you ready to inspire

409
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,569
a whole new generation
of "Drag Race" fans?

410
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:37,239
- Mother, another day,
another slay.

411
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,340
Who's first?

412
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,842
- Ooh.
- Oh.

413
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:41,076
- [laughs]

414
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:43,779
- I am completely
intimidated.

415
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,415
That's like
if Ru just was like,

416
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:47,850
I'm gonna throw my hat
in the ring.

417
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,451
I'm competing
this year, too.

418
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:51,353
- She's already
had the crown.

419
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:52,721
Why does she need
another one?

420
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:53,789
Grandma, sit down.

421
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,858
Let us other bitches
have a crown.

422
00:15:57,726 --> 00:16:00,396
- Ladies, if BeBe
goes all the way,

423
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:02,932
she'll be the first queen
in "Drag Race" herstory

424
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:06,001
to snatch two crowns.

425
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:09,471
But who stays and who goes,
well, that's up to you.

426
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,775
"All Star" rules
are in full effect.

427
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:17,646
Each week the top two queens
will lip sync for their legacy.

428
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:20,783
The winner will receive
a $10,000 tip,

429
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:25,921
plus the power to eliminate
one of her fellow queens.

430
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:29,992
- Baby,
this is "All Stars 3."

431
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:31,427
The rules are rough.

432
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:33,796
You don't have the opportunity
to save yourself.

433
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:35,331
You rely on other people.

434
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:38,400
So there's no space
for mistake. None.

435
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,438
- Keep your friends close
and your enemies even closer.

436
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:45,474
Because when it comes
to "All Stars,"

437
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:48,110
it do get shady up in here,
am I right?

438
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,445
- Hello.

439
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:52,348
- Now let's take a moment
to get reacquainted.

440
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:54,049
Oh, pit crew.

441
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,552
- Oh!
- Hey!

442
00:16:56,552 --> 00:17:01,624
- That's right, ladies,
the library is open,

443
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:03,559
because reading is what?

444
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,728
[All] Fundamental.

445
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:08,764
- I can't wait to see
how this turns out.

446
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:12,635
First up, Thorgy Thor,
come on down.

447
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:13,903
- Whoo!

448
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:16,105
- Wait. Do you know
where my wallet is?

449
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,706
- What?
- Chi Chi, didn't you take it

450
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,642
when you stole my spot
in the top five of Season 8?

451
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:22,144
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

452
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:23,979
- Shangela is the most annoying
thing I've ever met in my life.

453
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,248
She's like a pull-up toy
that says Halleloo,

454
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:27,583
but the only thing
more annoying than Shangela

455
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,151
is Bob the Drag Queen.

456
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,120
- Oh.

457
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,388
- Just my opinion.

458
00:17:32,388 --> 00:17:34,390
- By the way, Ru,
do you know me and Aja

459
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,624
used to work together
in Brooklyn?

460
00:17:35,624 --> 00:17:36,759
- No, I didn't know that.

461
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,460
- Do you know
she's a straight-up witch?

462
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,762
She cast a spell
on the producers.

463
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:41,263
How else do you think
she ended up on "All Stars?"

464
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,198
- Oh!
- Oh!

465
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:45,267
- Miss Thorgy Thor.

466
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,969
Girl, what the fuck
you got on your head?

467
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:48,337
[all laugh]

468
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:49,805
- Christmas with the Kranks,
honey.

469
00:17:49,805 --> 00:17:51,740
[all laugh]

470
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,809
- Big and milky,

471
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,045
girl, just like the drink,
you give me the shits.

472
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:57,579
[all laugh]

473
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,814
- Me, too.

474
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:01,750
- Aja, welcome
to the big leagues,

475
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,320
where Charlotte Russe
and Forever 21

476
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,888
won't cut it, little girl.

477
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:07,990
[all laugh]

478
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,693
- BenDeLaCreme,
where you been?

479
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:12,861
- Ooh.
- [laughs]

480
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:14,163
- Like, literally,
where you been?

481
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:15,698
- Oh, Seattle.

482
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:16,932
- [laughs]

483
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:19,068
- It's okay.
I'm gonna Sia this bitch.

484
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,337
[all laugh]

485
00:18:21,337 --> 00:18:23,973
Kennedy Davenport,

486
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:26,742
the only queen
that doesn't have to turn

487
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:29,478
to look both ways
before crossing the street.

488
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,580
[all laugh]

489
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,848
- I hate you.

490
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:36,652
- Shangela. I always thought
her name was Angela,

491
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:39,088
and people were just
telling her to shut up.

492
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:42,624
[all laugh]

493
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:45,494
- Chi Chi DeVayne,
girl, with that mouth,

494
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:47,463
you could've put Black &amp; Decker
out of business, bitch,

495
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:49,198
'cause you a mouthful
of tools, honey.

496
00:18:49,198 --> 00:18:51,266
[all laugh]

497
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:52,334
- Kennedy Davenport.

498
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,969
- Be gentle, sister.

499
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:56,071
- You seem a little offended
by our little jokes.

500
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,674
We weren't offended
by your parents' little joke.

501
00:18:58,674 --> 00:19:01,543
- Aah
- Ooh!

502
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,545
- Thorgy Thor,
you know, I love clowns.

503
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:04,913
- Uh-huh.

504
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:07,149
- And I never met an unfunny one
till I heard you read it.

505
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,617
- Oh!

506
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:09,952
- The low-rent
Michelle Visage,

507
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,653
sister,
it's nice to see you here.

508
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:12,955
It's nice
to see you anywhere

509
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,923
considering you've been
unemployed since Season 6.

510
00:19:14,923 --> 00:19:16,058
[all laugh]

511
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:18,761
Morgan McMichaels,
sister, I know

512
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,963
you love to perform
hard rock music,

513
00:19:20,963 --> 00:19:23,499
and that's good because
that face is also a hard rock.

514
00:19:23,499 --> 00:19:25,701
[all laugh]

515
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,236
- Aja.
- Oh.

516
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:28,804
- You're beautiful,
you're gorgeous,

517
00:19:28,804 --> 00:19:29,872
you look like Seal.

518
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:33,509
[all laugh]

519
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:35,077
Wow, Milk, you put a lot
into this look.

520
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:37,613
What, 2%?

521
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:40,549
Shangela.
- Hey!

522
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:42,184
- What if this season
we put you in a box?

523
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:44,153
'Cause you're gonna
halle-lose.

524
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:46,522
[all laugh]

525
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:48,357
- BeBe Zahara Benet,

526
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,325
you look like
an overweight Naomi Campbell.

527
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,461
- Aah!
[all laugh]

528
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:55,164
- Morgan McMichaels, I would
take the A out of your name

529
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:56,432
and replace it with an O

530
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:58,333
because I'm pretty sure
we'd like you Mor-gone.

531
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,269
- [gasps]
- What?

532
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:03,138
- Trixie, you look like
a Lisa Frank serial killer.

533
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:04,940
- I will take that.

534
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,175
I'm from Wisconsin.

535
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,911
- It's an aesthetic.
- Oh, Lord.

536
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:11,914
- Well, I'm very excited
to read all of my sisters.

537
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:14,516
Oh, Thorgy,
I love this full outfit.

538
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:16,485
I usually only get to see
about this much

539
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:18,387
when you're handing out balloons
from that sewer grate.

540
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:20,322
[all laugh]
- Oh, my God.

541
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:24,526
- Shangela,
you have come so far.

542
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:26,662
Initially your makeup
was kind of busted

543
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:28,163
and your outfits
were a mess

544
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:29,965
and your personality
was super grating,

545
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:31,867
but look at how far
you've come now.

546
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,202
You are much older.

547
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:35,237
[all laugh]

548
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:38,674
Trixie, you know, a lot
of people clock your makeup,

549
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:40,409
but I totally get it.

550
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:42,444
You know, you're just painting
for the back of the room,

551
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:45,414
which makes sense because that's
where your audience collects

552
00:20:45,414 --> 00:20:46,949
if you remember
to lock the door.

553
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,450
[all laugh]

554
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,720
- And, BeBe, I hear
that this is the year

555
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,722
that you might
get two crowns,

556
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:56,058
which is really not
a lot of dental work

557
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,460
as far as those early seasons
are concerned.

558
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,729
[all laugh]

559
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,164
- Thanks, Mother.

560
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:03,966
[clears throat]

561
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,068
Thorgy Thor.

562
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:08,770
Mother, she looks homeless.

563
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,473
You know, I'm not gonna read
Morgan McMichaels.

564
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:13,775
Life already has.

565
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:17,980
Everybody,
I'm the only African here,

566
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,182
but why it does look like
with Kennedy Davenport

567
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:22,751
you can sponsor her
for 30 cents a day?

568
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,587
[all laugh]

569
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:27,556
- Ooh, somebody burned out
a light.

570
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:28,824
It's shady in here.

571
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:30,926
- [laughs]

572
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:33,162
- The library
is closed officially.

573
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:34,696
- Thank you.

574
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:38,467
- The winner of today's
mini challenge is...

575
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,835
BenDeLaCreme.

576
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:41,970
[cheers and applause]

577
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,140
You've won
a $3,000 gift certificate

578
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,676
from l.a. Eyeworks.
- Oh.

579
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:51,046
- So Miss Congeniality
won the reading challenge.

580
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:53,549
Some of the queens
are underestimating

581
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,883
what I'm bringing
to this competition,

582
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:57,386
and I'm gonna
prove them wrong.

583
00:21:57,386 --> 00:22:02,224
- And I will be posting more
of your reads at VH1.com.

584
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:04,760
All right. Ladies,
it's time to get ready

585
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,162
for your big comeback
to the main stage.

586
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:09,264
For this week's
maxi challenge,

587
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:12,501
you'll be headlining
an All Star Variety Show.

588
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:15,170
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

589
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,273
- Tomorrow, in front of
a live studio audience,

590
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:20,676
you need to show that
your charisma, uniqueness,

591
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:25,847
nerve and talent, is bigger,
fresher, and better than ever.

592
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,716
#AllStars3.

593
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:30,652
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

594
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:33,622
and may the best
All Star win.

595
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,557
[cheers and applause]

596
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:39,461
- I need to get
the fuck outta drag.

597
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:41,997
- This was Pearl's spot,
and she skated by,

598
00:22:41,997 --> 00:22:45,534
so I'm looking to inherit
that energy.

599
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:47,436
- [laughs]
Bitch, you got jokes.

600
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:50,038
- Guys, BeBe's back.
- Mother.

601
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:51,206
- Winner, winner
chicken dinner.

602
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:54,443
More great things
are happening for you.

603
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:56,578
- Do you think you have a good
chance of winning this season?

604
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:58,614
- Everybody's competition,
but I'm here

605
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:00,716
to really, really
get to share my gifts,

606
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:01,850
and also
to be able to learn

607
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,652
from the all other girls
I have not worked with,

608
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:06,355
because everybody
has something special.

609
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:08,590
That sounds like
an Oprah moment, but it's true.

610
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,692
- BeBe's never really
experienced a hardship

611
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:11,927
on "Drag Race."

612
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,862
She hasn't had a bad moment.

613
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,063
It's actually scary
to be her.

614
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:17,532
- If you have a good experience
on "Drag Race,"

615
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:20,502
it's like so terrifying
to come back.

616
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:21,737
- Oh, there's more to lose.

617
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:23,505
- Absolutely.
And I have to say

618
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:25,641
that I really thought
Valentina was gonna be here.

619
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:27,709
- Me, too.
- And I am disappointed,

620
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:31,613
because I am now like
the Miss Congeniality

621
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:33,348
who, like,
if I'm like a bitch,

622
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:35,183
that's gonna look terrible.

623
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:36,785
But if Valentina was here,
she's just like already

624
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:39,154
automatically the worst
about that.

625
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:40,656
- I like Ben.

626
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:43,825
I just think
she can come across

627
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:46,862
as trying to be congenial,

628
00:23:46,862 --> 00:23:49,998
but I don't think that
that's actually who she is.

629
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,601
I think
she will be congenial

630
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:54,202
to get
exactly what she wants.

631
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:03,111
- Trixie, are you making
a porno for your talent?

632
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:05,247
- No, I'm gonna play violin
in a red clown wig.

633
00:24:05,247 --> 00:24:07,382
It's kind of my thing.
- Very funny.

634
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:09,718
The first challenge
is very, very important

635
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:10,852
because in "All Stars,"

636
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:13,388
it's about impressing
your competition,

637
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:15,691
so you really have to come out
as a front runner right away.

638
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:17,125
- What are you doing
for talent?

639
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,127
- I'm drag dancing it out.
What are you doing?

640
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:22,064
- Come through.

641
00:24:22,064 --> 00:24:23,632
- I've never done it
before, so...

642
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:24,633
- Very good.
- And what are you doing?

643
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,101
- Just one of my songs.

644
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:27,469
- She's also
performing a song.

645
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:31,006
- A lot of the queens are doing
basically the same thing,

646
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:33,342
lip syncing or dancing

647
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:35,377
or singing
one of their original songs.

648
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,146
As long as I do well
with the violin playing

649
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:41,383
and my strings don't explode,
I'm gonna win. Whoo!

650
00:24:41,383 --> 00:24:46,021
- How do you feel about
the whole elimination setup?

651
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:47,556
- I like it.
- Do you?

652
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:48,890
- I'm just gonna
send the bitch home

653
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,359
that I think
is the strongest.

654
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,593
- Really?

655
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:54,262
- That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

656
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:55,831
- That is terrifying.

657
00:24:55,831 --> 00:24:57,399
- Well, the thing is,
I mean, why lie about it?

658
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:00,402
Like, you know, everybody
played Kumbaya last year,

659
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:04,906
and it was like, oh, here.
Tch, tch, tch, tch.

660
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:06,975
We are all friends,
we are all sisters,

661
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:10,445
but, like, at the end
of the day, $100,000.

662
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:12,848
My strategy
for sending girls home--

663
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,016
it isn't shady,
it is honest.

664
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,118
This is a game.

665
00:25:16,118 --> 00:25:17,552
You have to play it
to win it,

666
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:20,255
and I love the girls,
but I want to win.

667
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,857
- I feel like it would be
like career suicide

668
00:25:21,857 --> 00:25:23,158
to look
straight in the camera

669
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:25,060
and say, that person
is my biggest threat, go home.

670
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,495
- But you don't
just have to deal with,

671
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:27,696
like, what other people's
response is.

672
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:28,897
You have to deal with, like,

673
00:25:28,897 --> 00:25:30,899
how you feel about how you won
or didn't win.

674
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,134
- But if you're honest,

675
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:34,636
then there's no fast one
being pulled.

676
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:37,305
If you're straight up
from the jump,

677
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:39,908
then there's no--
there's no mincing of words,

678
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,443
there's no mixup
in your communication.

679
00:25:41,443 --> 00:25:42,644
- It's hard, though,

680
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,446
because it's like a room
full of fan favorites.

681
00:25:44,446 --> 00:25:45,981
- With the exception of me.

682
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,116
- That's true.
- [laughs]

683
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:49,084
- But it is. I mean--

684
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:50,185
- No, like the T, yeah.

685
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:52,220
- Everybody in here
is a fan favorite,

686
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,456
except I'm not worried
about that.

687
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:55,624
- Morgan is talking about

688
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:56,992
she's gonna eliminate
the strongest queens

689
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,326
to knock out
the competition.

690
00:25:58,326 --> 00:26:00,695
Sweetie,
that's a great strategy

691
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:02,063
that you should not
have said out loud

692
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:03,498
in front of
all these queens.

693
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:05,700
- Would you say that it's not
"RuPaul's Best Friend Race"?

694
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,502
- Well, LaShauwn said it,
I didn't.

695
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:10,138
- Coming up...

696
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:12,007
- Everybody

But we all know
how this works.

699
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:17,746
We ain't talking about that,
Miss Thang.

700
00:26:17,746 --> 00:26:19,614

- Be nice, bitch.

- Good morning.

705
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,126
- Zaddy's home.

706
00:26:29,126 --> 00:26:30,828
- Today's maxi challenge

707
00:26:30,828 --> 00:26:33,897
is a "RuPaul's Drag Race All
Stars" Variety Extravaganza.

708

[pop] My talent is not
tongue popping. Don't worry.

709
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,936
- How's everybody doing?
- How are you doing?

710
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:41,338
- Of course everybody
is getting along.

711
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:42,773
Everybody is Kumbaya,

712
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:45,242
everybody is Mother Teresa,
Gandhi.

713
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:47,878
Oh, I love you,
kissy, kissy, kissy.

714
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:49,379
But we all know
how this works.

715
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:51,315
It will be very interesting

716
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:55,552
to see if all of this
sisterly love stays.

717
00:26:57,254 --> 00:27:00,057
- Well, I'm just hoping
that I am not in the bottom

718
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:02,259
because every season
I've been on,

719
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,261
I was in the bottom
on the first episode.

720
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:06,797
- But one person
has to go home today.

721
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:09,299
I mean, it's always scary
like the very first elimination.

722
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,667
- [gasps] I'm shook.

723
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,403
- It sucks, but somebody
gotta do it, bitch.

724
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:16,306
Tonight
is the first elimination,

725
00:27:16,306 --> 00:27:18,909
and it's all up
to the girls.

726
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:21,411
Right now you just don't know
how it's gonna go.

727
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:23,213
There's no set guidelines.

728
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,516
And then what if
we set the guidelines

729
00:27:25,516 --> 00:27:28,418
and somebody steps
outside of those guidelines?

730
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:31,188
It just...
it wrecks my nerves.

731
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:35,359
- I think that we as a group

732
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,194
have generally gotten along
really, really well so far,

733
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:40,163
but I think people's true colors
will start to show

734
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:42,666
the minute the top
and the bottom are announced.

735
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,902
I think the claws
are gonna come out tonight.

736
00:27:44,902 --> 00:27:46,103
- I want the claws
to come out.

737
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:47,237
- Me, too.
I like the drama.

738
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:48,539
- I think it'll be so fun.
I love drama.

739
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,607
- I'm always intrigued
because the fans are, like,

740
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,543
oh, you're the nice one,
you're the bitchy one.

741
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:54,011
I'm, like, baby, you realize

742
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:56,246
that drag queens
encompass everything, right?

743
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:59,583
Like, yes, I'm a little more
viper-tongued.

744
00:28:01,852 --> 00:28:03,086
- You're such a meanie,

745
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:04,988
but I don't think
you are at all.

746
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:06,456
- Morgan is one of the nicest
people I've ever met.

747
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:08,458
- I really, like,
love you, Morgan.

748
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,693
- Oh, thanks, babe.

749
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:10,694
I'm just me.

750
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:14,298
- Do you know what?
I actually think

751
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:16,466
"Drag Race"
is more stressful

752
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:19,236
than any drag experience
I've ever had in the real world.

753
00:28:19,236 --> 00:28:21,638
I think I spent the whole time
the first time on "Drag Race"

754
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:24,408
saying "I'm not scared,"
even though I was.

755
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:27,511
- Last time
I got really in my head,

756
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:29,713
and when I didn't do as well
as I thought I was gonna do,

757
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,815
I thought it was, like,
a reflection of my worth.

758
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:35,719
And Milk saw me, like, before
the show aired after our season.

759
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:37,220
- Yeah, she was in a mood.

760
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,655
- I was shook.

761
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:42,192
When I was eliminated,
I was devastated.

762
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:46,730
I felt like the air was
being sucked out of my lungs.

763
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,865
But this time around
I'm here to prove

764
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:51,835
that I can get through
anything that's thrown at me

765
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:53,337
without getting rattled
by it.

766
00:28:56,707 --> 00:28:59,610
- Who did you gag on coming
into this room, honey?

767
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,845
- Aja, because
she just left the season.

768
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:03,146
So it was like--

769
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:04,481
- Are you surprised
to see me?

770
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,515
- Yeah.

771
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:06,750
- I mean,
you were just so new.

772
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,119
Girl, you just
got off the boat, bitch.

773

Bitch, you fresh meat,
bitch, so...

774
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:13,390
- But she just got off
the "Drag Race" boat,

775
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,492
but she's been doing drag
for like six-and-a-half years.

776
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:16,893
- We're not talking
about that.

777
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,895
- Sister, I'm allowed to put
a little piece in there.

778

- Oh, girl, but we ain't talking
about that, Miss Thang.

779

- Let me stop, honey.
- Be nice, bitch.

782
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,371
- They're gonna start thinking
I'm mean, girl.

783
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,940
- You still mean, girl.
You're still mean.

784
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,676
- I know the girls
are gonna underestimate me,

785
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:35,512
and my advice to them
is underestimate me

786

00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:53,456
that were embellished tonight
on this stage.

1046
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:56,425
- Consider it burnt.
[all laugh]

1047
00:43:57,727 --> 00:43:59,028
- Up next, Thorgy Thor.

1048
00:43:59,028 --> 00:44:00,563
- Hi, guys.

1049
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:02,965
- You look amazing.
I love this jumpsuit.

1050
00:44:02,965 --> 00:44:05,001
It's so chic and beautiful.

1051
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:07,136
- It's very Halston, Liza.

1052
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:08,871
It's gorgeous.

1053
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:11,073
- And a Phyllis Diller wig.

1054
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:13,442
- I had never heard "Sissy
That Walk" played on the violin.

1055
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,144
- [laughs]
- That was incredible.

1056
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:17,480
- It's absolutely amazing

1057
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,949
to see you marry
classical music and drag.

1058
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:22,618
- But at the same time,
you seemed a little bashful,

1059
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,819
kind of like, well...

1060
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:26,622
And I want to see you,
like, own it more.

1061
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,926
Like, I want to see
your fierceness a little more

1062
00:44:29,926 --> 00:44:31,427
'cause I know
that you have it in you.

1063
00:44:31,427 --> 00:44:33,462
- All right. Thank you
for that challenge.

1064
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,032
- Up next, Aja.

1065
00:44:36,032 --> 00:44:37,466
You look like a model.

1066
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,403
- Did you stone
those tights?

1067
00:44:40,403 --> 00:44:43,039
- [laughs]
- I like the many reveals.

1068
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:44,473
I thought it was beautiful,

1069
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,875
and it was just
really good drag.

1070
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,811
- Aja, I remember being
very frustrated in Season 9

1071
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,680
because I felt like I wasn't
getting enough of you.

1072
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,249
You raised the bar today,

1073
00:44:53,249 --> 00:44:54,784
and then
you jumped off of it.

1074
00:44:54,784 --> 00:44:57,219
- Aah!
- You really brought it.

1075
00:44:57,219 --> 00:44:58,287
I'm so into vogueing
right now,

1076
00:44:58,287 --> 00:45:01,157
so that gave me life,

1077
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,526
and that jump,
it was just insane.

1078
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,861
- This is what I was waiting for
all of Season 9.

1079
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:07,229
- What's changed?

1080
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:08,631
- I don't give a fuck
what anybody thinks about me.

1081
00:45:08,631 --> 00:45:11,534
This is me, and if somebody
has a problem with it,

1082
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,970
then that's a you problem
and not a me problem.

1083
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,905
- That's right.
You just jump on their ass.

1084
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:17,239
[all laugh]

1085
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:19,041
Thank you, Aja.

1086
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,476
All right, next up,
BenDeLaCreme.

1087
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:21,510
- Hi.

1088
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,945
- You're so beautiful.

1089
00:45:22,945 --> 00:45:25,281
- I know, right?
[all laugh]

1090
00:45:25,281 --> 00:45:27,650
- You look stunning
head to toe.

1091
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,086
The little fascinator, the
jewelry, the color you chose,

1092
00:45:30,086 --> 00:45:32,288
and then you give us comedy

1093
00:45:32,288 --> 00:45:34,690
when you did the Ukrainian
nesting dolls of bras

1094
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,626
that kept coming.

1095
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:38,160
I was waiting
for one of Gorbachev.

1096
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,096
- I think
you're just the tits.

1097
00:45:40,096 --> 00:45:41,564
I do.

1098
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:43,065
You know, there are
certain queens come up here

1099
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:44,867
and you go, I cannot wait
to see what they do.

1100
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,136
You're one of them.
- Thank you.

1101
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:48,437
Tch, tch.

1102
00:45:48,437 --> 00:45:50,239
- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.

1103
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,507
- Hey, y'all.

1104
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:53,676
- You look beautiful.
Your face looks beautiful,

1105
00:45:53,676 --> 00:45:57,213
but all I kept doing
was looking at the shoes.

1106
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,182
You have to have
some kind of a heel,

1107
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:02,952
because it immediately
crunches you.

1108
00:46:02,952 --> 00:46:05,087
- I have to agree
with Michelle.

1109
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:06,355
Those shoes were killing me.

1110
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:08,290
I know you have to have
a certain kind of shoe

1111
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,592
to do what you were doing.
- Yeah.

1112
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:10,993
- But I've seen
you do acrobatics.

1113
00:46:10,993 --> 00:46:12,395
- In heels.
- Yeah, girl.

1114
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,131
- And I could've just easily
just put on a six-inch heel

1115
00:46:15,131 --> 00:46:16,732
and still
worked something out.

1116
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,134
It was just a bad decision.

1117
00:46:18,134 --> 00:46:20,169
- I was not in love
with the hair.

1118
00:46:20,169 --> 00:46:21,871
I felt like
it was getting in the way

1119
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:24,106
of the performance a lot.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1120
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:25,141
- I think
for the performance,

1121
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,475
you gotta amp it up
a little bit.

1122
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:28,277
- It was almost like
down here

1123
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:29,879
when the rest of the girls
were taking it up there.

1124
00:46:29,879 --> 00:46:32,148
And I know that
you have what it takes,

1125
00:46:32,148 --> 00:46:35,251
so I want you
to push it there.

1126
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:38,220
- Up next,
Morgan McMichaels.

1127
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,290
- Finally I get to get judged by
the notorious Michelle Visage.

1128
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,693
- Notorious, yes, darling.

1129
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:45,127
You look amazing.

1130
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:47,663
Out of the four
spangled bodysuits,

1131
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:49,799
yours is above and beyond
my favorite.

1132
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:52,935
- I mean, the shoulder details,
all of the embellishment,

1133
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,104
the colors, the iridescence.

1134
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,806
Really well done.
- Thank you.

1135
00:46:56,806 --> 00:46:58,274
- But when
you were performing,

1136
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,042
I felt like your nerves got
a little bit too good of you.

1137
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:01,777
Because I found you

1138
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,714
almost doing the entire thing
over to the girls.

1139
00:47:04,714 --> 00:47:06,749
- Um, I had never recorded
a track before,

1140
00:47:06,749 --> 00:47:08,617
so I was shitting it
a little.

1141
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,319
- I get to see you
in Palm Springs all the time,

1142
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,623
and nobody owns a room
like Morgan McMichaels.

1143
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,692
It's like everybody
in the club disappears

1144
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:19,261
and I see is you because
you're in charge of me.

1145
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:21,464
- I charge for that.
[all laugh]

1146
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,666
- So any self doubt,
knock it off,

1147
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,168
because anything less than 100
is not good enough.

1148
00:47:26,168 --> 00:47:28,637
- You heard it here.
Don't take less than 100.

1149
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:32,341
[all laugh]

1150
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,177
Thank you, ladies.

1151
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:37,713
Based on
the judges' critiques,

1152
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:39,749
I've made some decisions.

1153
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,686
Aja,

1154
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:45,287
BenDeLaCreme...

1155
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,092
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

1156
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:52,628
Con-drag-ulations.

1157
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:56,832
You've each won airfare
and a five-night stay

1158
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:01,270
at the Grand Resort Hotel
and Spa in Fort Lauderdale.

1159
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,005
Clothing optional.

1160
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,441
- Perfect.
[all laugh]

1161
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:07,643
- Shangela,

1162
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:08,677
Thorgy Thor...

1163
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,615
You are safe.

1164
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:17,119
That means Chi Chi DeVayne
and Morgan McMichaels,

1165
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,555
you are in the bottom two.

1166
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:20,656
- Oh, shit.

1167
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:22,591
First episode,
in the bottom.

1168
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:25,961
I've worked so hard
to be here on "All Stars,"

1169
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:28,197
and I do not want to go home,
like, at all.

1170
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,466
Like...

1171
00:48:30,466 --> 00:48:32,468
Oh, God.

1172
00:48:32,468 --> 00:48:34,870
- Aja and BenDeLaCreme,

1173
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,406
each of you needs to decide

1174
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:41,243
which of the bottom two
you will eliminate

1175
00:48:41,243 --> 00:48:43,846
if you win the lip sync.

1176
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:47,716
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

1177
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:52,021
the judges and I will watch
Vanessa and Pork Chop

1178
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:53,856
lip sync for their lives.

1179
00:48:53,856 --> 00:48:55,925
[all laugh]

1180
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:57,293
You may leave the stage.

1181
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:59,128
Coming up...

1182
00:48:59,128 --> 00:49:01,497
- I really wish you would
have gave Morgan--

1183
00:49:01,497 --> 00:49:03,365
- Yeah.
- Like 1,000%.

1184
00:49:03,365 --> 00:49:04,834
I'm about
to ruin somebody life.

1185
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,502
- I know that you're capable
of stronger work

1186
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:07,536
than you did tonight.

1187
00:49:07,536 --> 00:49:10,639
- Yeah.
- But sometimes you're done.

1188
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:12,741
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

1189
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,544
[RuPaul laughs]

1190
00:49:13,544 --> 00:49:16,080
- Whew.
Thank you.

1191
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,348
- This is "All Stars."

1192
00:49:17,348 --> 00:49:20,351
The lip sync for your legacy
rules are in effect,

1193
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:23,254
and we have to eliminate
one of these queens already,

1194
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:26,457
and I don't think anyone's
really ready for it.

1195
00:49:26,457 --> 00:49:28,226
- Well, first,
congratulations.

1196
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:29,560
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1197
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,329
- Cheers, top two.

1198
00:49:31,329 --> 00:49:33,664
- It feels insane because
I never was even in the top.

1199
00:49:33,664 --> 00:49:36,534
In my season, like,
I never went past safe.

1200
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:37,935
- You're only gonna get it once,
so enjoy it.

1201
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:39,203
- Fuck off.
[laughs]

1202
00:49:39,203 --> 00:49:41,439
- You're in a horrible position
right now, you guys.

1203
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:42,607
- I mean,
it's not great, right?

1204
00:49:42,607 --> 00:49:45,743
Like, this is the worst
double-edged sword.

1205
00:49:45,743 --> 00:49:48,613
It is really exciting
to win this challenge.

1206
00:49:48,613 --> 00:49:52,416
However,
I wanna judge fairly,

1207
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:55,553
and playing fair
does not involve eliminations

1208
00:49:55,553 --> 00:49:57,955
that you think are just
gonna help you personally.

1209
00:49:57,955 --> 00:50:01,292
This sucks.
- You have to pick somebody.

1210
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:03,294
- We have to because it's like
we'll never get anywhere

1211
00:50:03,294 --> 00:50:05,696
if we're just like
hugging each other.

1212
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:07,331
Girl, I'm okay
with sending people home

1213
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:09,634
because
it's a part of the gig.

1214
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:10,868
We signed up for it.

1215
00:50:10,868 --> 00:50:13,037
- Just think of it
as like a business decision.

1216
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:14,405
- So as this goes on,

1217
00:50:14,405 --> 00:50:17,208
are you guys gonna go on,
like, the performance that day,

1218
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,442
the performance
on the show overall?

1219
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:19,577
- It should be
a combination.

1220
00:50:19,577 --> 00:50:20,678
- I'd like to know

1221
00:50:20,678 --> 00:50:24,482
if we all have any system
or code in place

1222
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:26,350
for how we would like
to make our decisions

1223
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,418
from this night on.

1224
00:50:27,418 --> 00:50:29,487
Are we going off
the judges' critiques?

1225
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:31,055
Like, they sort of came

1226
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,624
to a little bit
of a consensus last season.

1227
00:50:33,624 --> 00:50:35,927
- Okay.
So Miss DeLa apparently

1228
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:38,129
is suffering from
the short-term memory loss.

1229
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:40,064
Did you see "All Stars 2?"

1230
00:50:40,064 --> 00:50:42,133
The whole group consensus thing
didn't work out.

1231
00:50:42,133 --> 00:50:45,036
Yes, we would all love
to be fair,

1232
00:50:45,036 --> 00:50:46,070
and I think
we should be fair.

1233
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:47,772
I will respect
the choice you make,

1234
00:50:47,772 --> 00:50:49,373
and you should do
the same for me.

1235
00:50:49,373 --> 00:50:51,409
- Underlying, we agree with
the judges most of the time.

1236
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:52,576
- Yes.
- No.

1237
00:50:52,576 --> 00:50:54,745
- I think everything
has to come into play.

1238
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:57,248
We should look at
the whole picture.

1239
00:50:57,248 --> 00:50:59,383
- As of now,
the elimination strategy

1240
00:50:59,383 --> 00:51:01,585
is definitely
a free-for-all.

1241
00:51:01,585 --> 00:51:03,421
Who knows
what's gonna happen?

1242
00:51:03,421 --> 00:51:06,090
- Can we all agree
that if one of us

1243
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,093
lets the other borrow their
gross rhinestone tank top,

1244
00:51:09,093 --> 00:51:10,761
that we won't save them?

1245
00:51:10,761 --> 00:51:12,663
- Aah!
[all laugh]

1246
00:51:12,663 --> 00:51:16,901
- I would like to take a moment
with Morgan and Chi Chi.

1247
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:18,002
- If that's okay with y'all.

1248
00:51:18,002 --> 00:51:19,003
- Yeah, that's cool.

1249
00:51:19,003 --> 00:51:20,104
- Unless y'all wanna fight.

1250
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:22,073
If y'all wanna fight,
we'll fight.

1251
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,344
- All right.

1252
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:28,279
- Hi, how are you?

1253
00:51:28,279 --> 00:51:29,780
- It is what it is.
- Yeah.

1254
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,149
- Somebody gotta go home first,
you know what I mean?

1255
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:35,453
When it all boils down to it,
I fucked up,

1256
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:38,756
but I don't want you
to feel like I'm giving up.

1257
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:41,325
I've always been a fighter.
I've fought my whole life.

1258
00:51:41,325 --> 00:51:42,760
I fought to get here.

1259
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,962
- I do think you're
a super fierce competitor,

1260
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:46,897
and I know
that you're capable

1261
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:48,265
of stronger work
than you did tonight.

1262
00:51:48,265 --> 00:51:50,267
- Yeah.
- But sometimes you're done,

1263
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:52,103
and that's okay,
you know what I mean?

1264
00:51:52,103 --> 00:51:54,305
Because you have a full career
ahead of you no matter what.

1265
00:51:54,305 --> 00:51:55,906
- I don't want to go home

1266
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:58,642
because I feel like I still
have something to prove,

1267
00:51:58,642 --> 00:52:01,846
but I'm really not counting
on DeLa to have my back.

1268
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:08,185
- I haven't been on "Drag Race"
since 2010.

1269
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:10,154
I've wanted this
for so long

1270
00:52:10,154 --> 00:52:12,323
because I have
so much more to give

1271
00:52:12,323 --> 00:52:13,624
and so much more to show,

1272
00:52:13,624 --> 00:52:16,460
and now the chance
that I might be going home,

1273
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,095
that's the kick in the tits.

1274
00:52:18,095 --> 00:52:19,397
- This is the T.

1275
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:20,498
You're such a bitch.

1276
00:52:20,498 --> 00:52:22,066
Like, you could literally
point at someone

1277
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:23,934
and make them feel like
they're gonna fucking die.

1278
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:29,140
But I really wish you would
have gave Morgan, like, 1,000%.

1279
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,175
- The reason why
I was reserved

1280
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:32,510
was because it was something

1281
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,345
that I had recorded
and done myself.

1282
00:52:34,345 --> 00:52:37,515
- I've seen Morgan perform
several times.

1283
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:41,719
I've had Morgan
force-feed me vodka in a bar.

1284
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,055
I know she can give me
so much more than that.

1285
00:52:46,524 --> 00:52:51,228

I am not mad about it.

This is gonna be

- You were saying that you
would be strategic about--

1310
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:45,049
- Absolutely.

1311
00:53:45,049 --> 00:53:46,050
- About possibly
eliminating girls

1312
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,051
that you saw
as big competition.

1313
00:53:47,051 --> 00:53:49,687
- Uh-huh.
- And it is hard for me

1314
00:53:49,687 --> 00:53:53,290
not to think about,
like, if you stay--

1315
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,892
- Is that what I'm gonna do?

1316
00:53:54,892 --> 00:53:56,927
- Would you knock me out,
you know what I mean?

1317
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:58,162
Like, that's obviously
on my mind.

1318
00:53:58,162 --> 00:53:59,730
I can't pretend
that's not there.

1319
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:01,699
- We talk about, oh,
we're family, we're sisters.

That's fine.
We are those things.

- Yeah.

1322
00:54:04,602 --> 00:54:06,971
- But like straight-up
honesty,

1323
00:54:06,971 --> 00:54:08,772
I would send
the stronger girl home,

1324
00:54:08,772 --> 00:54:11,108
and that's just the truth.

1325
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:13,244
I guess you have to look
at how you think.

1326
00:54:13,244 --> 00:54:15,579
If you want to go
with what the judges said,

1327
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:18,649
I think that they picked on
her hair and her shoes

1328
00:54:18,649 --> 00:54:21,185
and the kind of
all-around appearance,

1329
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:24,288
and they just picked on
my, you know,

1330
00:54:24,288 --> 00:54:28,859
lack of effervescence,
you know.

1331
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:30,895
- Yeah.

1332
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:34,565
- It's clear
that DeLa does not agree

1333
00:54:34,565 --> 00:54:36,367
with the way
I want to send people home.

1334

She's, you know,
Miss Congeniality.

1335
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:42,506
But if DeLa's making her
decision based on the critiques,

I don't like you

- All right.

1412
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:22,496
Ladies,
I have made my decision.

1413
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,371
BenDeLaCreme,

1414
00:58:31,371 --> 00:58:32,506
you're a winner, baby.

1415
00:58:32,506 --> 00:58:36,910
[applause]

1416
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,944
- Thank you.

1417
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:39,980
I'm the first winner.

1418
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,748
I won
my first lip sync ever.

1419
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:43,884
I feel incredible.

1420
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:45,018
Like,
I'm on top of the world.

1421
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:50,257
- And you've earned
a cash tip of $10,000.

1422
00:58:50,257 --> 00:58:51,792
- I'll take it.

1423
00:58:51,792 --> 00:58:54,294
- [laughs]

1424
00:58:54,294 --> 00:58:56,830
- Aja, you are safe.

1425
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,331
- Thank you so much.

1426
00:59:02,135 --> 00:59:05,639
- Will the bottom two
please step forward?

1427
00:59:10,777 --> 00:59:15,949
BenDeLaCreme, with great power
comes great responsibility.

1428
00:59:15,949 --> 00:59:21,021
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

1429
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:23,190
- I think you guys are both
super fierce queens,

1430
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,292
but Chi Chi,
I know that you know

1431
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:27,694
that you didn't bring your
strongest performance tonight.

1432
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,896
Morgan, I think
that you took a risk

1433
00:59:29,896 --> 00:59:31,731
and you tried
something new tonight,

1434
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:33,733
and I don't think that
it was a perfect payoff,

1435
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:34,768
and you know that.

1436
00:59:34,768 --> 00:59:37,270
And when we as a group
talked about

1437
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:40,640
why we might eliminate somebody
moving forward,

1438
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,643
we talked about that we would
not want to make that decision,

1439
00:59:43,643 --> 00:59:45,178
pretty much unanimously,

1440
00:59:45,178 --> 00:59:47,714
based on knocking somebody
that we saw

1441
00:59:47,714 --> 00:59:49,115
as fierce competition
out of the way.

1442
00:59:49,115 --> 00:59:50,784
And you were very forthright
in saying

1443
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:52,552
that that is something
that you would do,

1444
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:58,024
and in the interest
of everyone moving forward,

1445
00:59:58,024 --> 00:59:59,693
I chose Morgan McMichaels.

1446
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:04,231
- Morgan McMichaels.
- Yes.

1447
01:00:04,231 --> 01:00:07,501
- You are and will always be
an All Star.

1448
01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:08,935
- Thank you.

1449
01:00:08,935 --> 01:00:11,338
- Now sashay away.

1450
01:00:11,338 --> 01:00:12,739
- Thank you, guys.

1451
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:16,376
[applause]

1452
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:18,712
- I'm confused by DeLa.

1453
01:00:18,712 --> 01:00:22,215
I think she believes that
we're set on a group consensus

1454
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:24,551
of how we're gonna actually
send the girls home,

1455
01:00:24,551 --> 01:00:25,785
but nope.

1456
01:00:25,785 --> 01:00:28,922
Baby, that's a completely
different TV show.

1457
01:00:30,123 --> 01:00:31,892
- Performing my own track,
I think,

1458
01:00:31,892 --> 01:00:34,494
was a little,
you know, risqué.

1459
01:00:34,494 --> 01:00:36,196
But I think that
it's a little contradictory

1460
01:00:36,196 --> 01:00:37,564
that DeLa sent me home,

1461
01:00:37,564 --> 01:00:40,100
because I wasn't the worst
out of the two.

1462
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,134
But I'm grateful to be here.

1463
01:00:41,134 --> 01:00:42,536
Even though
I'm the first to go,

1464
01:00:42,536 --> 01:00:45,672
I'm still part of a legacy,
so I'm excited about that.

1465
01:00:45,672 --> 01:00:46,673
If I had to say anything--
[bell rings]

1466
01:00:46,673 --> 01:00:48,008
Oh, shit.

1467
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,146
- Blessed be, kitty girl.

1468
01:00:53,146 --> 01:00:54,981
Don't be scared.

1469
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:56,716
I got your back.

1470
01:00:56,716 --> 01:01:00,287
[evil laugh]

1471
01:01:01,454 --> 01:01:03,924
- I don't know
what that means.

1472
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:05,725
Like, seriously though,

1473
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:09,696
does anyone want
to tell a bitch? No?

1474
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:15,869
- Next time on
"All Stars..."

1475
01:01:15,869 --> 01:01:20,941
You'll be performing
our very own VH1 Divas Live.

1476
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:22,075
[cheering]

1477
01:01:22,075 --> 01:01:24,844
- Five, six--
Kennedy, where you at?

1478
01:01:24,844 --> 01:01:26,112
- I got lost.

1479
01:01:26,112 --> 01:01:27,914
- You can't let your backup
dancers upstage you.

1480
01:01:27,914 --> 01:01:29,716
- 'Cause I'm coming for you
back here, baby.

1481
01:01:29,716 --> 01:01:32,152
- Ooh.
- You didn't know the words,

1482
01:01:32,152 --> 01:01:33,987
and if you did,
then you missed them.

1483
01:01:34,988 --> 01:01:36,890
- Okay.

1484
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,159
- I'm being set up to fail.

1485
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,928
- Don't ever sleep
on Chi Chi DeVayne, boo.

1486
01:01:41,928 --> 01:01:44,831
- I was in character
the entire time.

1487
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,566
It's stupid.

1488
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:49,035
- [chuckles] Girl...
