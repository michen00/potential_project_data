00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,569
- Previously on All Stars...

3
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,471
Blessed be, Kitty Girl.

4
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,506
- What the hell is going on?

5
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,876
- You haven't seen
the last of me.

6
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,778
The day of reckoning is upon us.

7
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:12,813
- Y'all scaring me.

8
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,950
[screaming]

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,787
- How many of my eliminated
girls were you able to capture?

10
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,956
- We think you'll be pleased.

11
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,325
- Show yourselves.

12
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,362
- Morgan of BenDeLaCreme.

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,598
- Aja of Bebe Zahara Benet.

14
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:35,936
- Chi Chi of BenDeLaCreme
and Shangela.

15
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:39,873
- Wait a minute, just three?

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,874
- Sorry we're late.
- Sorry.

17
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,643
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- So sorry, oh, my gosh.

18
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,378
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,414
- Milk of Kennedy.

20
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,551
- Thorgy of Shangela.

21
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:56,790
- The time has come
for your revenge.

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,026
[cackling]

23
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,365
- Wait...

24
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,334
Did I leave the iron
on in my dressing room?

25
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,772
No, I'm good.

26
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,440
[cackling]

27
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,719
[sighing]

28
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,588
- Good job, girl.
- Good job, bitch.

29
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,524
- You were really fabulous.
"I love you bitches.

30
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,794
Honestly, thank you from
the bottom of my heart."

31
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,963
- [sighs]

32
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,664
It's a bummer.

33
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,599
I think Aja kind of
made us feel motivated

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,102
that someone so young
was so good.

35
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,236
- She was such a firecracker.

36
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,073
It was just really, really hard,
but I know she is going

37
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,607
to take everything from here,

38
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,010
and she is going
to be unbeatable.

39
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,379
I made the right decision
when I thought Shangy was

40
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,982
the stronger contender,
but it's also sad

41
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,585
because I know Aja
really wants to be here.

42
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,454
To Aja.
- To Aja.

43
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,457
- Love you Aja-poo.

44
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,325
- Ooh, let me get
all this off.

45
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,994
Help me Lord Jesus.

46
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:11,031
- So girl, who you pick?

47
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,834
- I also chose Aja.
- Oh, thank you.

48
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,671
- It is obviously you helped me
last week, but besides that,

49
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,972
you had a better track record,

50
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,041
you've done more
with your time on "Drag Race,"

51
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,676
and I believe that next week

52
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:25,345
you would be doing things
maybe Aja couldn't.

53
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,780
- Well, I'm so happy to be here.

54
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,049
Thank you and thank you.

55
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,886
When both BeBe and Trixie
choose me to stay,

56
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,789
I'm like, honey, the work
has not been in vain.

57
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,492
I do want the validation from
Ru, but I love having it

58
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,327
from my sisters as well.

59
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,662
Them saying, you know what,
you belong in this competition.

60
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,866
I know I belong, but it's nice
to know they think that too.

61
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,035
So we've been basing a lot
of stuff on track records.

62
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,504
Where are we on track
records right now?

63
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,872
BenDeLa has the most.

64
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,707
- I have one win.

65
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,509
- I have one.
- One, one, two, one.

66
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,711
- But then if we go on bottoms,
then how many bottoms?

67
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,413
- One.
- One.

68
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,580
- How about you?
- Never.

69
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,049
- Never.

70
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,851
- I've been in the bottom twice,
but I really do just believe

71
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,021
that the race is not given
to the swift or the strong,

72
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,891
it's the one that endures.

73
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,826
It's not about a track record,

74
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,062
it's about who is there
at that moment,

75
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,098
and that's what
it's about in my opinion.

76
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:21,668
- It was clear what the criteria
was when it was like all of us,

77
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,771
but now it's getting very,
like, personal viewpoints.

78
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,908
We all have our own
individual scorecards.

79
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,777
Ben has the most wins,
then Shangela, but,

80
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,946
like, Shangela and I have been
the most with "Drag Race."

81
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,381
We probably have
the biggest careers.

82
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,749
That also matters.

83
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,018
Kennedy is a fucking fabulous
competitor,

84
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,520
but she has the worst
track record here,

85
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,755
and BeBe won
"Drag Race" already.

86
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,824
It's like apples and oranges.

87
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,360
We're gonna have to pull
lipsticks we don't wanna pull.

88
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,832
It's bad.
It's bad news, Brenda.

89
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,703
- [RuPaul] The winner of
"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars"

90
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,472

[vocalizing]

100
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,966
- There is significantly
less of us here.

101
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:30,804
- It's another day in the
workroom, and baby, I'm here.

102
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,040
[laughing]
Thank God I'm still here.

103
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,977
- Hello, hello, hello.

104
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,378

- My top five All Stars.

107
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,785
For this week's maxi challenge,
you'll be auditioning

108
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,389
to be part of
my new super group,

109
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,490
the Kitty Girls.

110
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,491
- Ooh.

111
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,727
- Hashtag #AllStars3.

112
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,663
First, each of you
needs to create

113
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,333
a distinctive Kitty Girl
look and persona,

114
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,837
and then write lyrics
for your solo

115
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,672
on the Kitty Girls
debut single.

116
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,374
- Oh.

117
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,544
- Now, to help you purr-fect
your Kitty Girl look,

118
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,747
you can use fabric

119
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,716
and hair provided
by Rock Star Wigs.

120
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,820
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman--

121
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,024
wait a minute.

122
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,792
I almost forgot.

123
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,394
- Oh, Lord.

124
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:31,631
- In addition to you,
my top five All Stars,

125
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,769
I've decided to audition
a few other girls.

126
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,907
[screaming]

127
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,777
- Hey, yo, Sis, I'm back.

128
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,581
- Say hello to Morgan, Thorgy,
Chi Chi, Milk, and Aja.

129
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,416
- Oh, my gosh.

130
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,984
- [Aja] These remaining queens
are acting like

131
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:55,722
they're not bothered, but
they're clearly bothered.

132
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:59,859
- The eliminated queens
will be forming their own

133
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,895
competing Kitty Girl group.

134
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,965
- Ahh!
- Work!

135
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,933
- And tomorrow on
the main stage,

136
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,837
the two groups will go head
to head and toe to toe.

137
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,975
Now in the end, one of
the top five All Stars

138
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,977
will get the chop

139
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,512
and be replaced

140
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,681
by one of the
eliminated queens.

141
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,852
- Oh, it's gonna be so good.

142
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,421
a crock of shit.

143
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,421
- I think it's

144
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,625
It's not fair,
and it's not right.

145
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,428
I'd rather one of us leave
and that be that,

146
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,064
not let another bitch come in
and we've been working

147
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,668
five damn episodes and
they done missed all of them.

148
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,337
- In a moment you'll head
to the studio

149
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,574
where you'll be working with
the amazing Adam Lambert.

150
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,342
- Oh!
- All right!

151
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,547
- And tomorrow on the main
stage, we'll be joined

152
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,984
by the legendary Emma Bunton
from the Spice Girls.

153
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,587
- [cheering]
- Oh my God!

154
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,790
- I can't believe
Baby Spice is coming.

155
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,459
I spent a good part of my youth
pretending to be Baby Spice,

156
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,595
and a lot of my adulthood,
so I'm pretty happy.

157
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,030
Oh, my God.

158
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,365
- Now, I know you have a lot
of catching up to do,

159
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,402
so gentlemen,
start your engines,

160
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:18,672
and may the best All Star win.

161
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,742
- Oh!

162
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,943
- Oh, bitch.

163
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,478
- I'm so happy to see you.

164
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,982
- Baby, do not be fooled by
the hugs and the kissin'

165
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,084
and the sissin' and the
whatever you wanna call it.

166
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,486
Baby, the shit is
about to hit the fan.

167
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,021
- Great day to have never
drawn a lipstick.

168
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,657
I never won a lipstick,
so I'm like hey, guys.

169
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,427
- So you just wanna
coast through?

170
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,629
- Shangela, I heard you
were really mad

171
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,965
about my lipstick message
that I left.

172
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,568
- To be very honest with you,
I was like not a big deal.

173
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,402
- What did you think
I meant by that?

174
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,503
- Time out.
I'm gonna let you know.

175
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,406
So the lipstick message when
you told me to suck it,

176
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,042
I told everybody in this room,

177
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,911
she must have maybe been
in her feelings.

178
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,546
- Cool.

179
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:02,515
- Now, the next day, when
I discovered a note

180
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,751
that was left for Trixie
that said,

181
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:08,855
"Shangela is a fucking
shady fucking bitch",

182
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,559
I was cracked by that.
- She posted that in her area.

183
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,494
- This fucking letter again?

184
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,763
- Posted it?
- Yeah.

185
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,531
- Well, Trixie, did you show
it to her to get her upset?

186
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,933
- No.
- She hung it on the wall.

187
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:20,800
- She put it on her wall.

188
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,968
- It was obviously
done for a reason.

189
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,570
- This is what transpired,

190
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,472
because I can't have
this conversation again.

191
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,540
- I can. I'd love to have
a conversation about feelings

192
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,908
about me behind my back.

193
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,810
Don't shush me Trixie.

194
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,978
I'm sorry if you don't want
to talk about it anymore,

195
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,680
but guess what, I do.

196
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,449
I'm a little surprised that
like everyone got to see that

197
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,318
and then judged me
while I wasn't here

198
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,486
when it supposed to be
like a joke to her.

199
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,054
- Girl, it was taped
on her wall.

200
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,522
That's what I told Trixie.

201
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,624
I said, that's between
you and your friend.

202
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,993
I would've read the note
and like, girl, she crazy,

203
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,828
and put it in my pocket.

204
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,331
I wouldn't have posted it
where everybody could see.

205
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,567
- I hate that note.

206
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,702
- I never dragged you like that.

207
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,036
It actually hurt my feelings.

208
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,805
- It sounds like you
were really upset, girl.

209
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,973
- No, I was.

210
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,075
Because I had never called
you no shady fucking bitch.

211
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,477
I would not have written
something like that about you.

212
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,079
- No, you wouldn't have.

213
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,914
I was in my feelings.

214
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,784
So moving forward, I had
time to contemplate

215
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,452
why you chose my lipstick.

216
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,987
What the hell was that about?

217
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,724
- I always said I was hoping
to keep strong competitors,

218
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,894
but in the challenge, I felt
like she had more to do--

219
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,096
- And you guys had some
secret, like, shaking hand,

220
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,665
like, oh, no matter what?

221
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,701
- Okay, I'll answer your
second question next, okay?

222
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,871
I felt like she had a
taller order in her challenge.

223
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,040
She was asked to do 15--

224
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,108
- That's not what
you just said that.

225
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,776
- Hold on.
Baby, I ain't done.

226
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,978
Numero uno, I said--

227
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,513
- Girl, I love you.

228
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,915
- Baby, you keep-- don't
start about loving me,

229
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:42,982
because you keep
cutting me off

230
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,951
while I'm trying
to say my thing.

231
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,386
Either--I'll let you finish,
and then you tell me

232
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,055
when it's my turn.
- All right.

233
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,957
- Luckily the tables
are pretty heavy,

234
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,726
so there was gonna be no
flipping of any sort of table.

235
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,728
- You feel that the only
reason I kept Kennedy

236
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,931
is because we're friends.
That's not true.

237
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,567
I just felt like she had
more to do in the challenge,

238
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,602
therefore, to me,
you were supposed

239
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,537
to up the amount you did
in the challenge.

240
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,739
It was a hard choice to make,
and I just made it.

241
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,941
- And it happened to be me.

242
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,075
- Yes, ma'am.

243
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,910
- So when I come at you like,
I have the right to feel

244
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,512
that way too because
it's how I feel.

245
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,347
- I get it, no tea,

246
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,382
and I hope we can still
be cool after this.

247
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,318
- Let's just move forward.

248
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,919
I also still love Shangela,

249
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,489
but what I wanted
was like closure.

250
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,957
I don't think I should've been
in the bottom two,

251
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,727
however, Shangela didn't
put me there.

252
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,896
- So Ben, what was your
criteria for sending me home?

253
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,835
- We had talked about the
idea of wanting to keep

254
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:39,105
the girls moving forward
who were performing the best.

255
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,074
- No. We did not come
to no consensus on that.

256
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,475
- No, you didn't.

257
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,577
- And you had said that
you would knock

258
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,713
those girls out of it,
so I was like, okay,

259
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,482
if I make this decision now,
moving forward

260
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,884
we'll all be on
the same page.

261
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:51,951
It was a hard decision
to make at the time.

262
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,586
- Had you said it--

263
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,988
- But also keep in mind,
if that had been removed,

264
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,322
I still would've thought
that you were

265
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,391
the weakest performance
of the night.

266
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,027
- But in appearance,
in performance, I didn't flub.

267
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,862
If you'd listened to what
the judges said,

268
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,532
there's no way that
I was weaker than her.

269
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,367
But you should know this,
at least I was honest

270
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,835
with everybody up front.
You changed it--

271
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,036
- But I was honest
with you as well.

272
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,105
- No you--
no, you weren't.

273
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,573
Because you sat on
that white couch

274
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,042
saying we're gonna do it
the way the judges want

275
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,744
and we're gonna be sisters,

276
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,412
and then at the last minute
you changed your mind.

277
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,813
You have every right
to do that,

278
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:24,484
but for me, that makes
you a coward.

279
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,486
- Ooh, oh Miss Morgan is hot.

280
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,588
Bitch, somebody must've
put hot coals down

281
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,658
Miss Morgan's panties, honey,
'cause she is steaming.

282
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,760
- So when you said I'm doing
the best for the girls,

283
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,429
you basically told me
I wasn't part of that,

284
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,497
and that's fine 'cause
you don't know me.

285
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,898
- Well, you decided-- no,
I don't know you at all.

286
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,033
- You sure don't.

287
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,900
- Like I said,
super forthright--

288
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,769
- Right.

289
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,837
- --in saying that you didn't
want to play by the rules

290
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,673
that the community--

291
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,907
- But you understand what
a hypocrite is, right?

292
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,576
- Ooh!

293
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,777
Sister, I don't think
they're gonna find

294
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,779
a bridge over troubled
water, unh-unh.

295
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,382
- [RuPaul] Coming up...

296
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:56,983
- I thought the least
you could've done was say,

297
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,751
hey, Aja helped me.

298
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,755
- You sat on this couch,
read my drag for feel.

299
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,357
- What?

300
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,960
- I don't owe nobody no apology,
point blank and simple.

301
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,697
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

302
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:11,864
[RuPaul laughs]

303
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,669
- If you were judging the way
that you said you were judging,

304
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,438
I should've still
stayed in the competition,

305
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,672
and that's just flat out.

306
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,041
So at the beginning of
the competition,

307
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,777
DeLa made it seem like she was
going to eliminate the queens

308
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,380
who had the worst critiques
by the judges,

309
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,781
and she didn't do that.

310
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,051
She eliminated me based on
the fact that I was going

311
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,454
to send the strongest girl
in the bottom home.

312
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,923
So now I'm calling
her out basically.

313
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,560
- While I see that it's, like--
- Hypocritical?

314
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,595
- There's, like--
- Yeah.

315
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,464
- I see why there's hypocrisy
in that, which is why I said

316
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,332
as soon as you walked out
the door that I'm trying

317
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,768
my best to make the decision
I think is right

318
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,536
for the competition over all.

319
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,038
- I'm not a fucking idiot.

320
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,407
because DeLa's afraid of

321
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,407
DeLa will not own shit

322
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,876
what the fans think, and
that's just straight up.

323
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,646
- I mean...
- No other way you try

324
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,415
and mince the words,
it's hypocritical.

325
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,751
- I'm tuning out because
it does not help me

326
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,319
to be present for this.

327
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,087
Like I'm not available
to be vented at.

328
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,456
[clears throat]

329
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,459
- Okay, so this is how I feel.

330
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,695
I wasn't mad that
you sent me home.

331
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,731
I was more mad that when
the judges were like,

332
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,667
we love the way you look,
we love your outfit,

333
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,603
and you literally
just said thank you.

334
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,772
And I just thought it was
kind of messed up because

335
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:26,773
I thought the least
you could've done was say,

336
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,409
"Hey, Aja helped me."

337
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,810
- Really?

338
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,712
Would it have changed anything?

339
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:38,418
Hey, Judges, oh, she helped
me with part of my body.

340
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,620
Would it have mattered
that nobody really liked

341
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,756
what you have presented
on the runway?

342
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,825
- I also feel like in
the deliberation, like,

343
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,427
you're about to do right now
and cut me off,

344
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,861
I tried to talk to you
and you kind of

345
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,563
just spoke over me
the whole time.

346
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,365
- Okay, great.

347
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,800
I'm happy that you were
able to express that.

348
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,636
First of all, I'm going
to say that your elimination

349
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,573
was one of the toughest
for me and very emotional.

350
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,742
- Here we go, Mother,
hear me out.

351
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,644
I'm like what is with
these introductions.

352
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,079
What are you, the queen of--

353
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,014
shut up, just answer
the question.

354
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,817
- I'm sorry if you feel that
I was talking over you.

355
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,920
I feel like that was a moment
that I could really, really

356
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,856
encourage you, and when
it comes to the runway

357
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,826
everybody knows I don't talk
too much on the runway.

358
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:20,860
I just don't.

359
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,497
- But everybody on
the runway said who helped.

360
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,599
I just think it's fair
because you're getting praise

361
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,501
for something that it's
a design challenge

362
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,802
and they're up there
thinking that

363
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,070
you made that
from head to toe.

364
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,439
- Aja, what I'm simply
saying is a compliment

365
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,743
was given to me about
my garment, thank you.

366
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:39,645
- Ah!

367
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,715
Does it take that much
pride to like just take

368
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,683
a step back and say,

369
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,319
"Aja helped me a lot,
thank you so much."

370
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,621
Does that really take that much?

371
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,923
- [Aja] Whatever. I didn't come
here to argue with BeBe.

372
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,993
I came here to continue
my run on the show,

373
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,096
but if BeBe ends up in the
bottom, I will send her home.

374
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,331
That's all I have
to say on that one.

375
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,566
[laughs]

376
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,835
- Since we're talking
about sending girls home

377
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,805
and what the reasoning behind
sending somebody home is...

378
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,742
I don't--
what was your reason?

379
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,943
- You don't get why
I sent you home?

380
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,345
- No.
- I have a lot of reasons.

381
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,746
Okay.

382
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,815
The first reason was during
the Bitchelor

383
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,517
it was like a struggle for you,

384
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,520
and I didn't find
not one moment funny.

385
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,090
So for me, that was
the first X.

386
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,026
Second of all, you sat
on this couch,

387
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,028
read my drag for feel.

388
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,730
That shit hurt my feelings.

389
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,566
Then you would have
chosen me to go home.

390
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,736
- I think I would've
chosen Thorgy to stay.

391
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,539
- That sent a shock through
my brain too, because I'm like,

392
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,607
I thought we were
closer than that.

393
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,775
- And you wanted
to save your friend.

394
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,076
- Huh?

395
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,077
- And you wanted to
save your friend.

396
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,412
- No, that's not it at all.

397
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,880
- That's exactly how it is.

398
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,415
- Well, that's not it at all.

399
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,652
Then you act like
your shit didn't stink.

400
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,854
You didn't even-- and see,
right, you don't even know

401
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,523
what I'm talking about.

402
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,726
I'm tearing up right now
because I just felt

403
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:02,762
that there was nothing
genuine with you,

404
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,564
and it just seemed
like Milk was only

405
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,400
concerned about herself.
- What?

406
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,637
- Milk just felt
like he was above everybody,

407
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,673
and we all noticed that.

408
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,842
Correct me if I'm wrong girls,
am I the only one?

409
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,677
- No.
- Okay.

410
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,445
- I just don't want
to jump in over anybody.

411
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,583
- [Milk] It's really hard
hearing so many people chime in

412
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,053
and just like subtly
raise their hand.

413
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,688
I mean, they were basically
saying I'm an asshole.

414
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,491
Am I an asshole?

415
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,360
Why didn't you come up
to me and talk--

416
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,428
I mean, you know
I'm approachable.

417
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,664
- Milk, but you have never
even presented yourself

418
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,967
and it was like you kept
running to Trixie,

419
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,569
kept running to Trixie,
and then all of that

420
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,638
just came together,
so you know what?

421
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,807
I'd rather not work
with somebody that is not

422
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,644
gonna be 100 percent
real and helpful.

423
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,579
I don't owe nobody no apology.

424
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,883
I know how I felt,
point blank and simple.

425
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,353
- All right.
This isn't going anywhere.

426
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,457
Let's stop fighting, and let's
send all of the girls

427
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,459
that are still here home
by kicking their asses.

428
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,526
- It ain't no secret.

429
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,663
If we win, these girls
are gonna send the people

430
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,665
home who sent them home.

431
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,034
These girls are out for blood.

432
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,738
- Gather around
cross dressers.

433
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,539
- I think this is an
interesting opportunity to

434
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,708
put forward like
a fierce number,

435
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,678
but also it'd be fun
to put a message through.

436
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,813
Like, we're all eliminated,
we're all, you know,

437
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,716
back for another chance.
- Yeah.

438
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,952
- We have nothing to lose and
everything to fucking gain.

439
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,088
- I want to be Sparkle Kitty.

440
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,723
- Oh, that's cute.

441
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,725
- She's lit up, she's ebullient,
and she's like--

442
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,826
- She's like
the dance team captain.

443
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,361
- Yeah.

444
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,564
- I wanna be Diva Kitty,
very confident, strong.

445
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,533
- We're deciding who's
gonna take what part

446
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,702
of the song and
who's gonna chose

447
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,971
what kind of character
to bring it to life.

448
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,940
- I want to be something,
I want to be like,

449
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,776
[vocalizing].

450
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,744
What would that be?
Like, that would not be diva.

451
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,113
[laughing]

452
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,348
- What about Mother Kitty?

453
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,785
- Don't put her
in that category.

454
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,653
- I'm thinking she has kids
'cause she's old.

455
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,956
Ah!

456
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:14,093
- Maybe like Jungle Kitty,
but like wild.

457
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,895
- Yeah.
- Right, like Jungle Kitty.

458
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,563
- I love that.

459
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,632
- Because no matter
who we are individually,

460
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,968
I think collectively
we're a fun group, right?

461
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,970
- Yes.
- You're-- right?

462
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,771
I'm like, you're gonna
have fun, right?

463
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,440
- I mean, friends fight.

464
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,775
- You can just tell totally
tell that BenDeLa's rattled.

465
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,979
Her having that conversation
with Morgan shook her.

466
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,549
What are you thinking BenDeLa?

467
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,950
- I don't know yet.

468
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,952
So we've got like puss, diva.

469
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,989
- Yeah.
- Depressed.

470
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,557
- No, you're not depressed.

471
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,492
- After that conversation
I generally am.

472
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,329
I mean, so far this competition
has been about, like,

473
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,832
talent and all of us,
like, bringing it

474
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,500
and being respectful,

475
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,935
and I'm just like really
not here for this drama.

476
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,805
Like, I'm not here for drama.

477
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,875
That's not what
I'm here to do.

478
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,412
- I'm actually glad that Thorgy
was able to clear the air

479
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,714
about how she felt, and
now I think, hopefully,

480
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,316
it's resolved and
we can move on.

481
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:10,916
You and I talked.
- Yeah.

482
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:11,917
- We moved on.

483
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,490
- Trying to focus
when you feel like hurt

484
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,392
or attacked is difficult.

485
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,028
I would like--
I'm so shook right now.

486
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,362
- Just shake it off, sis.

487
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,196
- You gotta shake it off,
sister.

488
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,698
This is what you do.
- No, totally.

489
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,532
- You're a performer,
you're a character.

490
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,100
Let that go.

491
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,870
- I'm worried because this
is a group challenge.

492
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,841
One weak link means
that we all fail.

493
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,411
- [RuPaul] Coming up...

- ♪ Raka ta ti ti ta ta

495
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,915
- I rapped in "No, She Better
Don't" on Season Six.

496
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,984
I think it was the most
memorable rap.

- Hi, everybody!

503
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,466
This week's maxi challenge
is to perform

504
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,769
in competing girl groups,
the Kitty Girls, meow.

505
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,905
Right now it's time
to record our Kitty Girl track

506
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,606
with Adam Lambert.

507
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,108

to be here today.

508
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,910
I'm here to make you your best.

509
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,345
This is your chance to get
back into the competition,

510
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,382
so we gotta get really good
performances out of you today.

511
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,750
- Our team is
the returning girls,

512
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,352
and we have a fire
under our butts because,

513

00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,860
So find something to change
it up, because if you just

685
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,629
do it like that, it sounds like
you're kind of half assing it.

686

- It's harder to concentrate
when you're upset,

I'm just gonna keep

pushing myself back towards
what I'm here to do.

689

in the shape of a smile ♪

694
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,390
Look, most of us got confronted
by the eliminated queens,

695
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,394
but we've moved on,
and DeLa needs to do the same

696
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,597
because look, bitch,
this is a group number.

697
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,399
And if LaToya and LaTavia
can't hit the notes then

698

in Destiny's Child, okay?

699
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,005
So she's gotta
pull it together.

700
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,473
- Coming up...

701
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,741
- If I feel you
this certain way,

702
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,409
then I'm just gonna shut down.

703
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,512

shafted that I was let

704

like a douche bag.

So now it's time for us
to get up in the gig

for our Kitty Girl
performances for the judges.

Now the real tea is that
today someone is going home,

711
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,573
and one of these eliminated
queens comes back.

712
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,074
- I'm happy for someone
coming back,

713
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,676
because I've been that girl.

714
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,878

so tight

that one of us goes next,

but that's All Stars.

717
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,687
- Did you and Morgan have
a chance to talk today?

718
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,922
- We didn't.

719

we haven't followed up.

I just feel like, you know,
the ball's in her court.

721
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,426
- Right.

722
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,427
- I'm just focusing
on what I'm doing.

723
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,063
Like, I'm not ignoring her,

724
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,632
but I'm just trying to keep
my eyes on the prize.

725
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,634
This one thing with Morgan
has brought up

726
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,537
this feeling of am
I compromising, like,

727
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,005
my personal ideals,

728
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,741
ideals about, like, not
wanting to be a part of,

729
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,910
like, unnecessary conflict.

730
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,546
That kind of has been gnawing
at me since even before

731
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,748
I came here,
and the fact that I need

732
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,984
to eliminate somebody
every time I win,

733
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,385
I don't care about it.

734
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,020
It doesn't, like,
resonate with me.

735
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,057
Competition itself has not
ever been something

736
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,326
that I like got into
this game to be a part of.

737
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,361
I'm competitive with myself.

738
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,463
- See, I know her really well,

739
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:55,634
and I don't think she comes
from like a mean-spirited place.

740
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,069
- Yeah.

741
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:58,704
- And I think that maybe
you should pull her aside.

742
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,573
Look, nothing's gonna
get resolved by you

743

her sitting over there.

We don't know what's
gonna happen tonight.

You may never have
this opportunity

to clear the air
with her again.

Sometimes you just gotta
pull the Band-Aid off.

I don't-- I don't know--

749
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,022
like, I don't know
what to say to, like,

750

make anything feel better, but
I just want you to know--

751
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:19,958
- You don't have
to say anything.

752
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,727
- Okay.

753
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,962
- I'm not mad at your decision,
I was confused by it.

754
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,098
I was like, but that's
not what she said.

755
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,501
- Yeah.
- And I felt like--

756
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,837
I felt, like, dumbfounded
a little bit.

757
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,972
And then yesterday I needed
to say what I needed to say

758
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,108
right then and there or
it was never coming out,

759
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,411
and it just kind of
verbal diarrhea'd, you know.

760
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,713
And when I questioned you about
it, you were just kind of like,

761
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,415
well, that's, you know,
and I was like,

762
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:45,450
is this bitch being smug
right now?

763
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,519
- I just kind of glaze over
in those moments,

764
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,987
and I don't always know
how people interpret that

765
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:51,323
or if it feels like you
were saying, I seemed smug.

766
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:54,893
Like, I just-- I'm like,
power down, can't deal.

767
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,862
- I felt terrible the whole day
because I was like, bitch,

768
00:29:56,862 --> 00:30:00,365
I just came for her
too much without giving her

769
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:04,970
a chance to even respond,
so I have to say I'm sorry.

770
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,005
I'm confrontational.

771
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,541
She's so anti-confrontational.

772
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,544
Maybe had I come in a little
softer or less pointed,

773
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,579
she would've responded
to me a lot different.

774
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,581
Truce and peace and all
that kinda shit, yeah.

775
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,783
- Yeah.
No, I feel the same way.

776
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,384
I really respect your work.

777
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,085
- Honey, you fuck with me,
you're stuck with me.

778
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,320
I'm not going fucking anywhere.

779
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,590
- I'm pleasantly surprised by
this interaction with Morgan.

780
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,760
Yesterday I saw a very specific
side of her that I think

781
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,997
is really easy to pigeonhole
and today I'm seeing that,

782
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:35,634
like, no, Morgan is like
a fully fleshed human being,

783
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,403
and I'm so glad that
I was really hanging onto

784
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,671
the idea of giving her
the benefit of the doubt.

785
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:43,875
- I don't want
to hold grudges.

786
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,977
I don't want to hold
regrets with Kennedy.

787
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,046
Whatever I did hurt her,

788
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,650
and so I'm gonna go about
trying to reconcile it.

789
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,352
I don't want us to be,
like, angry at each other.

790
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,887
- Yeah.

791
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:59,357
I can say that I was probably
wrong for not at least

792
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,959
making an attempt
to talk to you about it.

793
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,627
- Yeah.

794
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,763
I feel sort of like
shafted in a way that

795
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:09,568
I was let to walk around
like a douche bag.

796
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,336
- Here we go again.

797
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,339
The fact of the matter is
Milk has a bit of an ego.

798
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,375
Everybody praises him
for being a hot guy,

799
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,512
and I think he kinda thinks
that translated

800
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:24,683
into being a hot Milk,
but it doesn't.

801
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,351
I mean...

802
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,488
- Yeah, it would suck to hear,
but it sucks to hear it--

803
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,756
- After the fact.
- --hardcore after the fact.

804
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,657
- Yeah.

805
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,993
- They've been allowing me to
just do this without ever, like,

806
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:39,097
talking to me about it,
like, what is that about?

807
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,733
I feel like Alexis Michelle,
when she's just like,

808
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,401
guys, why did you let me
walk out on the runway

809
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,971
in this blue dress and
this hideous fur?

810
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:50,375
- But at that time I didn't
see anything genuine from you.

811
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,712
I feel like if we had
that conversation then,

812
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:54,880
I wouldn't have believed it,

813
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,548
and I would've felt
like it was fake.

814
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,717
- That's sort of, like,
painful that you would

815
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,353
think my reaction would've
been disingenuous.

816
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,021
- If I feel like you
this certain way,

817
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:06,758
and I feel a sense of rejection,
then I'm just gonna shut down.

818
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,959
- Yeah.

819
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,628
- You know?
And sometimes that's just--

820
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,930
maybe that's just a
bad quality that I have.

821
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,868
My reaction, it comes
from wanting to be accepted,

822
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,437
very much so as a kid,
like, wanting to be

823
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,508
in the in group and
not being accepted.

824
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:28,547
I just leave it alone,
and I just stop trying.

825
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,348
- I understand where
you're coming from.

826
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,917
It's definitely something
I've been trying

827
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:36,454
to think about because, I mean,
I would hope that no one else

828
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,456
in the real world
feels this way

829
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,691
and hasn't talked
to me about it.

830
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,092
- Right.

831
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,361
I mean, now I know, if I feel
a certain type of way

832
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,730
then I know I can
come to you now.

833
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,466
- Talking with Kennedy
is helping me, like,

834
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,769
look inward and figure out
the way I act

835
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,804
and react towards people.

836
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,440
So maybe it's all
a good thing.

837
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,309
I love you.
- I love you too, honey.

I was blown away.

I love the thigh high.

1022
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,499
I think it's got loads
of girl power in there.

1023
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:12,103
- But the hair's a little
Newark realtor for me.

1024
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,673
Like, it could be a little
more glamorous.

1025
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,710
- I love your high kicks though,
and I loved your splits.

1026
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,912
I was missing the diva
a little bit though.

1027
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:24,082
I mean, diva to me
is she's killing it,

1028
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,050
she's out there,
she's living it.

1029
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,487
I wanted to see much more.

1030
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,657
- Up next, Goth Kitty,
BenDeLaCreme.

1031
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,325
- The makeup, I love it.

1032
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,860
It's goth but it's also 1920s.

1033
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,730
I actually like
this whole look on you.

1034
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,698
- This is actually my
Julie Andrews outfit.

1035
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,633
- All right.
Recycle Kitty.

1036
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,968
- Yes.

1037
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,703
- Yesterday I was worried.

1038
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,739
You worked well with me,
you weren't standoffish,

1039
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,474
but it was literally tough.

1040
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:52,810
Today, the minute you hit
the stage, you nailed it.

1041
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,479
I was blown away.

1042
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,547
- I did see you have a
little trip on the heels,

1043
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,318
and I know how hard it is
to dance in those wedges

1044
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,689
because I've actually broken
my ankle a few times in those.

1045
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,960
- Well, I was very angsty,
so I guess it was method?

1046
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,395
- Why were you angsty?

1047
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:11,929
- The eliminated girls
came back

1048
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,933
and there were a lot of
emotions about who had left.

1049
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,802
I was having
a terrible day yesterday,

1050
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,737
and this was a place
to channel it.

1051
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:20,838
- Thank you, DeLa.

1052
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,440
- Thank you.

1053
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,308
- Sparkle Kitty, Shangela.

1054
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,677
- Hey!
- This look is flawless.

1055
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,013
It's detailed,
the shoe is fantastic.

1056
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,515
Everything is perfection.

1057
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,450
- And I'm also getting into
this new

1058
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,318
Shangela padding
that we're seeing.

1059
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,753
- Just a little extra shape.

1060
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,790
- Girl, she got some
thunder thighs,

1061
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,825
and it's very, very womana.

1062
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:44,495
- But you are such a show woman,
the thing that I noticed

1063
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:46,898
most during your performance
was that it just felt

1064
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,500
a little bit more tentative
than it normally is.

1065
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,069
- I totally disagree.

1066
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,739
I could not take
my eyes off you,

1067
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:56,007
and I kinda like that it was

1068
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:57,675
just a bit downplayed,
a bit sexy.

1069
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,311
I really enjoyed
your performance.

1070
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,546
- That means a lot
coming from you.

1071
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,414
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1072
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,715
- And if y'all
ever do a reunion

1073
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,417
and you need a number six,
you can call me, okay?

1074
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,985
- I think you should come
and join us anytime.

1075
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,821
- Thank you.

1076
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:13,591
- Up next, Jungle Kitty,
BeBe Zahara Benet.

1077
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,592
- Hi, Mother.

1078
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,595
- I, of course, love the
leopard print cat suit

1079
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,864
because I hope that
Scary Spice was a bit

1080
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:21,466
of an influence on that.

1081
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,835
- All I have to say
is "raka tiki ta ta".

1082
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,571
Did I say that right?
What does that mean?

1083
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:28,739
- Honey, it is just
speaking in any language

1084
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,107
you're feeling at the moment.

1085
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,610
It's an emotion,
"raka ta ti ti ta ta".

1086
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,945
[laughter]

1087
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:37,849
- You cracked me up every
take yesterday

1088
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:40,718
because you were just
bizarre and hilarious,

1089
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:43,921
and today I was blown away
by how brilliant

1090
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,823
you were delivering it.

1091
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,626
- When you come out, there's
a presence that comes with you.

1092
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,761
There's a reason why
you won Season One.

1093
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:51,896
- Thank you.

1094
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,965
- Thank you, ladies.

1095
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:58,336
Based on the judges critiques,
I've made some decisions.

1096
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:02,940
BenDeLaCreme,

1097
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,443
BeBe Zahara Benet...

1098
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,714
you are the top two
All Stars of the week.

1099
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:12,416
Condragulations.

1100
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:18,022
You've each won a $1,000 gift
card to Spa on Rodeo,

1101
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:23,828
and a $1,000 gift card
from MuLondon.

1102
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,665
In a moment, you will
lip sync for your legacy.

1103
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,535
The winner of that lip sync
will have the power

1104
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:33,804
to bring back one of
the eliminated queens,

1105
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:37,275
and to give one of
your teammates the chop.

1106
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:42,013
While you queens deliberate
in the workroom,

1107
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,284
the judges will be
giving me a sponge bath.

1108
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:48,686
[laughs]

1109
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,820
- Thank you, Adam,
I'll be here all week.

1110
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:50,655
[laughing]

1111
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,058
- Coming up...

1112
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,694
- It hurts like hell because
I don't feel I didn't do bad.

1113
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,663
- I can't send her home.

1114
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,598
- As an artist, like
I have so much to give.

1115
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:02,567
- I want it so bad.
- I want to show more.

1116
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:04,502
- There will be a lot
of broken hearts.

1117
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,369
How do you win?

1118
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,339
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

1119
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:10,341
[RuPaul laughs]

1120
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:15,379
- Oh, my God.

1121
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,749
- I feel for BeBe and DeLa
because not only do they have

1122
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,419
to bring back one of us girls,

1123
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,922
they have to send somebody
home from their group.

1124
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,024
Tough decision,
tough decision.

1125
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:31,062
- So I have a question for
Trixie, Kennedy, and Shangela.

1126
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,663
Knowing that you
killed the challenge,

1127
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,465
and to be told
that that was great,

1128
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,501
but you might be going home,
what does that feel like?

1129
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,670
- I'm like all over the place.

1130
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,673
Being that we have to go by
the rules, you know,

1131
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,775
I understand that's
what it has to be,

1132
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:49,580
but it hurts like hell
because I didn't do bad.

1133
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,883
It just sucks ass.

1134
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,585
It don't feel good.

1135
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,922
- Kennedy's upset because she
has the worst track record here

1136
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,991
and had
the harshest critiques,

1137
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:03,527
so I think she's feeling
like it could be her day.

1138
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,895
- Can we get, like, real?

1139
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,764
Is this hard for
you guys to consider?

1140
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,501
- It's-- um...

1141
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:14,105
I-- it's always hard,

1142
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,106
but I have less of a concept

1143
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:20,444
than I ever have of why
anyone should go home.

1144
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,480
I'm trying to pick through
what the reasoning

1145
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,649
would be to send anybody home.

1146
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:29,320
I'd love to talk to all three
of the rest of the five.

1147
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,622
- Same here.
- Come with me.

1148
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:35,026
- But it just--
it doesn't make sense to me.

1149
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:38,796
How do you-- how-- what do--

1150
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,331
- What are you gonna pick?
Oh, I know.

1151
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,666
- What do you do?

1152
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:44,068
Like, how do you even
think about this?

1153
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:47,371
I mean, like, how am I supposed
to even consider this?

1154
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,741
I don't have any clue.

1155
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,076
- I would just not pick me.

1156
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:53,911
- Okay, that's fair.
- No.

1157
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,879
I mean, Shangela
has more wins than me.

1158
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:56,847
I have a better track
record than Kennedy,

1159
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,816
and I got better
critiques today.

1160
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,584
- Yeah.

1161
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,585
- I know we're at the point
where everyone's fierce,

1162
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,988
but I felt exceptionally
fierce in what I did.

1163
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,356
- Yeah.

1164
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:07,692
You-- yeah, got
your groove back.

1165
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:11,562
Trixie has only had two weeks
to start to prove herself.

1166
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:15,933
She deserves more time here.
I can't send her home.

1167
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,636
- How are you feeling?

1168
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:22,039
- I'm not ready to go home,
that's all I can say.

1169
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,574
I'm not ready to go home.

1170
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:26,544
- In order to make a
really fair decision,

1171
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:29,413
I'm looking at the whole
entire body of work

1172
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,749
and if they still have
the fire to go on

1173
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:35,019
to the very last end,
because at this point, to me,

1174
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,456
that's what would really
differentiate everybody.

1175
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:41,792
- You know that
I'm 100 percent in this thing,

1176
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,527
but it comes down to you.

1177
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:45,529
- Right.
- And your decision.

1178
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,333
I need to go to the end,
point blank and simple.

1179
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,935
I need to go to the end.

1180
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:54,438
Just know in your heart who
you really want to be here,

1181
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,440
'cause that's
what it boils down to.

1182
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,677
- I'm wrecked, girl.
I'm rattled, bitch.

1183
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,412
- Are you?

1184
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:05,716
- I mean, I'm just so cracked
that you guys have

1185
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,018
to make a choice
out of the top five.

1186
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,487
Bitch, I'm nervous.

1187
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,589
It's just a toss-up
at this point.

1188
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:14,091
I just want to say to you,
I'm proud of you

1189
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,760
and the work that you've done,

1190
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,829
regardless of
this whole competition.

1191
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:23,434
- I have always been
so impressed by your work.

1192
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,636
I've been impressed by
the way that you bounced back

1193
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,739
from being booted out of this
room over and over again.

1194
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,040
- Over and over.

1195
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,876
- Shangela is a rock star.

1196
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:34,445
She has an incredible track
record in this competition

1197
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,848
so far, and she-- I--

1198
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,851
she belongs in the top
for this competition.

1199
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,954
It would be, like, kind of
insane to send Shangela home.

1200
00:48:45,723 --> 00:48:48,025
- Bitch, you were in this
same place last week, honey.

1201
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,094
- I know.

1202
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,862
- How you feeling? Like...

1203
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,097
- I feel great.

1204
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,598
- Calm.
- Right.

1205
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,966
Pleased, happy.

1206
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:57,601
- Mm-hmm.

1207
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,602
- They got my character,
they thought it was funny.

1208
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,337
The look worked for them.

1209
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,673
I feel proud of what I did.
- Yeah.

1210
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,442
- So like, you know,
if it comes down to,

1211
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,911
we would've like you
in different hair,

1212
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,713
I'm like, well, that's
the point we're at.

1213
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,882
- There's a sense of calm.

1214
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,018
There's a sense of resolution.

1215
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:18,722
It's almost like she is ready
either way, but I love Trixie.

1216
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:22,760
Look at us trying to, like,
hug, and it's like--

1217
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,528
I feel Trixie is talented.

1218
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:27,464
I mean, it's top five, how do
you choose who's gonna go home?

1219
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,000
- Hey, again.
- Hey, again.

1220
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,536
- I mean, I wouldn't want
to be in your position.

1221
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,872
- Neither of us are
in great positions.

1222
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:38,642
- Well, you, at least you in
the position to stay, you know.

1223
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,013
But bitch, I'm definitely
not ready to go home.

1224
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,917
I don't know what else to say.
I just don't.

1225
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,353
- Kennedy is the lowest
ranking right now,

1226
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,856
but she keeps bouncing back.

1227
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:54,425
She's so consistent
in her temperament,

1228
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:56,093
which is so valuable.

1229
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:58,863
I can't send her home.

1230
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:01,699
It just doesn't feel fair
to send any of these girls home,

1231
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:04,835
and this idea just makes
zero sense to me.

1232
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,737
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey, sis.

1233
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,072
- Hi.

1234
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:10,007
- So it's turn to talk
to Ben and BeBe.

1235
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,709
We've got to plead our cases.

1236
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,711
- I really broke down
the episode I went home.

1237
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,813
It just-- the pressure
really hits me

1238
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,849
because I expect
so much from myself.

1239
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,517
I didn't think I was ready
to go then,

1240
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,752
and I'm ready
to come back now.

1241
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,988
As an artist, like,
I have so much to give.

1242
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,490
- Obviously I want to be here
just as much as anybody else.

1243
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,592
I want to show more,
but if that's not

1244
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,727
what's in the cards
for me, that's cool.

1245
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,730
If I went home tonight,
I could raise my head up high

1246
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,698
and say, you know what,
fucking rock on, bitches.

1247
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,901
- The only reason I can say
is because I want it.

1248
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:38,535
I want it so bad.

1249
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,005
I will jump off of
this building for it.

1250
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,807
- I saw you do it
in the talent show.

1251
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,844
- I was doing so well,
and I want to come back.

1252
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:49,413
This just means so much to
me because I've already been

1253
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:53,017
kind of like going on such
a better run than my season,

1254
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:55,019
so I want to continue it.

1255
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,620
I just want to be in the top.

1256
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,490
- Girl, this an easy one
for you with me, honey,

1257
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,792
'cause I feel like I got
a little bit more work to do.

1258
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,729
So bringing me back would
kind of be like

1259
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,500
beating a dead horse basically,
you know what I mean?

1260
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,870
Like, girl,
the horse dead already.

1261
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,072
I don't want to be
the Roxxxy of All Stars 3,

1262
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,373
you know what I mean?

1263
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,976
I realize when it's my time.

1264
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:21,312
You just gotta know
when it's time to go.

1265
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:23,013
- I know I don't need this
to prove myself

1266
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,549
because I've proved myself
in the outside world,

1267
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:29,620
but I feel I really grew
a lot and I learned a lot

1268
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,689
from my first experience,
and so I want to be able

1269
00:51:31,689 --> 00:51:37,027
to have more experience
to grow even, like, bigger.

1270
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,863
I really fucking want this.

1271
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,565
I want to be brought back.

1272
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:44,702
I feel very deserving
to be brought back.

1273
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:46,670
- Thank you, ladies,
I love you all.

1274
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,406
There's just so many emotions
going on at the same time.

1275
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,843
All of these girls are
deserving of a second chance.

1276
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,611
I don't know how
I'm going to choose.

1277
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,982
- I think that there is
one queen in particular

1278
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:02,519
who has more to show here,

1279
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,388
and I want to give her
the second chance.

1280
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,463
- Now, when my fans receive
one of my limited edition

1281
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:17,368
collectibles from Tweeterhead,
they must be spotless.

1282
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,103
Emma, let's take a look.

1283
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:22,272
- Okay, here we go.
How's that?

1284
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,578
- Oh, Emma, it's filthy!

1285
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:32,316
I'm not mad at you,
I'm mad at the dirt.

1286
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,085
Silence!

1287
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,588
Bring back my dirty girls.

1288
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,357
Emma!

1289
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,866
- There's been four other
times that I've been standing up

1290
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:52,636
here in this position
deciding somebody's fate,

1291
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:57,408
and it is always a
really difficult decision.

1292
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:59,309
It's always really
hard to be here.

1293
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,679
What would you do?

1294
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,582
- When I'm looking at the box,
it's coming to life

1295
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,485
who I'm thinking would
be deserving to come back,

1296
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,387
but when it comes
to the top five girls,

1297
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,823
this is a very hard
decision to make.

1298
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:16,927
And no matter what I do, there
will be a lot of broken hearts.

1299
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,328
How do you win?

1300
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,298
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

1301
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,333
[RuPaul laughs]

1302
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,739
- Welcome back, ladies.

1303
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:31,875
Two All Stars stand before me.

1304
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,479
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

1305
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,948
win $10,000,

1306
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:43,587
earn the power to bring back
one of the eliminated queens,

1307
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:48,025
and to give one of your
All Star teammates the chop.

1308
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,897
The time has come
to lip sync

1309
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,500
for your legacy.

1310
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,771
- I have made my choices.

1311
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:04,708
I feel strong in my conviction
about these choices.

1312
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,477
I have to win this lip sync.

1313
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:10,881

00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,731
- Thank you so much.

1355
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,967
- BeBe Zahara Benet,
you are safe.

1356
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:51,441
Now, will the eliminated queens
please step forward.

1357
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:00,851
DeLa, which queen have
you chosen to bring back

1358
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,719
to the competition?

1359
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:09,660
- I think that everyone here
is deserving of getting to be

1360
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,795
a part of this, and of getting
to show their talent

1361
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:16,400
to the world, and there's
one queen who didn't have

1362
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,704
as much of an opportunity.

1363
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:26,643
So Morgan, get in here
and make me proud.

1364
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:30,347
- Condragulations, Morgan,
you are back in the game.

1365
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,351
- I don't like emotion.

1366
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,025
- Will the four
eliminated queens

1367
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,727
step to the back of the stage.

1368
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,966
Will the bottom three All Stars
please step forward?

1369
00:57:54,738 --> 00:58:00,477
DeLa, which of your All Star
teammates have you chosen

1370
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,012
to get the chop?

1371
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:07,784
- This is the easiest choice
I have had to make

1372
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,486
this entire season.

1373
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,858
I'm going home.

1374
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,095
- What?

1375
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:23,867
- What did she just say?

1376
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,969
Did she just say her own name?

1377
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:36,413
- I am so, so grateful
for my time here,

1378
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:38,782
both on the last season
and this season.

1379
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,784
I scribbled out a different
one and I wrote this one

1380
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:43,019
in whiteout, and let
me tell you why.

1381
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,756
I hope that you don't see
this as a sign of disrespect,

1382
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:48,692
because I see myself as such
a Drag Race success story.

1383
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,560
I had such a difficult
time on my season,

1384
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,728
even though I did well.

1385
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:55,365
I wanted this opportunity
to come back, to fight hard,

1386
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:59,703
to show myself what I can do.

1387
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:03,073
I have accomplished that.
I feel like a winner.

1388
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:04,641
I love these girls.

1389
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,711
I think they all deserve
a shot to win, and I--

1390
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,880
I'm incredibly grateful.

1391
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,082
I hope that you all
can see that.

1392
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:15,318
- I'm-- actually,
I don't know how...

1393
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,520
how to take this.

1394
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,055
- I feel so good.

1395
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,758
I feel like I'm going
home winning.

1396
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,828
- As it written,
so it shall be done.

1397
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:32,436
DeLa, you are and will
always be an All Star.

1398
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:37,307
Now, sashay away.

1399
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,812
- I love you guys.
I love you so much.

1400
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,514
- Ben wanted to leave on her
own terms, and good for her,

1401
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:48,418
but it's still kind
of like fuck girl.

1402
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,553
We're just kind of like
over it

1403
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:51,455
because she's like
being omnipotent.

1404
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,624
- You guys win. I won.
I love you.

1405
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,927
- It just seems so like--

1406
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,462
- Thank you all.

1407
01:00:00,464 --> 01:00:02,566
- What the fuck
is happening.

1408
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:06,102
Not BenDeLaChrist, savior
of Morgan and the drag queens.

1409
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,871
But I don't know if that's
gonna look good or bad.

1410
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:12,075
Honestly.

1411
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,877
- Thanks for letting me be
my kind of winner.

1412
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,245
I had a real good time.

1413
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,716
I was looking over
those lipsticks,

1414
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:22,986
and none of those answers
felt right to me,

1415
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:26,756
so I made my own rules,
and I feel great about it.

1416
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:29,493
It's like I proved
everything I have to prove.

1417
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:34,431
After five out of six wins,
what more can I want?

1418
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,535
This in gold?
I have spray paint at home.

1419
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:40,070
I know the queens
in the top five have

1420
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:44,708
had their struggles and
I'm delighted to get

1421
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:49,613
to give them the opportunity
to live another week.

1422
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:51,815
I think the actual title
is more important to them

1423
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,250
than it is to me.

1424
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,556
- Well, condragulations,

1425
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:04,661
and ladies,
no more white out!

1426
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,397
And remember, if you
can't love yourself,

1427
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,965
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

1428
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,066
Can I get an amen up in here?

1429
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:12,002
- Amen.
- All right.

1430
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,670
Now let the music play!

1431
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,073
- ♪ Charisma, Uniqueness

1432
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:21,878
♪ Nerve and Talent

1433
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,414
♪ Let your body
tell the truth ♪

1434
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,785
- Next time on All Stars...

1435
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:31,988
- You'll be starring in
"My Best Squirrelfriend's

1436
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,057
Dragsmaids Wedding Trip."

1437
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:35,692
- Yeah, that's all you've
got, lady, big feet

1438
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,394
and ugly fucking pumps.

1439
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:38,562
[laughs]

1440
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:42,465
- Wow! Jazz!

1441
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:43,800
- I don't get it.

1442
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,702
- I live for moments
like this, where you just

1443
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,604
ask yourself how
did she do that.

1444
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:50,006
- I got a little excited.
I'm single.

1445
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:54,044
- You need to be bigger
and more ridiculous.

1446
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,012
- Girl, what the fuck?

1447
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:59,015
- Nothing is getting in my way.

1448
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,818
- I'm Natalie Imbruglia, Torn.

1449
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:03,053
- You're not friendly enough
for someone

1450
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,521
to think you're a jerk.

1451
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:06,289
- Who gives a shit, okay?
