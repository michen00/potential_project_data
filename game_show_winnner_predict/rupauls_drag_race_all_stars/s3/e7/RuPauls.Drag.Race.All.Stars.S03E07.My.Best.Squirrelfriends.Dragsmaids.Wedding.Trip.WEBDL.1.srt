1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,436
- Previously on "All Stars"...

3
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:06,206
You'll be auditioning
to be part of the Kitty Girls.

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,442
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:14,014
I've decided to audition
a few other girls.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,816
[cheering]

7
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:18,151
- Hey, yo, sis, I'm back!

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,989
- In the end,
one of the top five All Stars

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,523
will get the chop

10
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:29,630
and be replaced by
one of the eliminated queens.

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,433
My top five All Stars,

12
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,002
con-drag-ulations,
you're the winning team.

13
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,938
[cheers and applause]

14
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,741
BenDeLaCreme,
you're a winner, baby.

15
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,343
[applause]

16
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,915
Which queen have you chosen

17
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,784
to bring back
to the competition?

18
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,986
- There's one queen

19
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:55,055
who didn't have
as much of an opportunity...

20
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,493
So Morgan.

21
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:03,196
- Con-drag-ulations, Morgan.
You are back in the game.

22
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,734
Which of your All Star teammates

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,404
have you chosen
to get the chop?

24
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,106
- This is the easiest choice

25
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,575
that I have had to make
this entire season.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,014
I'm going home.

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,084
- What?

28
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:28,855
- I wanted this opportunity
to come back,

29
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:33,527
to fight hard to show myself
what I can do.

30
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,928
I've accomplished that.

31
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,631
I feel like
I'm going home winning.

32
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:41,134
- DeLa, sashay away.

33
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,381
- The whole room
is actually shaken.

34
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,851
BenDeLaCreme just left
the Spice Girls Geri style.

35
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,786
The person who's won
the most challenges,

36
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,621
who nobody would send home,

37
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,424
left "Drag Race"
on her own accord.

38
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,926
I'm gagged.

39
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:08,362
- I was not expecting that.

40
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,830
- No.
- At all.

41
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,100
I wasn't even expecting
my name to be called.

42
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,535
I'm happy that DeLa
chose me to come back,

43
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,937
but did DeLa pick me

44
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,740
because she sent me home first
and felt guilty about it?

45
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,210
And why the fuck would she
leave a competition like this?

46
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,512
Did she waste someone's time?

47
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,382
Girl, everybody else
is here for the crown.

48
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,983
We want to win.

49
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,319
- Having had
conversations with her,

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,156
I feel like the process
was getting too much for her.

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,293
- Also, she hated
having to draw lipsticks.

52
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,462
- Right.
- It's a lot of ways

53
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,198
that you could look at it
as to why he did what he did.

54
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,403
He could've did it because
he was just tired of it.

55
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:53,140
He could've did it to keep
his name as Miss Congeniality.

56
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,776
It could've been
a promotional move for her,

57
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,512
but Ru like people
that's gonna fight.

58
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,581
Ru like people
that's interested in winning,

59
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,184
competing, staying in the race,

60
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,920
being fierce,
and not playing the radio.

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,356
If you wanna leave, leave.

62
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,191
- I just...

63
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,062
I just wish that
she could've fought, you know?

64
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,498
- Even in her final moments,
honey,

65
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,068
DeLa was still using
her little strategy.

66
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,337
You don't only throw
yourself to slaughter,

67
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,007
you save the lion

68
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,110
that was gonna eat you
for lunch yesterday.

69
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,378
She said, oh, I may be going,

70
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,480
but y'all will remember me
as Miss Congeniality.

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,649
- The show much go on, girls.

72
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,318
- We've lost
our clear frontrunner,

73
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,554
so now the rest of us
are like, oh, my gosh,

74
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,323
the likelihood of me winning
has just skyrocketed.

75
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,959
This is like your pretty friends
not going to prom,

76
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,430
and now you're, like,
don't forget to write.

77
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,967
I'm gonna write you a letter
on one of my $100,000.

78
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,036
- Morgan, I got to come back
on "Drag Race,"

79
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,071
and I know it's a super gag.

80
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,973
- It is, and I feel like

81
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,441
I'm the luckiest bitch
in the fold.

82
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,944
I'm happy as fuck
that I'm here,

83
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,412
but I missed
a lot of challenges,

84
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,848
and I'm going to have
to work my ass off

85
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,684
to prove that
I deserve to be here.

86
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,953
- BeBe, whose lipstick
did you pull?

87
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:16,423
- Out of respect for DeLa,

88
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,526
I'm not going to reveal
who I was going to send home

89
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:23,797
or I was gonna bring in,
just so everybody knows.

90
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,031
So don't come asking me.

91
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,700
- We do this every week, girl.

92
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,335
You don't want to say?

93
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,070
Girl, what the fuck.

94
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,805
We've all had to show
a lipstick.

95
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,741
- And I would just
really, really appreciate

96
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,744
if everybody just lets that be.

97
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,047
I'm not scared, but
at this point we need peace.

98
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,816
We need people to be focused

99
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,985
because it's now
a journey to the top.

100
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,888
So if anybody
is curious about anything,

101
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,223
just know you'll be curious
for the rest of your life.

102
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,160
- She's not gonna tell.

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,427
- Let's not talk about it then,
thank you.

104
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,962
- Let's get out of drag, bitch.

105
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,664
- Yes, let's get out of drag.

106
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,666
Oh, baby, Miss BeBe,

107
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,801
she don't want to piss off
whoever the girl is

108
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,338
whose lipstick is sitting up
in her bra tittie, okay?

109
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,440
She said, I ain't pulling
the lipstick from the bra tittie

110
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,777
because I will still need
allies in this game. Oh.

111
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,245
So that Cersei Lannister.

112
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:15,215
I see now,
but here come the dragons.

113
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,287
I'm Daenerys, bitch.

114
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,224
- The winner of "RuPaul's
Drag Race All Stars"

115
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,859
receives a one-year supply

116
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,428
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

117
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,097
a coveted spot
in the "Drag Race" Hall of Fame,

118
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,701
and a cash prize of $100,000.

119
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,938
With extra-special guest judges
Garcelle Beauvais

120
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,439
and Chris Colfer.

121
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,707
- ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race

122
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,942
- ♪ May the best woman

123
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,544
- ♪ Best woman win

124
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,449
- Hey, guys.
- Hi there, darling.

125
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,817
- Halle-loo.

126
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,486
- I'm super ready
for this next challenge.

127
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,922
I'm back, back, back again.

128
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,992
- Hello, hello, hello.

129
00:05:58,992 --> 00:05:59,993
- Hi!

130
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,761
- Hi, All Stars.
Are you decent?

131
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,263
- Yes!
- Oh, my God!

132
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,032
- Well, please give
a "Drag Race" welcome

133
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,102
to Democratic leader
Nancy Pelosi.

134
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,104
- Hey!
- Hi.

135
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,940
- Nancy Pelosi?
I'm dying.

136
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,775
I just want to say
thank you to her,

137
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,245
I want to hug her, I want
to be, like, kick their ass.

138
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,780
Nancy Pelosi is spearheading
the way through.

139
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,317
- Congresswoman Pelosi
is a strong woman

140
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,853
who knows how
to get things done.

141
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,455
- Halle-loo.
- And for 30 years,

142
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:32,692
she's been a champion
for LGBT rights.

143
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,628
- Yes!
- Welcome!

144
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,695
- And thank you.

145
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,063
- Well, when I got
the invitation

146
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,401
to visit the workroom,
I couldn't resist.

147
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,769
- Wait, did somebody
just say "resist?"

148
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,471
[all laugh]

149
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,039
- Resist.
- Yes!

150
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,907
- Come on.

151
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,442
- I'm honored to be here.

152
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,311
You're an inspiration,
I hope you know,

153
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,681
because you really know
your power.

154
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,584
It's about taking pride,
and that's what you do,

155
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,121
take pride in yourselves,
so you know your power.

156
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,556
- And don't forget to vote.

157
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,191
- Voting is everything.

158
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,994
I mean, people sacrificed
so much in our country

159
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,131
for people to have
the right to vote.

160
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,366
It's a blessing,
but we have to use it.

161
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,970
If you don't vote,
you don't count, and you count.

162
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,838
- Every time you get in drag,

163
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,206
you're making
a political statement.

164
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,109
We live in a world where
a high-power politician

165
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,812
will walk into the workroom,
and it makes you feel hopeful.

166
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,914
- So I know you have to run,

167
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,950
but before you go,
on behalf of my girls

168
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,820
and all the patriotic
Americans watching,

169
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,322
I have one thing to say.

170
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,059
You better work.

171
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,593
[cheers and applause]

172
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,429
- Whoo!

173
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,863
- Thank you so much.

174
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,665
- Bye, Nancy.
- We love you!

175
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,035
- Bye-ee!
[laughs]

176
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,339
Well, speaking of strong women,

177
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:58,578
I love me a serious Meryl Streep
Oscar-winning drama.

178
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,915
And I also love me
a filthy Amy Shumer comedy,

179
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,149
which got me thinking.

180
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,319
What would happen
if they made a movie

181
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,055
that could be
a little bit of both?

182
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,291
Hmm. Well,
we're about to find out.

183
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,461
For this week's maxi challenge,

184
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:19,265
you'll be playing important
award-winning female characters

185
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:25,839
starring in the raunchiest girl
comedy blockbuster of all time.

186
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,074
The working title is...

187
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,513
Rolls off the tongue.

188
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,915
- [laughs]
- Okay. Hey.

189
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,584
- Now, our story features

190
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,520
the most gag-worthy ensemble
of characters ever.

191
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,689
There's Sharon Frockovich,

192
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,726
a busty whistleblower
who fights the power.

193
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,796
There's her Royal Majesty,
the Queen.

194
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,598
She's reigned for decades

195
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:56,035
with the motto, "Keep calm
and carry a big purse."

196
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,170
- [laughs]

197
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,372
- There's Actavia,

198
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,476
the pie-making maid
turned rocket scientist

199
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,880
who doesn't take crap
from anybody.

200
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,783
And there's the Beige Swan,

201
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:15,488
an unhinged prima ballerina
obsessed with winning.

202
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,158
And last but not least,
there's LaLa,

203
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,826
a young actress

204
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:22,695
singing and dancing her way
to movie stardom.

205
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:26,032
Now, Morgan,
as a welcome back gift,

206
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,101
you get to assign the roles.

207
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,436
- Oh, shit.

208
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,505
- Now, to help y'all
get into character,

209
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,843
feel free to use hair
provided by RockStar Wigs,

210
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,980
and jewelry provided by
Fierce! Drag Jewels.

211
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,152
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best All Star win.

212
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,522
- Morgan, do you want
to hand these out?

213
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,257
- Morgan, it doesn't mean
you're the boss.

214
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,926
Don't get too cocky now.

215
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,895
- Ooh, yes, bitch,
I'm feeling very fair,

216
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,363
but, you know,
a little powerful.

217
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,065
I'm just gonna assign the roles

218
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,868
to who I think is gonna
be good in that role.

219
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,937
- I can already see
by the description,

220
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,672
I'd love to have Actavia.

221
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,639
- I'm gonna
read through it first.

222
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,907
- Okay, sorry.

223
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,711
Look, doing well in this
challenge is very important.

224
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,848
Whoever comes out on top on this
goes on to the top four,

225
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,016
so I'm very vocal
about saying, Miss Morgan,

226
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,284
I'm gonna need a heavy role.

227
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,221
I would love to have Actavia,

228
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,922
but I'd be fine with Sharon,

229
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,159
because Sharon
looks like a lot of dialogue

230
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,128
and I'm good at memorizing a lot
in a very short amount of time.

231
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,297
- I think I want LaLa
or Beige Swan,

232
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,332
but I really like LaLa.

233
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,500
- Kennedy?

234
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,503
- I was actually looking
at Beige Swan and LaLa.

235
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,371
- I would love to try LaLa.

236
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,639
I went to school
for musical theater,

237
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,140
and I feel like
I know this girl.

238
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,110
- How about BeBe
doing the Queen?

239
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,112
- Seems fitting.

240
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,648
- I wonder why
I'm being given the Queen.

241
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,184
She's very uppity tight,

242
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:56,189
very stiff and kind of
very unapproachable.

243
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,725
I don't get it.

244
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,529
- I like Beige Swan just 'cause
I'm, you know, mental anyway.

245
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,030
- [laughs]

246
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,633
- You could do Actavia.
- Thank you.

247
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,835
- You're a singer and a dancer,
so you could do LaLa,

248
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,337
and Sharon Frockovich
can be Trixie.

249
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,208
- Morgan's, like, what roles
are you guys drawn to?

250
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,910
And I'm like, well, I like
this one and this one,

251
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,011
and she goes, great.

252
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,178
I'm gonna give you
this other one.

253
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,614
Not only do I not think
this role is very funny,

254
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,883
but it's a million lines.

255
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,052
Also, I didn't want to wear
brown hair.

256
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,755
Oh!

257
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,623
- Coming up...

258
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,926
- All right, bridesmaids,
who's hungry?

259
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:33,960
- [laughs]

260
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,462
- Wow, jazz!

261
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,669
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

262
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,004
[RuPaul laughs]

263
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,675
- Hello.
- Hello.

264
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:52,679
- It's time for us to film
the new blockbuster,

265
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,448
"My Best Squirrelfriend's
Wedding--"

266
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,116
What?

267
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,820
"My Best Squirrelfriend's
Wedding" something.

268
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,423
"Dragsmaid's Wedding Strip."

269
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,459
Let somebody else
have that line, baby.

270
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,430
- Welcome to the Ross Mathews
Drag School of Overacting.

271
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,065
- Oh.
- All right.

272
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,100
- This is our beautiful
bridal suite

273
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,469
with furnishings by Objects.

274
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,172
Are you ready to snatch all
the trophies of award season?

275
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,974
- Yeah. [laughs]
- Places!

276
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,709
Places, ladies!

277
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,010
Okay, action!

278
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,879
- All right, Bridesmaids,
who's hungry?

279
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,648
Oh, hey, Queen.

280
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,984
- It appears
we are first to arrive.

281
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,920
- No shit, Sherlock.

282
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,920
- [laughs]

283
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,424
your Royal Highness?

284
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,424
- Don't you mean no, shit,

285
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,793
- Cut. Sorry.
BeBe, can you just be louder?

286
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,261
Can you just project
a little more?

287
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,564
Look, I know you're being
proper, but let us hear it.

288
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,733
- Okay.
I got here a bit early

289
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,370
because I planned
to be assuming the role

290
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,472
of Sharon's matron of honor.

291
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,008
- Cut. BeBe,
some of the line readings

292
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,309
are feeling a little stiff.

293
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,777
It's the School of Overacting.

294
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,781
Exaggerate. Got it?
- Okay.

295
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,916
- Now, I never met the Queen,

296
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,386
but I'm noticing
that BeBe's character

297
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,489
is just BeBe doing BeBe.

298
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,224
Where is the damn queen?

299
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,625
- Sorry I'm late.

300
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,993
I was down at City Hall

301
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:17,530
shaking my tits
for the sake of justice.

302
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,099
I'm so happy y'all are here.

303
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,268
- Mwah.

304
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,936
Okay, I forgot.
Not a hugger.

305
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,005
- [laughs]

306
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,407
- Sharon Frockovich
is not the role I asked for,

307
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,542
but once I get out there
and I get the laughs,

308
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,045
I'm, like, this role
is actually a gift.

309
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,814
- Sorry I'm late.

310
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,184
Traffic was crazy,
the sky was hazy,

311
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:44,557
my driver was lazy,
and, wow, jazz!

312
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,629
- I'm so glad you're here.

313
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,631
I thought you were coming
with Beige Swan.

314
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,312
- She did that.

315
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,314
- Cut. Real quick,
Morgan, when you come out,

316
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,450
are you gonna do any,
like, noises or anything?

317
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,285
Because it's your big entrance,
your big moment.

318
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,619
- Okay.
- Let's try again.

319
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,988
- I thought you were coming
with Beige Swan.

320
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,091
- [hisses]

321
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,327
- Girl, that ain't--oh.

322
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,230
- [hiss]

323
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,266
[hiss]

324
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,035
- All right.

325
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,503
- Okay, cut.

326
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,371
Morgan, honey,
are you loving the hissing?

327
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,406
Is there something funnier?

328
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,874
Because it's like
you're coming in

329
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,008
and you're, like, clearly

330
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,810
kind of off your rocker
a little bit, right?

331
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,779
But we're going for funny.

332
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,781
A swan noise. I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

333
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:45,818
- They only actually hiss.
That's if humans come near them.

334
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,320
- Oh, wow, you are method.

335
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,423
Whatever you're gonna do,
I want you to commit to it.

336
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,958
I mean, because
remember "Black Swan?"

337
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,360
She was kind of like--
- She was a nut job.

338
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,230
- You can make it campier,
just do it a hundred.

339
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,332
- Morgan, dead on arrival.

340
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,735
I actually saw her
as a Sharon Frockovich,

341
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,704
like a slutty
kind of confrontational,

342
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,507
so I'm just like, big mistake.

343
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,875
Huge.

344
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,377
- Coming up...

345
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,846
- You nailed it.
- You were so much fun.

346
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,581
- I got a little excited.
I'm single.

347
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,582

crowns an All Star.

After Adam Lambert last week,

355
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,773
I was trying to smile at Ross
the whole time.

356

[laughs] Hah.

357

like, over me being there.

358
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,981
- Were you bothered when Adam
said that you were standoffish?

359
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,317
- Well, only because
people have told me before

360
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,619
that my tone is just so dry
that they thought I was angry.

361

you don't mean to give that off.

362
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,124
- Yeah.
- But it's unintentional.

363
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,626
- Oh, girl, because
perception is reality.

364
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,563
I might accidentally sometimes
come off as standoffish.

365
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:07,700
I mean, Trixie on stage
is fun and bubbly,

366
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,068
but me and in real life,

367
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,870
a lot of the times I'm just,
like, a boring white dude

368
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,373
who doesn't like hugs,
so I get how that can read.

369
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,211
It's something I always have
wanted to change about myself.

370
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,913
Our whole industry
is interpersonal communications.

371
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,481
If you're not friendly enough,
someone thinks you're a jerk.

372
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,717
Remember that thing
in West Hollywood, Morgan,

373
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,386
when I got tweets
from other "Drag Race" girls

374
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,021
saying that I was acting grand?

375
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,023
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm not super social,

376
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,125
so a lot of times I'm just
saving it for the audience.

377
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,295
- Look, out
of the "Drag Race" alum,

378
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,297

that are definitely known

379
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:41,767
for being generous with
local queens and the fans,

380
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,636
and then there are also queens
that are the exact opposite.

381
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,372
Trixie has been called out
about how she treated them

382
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,007
when she was in their company.

383
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,508
As much as I love her,

384
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,446
if she thinks that
she's not, like, a little grand,

385
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,780
she's fooling herself.

386
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,583
- They say that about me.
"Oh, she's too bougie."

387
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,685
- BeBe, you don't think
you come off a little bougie?

388
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,854
- Do you think I do, girl?
- Yes.

389
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,492
You are a little bougie, and you
give the girls looks, like this.

390

- Brava. You would think

391

of Zamunda, bitch.

Mama, you are the definition
of bougie.

is always very regal, but--

395
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,973
- Oh, yeah.
- I am very goofy.

396

I'm not--

Please don't take it
the wrong way.

- No, not at all.

My favorite thing
in the entire world

404

is when I'm at Mickey's

405
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,460
and there's girls
in the audience

406
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,262
and I get to
bring them up on stage,

407
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,430
even if it's just to watch.

408
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,798
- You're very that girl.
You will call out girls

409
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,433
even though we don't want
to be called out sometimes.

410
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,868
- Girl,
I'd be trying to hide.

411
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:49,869
I like to go to drag shows

412
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,970
where they don't know
I'm there,

413
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,605
and they don't know,
you know--

414
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,073
I just want to see
the drag show.

415
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,475
- My thing is that I really--
my features are so distinct,

416
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,210
as soon as I open my voice,
they're like, ooh.

417
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,680
- See, that's my whole purpose
of being in "All Star 3."

418
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,916
I want to be that girl,
because before All Stars,

419
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,653

we are all booked together

423
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,129

424

And then five minutes
before it's time to wrap,

427
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,272

and grab a picture.

428

by second thought.

a great, great, great job.

come for, we've gotten.

00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:35,521
a prima ballerina driven
to perfection and madness.

519
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,361
- [quacking]

520
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,400
Quack!

521
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,935
- She did that.

522
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,904
- Shangela is Actavia,

523
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,640
a maid who's also
a rocket scientist.

524
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,508
- Ain't nobody can make
my famous fudge pies

525
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,178
and put a man on the moon.

526
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,914
[whistle]
- Ladies, don't move.

527
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:03,282
You are all under arrest.

528
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:06,952
Now put your legs
behind your head.

529
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,121
[cheers and laughter]

530
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,524
- You're a dirty cop,
and I'm a whistleblower.

531
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,093
- Okay, honey,
launch that rocket.

532
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,029
- And when these divas
let loose,

533
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,131
who knows what drama
will happen?

534
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,734
- How dare you invite
another dancer here!

535
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,302
I deserve to be maid of honor.

536
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:25,604
Give me that trophy!

537
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,007
- He's dead!

538
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,508
- You killed him!

539
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,445
- Why does this
always happen to me?

540
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,281
- But when
the church organist cancels...

541
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:38,417
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

542
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,219
- Will they make it
down the aisle?

543
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,621
- This is some "How To Get Away
With Murder" shit.

544
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:44,823
- Quack, quack,
quack, quack, quack.

545
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,260
- If you stay ready,
you ain't got to get ready.

546
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,795
- Pow!

547
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,264
- Girl, you don't need
an organist, you've got us.

548
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,901
- We ate Actavia's pie.
- Hit it!

549
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:00,539
[playing the "Wedding March"
by passing gas]

550
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,410
[all laugh]

551
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,646
- You guys really are
the best Squirrelfriends.

552
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,817
- So if you loved the poop scene
in "Bridesmaids,"

553
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:15,587
but also love high brow
award-winning actresses,

554
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,289
then you'll love...

555
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,127
Rated P-U.

556
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,697
[all laugh]

557
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,365
- Good job, girls.

558
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,133
- Thanks, Mother.
- Thank you.

559
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,768
- It's time
for the judges' critiques,

560
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,972
starting with
BeBe Zahara Benet.

561
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,541
- You are a vision.

562
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,345
The headpiece, the makeup,
you look divine.

563
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,312
- Thank you.

564
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,647
- Tonight
in the acting challenge,

565
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,850
you played the Queen,
but you're a drag queen Queen,

566
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,320
so I would have loved
bigger and more ridiculous.

567
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,057
- You were more Helen Mirren,
and I needed Yellin' Mirren.

568
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:56,261
- It would've been hilarious
if you did a British accent.

569
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,264
- I feel sometimes when
you try to copy some accents,

570
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,900
it can be taken as being rude.

571
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,370
- On this program?

572
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,438
[all laugh]

573
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:10,209
- Thank you, BeBe.
Up next, Shangela.

574
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,343
- I love your outfit.

575
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,644
I live for moments like this.

576
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,547
- When it started to inflate,
I got a little excited.

577
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,549
I'm single.
[all laugh]

578
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,485
- And if you'll notice
in the acting challenge,

579
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,520
I didn't give you
a lot of direction.

580
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,356
I just sat back
and enjoyed the Shangela show.

581
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,092
- You nailed it, and I think you
did Octavia Spencer very proud.

582
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,293
- Thank you.

583
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,296
- Up next, Trixie Mattel.

584
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,731
- What's your favorite book,
just off the top of your head?

585
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,467
- Oh, my God.
[all laugh]

586
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,470
- This outfit is everything.

587
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,105
- And then
in the acting challenge,

588
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,107
you were so much fun

589
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,810
because every take
you tried something new.

590
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,512
- And that moment
when you used the baby's hand

591
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,280
to wipe your hair, I died.

592
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,549
- You are now
pushing yourself

593
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,118
out of the Trixie Mattel box,
so to speak,

594
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,154
and you're making yourself
do things

595
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,156
that maybe wouldn't be
in your comfort zone.

596
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,323
- Yeah.
- But I think

597
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,926
you taking those risks
is paying off in spades.

598
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,728
- Thank you.
I think so, too.

599
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,797
- Up next,
Kennedy Davenport.

600
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:09,101
- Tonight, watching you here,
I think fabulous and regal.

601
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,102
- Thank you.

602
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,103
- But I'd lighten up
a little bit

603
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,104
on the highlighter on the nose,

604
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,106
because that's all we're seeing.

605
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,340
- When it came
to the acting challenge,

606
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,209
I thought you were
maybe a little more,

607
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,111
like, Jodie Foster
in "Nell,"

608
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,314
than Emma Stone
in "La La Land."

609
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,582
I was kind of hoping
you'd do more

610
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,217
of the Emma Stone nuances,
you know.

611
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:27,553
She's very serious
about everything.

612
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,488
- It was kind of one note.

613
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,690
She kept doing the same thing
over and over.

614
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,059
- Pow! Pow!

615
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,227
- And it really
didn't go anymore.

616
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:38,464
- Up next,
Morgan McMichaels.

617
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,432
- Tonight you're dressed
like Judy Garland

618
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,700
in "Meet Me in St. Louis."

619
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,802
Like, even though your boobs
are hanging right out--

620
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,037
- I was feeling
my Michelle moment.

621
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,038
- There you go.

622
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,339
This is so beautiful.

623
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,775
- I love me
some Morgan McMichaels.

624
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,710
I am so happy to see you back,

625
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,912
but Morgan,
you got to choose the roles

626
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:54,947
for the acting challenge.

627
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,049
If I were in your heels,

628
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,052
I would have picked
Beige Swan last.

629
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,622
That's a tough role,
because to play crazy,

630
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,326
you either have to play
so over-the-top crazy,

631
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,862
or you have to play that
you're concealing you're crazy.

632
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,931
I worked with you the most,
and I got you to quack.

633
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,700
- Quack, quack, quack.

634
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,702
- I wanted even more.

635
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,736
- Thank you, ladies.

636
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,239
Based on
the judges' critiques,

637
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,608
I've made some decisions.

638
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:28,213
- Shangela, Trixie Mattel,

639
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,481
con-drag-ulations.

640
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,150
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

641
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,218
[applause]

642
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,786
- Thank you.
- Word.

643
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:40,125
- You've each won a $1,000
gift card from Elea's Closet,

644
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,195
and a set of luggage
from Raden luggage.

645
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:47,099
- This week,
if you're not in the top,

646
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,133
you're in the bottom.

647
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,503
That means BeBe,
Kennedy, Morgan,

648
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,105
you are the bottom three.

649
00:27:55,908 --> 00:28:00,245
Shangela, Trixie,
each of you needs to decide

650
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,482
which of the bottom three
you'll eliminate

651
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:06,084
if you win the lip sync.

652
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,187
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

653
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,389
the judges and I

654
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:14,192
will be contacting
our elected representatives.

655
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,661
[telephone rings]
Thank you, ladies.

656
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,829
You may leave the stage.

657
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,531
- Coming up...

658
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,099
- I thought I gave
as much as I could.

659
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,035
- I can't crush
a friend's dream.

660
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,537
- I'm very proud of what I did.

661
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,173
- Who gives a shit, okay?

662
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,743
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

663
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,546
[RuPaul laughs]

664
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,249
- Ooh!

665
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,051
- So I'm in the bottom.

666
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,019
And the curse
of the returning queen

667
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,354
is that most of us go home

668
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,656
the episode
after we've returned,

669
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:45,791
and I do not want that.

670
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,659
I want to break the curse.

671
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,094
- Well, I want to say
congratulations

672
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,896
to Trixie and Shangela.

673
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,130
- Oh, thank you.

674
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,899
- You guys did an amazing job.

675
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,101
- I feel good about what I did.
- Right.

676
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,037
I mean, it's all
strong forces, you know?

677
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,607
But I know for sure
that I didn't do a bad job.

678
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,842
- I thought I gave
as much as I could.

679
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,378
I think the Queen
would have been a lot of fun,

680
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,347
but, I mean, I just didn't
want to do something

681
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,148
that would have
been expected of me.

682
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:13,485
- Morgan, you know, she got
an opportunity to come back,

683
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,988
and if you only have one chance,

684
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,589
don't try nothing new.

685
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,824
Stick to what you know.

686
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,927
Who gives a shit, okay?

687
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:25,831
- BeBe, how do you feel?
Because you seem really quiet.

688
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:27,432
- I personally feel

689
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,068
that if you read the description
of who my character is,

690
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,337
she was very stuffy,
very uptight.

691
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,840
I was trying
to be that character.

692
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,208
I'm very proud of what I did.

693
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,677
When you look at all the girls,

694
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,612
I've been the most consistent.

695
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,280
Yes, there is a top two,

696
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,549
then everybody down there
becomes the bottom.

697
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,953
But I've stayed safe
and I've won challenges.

698
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:52,357
I should stay.

699
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,059
- If my face
looked like yours right now,

700
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,828
I would never cover it
in my life.

701
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,630
You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

702
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,098
- You look like Ornacia,
but like--

703
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,466
- Oh! [laughs]

704
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,035
- Who's Ornacia?
I don't know who that is.

705
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,239
- She's fully
never seen "Drag Race."

706
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,740
- Then mannequin head, girl.

707
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,176
- BeBe won "Drag Race,"
and stopped watching it.

708
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,711
- No, no, it's not that.

709
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,212
- You didn't watch
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"

710

that gave you your career?

712
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,384

713
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,421
Oh, okay, I see.

714
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,955
- Girl, get ready.

715

your ass to death, bitch.

716
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,759
- Wait, what is "me-me?"

717
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,228
- You know how they, um--

718
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,030
- Meme.
- Yeah, that.

719
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,566
[all laugh]

720
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,136
- I'm in a nightmare.

721
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,471
BeBe's never seen "Drag Race."

722
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,139
Kennedy doesn't know
what a meme is.

723
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,576
Winning the crown
is the only way out alive.

724
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,978
Would you guys like to sit
on a sofa and possibly cry?

725
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,948
- Yeah, come on, BeBe.

726
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,948
- I'll go first, shit.

727
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,584
- Let's have a sister
conversation.

728
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,752
- Well, shit

729
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,757
- So tell me why you made such
a mess of this whole challenge?

730
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,026
- Oh, honey, I did not make a
mess of this whole challenge,

731
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,763
because when I sit and listen
to what the judges have to say,

732
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,365
I mean, it was like, oh, well,
you were kinda quiet.

733
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,501
I wish you could have
played her over the top.

734
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:12,304
If those are the critiques
you're giving me right now,

735
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,407
I must have done something
great, and that's the way I am.

736
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,109
- BeBe has, like,
an unshakeable confidence,

737
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,112
which in a lot of ways
is a huge asset.

738
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,514
But on the other hand, girl,
you did get negative critiques,

739
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,849
and you're, like,
fully pretending

740
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:24,983
like it didn't happen.

741
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,151
I was there.

742
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:27,753
- You've seen my track record.

743
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:28,987
You know my work.

744
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,223
If you value what I bring
to the competition,

745
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,091
then I would want to trust

746
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,927
that you would make
the right decision.

747
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,764
- Okay, let me ask you this.

748
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,132
Who would you send to the house?

749
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,466
- Shit.

750
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,667
I didn't win.

751
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:46,037
- No, bitch.
- [laughs]

752
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,607
- Listen, I'm not
sending Kennedy home.

753
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:52,878
She's been a rock for me
in this competition as a friend,

754
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:56,414
and I want to know
what she has to say

755
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,250
because this is really a hard
choice for just one person.

756
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,486
- I was thinking about Morgan,
because she struggled the most.

757
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,488
- In that challenge, yes, ma'am.
- Right.

758
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,858
- But do you think that's enough
to send her to the house?

759
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,428
I know Morgan
didn't do her best,

760
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,264
but I don't want to be the one
to send her to the house

761
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,733
before she's had a chance
to really shine.

762
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:15,867
This is her second chance,

763
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,602
and, look, I know
about second chances,

764
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,472
and I can't crush
a friend's dream.

765
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,674
- On the other hand,
you have BeBe,

766
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,776
who could have dove in it more.

767
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,178
- But in this challenge,

768
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,514
I don't even think she feels
she did anything wrong.

769
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:33,718
- Right. I kind of put her
in the place of where Milk was.

770
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,254
- Miss BeBe
is a fantastic queen.

771
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,324
However, when you don't think
you have any flaws,

772
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,159
that's a flaw.

773
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,329
- Either way you go,
you have just cause.

774
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,666
- Uh-huh. Okay.

I said, hey, girl, hey.

777

to stay out of my uterus.

- Wow. Cory Booker

- Ross, did you get through
to the president?

- No. I think my fax paper
is jammed.

781

is go to house.gov

[telephone rings]
Hello? Maxine?

788
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,301
- I like how you got
this demure look,

789
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,670
but you still found a way
to make it a full hooker.

790
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,672
- Well, you know,

791
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,441
there's something to be said
about talent.

792
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,978
Both Trixie and Shangela
have been in my position.

793
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:35,380
They've both left
the competition and come back,

794
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,216
so maybe they both have
a little bit more insight

795
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,018
to what is going on in my head,

796
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,187
and I want to get
to the top four.

797
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,155
I just want it so bad.

798
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,491
I haven't been here.

799
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:47,759

from the jump.

a little, like,

well, maybe I might be going.

803
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,500
- When I came back
on "Drag Race,"

804
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,203
I felt like everybody
was happy to have me there,

805
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,105
but I did feel
like I wasn't sure

806
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,340
if there was a way
I could possibly stick around,

807
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,441
you know what I mean?

808
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,443
- Like the uneasiness
is unsettling.

809
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,678
- I feel you.

810
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,981
Morgan needed to basically
walk on water yesterday,

811
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,216
and instead she drowned.

812
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,384
- I live for you.

813
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,985
- But I kind of have sympathy
for Morgan.

814
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,887
I know what it's like
to have to get back into it

815

people who have been competing.

It's not over
till the fat lady twerks.

909
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:05,216
Shangela, you are a winner.

910

- Yay! Yay!

00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,720

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,500
Will the bottom three
please step forward.

917
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:32,243
Shangela, which queen
have you chosen to get the chop?

918
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,812
- You know,
Kennedy and BeBe and I

919
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,648
have been here since day one

920
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,883
fighting to get
to this top five,

921
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:42,554
and Morgan I've known
since I started my drag career

922
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,122
almost seven years ago.

923
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,858
And any one
of these three queens

924
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:49,127
would be a fantastic All Star,

925
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,963
but unfortunately, I have
to send one home tonight.

926
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,898
It's not something
I want to do,

927
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,900
but it's part of what
the gig is.

928
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,337
The person I'm sending home
is my sister and friend...

929
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,975
Morgan.

930
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:07,579
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

931
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:12,684
Morgan, you are
and will always be an All Star.

932
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,787
Now sashay away.

933
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,888
- Thank you, guys.

934
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:18,156
Love you much.

935
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,290
- I'm sorry.
- Don't go.

936
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,592
- No, I'm not leaving.

937
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,893
I'm not Fifi, girl.
I hug everybody.

938
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,461
- I love you, Morgan.
- I love you, too.

939
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,468
- I'm not so excited
to be going home,

940
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,803
but I'm at peace with it,

941
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,705
and I would have done
nothing different.

942
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,473
Why blend in
when you can stand out?

943
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,408
I got to be on
"All Stars Season 3,"

944
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,344
so All Star forever.

945
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,412
And I fucking better
get two of these.

946
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:44,315
Queen of Scotland is out.

947
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,389
- My fierce final four,

948
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,590
con-drag-ulations.

949
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,160
Next week is our All Star
grand finale,

950
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,098

has never been closer.

951
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:02,934
So I want to hear from our fans.

952
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,736
Which one of these bitches

953
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,738
deserves a coveted spot

954
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,674

Hall of Fame?

955
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:13,478
Are you Team BeBe,
Team Kennedy,

956
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:17,282
Team Shangela,
or Team Trixie?

957
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:18,449

Now, girls, listen closely.

962
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,163
If you can't love yourself,

963
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:36,367
how in the hell are you
going to love somebody else?

964
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,236
Can I get an amen
up in here?

965
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:39,370
All: Amen!

966
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,673
