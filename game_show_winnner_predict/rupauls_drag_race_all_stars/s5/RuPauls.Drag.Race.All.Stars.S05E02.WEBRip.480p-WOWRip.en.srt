1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,974
RuPaul: Previously
on All Stars...

2
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,142
This season, each of you

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:13,413
will vote for the bottom queen
you think deserves the chop.

4
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,048
Everybody gets a vote?

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,550
Everybody?

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,519
You're two-faced, and I don't
fuck with two-faced people.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,755
There's only one person
I don't get along with,

8
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,690
-and it's India Ferrah.
-[sighs]

9
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,595
RuPaul: Welcome to
the Werq The World extravaganza!

10
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,830
India Ferrah.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,766
I have one word for you:
hairography.

12
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,401
-Yes.
-Yes.

13
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,372
Ahh. That was explosive, baby.

14
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,907
RuPaul: Derrick Barry.

15
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,442
Cher. You called me
after Madonna?

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,543
Fuck you.

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,479
The impersonations
were not great.

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,514
RuPaul: Mayhem Miller.

19
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,549
I was so excited
about where it was gonna go,

20
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,817
and then when it went there,
I thought, "Oh,

21
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,552
can we go back
to where we were?"

22
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,188
RuPaul: Ongina.

23
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,523
It kind of didn't go anywhere.

24
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,958
Carson: It stalled a little bit.

25
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,326
I wish I could have done better.

26
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,061
I've been in my head
all fucking week.

27
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,496
But, like, an All Star
believes in themselves.

28
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:03,997
I literally did not.

29
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,301
Ferrah, con-drag-ulations.

30
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,336
You are the top All Star
of the week.

31
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,471
[applause]

32
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:17,210
You will lip sync against
a secret lip sync assassin.

33
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,112
[cheers and applause]

34
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,280
Yay!

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,716
Yvie Oddly, con-drag-ulations.

36
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:24,084
You're the winner, baby.

37
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,920
The $10.000

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,957
will roll over
to next week's tip.

39
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:32,559
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,428
Yvie holds the lipstick

41
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,697
of the queen that the group

42
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,832
has voted to get the chop.

43
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,300
Derrick Barry.

44
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,371
Derrick, sashay away.new act?

45
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,746
Oh, my goodness.

46
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,650
Oh, Miss Thing, that was insane.

47
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,519
Bitch, no. I can't.

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,687
Bitch, you gonna get those off?

49
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,023
You deserve to rest your digits.

50
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,126
I am so gagged.

51
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,362
The first time
I won a challenge,

52
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,163
you bring out Yvie?

53
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,231
Ru had got me.

54
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,734
That's a huge deal
to have Yvie Oddly

55
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,869
as the first lip sync assassin.

56
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,304
But you know what?

57
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,272
If I have to lose to anyone,

58
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,308
at least
it was to that bitch.

59
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,843
The lip sync assassin situation.

60
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,045
Can we talk about Yvie Oddly?

61
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,180
When that screen rose up...

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,016
That really changes
everything now.

63
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,150
-It does.
-Everything.

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,053
You were the first winner

65
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:36,223
and the pressure of getting
that $10.000 tip--

66
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,025
Bitch, I wanted it so bad.

67
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,926
Ooh, that would have
a lot of nice things.

68
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,927
I tried. I tried.

69
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,696
-You did an amazing job.
-Thank you.

70
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,264
But I can't say that I'm mad

71
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,099
at it going into
the escrow account.

72
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,334
-I can't either.
-I'm not mad either.

73
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,835
'Cause I can't wait
till next week.

74
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,870
-Oh!
-Ooh!

75
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,139
-Yes!
-Yes!

76
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,374
She's, like,
I'm in the game now.

77
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,644
Do you know
how many things I can get

78
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,112
for $20.000?

79
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:03,617
Hold on. If I put $20.000
in an IRA Roth,

80
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,152
do you know
how much money that is?

81
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,190
$20.000 in an IRA Roth.

82
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,659
You guys,
it was the scariest feeling.

83
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,794
I know.

84
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,662
I flubbed this one
because of my nerves.

85
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,031
Like, I'm ready
to kick your asses.

86
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,032
[all laugh]

87
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,101
-Bring it, bitch.
-Bring it.

88
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,570
Mayhem, how do you feel?

89
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,372
-I'm here.
-Yeah.

90
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,140
Y'all love me.

91
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,342
You really love me.

92
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,878
Yeah, you're here
by our vote.

93
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,580
You all each got a vote, but--

94
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,982
Yeah, 'cause we--
okay, look.

95
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,219
When it went to Yvie,
I was, like, okay,

96
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,255
this is gonna be a true test
of my friendships right now.

97
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,256
[all laugh]

98
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,558
But you know what?

99
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,759
Honestly,
with a clear conscience,

100
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,662
I voted for you
to continue on with the show.

101
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,997
I know that you have
so much more to offer.

102
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,935
I just didn't think
that Derrick had as much range

103
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,770
to continue on with the show.

104
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,906
Did anyone vote
for Mayhem to go home?

105
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,277
I voted for you to go home.

106
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,646
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I am.

107
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,449
-You're joking, right?
-I am not joking.

108
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,720
Oh, so you...
Oh, so...

109
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,088
For real?

110
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,723
I've known Juju forever.

111
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,959
Worked with her,
been friends with her.

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,763
So I am gagged.

113
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,131
Gagged.

114
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,465
You've known me for years,

115
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,602
so you know my range of talent
and what I'm capable of.

116
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,103
And I would have thought
that you have been, like,

117
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,173
you know, I do know Mayhem
and I know she has the potential

118
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,775
to stay here and do well.

119
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,977
If we want
to decipher the performances,

120
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,180
I liked your performance.

121
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,816
I just...I laughed more
at Derrick's.

122
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,086
It's not personal, girl.

123
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,222
No, that's personal. [laughs]

124
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,391
That sounds completely personal.

125
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,425
I think she said
it's not personal,

126
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,493
and I think
she gave a reason why.

127
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,462
I don't think it is.

128
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,065
-It's cool.
-But it didn't affect you.

129
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,301
It's cool.
No, it didn't,

130
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,369
because obviously
everyone else saw

131
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,470
what it should have been.

132
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,238
Your feelings are very valid,

133
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,340
you know,
and I acknowledge that.

134
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,577
And if--
That's not a real apology.

135
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,345
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

136
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,915
We're all predators,

137
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,350
and the crown is the prey.

138
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,119
And somebody's feelings
gonna get hurt.

139
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,253
They're gonna
take it personally.

140
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,490
But I am hungry for this crown.

141
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,693
I'm here to slay and filet

142
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,995
and slice and dice
these bitches.

143
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,597
Ooh, I'm gonna eat you up, ho's.

144
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,599
I'm gonna eat you ho's up.

Derrick's message, it was short,

170
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,232
I don't think it was that sweet,

171
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,468
and I just want
to get it off the mirror.

172
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,769
I just want to spray it,
wipe it away,

173
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,937
get it out of here.

Yeah, for the first time ever.

because my decision...

179
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,518
I don't know
if I did the right thing.

180
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,354
Do you think you voted
for the wrong person?

181
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:05,392
I feel I should have
brought in some Wite-Out.

182
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:11,298
Because Ongina...
Derrick, and Mayhem,

183
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,266
they believed
that they could do it.

184
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,902
And you didn't believe
in yourself.

185
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,605
And that's an All Star thing.

186
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,273
Uh, where did that come from?

187
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,344
Cracker wants to put my name
on the lipstick with Wite-Out?

188
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,645
Okay, first of all,
you're not BenDeLaCreme

189
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,913
and you wish you were.

190
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,116
And second, you're not a judge,
so slow your roll.

191
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,319
And third, like,
there's no third

192
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,454
because just
shut the fuck up already.

193
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,390
You are an All Star and you
have to believe in yourself,

194
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,526
and that's something
you can switch right now.

195
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:41,094
I do believe in myself.

196
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,696
I think everyone's
looking at that from you.

197
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,598
I do get that All Stars
is another type of game,

198
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,835
but are we playing
mental warfare here?

199
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,271
I don't know if Miz Cracker's
trying to get in

200
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,206
to Miss Ongina's head,

201
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,742
but that seems
a little shady to me.

202
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,143
I literally was up all night.

203
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,545
I was, like,
should I have done that?

204
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:01,314
So now--help me sleep.

205
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,415
Go to bed.

206
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,750
[all laugh]

207
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,752
[alarm]

208
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:06,886
-Ooh, girl.
-Here we go.

209
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,723
She done already
done had herses.

210
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:13,126
Dear diary, I've got a crush.
[giggles]

211
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,662
He's rich, famous,

212
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,766
and he has
one big huge...

213
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,800
heart.

214
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,971
So should I slide
into his DMs

215
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,740
or just...

216
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,109
slip him the tongue?

217
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,745
Wait a minute.

218
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,213
I have an idea.

219
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,117
I'm gonna write a song.
[laughs]

220
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,920
Hello, hello, hello.

221
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,556
[cheers and applause]

222
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,325
-Yes.
-Mother.

223
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,193
Good morning, All Stars.

224
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,495
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

225
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,330
For this week's maxi-challenge,

226
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,235
you'll be debuting
the newest All Stars smash hit:

227
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,269
I'm In Love.

228
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,872
-Ooh.
-Yes.

229
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,973
Working in groups,

230
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,742
each of you
will write and record

231
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,912
your own love sickening verse

232
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,416
to the celebrity man crush
of your choice.

233
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:13,553
Then you'll create a group look
and choreography.

234
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,689
#AllStars5.

235
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,391
You wanna know
who my celebrity crush is?

236
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,659
-Yes.
-Yes.

237
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,961
Ed O'Neill when he was on
Married With Children.

238
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,398
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

239
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,567
[laughs] Yes.

240
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,736
There. I said it.

241
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,870
Now, India Ferrah.

242
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,573
As last week's top All Star,

243
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,842
I'm gonna put you on the spot.

244
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:36,843
Okay.

245
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:40,547
Who are your
two biggest competitors?

246
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,248
Ooh.

247
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,283
Ho-ho-ho.

248
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,784
Shea...

249
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,252
and...

250
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,587
Blair.

251
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,125
Shea I understand, but Blair?

252
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,293
Oh!

253
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,761
Okay.

254
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,665
India, Shea,
and Blair St. Clair,

255
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,167
you are this week's
team captains.

256
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,770
[all laugh]

257
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,473
Oh, my God.

258
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,007
I fucked the whole thing up.

259
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,642
Now, as captains,

260
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,611
you get to choose
your own group members.

261
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,914
Starting with India,
who do you choose first?

262
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,982
Jujubee.

263
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,217
Oh.

264
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,751
Come on up here.

265
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,953
Blair, you're next.

266
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,987
I'm gonna go with Cracker.

267
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,057
Mariah.

268
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:30,463
My Season 3 sister Alexis Mateo.

269
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,067
Mayhem Coors Light,
come on over, girl.

270
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,903
That means
you're stuck with me, Shea.

271
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:40,373
[laugh] You all think
that you're picking me last,

272
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,243
but this is working out
to my favor

273
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:47,514
because I get to be on a team
with Mariah and Shea.

274
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,748
Yay.

275
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,451
All Stars, start your engines,

276
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,653
and may the best woman win.

277
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,656
Come on. Let's do this.

278
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,391
-Who's your celebrity crush?
-John Stamos.

279
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,393
-Oh, from Full House.
-Uncle Jesse.

280
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,761
I want my house filled.

281
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,463
Filled. [laughs]

282
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,764
Cool.

283
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,765
And who is yours?

284
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,335
My celebrity crush
is Daddy Yankee.

285
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,771
Oh, yeah, I see that.

286
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,773
Daddy Yankee has it.

287
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,242
The way that he just stand there
and grab the microphone,

288
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,344
baby, grab me like that.

289
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,480
What I had was,

290
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,915
'cause mine
was gonna be, like,

291
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,816
♪ I'm in love with my fiance ♪

292
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,787
♪ His name is RJ,
and nothing can take him away ♪

293
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,455
India, you ain't dating
no celebrity.

294
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,957
We all know that.

295
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,226
You are in love with RJ.

296
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,394
Yeah.

297
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,931
But India is a character
on All Stars.

298
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,332
Yes.

299
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,100
-I know you miss this man.
-Right.

300
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,070
But, like, girl,
you are so hilarious.

301
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,238
No.

302
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,606
You are, though.
You gotta believe in yourself.

303
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,840
-You're just saying that.
-Ju's right.

304
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,044
So I would dig into that
and be, like, super campy.

305
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,278
Okay.

306
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,847
I know India
is an amazing entertainer.

307
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,183
She can lip sync,
do a great drag show,

308
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,885
and she ain't afraid
of cosmetics.

309
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,120
But this one
is a girl group challenge,

310
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,523
and when she's surrounded
by other girls,

311
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,525
personalities overshine.

312
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,028
I want my celebrity crush
to be silly.

313
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,363
So who are you gonna choose?

314
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,031
I have Hannibal Lecter
written down.

315
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,901
Blair, coming from you,
that's, like, so crazy.

316
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,102
I know.

317
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,437
[silent stammer]

318
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,906
This bitch
is into eating people,

319
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,008
and she's that skinny?

320
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,009
What about you?

321
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,111
I'm thinking Mr. Rogers.

322
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,212
I love that.

323
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,348
I really believe in us
as a team.

324
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,017
Obviously, I think
I know the two of you the best

325
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:32,952
out of all the competitors
right here in the competition.

326
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,354
And I think that the three of us

327
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,689
already have
a great working relationship.

328
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,358
I absolutely agree.

329
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:45,264
However,
we have to turn it out.

330
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,033
I've competed with Cracker
before.

331
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,735
Something happened
with a pickle.

332
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,370
-There you go.
-[whimpers]

333
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,240
It just was overshadowed
by Dr. Dill.

334
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,876
Mayhem, sashay away.

335
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,812
I'm not taking no chances
with Cracker this time around.

336
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,915
I gotta make sure
that I do my job and shine.

337
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,990
The sweater's warm and fuzzy.

338
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,792
Um, okay.

339
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,995
♪ Oh, that sweater's so cozy
when it's pouring rain ♪

340
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,097
Uh...

341
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,299
Come to my neighborhood and I
could ride your trolley train.

342
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,469
I ain't saying
that I'm a songwriter,

343
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,172
but I do know how
to make stuff rhyme.

344
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,642
But somebody--hmm--
wants it her way.

345
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,811
[sighs] You guys seen
Shakespeare In Love?

346
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,615
'Cause I'm, like,
really good at writing.

347
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,950
I'm so good at writing.
[laughs]

348
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,118
Okay.

349
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,853
It's not the Cracker show.

350
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:46,125
What do you think
the other girls are doing?

351
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,561
See, I feel like Blair

352
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,798
is gonna have a lot on her hands

353
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,667
with such strong personalities
like Cracker.subtitle

354
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:01,007
I'm still thinking about
what happened this morning.

355
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,976
with Cracker and the Wite-Out.

356
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,945
I felt like to her,
I'm not good enough to be here.

357
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,514
But I'm goddamn good enough
to be here.

358
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,883
I just was in my head.
You know what I mean?

359
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,086
-Which happen to the best of us.
-All of us.

360
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:16,355
If this is the game
Cracker wants to play,

361
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,324
then so be it.

362
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,727
But shadiness
does not make a winner.

363
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,030
Or--wait.
Does not a winner make, right?

364
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,231
Okay.SUBTITLE

368
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,208

It's time to record our
I'm In Love girl group lyrics.

378
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,899
I feel like there's
so much weight on my shoulders

379
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,167
to really deliver well.

380
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,937
Because everyone knows
that I'm a singer

381
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,240
and that I know
how to record music.

I picked Hannibal Lecter.

Don't she do music?

397
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,009
Why don't we do
some, like deep, breathing.

398

00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:34,834
Whoooooah.

532
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,503
I was, like, bitch, oh, no.

533
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,039
♪ I'm in love with Jason Momoa ♪

534
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,141

535
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,943

536
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,479
Let's grab it again.

537
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,180
♪ Yes, I'm that bitch,
Yes, I'm his-- ♪

538
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,215

540
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,052

541

Uh!

542
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:58,457
Uh, Jason Momoa
I think played Aquaman.

543
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,392
Oh, shit.

544
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,400
I am looking
at both of my teammates

545
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,735
and how they've done so far,

546
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,172
and all I can think is, Shea,

547
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,174
you in danger, girl.

548
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,146
Ooh, main stage.

549
00:21:20,146 --> 00:21:21,447
Yes.

550
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,748
Girl, it's time to rehearse

551
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,384
for our I'm In Love
girl group challenge.

552
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,052
Y'all go ahead
and take a seat.

553
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,822
-Break a leg.
-Thank you.

554
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,323
I brought a pillow so I could
sleep through your performance.

555
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,058
Ha.

556
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,995
Alexis, you have a little
more experience in choreography.

557
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,062
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

558
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,031
So if you will
take the lead on that

559
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:40,132
and help out with the group,

560
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,067
I would love that
and appreciate that.

561
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:46,172
I made the executive decision
to hand over control to Alexis,

562
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:49,642
because Alexis has that power
to get me and Juju

563
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,144
to really, all right,
five, six, seven, eight.

564
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,280
Can you all do
the switch boots thing?

565
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,882
Or that's too much to ask?

566
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:02,488
Oof. Right, left,
repeat, repeat.

567
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,722
[clears throat]

568
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,224
How you feeling?

569
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,793
I would give it a five out of...

570
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,094
-That's hideous.
-Okay.

571
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,630
We got no time for fives.
This is All Stars 5.

572
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,199
[all laugh]

573
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:17,036
If he's bringing sexy back,
shouldn't we bring sexy back?

574
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,370
Yeah.

575
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,272
I don't know, because
your sexy is not that sexy.

576
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,473
I'm very sexy.

577
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,075
-Give it to me.
-Mmm!

578
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,543
[all laugh]

579
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,011
Five, six--

580
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,780
Mayhem's laughing at me.

581
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,748
I don't even know
why I'm the choreographer.

582
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,817
I didn't sign up for this,
you know.

583
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,152
Touch all the way down
to the leg.

584
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,386
How far are we going down?

585
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,921
I don't want you
to pull a hamstring.

586
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,891
-I love ham and I love strings.
-Okay.

587
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,593
Somebody better call my manager
right now.

588
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,128
-We doing Beyoncé.
-Oh, yeah.

589
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,296
[laughs]

590
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,731
Okay, okay, okay, I got it.

591
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,832
And then how do I transition--

592
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,267
It'll be a circle.

593
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,003
Okay. So it's... wow.

594
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:54,506
Then by the time they sing
the first verse, we should pose.

595
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,442
Oh, my God!

596
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,743
[applause]

597
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,877
That was a big opening.

598
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,479
Thank you, thank you.

599
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,348
Okay, it's your guys' time now.

600
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,184
I'm not feeling
totally confident

601
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,253
about how we did
recording the songs,

602
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,922
so we have to make up for it
with this choreo.

603
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,491
-So I'm here. Mm-hmm.
-She's in the center.

604
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,362
We gotta make this shit
look flawless.

605
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,797
Five, six, seven, eight, boom.

606
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,468

609
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:33,579
Team Shea. Not a surprise,
coming right out the gate.

610
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,347
Ahh, ahh.

611
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,815
-And then--
-Yes, that would be perfect.

612
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,917
I want to be on her team.

613
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,854
One, two, three.

614
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,923
This is the highest altitude
I've ever been at

615
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,626
without actually being
enclosed in an airplane.

616
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,228
Okay.

617
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,462
Wow.

618
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,398
As soon as that,
then I can just...

619
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,033
-Right.
-We're cohesive.

620
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,768
We have our concepts.

621
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,204
We're gonna create little waves,
so he is my Aquaman.

622
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,506
Aquaman.

623
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,840
We're working great together.

624
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,808
Right? Yes.

625
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,444

-Yay.
-Yay.

629
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,053
Shea, how'd I do?

630
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,323
Shea's team is like, a-one
and two and three and four

631
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,891
and five, six, seven, eight.

632
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,993
I'm like, oh, God.

633
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,294
I'm gonna hit center here,

634
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,663
and then the two of you need
to be on either side.

635
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,032
Yeah, and we should open up
a little bit.

636
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,202
So we're here, and we're
doing the one, two,

637
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,538
I'm coming down and up.

638
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:35,107
So remember, we're doing--
the words are--

639
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,275
I wanna cook for him,

640
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:37,276
-I wanna cook for him.
-Yeah.

641
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:38,610
-So that--
-Right foot again.

642
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,280
Can we do hung-ry?

643
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,381
Hung-ry.

644
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,716
As a team leader,

645
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:48,420
it's my job
to keep everyone on track.

646
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,255
We just need to be unified
as a team.

647
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,590
And that's our transition
to Cracker.

648
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,624
-Okay.
-So I think we--

649
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,193
And I'm gonna get rid of her.

650
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,628
-I'll take it from you.
-I can just...

651
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:02,735
But I feel like Cracker's
main focus right now is Cracker.

652
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,269
-Hung-ry.
-Hung-ry.

653
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,472
I'm holding it weird. Okay.

654
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:08,040
We can simplify
if it'll make it cleaner.

655
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,274
No, no, it's still cool.

656
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,210
No, it just would
make it cleaner. So I'm in--

657
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,711
We have a time limit.

658
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,684
Did I pick the wrong team?

659
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,824
We're back!

660
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,259
♪ Ooh ♪

661
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,727
Today we're getting ready

662
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,662
for our I'm in Love
girl group performance.

663
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:31,864
Teamwork makes the dream work.

664
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,098
It does make the dream work.

665
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,400
-It really does.
-Dreamworks, Inc.

666
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,968
Oh, my team is way over there.

667
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,770
Hey, I'm gonna put my shit
right here.

668
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,038
Blair and Cracker are on
the other side of the room,

669
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,139
which is a good thing.

670
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,307
Because there's been
some tension.

671
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,476
Let me ask you, how
do y'all think about our team?

672
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,912
I feel like it's a little bit
of tension there.

673
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,414
There was a lot of stress there.

674
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:51,150
Yeah, all I was getting
was a lot of frustration.

675
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,318
I think it's just
personalities.

676
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,887
It was very difficult,

677
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,588
because you know
when working with a group

678
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,823
there has to be
some kind of compromise.

679
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:01,059
And I felt very much
that Cracker was not budging.

680
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,395
You know, that she likes her
way, and that's
the only way.

681
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,396
I can see that.

682
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,165
She did try to rewrite my verse.

683
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,499
-Mm-hmm.
-Which I was, like--

684
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,568
-No, are you serious?
-Oh, baby.

685
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,336
No, bitch, I gag.

686
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,872
And it's like--
and I think, okay, so--

687
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,674
And you didn't went
completely ballistic?

688
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,676
Girl, you know,
I tried-- [laughs]

689
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,914
Yesterday, when she was, like,
she wanted to Wite-Out--

690
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,148
Girl.

691
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,651
Like, heat just, like,
went whew all the way.

692
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,686
And I think, like,
smoke came out of my ears.

693
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,154
It was like,
where'd that come from?

694
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,056
Like, I want it behind me,

695
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,292
especially
with the challenge today.

696
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,827
Right.

697
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,263
[sighs]

698
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,832
I love you,
but you can be difficult.

699
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,067
How am I difficult?

700
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,802
-You're egotistical.
-Yeah.

701
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,504
Oh, that's garbage.

702
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,005
-Really?
-Why?

703
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,675
Because I all the time say
I'm worried about this,

704
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:50,676
I'm worried about that,
and blah, blah, blah.

705
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,677
I never hear that.

706
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:52,945
Oh, God.

707
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,380
I have a Pavlovian response
to the word "difficult."

708
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,650
I was like... [panting]

709
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,087
because I get that all the time,

710
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:06,892
and I feel like I'm a loving
person trapped in this cage,

711
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,261
and people can only see
the cage.

712
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,798
Honestly, to be real,
I can't connect with people.

713
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,235
I don't--nobody
seems to understand

714
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:17,569
where I'm coming from.

715
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,338
I can't get people
to understand me.

716
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,808
It's why I have, like,
very few friends.

717
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,043
I wanna be that person
like Blair

718
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,612
that everyone thinks of as nice.

719
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,680
I haven't made a friend in years

720
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,452
because in my head, I'm,
like, don't get used to this.

721
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:37,122
There will come a day when they
don't wanna talk to you anymore.

722
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,492
If I knew why people
thought I was difficult,

723
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,227
I could fix it.

724
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,032
My time in drag is my only time
that's peaceful for me.

725
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:50,002
Even if people
don't understand me or like me,

726
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,405
I put on a pretty dress,
and the judges say I'm good.

727
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,207
They love you.

728
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:59,545
No, I can't cry because I have,
like, all this face on.

729
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:02,114

871
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,171
[all laugh]

872
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,507
Alexis Mateo.

873
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:38,276
Look at the layers
on those lips.

874
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,644
Michelle: Which ones?

875
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,946
Alexis: I'm walking the runway

876
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,380
in this self-made gown

877
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,884
in complete leather
in my skin tone,

878
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,354
and I'm so proud to be seen
as a Puerto Rican, baby.

879
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,724
RuPaul: She's ribbed
for your pleasure.

880
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:57,462
Blair St. Clair, I declare!

881
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,164
Michelle: Someone forgot
their sunscreen.

882
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:00,732
[RuPaul laughs]

883
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,134
RuPaul: Now that's the worst
case of pinkeye I've ever seen.

884
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,471
[all laugh]

885
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,306
Blair: I am loving
the skin that I'm in,

886
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:09,975
and I wanted to go
outside of the box.

887
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,509
Because I think that I am more

888
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,510
than what people see
on the outside,

889
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,712
and I'm giving them

890
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:16,081
exactly what I feel like
on the inside:

891
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,148
pink.

892
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,416
Carson: We're all pink
on the inside.

893
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,385
RuPaul: That's true.

894
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,087
Ding!

895
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,356
RuPaul: Miz Cracker.

896
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,091
Carson: This would be great
at a salad bar.

897
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,226
Madison: Yes, the sneeze guard.

898
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,894
[all laugh]

899
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,296
Cracker:
You want Jewish princess,

900
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,198
I am giving it to you.

901
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,834
It's time for me to show
my roots, literally.

902
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,869
You wanna fiddle around
on the roof,

903
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,739
this whore is ready, darling.

904
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,407
Carson:
Look how long her tulle is.

905
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:43,808
Tessa: Ooh, I've heard.

906
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,810
[all laugh]

907
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,279
RuPaul: Mayhem Miller.

908
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,647
Michelle:
Somebody have a towel?

909
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,915
Carson:
You really can't bead it.

910
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,984
[all laugh]

911
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,286
Mayhem: My gown today
is lovely, honey.

912
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,222
She is dripping.

913
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:00,358
And when I say dripping, she's
like really oozing glamour.

914
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,694
Do I love the skin I'm in?
Ha ha!

915
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:03,828
Look at it.

916
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,665
Mmm. Chocolaty.

917
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:10,068
RuPaul: Melts in your mouth,
not in your hands.

918
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:13,171
Shea Couleé.

919
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,539
Ooh.

920
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,008
Michelle: Now I know
where my implants went.

921
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,810
[all laugh]

922
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,211
Shea: Oh, yes, mama,

923
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,882
I'm serving up some
Nubian goddess realness.

924
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:26,685
Mama just stepped out
of the Nile River

925
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,788
drip-drip-dripping
in Swarovski stones,

926
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:33,625
and I feel gorgeous
and expensive.

927
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,894
Carson:
That's some serious vajazzling.

928
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:38,897
RuPaul: It certainly is.
Come on, Josephine Baker.

929
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,598
Madison: Come on, Grace Jones.

930
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,334
Michelle: Come on, Pam Grier.

931
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,703
RuPaul: Up next, Ongina.

932
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,839
Michelle: Hey, girl, hey.

933
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,142
[all laugh]

934
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,477
Ongina: My dress is a take

935
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,613
on a traditional
Filipino costume.

936
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:59,417
The feathers is inspired
by a legendary mythical bird.

937
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,985
And I just love wearing this,

938
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,756
because I'm very proud of being
a Filipino-American immigrant.

939
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,325
Tessa: This look
really ruffles my feathers.

940
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,060
[all laugh]

941
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,664
RuPaul: Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

942
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,866
Carson:
She mer-made it herself.

943
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,434
-Yeah.
-She did.

944
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,269
Mariah:
I am floating down the runway.

945
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,639
I am feeling like
butterscotch and caramel

946
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,875
mixed with a kiss
of brown sugar, baby.

947
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,977
RuPaul: She's got
a very glamorous headache.

948
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,980
[Michelle laughs]
The best kind.

949
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,349
I told y'all
I didn't come to play.

950
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,450
-Ru.
-What?

951
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,718
Michelle:
Is the train still running?

952
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,920
[all laugh]

953
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:38,857
Welcome, All Stars.

954
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:43,495
Based on your performances
and runway presentations,

955
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,130
I've made some decisions.

956
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,800
When I call your name,
please step forward.

957
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,168
Alexis Mateo.

958
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:54,205
Miz Cracker.

959
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,474
Mayhem Miller.

960
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,779
You are safe.

961
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,180
[exhales]

962
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,451
Safe queens,
you may leave the stage.

963
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,719
Thank you.

964
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,524
Now, the rest of you

965
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:15,393
represent the tops
and bottoms of the week.

966
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,995
It's time
for the judges' critiques.

967
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,865
First up, India Ferrah.

968
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,535
Tonight on the runway, I think
you looked really beautiful.

969
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:24,669
Thank you.

970
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,004
It's very like
Dancing with the Stars,

971
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:29,040
mother of the bar mitzvah lady.

972
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,310
It's a certain look,
but it's done really well.

973
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,113
Your celebrity crush
was Justin Timberlake.

974
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:37,582
You did, like, a Laganja moment,
"feeling very attacked,"

975
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:38,850
which made no sense to me

976
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,485
with the Britney moment
and then the Justin moment.

977
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,053
It was kind of disjointed,

978
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,556
and I kind of lost you
a little bit in your group.

979
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,658
I will say
during the performance,

980
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,026
I did kind of find myself

981
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,830
wandering to other people
a little bit.

982
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,631
All right, up next, Jujubee.

983
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,333
You chose John Stamos.

984
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,570
Your lyrics were one of
my favorites of the night.

985
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,273
You said, "Taking off my blouse,
please fill up my house."

986
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,409
Yes, ma'am,
I wanna go to that church.

987
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,211
[all laugh]

988
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,713
I actually got help from India
for that lyric.

989
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,416
Well, India, you gave her
your good material.

990
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,852
Your runway, just your walk
is so unbothered.

991
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,421
Your hair is a confection.

992
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,790
You look like
a walking champagne flute.

993
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,758
You're just so beautiful.

994
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,896
Up next, Blair St. Clair.

995
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,064
I do declare.

996
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:29,200
I love the whole look
from top to bottom.

997
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,568
It is delectable.

998
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,071
I just don't understand
how it's skin.

999
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,907
I don't mind the pink at all.

1000
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,376
The latex
is kind of skin-tight

1001
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,744
and like a second skin.

1002
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,213
I think it's really artistic
and super fun.

1003
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,615
I'm obsessed with you.

1004
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:44,782
When the song started,

1005
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,684
I immediately was staring at you
the entire time.

1006
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,586
And you were just
having fun with it.

1007
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,089
Then you stepped onto the runway
and blew me away with this.

1008
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,657
I get it,
and I think it's amazing.

1009
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,492
Thank you so much.

1010
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,328
Up next, Shea Couleé.

1011
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,030
Hi, y'all.

1012
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,699
I literally gagged when you
came out for runway tonight.

1013
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,934
I was like... [gasps]

1014
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:06,437
And then your jaw was open
for a really long time.

1015
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,706
It happens.
[all laugh]

1016
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,341
I was impressed.

1017
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,845
It's beautiful, it's fun,
it's campy, it's glamorous.

1018
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,847
It's what drag should be.

1019
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,448
You came out here
for the challenge,

1020
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:20,518
and you looked so cute.

1021
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,654
I loved the little
Afropuffs you had,

1022
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:25,189
and your lyrics were spot-on,
and you were in it.

1023
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,392
My note there
was "professional."

1024
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,694
Because you were living it.

1025
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,663
You weren't just
going through the moves.

1026
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,364
You were totally
commanding the stage.

1027
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,233
I can't stop looking
at your nipples.

1028
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,368
[all laugh]
Ooh.

1029
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,937
I wish I could, too,
but I can't look down.

1030
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,372
[laughs]

1031
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,373
Thank you.

1032
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,709
Up next, Ongina.

1033
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:47,445
Tonight on the runway,
I actually dig this.

1034
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,447
But because you're so tiny,

1035
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,416
your neck
is completely lost in that.

1036
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,185
This runway look
is one of my favorites.

1037
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,487
I have to agree
with Michelle, though.

1038
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,856
The execution
just needs some tweaks.

1039
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,192
It's like a little egg
in a nest up there.

1040
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,328
-Okay.
-Tonight in the performance,

1041
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,696
while I don't think
that Henry Cavill

1042
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,364
is the most inventive choice,

1043
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,433
I feel like
the way that you approached

1044
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,635
singing his praises
was inventive.

1045
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,805
In your performance, there
were moments that I lost you,

1046
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,940
and it's really difficult
on these stages,

1047
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,743
with all these animals.

1048
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,746
So you gotta fight
for every moment that you get.

1049
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:28,086
All right, up next,
Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

1050
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:29,787
Hello.

1051
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,623
This look tonight
is so stunning.

1052
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:33,891
The construction of this gown,

1053
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,594
I mean, the pavé bustier

1054
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:37,995
that's peeking out
through that neckline

1055
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,365
is, like, ridiculously good.

1056
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,666
I thought the performance
was good.

1057
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,967
I liked your look

1058
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,770
probably more
than I liked your performance.

1059
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,739
I did sort of,
when I would look at you,

1060
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,340
I felt like
you were a little bored

1061
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,676
or you, like, weren't really
that in your character.

1062
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,678
You're a quiet one,

1063
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,981
so you need to make sure
that you continue to get seen.

1064
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,150
As you know,
this is All Stars,

1065
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,886
and we are splitting hairs here.

1066
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,689
But there will be tops
and there will be bottoms.

1067
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,990
That's what she said.

1068
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,692
[all laugh]

1069
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,994
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1070
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,631
Based on the judges'
glowing critiques,

1071
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,300
I've made some decisions.

1072
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,942
Shea Couleé.

1073
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,345
Con-drag-ulations.

1074
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,647
You are the top All Star
of the week.

1075
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:33,084
[applause]

1076
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:36,387
You've won a six-night,
all-inclusive trip for two

1077
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:41,192
to Puerto Vallarta
at the Almar LGBT Resort.

1078
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,027
Mm.

1079
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,229
Jujubee.

1080
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,999
Blair St. Clair.

1081
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,734
You are safe.

1082
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,670
[mouths words]

1083
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,439
India Ferrah.

1084
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:55,940
Ongina.

1085
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,776
Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

1086
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,180
You are the bottom three
All Stars of the week.

1087
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,319
Shea Couleé, you need to decide

1088
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,355
which of the bottom queens
you will eliminate

1089
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,225
if you win the lip sync

1090
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:17,662
against this week's
lip sync assassin.

1091
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,198
And the rest of you
will cast your vote

1092
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:24,268
for which of the bottom queens
you think should get the chop.

1093
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,870
Thank you, ladies.

1094
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,104
You may leave the stage.

1095
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,809
Oh, my God, the girls are here.

1096
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,011
-Ladies!
-Come on in.

1097
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:37,448
I am riding
on such a high right now,

1098
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,417
but I come back to reality,

1099
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:42,520
and I realize that
there is a bottom three,

1100
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,656
and my team makes up
two-thirds of that.

1101
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,692
So let it out.

1102
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,427
Shea won!

1103
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,895
-Shea!
-Yay!

1104
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:53,331
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

1105
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,332
Are you in the top?

1106
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:55,333
No, not at all.

1107
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,467
I'm actually
in the bottom three

1108
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,003
with India and Mariah.

1109
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,439
-Moi.
-[gasps]

1110
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,807
First of all,
let's take a moment.

1111
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,141
Accentuate the positive.

1112
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,943
Shea, how do you feel?

1113
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,480
Honestly, it feels
really bittersweet,

1114
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,252
because my teammates make up
two-thirds of the bottom three.

1115
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,854
And as a team leader,

1116
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,790
that makes me feel
like I didn't do my job.

1117
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,325
Well, you should not
feel that way,

1118
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,961
because you were just
that freaking great.

1119
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:27,565
And Ru was even saying
that it's very hard for her,

1120
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,200
especially this week,

1121
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,869
to try and decide
who were gonna be the bottom.

1122
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:35,273
-Yeah.
-So it makes it--it's hard.

1123
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:39,710
Well, I guess we have to start
doing these deliberations, so--

1124
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,746
Actually, before that,
can I say something?

1125
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,180
Yeah.

1126
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,783
I prepared for All Stars.

1127
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,219
I was like, oh, my God,
I'm so fucking excited.

1128
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:50,321
Like, this is my chance
and my opportunity.

1129
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,459
And I came here
and I was a little bit rocky.

1130
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,528
Like, my reading challenge
wasn't the best.

1131
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,831
My talent,
I was almost on the bottom.

1132
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,867
And now I'm on the bottom three.

1133
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,236
I have so much more to give,
and I wanna give it,

1134
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:07,471
and I know I have the hunger,
I have the drive.

1135
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:10,074
I wanna be here so bad.

1136
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:13,344
But you don't have to
deliberate with me,

1137
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:16,514
because these two do not deserve
to go home at all tonight.

1138
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:18,349
This is not me giving up.

1139
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,884
This is the fairest thing to do.

1140
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:23,487
[sighs] Oh, God.

1141
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,657
The giggity-gag is that I said

1142
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,526
Ongina didn't have the heart
for the competition,

1143
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:29,760
and then Ongina says

1144
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,529
she doesn't have the heart
for the competition.

1145
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:34,198
But I can see that Ongina
is hurting.

1146
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:40,104
A lot of winners started out
in the bottom multiple times.

1147
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,174
And it's not fair for anyone

1148
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:46,911
to say that it means
you don't have what it takes.

1149
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,780
And I made your morning
difficult a while ago,

1150
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,415
and it was stupid.

1151
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,486
This is how that morning
could have gone.

1152
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,121
Like, "Are you guys
excited about today?"

1153
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,122
"Yeah." Me.

1154
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,595
Did I mean what I said?
Absolutely.

1155
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,299
But does it help me
to make Ongina feel bad?

1156
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:11,602
And does it help Ongina
to feel bad?

1157
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,871
No. That's the mistake.

1158
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,708
How you feeling?

1159
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,711
Um, I'm in a little disbelief

1160
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,179
that I'm in the bottom three.

1161
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,381
Didn't see that one coming.

1162
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,815
No, I didn't.

1163
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:28,019
But honestly, I wouldn't
have changed anything

1164
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,654
except for having more attitude.

1165
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,689
I know that I have the diversity
and the range

1166
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,057
to be here and to stay here,

1167
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:34,992
and I want everybody
to see more.

1168
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,828
And right now, I'm very proud
of what I've done.

1169
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,797
And I just wanna keep going hard

1170
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,500
and keep showing all the
different facets of my growth.

1171
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,101
Yeah.

1172
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,370
It really sucks that
we're in this position,

1173
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:51,876
because I feel very responsible
for you and Ongina.

1174
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,978
You guys were right there,
helping me shine,

1175
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:58,582
and so it, like,
doesn't feel fun.

1176
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,451
It doesn't feel right

1177
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:04,488
that I have to be the person
to decide somebody's fate.

1178
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,124
There is some kind of solace

1179
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,761
in knowing that me and Ongina
were on the winner's team,

1180
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,731
because she might go ahead
and throw us a bone

1181
00:47:13,731 --> 00:47:15,866
and just vote India off.

1182
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:19,203
So, hey.

1183
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:22,039
How you feeling, girl?

1184
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,276
I am a mess,

1185
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:28,779
because I feel like
I didn't do that bad.

1186
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,281
You didn't.

1187
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,382
-This sucks.
-Yeah.

1188
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:34,485
Because y'all
are like my friends.

1189
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,821
Well, I want you to know
I'm not giving up.

1190
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,222
I'm not gonna back down.

1191
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,224
I came more than prepared.

1192
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,659
I wanna be at the top.

1193
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:45,129
That may be bad for some people,
because that may be threatening.

1194
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:49,366
But I'm not gonna sit here
and be like, "I can't do this."

1195
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:55,673
I was moved by what you said
over there on the couch

1196
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:58,275
with the other girls, truly.

1197
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,111
But I just wanna know.

1198
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:04,515
In the event that I do decide

1199
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:09,253
to choose one of the other two
for any reason,

1200
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:12,156
can you please
just, like, promise me

1201
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:14,558
that, like, you won't give up?

1202
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,128
No, I'll fight, you know,
whatever that means.

1203
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:20,131
Ongina's down on herself,

1204
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,167
but I saw her battle
so much adversity

1205
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,935
in this last challenge,

1206
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,438
I'm just wondering
if perhaps another chance

1207
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,840
might help breathe
some life into her

1208
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:34,612
and give her the last push that
she needs to make this work.

1209
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,781
I hope you know
how bad I wanna be here.

1210
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:39,116
I absolutely do, 100%.

1211
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:40,351
I know we don't know each other
that well,

1212
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:41,685
and I know how hard it is,

1213
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,789
because the other two
on the bottom are on your team.

1214
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:46,624
Yeah, it does make it
tough for me,

1215
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:49,426
because you wanna feel

1216
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,295
a sense of loyalty
to your teammates, you know.

1217
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,097
And I consider myself
a very loyal person.

1218
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,934
And both of those girls
really put a lot of trust in me,

1219
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,502
which is not easy
in a competition.

1220
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,404
But you were an incredible
team captain as well.

1221
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:03,607
I know Shea has such
a tough decision to make.

1222
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:08,245
But Ongina just pled to us that
she no longer wanted to be here.

1223
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:13,217
I refuse to sit there and say
to anyone, "Send me home."

1224
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:14,885
Why would I do that?

1225
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,688
Well, I hope
that I can continue.

1226
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,290
-Mariah?
-Yes, my love.

1227
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,558
What's up?

1228
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:21,859
I just wanna show you all more.

1229
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:23,527
I just wanna keep giving more
in every challenge,

1230
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:26,263
and I know that
it's not my time to go.

1231
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,666
Who should go home?

1232
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,434
Oh, my God.

1233
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,702
Ongina was on my team,

1234
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,672
and I know the heart
and the passion

1235
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:36,807
and the want that she had
for it to push through.

1236
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,444
And India,
she's a fierce entertainer.

1237
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:41,545
You can't dispute it.

1238
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,681
Wow, this is, like, the worst,

1239
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,317
because I really love Ongina.

1240
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:50,588
And I also share my Season 3
common bond with you and India.

1241
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:53,457
Do you think that Ongina
saying that is her giving up?

1242
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,730
Remember, too,
if Shea wins this lip sync,

1243
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,700
and not the assassin,
our vote doesn't matter.

1244
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,604
Gosh, I need to have sex.

1245
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,606
[all laugh]

1246
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,913
I see my name front and center,

1247
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:19,216
and that is
a crude wake-up call.

1248
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,452
To go home now, I can't.

1249
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,153
I need to prove it to myself

1250
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:25,990
that I'm able to compete
against the best.

1251
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:38,769
It just tells you how hard
All Stars really is.

1252
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,972
Because Ongina has wanted
to be here for so long,

1253
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,174
and now she's gonna bow out?

1254
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,110
[sighs]

1255
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:50,781
I am furious

1256
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:55,553
about you giving up so fast
in the competition.

1257
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:56,987
I cannot let it go.

1258
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,890
So my vote
is for you to go home.

1259
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:06,797
Honestly, this decision
is not an easy one.

1260
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,633
There's so many things that
are going through my head.

1261
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,236
Who do I think wants this?

1262
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:15,105
Who do I think is the best
out of the three?

1263
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,775
And who do I think
deserves another chance?

1264
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:21,745
This is only week two,
and this is excruciating,

1265
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,747
but I feel like I know what
decision I need to make.

1266
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,419
Welcome back, ladies.

1267
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:33,857
Shea Couleé, it's time to
lip sync for your legacy.

1268
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,260
Would you like to meet
your opponent?

1269
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:39,363
Sure.

1270
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:42,099
[all laugh]

1271
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,834
The time has come

1272
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:47,171
to present this week's

1273
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:50,374
[echoing]
lip sync assassin.

1274
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,243
Oh, my God, who is it?

1275
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,013
Oh, there is so much pressure,

1276
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:59,984
because, damn, I gotta
go up against some bitch

1277
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:03,554
whose one purpose
is to come in here

1278
00:52:03,554 --> 00:52:05,756
and stop me
from winning this lip sync.

1279
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:07,825
-Who is this?
-Oh.

1280
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:12,262
[echoing] Ru-veal yourself!

1281
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,934
-Trinity?
-Oh, it could be Trinity.

1282
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,235
Wait, that's Kameron.

1283
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,542
[cheers and applause]

1284
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:32,249
Child, hmm.

1286
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,119
[laughs]

1287
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,823
None other than
the dancing queen herself,

1288
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,992
Miss Alyssa Edwards.

1289
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,927
So I'm a little skurred
right now.

1290
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,064
I'm back, back, back,
back, back again,

1291
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:49,299
giving y'all a dose
of assassin-eers.

1292
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,902
Oh!
[all laugh]

1293
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:57,207
Now, ladies,
Alyssa holds the lipstick

1294
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,778
of the queen that the group
has voted to go home.

1295
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:05,849
Now, if Alyssa wins,
that queen gets the chop.

1296
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:12,222
Two queens stand before me.

1297
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:16,026
Shea Couleé, this is your chance
to impress me,

1298
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,129
win $20.000,

1299
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:23,300
and earn the power

1300
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,336
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

1301
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,873
The time has come...
[thunder]

1302
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,309
to lip sync...

1303
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,845
[echoing] for your legacy.

1304
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:42,086
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

Will the bottom three queens
please step forward?

Shea Couleé, with great power
comes great responsibility.

1350
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:27,417
Which queen have you chosen...

1351
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:30,420
to get the chop?

1352
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,156
I thought a lot about this,

1353
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,426
and I think that you
are all unbelievably amazing

1354
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,527
and so talented.

1355
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,463
The queen that I've chosen...

1356
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:42,966
is Ongina.

1357
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,005
You are a giant.

1358
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:49,806
I don't ever wanna hear
anything different.

1359
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:53,844
As it is written,
so it shall be done.

1360
00:56:53,844 --> 00:57:01,385
Ongina, you are and will
always be an All Star.

1361
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:04,488
11 years ago,
you changed my life, Ru,

1362
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:06,723
and I just wanna say
thank you so much.

1363
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,059
And you're changing
my life again,

1364
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,661
and I cannot thank you enough.

1365
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:15,032
Ongina, 11 years ago
you changed my life.

will live on forever
