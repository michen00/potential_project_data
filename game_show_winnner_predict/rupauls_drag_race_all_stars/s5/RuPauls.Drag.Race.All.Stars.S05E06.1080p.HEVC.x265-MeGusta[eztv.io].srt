Previously on All Stars...

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,542
For this week's maxi-challenge,

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,845
we're gonna be playing
the Snatch Game of Love.

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,413
[cheers and applause]

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:14,915
I'm gay!

6
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,116
[all laugh]

7
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,117
[purrs]

8
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,553
Flavor Flav!

9
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,921
[all laugh]

10
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,991
Open up my thighs,
show you the surprise.

11
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,128
-He don't want it.
-[laughs]

12
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,529
Oh, India.

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,798
There was no Jeffree
in your Jeffree.

14
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,067
It was definitely a miss for me.

15
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:37,104
Shea Couleé, con-drag-ulations.

16
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,172
You're the top All Star
of the week.

17
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,775
Oh, my God. [laughs] Oh!

18
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,878
Starting today,
if you're not the top All Star,

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,514
you are in the bottom.

20
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,750
What?

21
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,052
Remember when you were in
the bottom with me and Mariah?

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,221
Alexis and Mayhem came to me

23
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,856
and asked me
to put your lipstick in.

24
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,358
Plotting? Against me?

25
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,727
I did not. I did not.
You're lying.

26
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,828
I'm not lying, girl.

27
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:04,631
Is Alexis the villain?

28
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,935
When I did that vote,
it was in my heart.

29
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,303
I just wanna know

30
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,939
why I should pick somebody
else's lipstick
over yours.

31
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:16,143
Ru-veal yourself!

32
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,711
Aah!

33
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,647
[all shouting]

34
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,549
Shea Couleé,
you're a winner, baby.

35
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,951
[applause]

36
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,854
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

37
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,291
I thought long and hard
about this.

38
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,659
India.

39
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,263
India Ferrah, sashay away.end
recap

40
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,075
Ooh, wow.

41
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,476
Home sweet home.

42
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,179
Back into ye olde werkroom.

43
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,181
India has gone home,

44
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:57,617
and there is
only five of us left.

45
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,855
And I can see the top four
upon the horizon,

46
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,258
and I can see myself there
so bad.

47
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,328
I just got to keep pushing.

48
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,063
Well, Shea, congratulations.

49
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,798
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

50
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,133
Yes! Girl, you turned it.

51
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,434
How are you ladies feeling?

52
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,236
Well, that was just,
like, a lot.

53
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,338
I'm still just, like,
really kind of confused.

54
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,573
Yeah.

55
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:25,078
What's going through
your mind right now?

56
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,383
I'm embarrassed
about the whole situation.

57
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:34,187
[crying] It hurts me,
because India was my friend.

58
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,524
And this was,
like, a desperate moment

59
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,193
for her to stay
in the competition.

60
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,597
Um...

61
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:48,835
I got really close--

62
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,371
really close
to picking your lipstick.

63
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,606
I'm not gonna lie.

64
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:56,243
This imagery that India
created in my head

65
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,844
of you going to all the girls,
like, in secret,

66
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,314
telling them to pick my name,
it just, like, really shook me.

67
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,516
But even though
there were doubts,

68
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,451
there wasn't reason enough

69
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,086
for me to send you home.

70
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,660
Shea, did I think
you were competition? Yes.

71
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,763
Did I campaign against you? No.

72
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,832
I know how voting works.

73
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:22,135
If I wanted you to go home,
I needed to talk to all of you.

74
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,804
Did I talk to you
or any one of you?

75
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,972
Never.

76
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,776
Should we look at the group?

77
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,777
I mean, yeah, I don't
even wanna talk about it.

78
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,012
I just wanna look at the box.

79
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,246
Yeah, I just kind of wanna
look at every vote.

80
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,217
So, India.

81
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,286
India.

82
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,488
India.

83
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,591
India.

84
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,362
Alexis.

85
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,133
I thank you guys
for believing in me.

86
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,135
You know, I see it.

87
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,305
I feel like the right person
went home tonight.

88
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,241
India was in the bottom
four times in a row.

89
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,276
Ooh.

90
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,980
But, like, with
the India/Alexis drama,

91
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,082
no one really knows
who to believe.

92
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,750
But Alexis is still here,

93
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,653
and it's hard,
because you wanna trust her.

94
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,356
But that doesn't mean
I'm not watching from afar.

95
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,292
Always watching.

96
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:26,032
One thing growing up that
my dad always, always said:

97
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:30,470
Whatever is done in the dark
will come out to the light.

98
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,838
-Thank you.
-Always.

99
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,341
And if there were
shady dealings,

100
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,744
if there was stuff going on,
it will eventually come out.

101
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,180
It's not real.
I can tell you that.

102
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,681
You live to fight another day.

103
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,016
To live another day.

104
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,885
You mean to die another day.

105
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,187
[laughs] Stupid.

106
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,723
[all laugh]

107
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,725
All right, who wants
to take their titties off?

108
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,160
Oh, me!

109
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,963
After this stunt, nothing
is sure for me any longer.

110
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,965
This feels like

111
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,068
when nobody wants to play
with you in the playground,

112
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,905
and they all pick up their toys
and they don't let you use them.

113
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,107
Sisters.

114
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,276
I'm kind of worried that the
competition is ruined for me.

115
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:12,212
And now I have to be perfection,

116
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,613
because the girls
are gonna vote me out

117
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,549
as soon
as they have the chance.

118
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,950
Hands down.

119
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,254
It's a scary place to be
right now.

120

Ugh. More shenanigans.

143
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,832
This mirror message
is very pointed,

144
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:43,637
and I think we all know
who it's pointed at.

145
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,940
India has left the competition,
and we still talking about her.

146
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,208
Smart girl, India.

147
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,277
We still talking about you,
bitch.

148
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,878
-Top five.
-Wow.

149
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,713
This feels so good.

150
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,015
It does.

151
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,516
-And it's a fierce five.
-It really is.

152
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,918
This is a fierce five,
and very diverse, too.

153
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,487
I feel like
we all deserve to be here.

154
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,089
What you thinking, Cracker?
Because you very quiet, bitch.

155
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,558
Oh, I'm, like,
I'm gonna shut the fuck up,

156
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,794
because we're about to vote
on the top four,

157
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,930
so I'm not gonna put my foot
anywhere it doesn't belong.

158
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,400
[alarm]
Oh! There we go.

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,801
What are we doing today?

00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,003
She done already

161
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,772
Hey, All Stars.

162
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,341
I got all my sisters with me,

163
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:26,813
plus aunties, nieces,
and several many play cousins.

164
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,416
So go on and fix you a plate,
Corneshia.

165
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,484
Y'all hungry?

166
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,653
[laughs] Yes, I am.

167
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,121
What's a "Corneshia?"

168
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,790
That's my cousin.

169
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,658
Don't act brand-new.

170
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,226
Hello, hello, hello!

171
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,363
-Hello!
-Hi!

172
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,298
Ladies, in all my travels

173
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,201
across the country
and around the world,

174
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,671
the most important thing
I've learned is this:

175
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,174
Happiness
is in your own backyard.

176
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,209
So for this week's
maxi-challenge,

177
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,179
my sisters Rozy and Renae and I

178
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,716
are throwing
a Charles family backyard ball.

179
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,917
-Ooh!
-Oh!

180
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,585
And you're all invited!

181
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,587
[all laugh]

182
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,423
-I love barbeque.
-

183
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,293
Now, y'all need to serve up
two fresh looks.

184
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,561
First look,

185
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,664
tapping into my family's
colorful Louisiana roots,

186
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,301
country cousin realness.

187
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:24,137
You'll create an original
play cousin persona

188
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,507
and crash the party
with a comedic back story.

189
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,377
Second look,
starting from scratch,

190
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,346
y'all need to whip up
some high fashion

191
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,949
worthy of the main stage.

192
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,587
-But there's a twist.
-Of course.

193
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,590
Michelle, tell them what
materials they'll be using!

194
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,924
[game show music plays]

195
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,027
Ru, the All Stars
will be using items

196
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,662
you find in your own backyard.

197
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,266
-Like tablecloths...
-"Audience": Ahh!

198
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,435
-lawn chairs...
-Ooh!

199
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,203
-picnic blanket...
-Ahh!

200
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,905
-hammocks...
-Ohh!

201
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,840
-barbeque sauce...
-Ah!

202
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,443
-and more.
-Oh!

203
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:06,546
The total value of this
Charles family ball showcase

204
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,314
is... priceless.
["audience" applause]

205
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,584
[all laugh]

206
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,119
Thanks, Michelle.

207
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,656
Now, you can use your own hair,
heels, and underpants,

208
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:21,861
plus materials
from the FandS Fabrics wall.

209
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,030
So y'all better fire up

210
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,366
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent,

211
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,767
because company's coming.

212
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,935
[applause]

213
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,272
All Stars, start your engines,

214
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,141
and may the best woman win.

215
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,411
Successful shopping trip.

216
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,313
Ooh, this was fun.

217
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,148
[grunts]

218
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,317
What the fuck
is "backyard eleganza?"

219
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,120
I don't have a backyard.
I live in Boston.

220
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,190
Hey, I have a poem.

221
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,793
Who could sew,
who loves hot glue,

222
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,564
my name is Juju.

223
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,099
Oh, wow.

224
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,867
No, but for real, who could sew?

225
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,937
My major in school
was theater costume design,

226
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,207
so I'm not a stranger
to a sewing machine.

227
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,242
I sew, like, half of my stuff
that I wear.

228
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,678
I sew a little,

229
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:15,081
and I also use
a lot of hot glue.

230
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,584
How about ju, Jujubee?

231
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,619
I'm so-so with sewing.

232
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,787
[laughs]

233
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:25,225
I'm so excited about
this sewing experience.

234
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,427
I know what I like, and I know
what silhouettes I like,

235
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,761
and this is definitely
like high fashion,

236
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,230
so I'm excited for that.

237
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,098
I think I have
a great eye for fashion,

238
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,333
so I feel like this challenge

239
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,002
is, like,
the Blair St. Clair challenge.

240
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,972
This feels like
it could finally be my win.

241
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,040
Also, this is my wheelhouse

242
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,109
because my family
likes to get together

243
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,911
and make stuff
out of weird materials.

244
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,212
Since I was a little kid,

245
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,281
I have been making stuff
with trash.

246
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,949
My mom took us to the museum

247
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,887
to look at costumes from around
the world and throughout time,

248
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,955
and said,
"Pick your favorite one."

249
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,958
"We're gonna go home
and make it out of garbage."

250
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,634
This challenge is a way for me
to show the judges who I am,

251
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,302
that I can do it all.

252
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,237
Oh, my God.

253
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,773
Oh, no!

254
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,941
What happened?

255
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,844
I made a mathematical error
just now.

256
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,145
Oh.

257
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,380
Wow, okay.

258
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,917
But if I don't nail it,
then they'll fail it.

259
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,720
And we do not need that
this late in the game.

260
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,823
Aah!

261
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,761
It's fine.end act

262
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:44,237
Today's maxi-challenge
is the Charles backyard ball.

263
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,371
You know what?

264
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,140
I am so confident
in this challenge, I'm--

265
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,808
ooh, I'm gonna take this.

266
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,411
Bitch, I am lying,
because I'm scared.

267
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,814
I am going to poop myself,
because this is terrifying.

268
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,516
That's the honest truth.

269
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,052
This is hard. This is hard.

270
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,055
I hate this challenge.

271
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,457
This other side
is the right side of it.

272
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,858
-And then you have all these--
-Well, how do you know

273
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,393
that it's the right side
and the wrong side?

274
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,228
See how you can see those,
like, lines running through it

275
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,030
from where it's been woven?

276
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,131
You're kind of seeing all that

277
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,633
and how it's smooth
on this side?

278
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,801
Yes.

279
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,903
And can you tell
this is the right side.

280
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,538
When you look over
at cute little Jujubee,

281
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,140
and, like, "Help me,"
I am just not the kind of person

282
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,610
that can be like, "No, bitch,
this is a competition."

283
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,945
Like, of course
I'm gonna help her.

284
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,880
I know that you're not
necessarily trained

285
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,950
in sewing and building costumes.

286
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,020
But the same type of, like,
energy and creativity

287
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,790
that you apply
to your performances,

288
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,325
-apply to this.
-Thank you.

289
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,393
You got it.

290
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,732
Don't do this to me!

291
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,935
Girl, that moment
when the material you chose

292
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,336
is not going through
the machine.

293
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,404
What's T?

294
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,972
It's just I'm having
to figure out

295
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,841
how this material
is gonna go through the machine,

296
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:56,542
because she's giving me
a little trouble right now.

297
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,413
Tension is tight, so you
might wanna loosen this up.

298
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,414
Okay.

299
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,649
And then your length
is super short,

300
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,783
so that's also making it--

301
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,385
So maybe like two and a half,
three.

302
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,786
Yeah, okay.

303
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,621
-Shea.
-Yes?

304
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,356
You never told a lie.

305
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,724
I never told a lie.

306
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,925
It's working perfectly.

307
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,761
Bam.

308
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,264
I really like this challenge,

309
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,601
because this is like what we do
in real drag, right?

310
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,403
Oh, yeah, girl.
When you ain't got money.

311
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,004
-Right?
-Yes.

312
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,907
This challenge
is perfect for me

313
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,542
because I do everything I wear.

314
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,744
What's your concept?
What you going for, mama?

315
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:36,616
I am going to do what I do best
is gowns, you know.

316
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,650
Mm-hmm.

317
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,285
I'm a pageant queen.

318
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,320
Yes.

319
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,587
And I'm gonna keep it very me.

320
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,589
But you also have to use
all the materials

321
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,026
that scream "Hello,
I'm a cookout material."

322
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,394
Right.

323
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,531
I want the gown to feature
everything that a barbeque has:

324
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,600
cups, plates, napkins, forks,

325
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,703
and even a kiddie pool, bitch.

326
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,071
Yeah, I was thinking in my head.

327
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,941
I said if I get invited to
RuPaul's barbeque in real life,

328
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,576
what would I wear?

329
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,178
And I said, the most.

330
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,779
[all laugh]

331
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,383
Yeah, I think this might be
your challenge, girl.

332
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,852
Now, is this barbeque

333
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,121
like a July Fourth celebration?

334
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,123
It's family, so you know
you have to show up

335
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,325
and show them that you're
employed and everything.

336
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,693
I love a barbeque.

337
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,697
Guys, India left me, like,
a letter, but also a gift.

338
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,232
Oh.

339
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,533
"Thank you so much for being
so sweet and showing me

340
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,268
"that there are still
wonderful people out there.

341
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,536
"I can't wait
to work with you soon.

342
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,971
"Keep slaying, so proud of you.

343
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,106
XOXO, India."

344
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,074
Wait, she didn't
give me nothin'.

345
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,075
You didn't get one?

346
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,010
Not even part of one.

347
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,846
Maybe she ran outta ink.

348
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,914
-Shea, you got one?
-I did.

349
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,817
Mine says, "Shea,
I'm so honored and blessed

350
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,887
"to have gotten to know you
and work with you.

351
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,124
"You are such an amazing person
and kind spirit.

352
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,558
"Love you so much.

353
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,026
"Keep turning it.

354
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,295
P.S.: I've got you."

355
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,064
-Wow.
-Did anybody else get a note?

356
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,767
I got one, I think,
but I don't wanna read it.

357
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,034
You don't wanna read it?

358
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,138
No, because it's not
important to me right now.

359
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,473
For real this bitch
didn't give me a letter?

360
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,875
I'm not gonna lose sleep

361
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,410
over India not writing me
a fucking note,

362
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,380
but she wrote a note for Alexis.

363
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,390
Did you wanna read my note,
Jujubee?

364
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,325
No, I'll just read mine.

365
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,863
Yeah, I'll read it.

366
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,964
Don't read it to me.
I don't wanna know.

367
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,065
Just read it to yourself.

368
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,033
You don't want me
to read it out loud?

369
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,034
No.

370
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:42,708
"Alexis, you are such a bitch.

371
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,611
I can't believe you're
still in the competition."

372
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,679
Girl.

373
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,447
"I can't stand you."

374
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,150
[laughs]

375
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,788
"You are the potato salad
with raisins

376
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,624
that nobody eats at a barbeque."

377
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,092
[laughs]

378
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,527
I am.

379
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,763
Do you want me to actually
tell you what it actually says?

380
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,764
-Yeah.
-Okay.

381
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,599
It says,
"Alexis, I still love you.

382
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,201
"Hugs and kisses, India.

383
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,502
Open your heart."

384
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,106
Wait. It doesn't say I'm a liar
or something like that?

385
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,575
No.

386
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,912
"Open your heart."

387
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:20,980
What do you think this means?

388
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,415
I don't know.

389
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:26,052
"Alexis, I still love you."

390
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,521
You don't love me, bitch.

391
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,025
Girl, bye.

392
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,628
This whole drama with India,

393
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,497
I feel like Alexis wants it
to all be done and over with

394
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,733
and for us
to stop talking about it.

395
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,968
But even though

396
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:45,004
I'm obviously looking
at Alexis Mateo differently,

397
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,839
I feel like everybody else

398
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,108
should be watching
their backs, too.end act

399
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:56,849
Today we're getting ready

400
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,418
for the Charles
Backyard Barbeque Ball.

401
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,888
Oh, damn,
this is in centimeters?

402
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:06,959
Centimeters.
So 2.54 centimeters is one inch.

403
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,028
I remember that from math class.

404
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,431
Hey, y'all!

405
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,700
-Hey, mama.
-Hey.

406
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,868
Who's making the potato salad?

407
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,970
-I ate the potatoes.
-[laughs]

408
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,640
Alexis Mateo.

409
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,174
Hey, RuPaul.

410
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,309
Does your family have barbeques?

411
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,310
-All the time.
-Really?

412
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,746
It's not all, like, barbeque,

413
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,215
but it's more like
all you can eat.

414
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,083
Is it in Puerto Rico
or in Florida?

415
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,485
In Puerto Rico.
All my family's in Puerto Rico.

416
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,387
I don't have nobody
in the United States.

417
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,289
Well, you have Vanjie.

418
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:40,026
Vanjie, my drag daughter
who doesn't cook.

419
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:44,163
She was here last week
as the lip sync assassin.

420
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,531
It was interesting.

421
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,567
I looked over at you,
and you had a sort of a--

422
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,170
I don't know, it was
a weird look on your face.

423
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,172
Were you happy to see her?

424
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,373
I was very excited
to see Vanjie.

425
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,810
It just--
it was a lot going on.

426
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,111
Yeah.

427
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,948
And when I saw Vanjie,
all I thought in my head

428
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,283
was, like,
you don't wanna go home

429
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,885
in front of your daughter.

430
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,320
Yeah. Yeah.

431
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,322
So let's talk about
this challenge.

432
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,258
I feel more at home
than any other challenge.

433
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,559
-Really?
-Let's put it this way.

434
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,028
Because this is literally
what I do normally.

435
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,198
You know how to sew, you know
how to put things together.

436
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,334
I can defend myself.
[laughs]

437
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,336
-You have it mapped out.
-I think so.

438
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,171
I'm gonna stay true to Alexis.

439
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:28,441
Good. You should.
You're an All Star.

440
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,209
-Yes.
-[laughs]

441
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,944
All right, Alexis,
I'll see you at the picnic.

442
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,313
I'm so ready to eat.

443
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,048
[both laugh]

444
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,751
Shea Butter Couleé.

445
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,885
Hey, Ru.

446
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,487
On your season,
you won the ball challenge.

447
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,925
I did. The gayest ball ever.

448
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:49,528
I love creating looks.

449
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,198
As a little kid, I used to
take my dad's dress socks

450
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,067
and cut them up and sew gowns
for my sister's Barbies.

451
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,103
Ooh.

452
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,704
Yeah, I started pretty young.

453
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,539
-Yes.
-And here we are.

454
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,642
And here we are. Wow.

455
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,845
And talking about family,
I remember

456
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,713
that when you were
on this competition before,

457
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,283
you had experienced
some bad news.

458
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:16,389
My dad, he had been battling
cancer for about five years,

459
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,624
and he had been in remission
and he was fine.

460
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,893
But while I was here
during filming,

461
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,662
went into the hospital,

462
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:27,266
and two days before the cast
for Season 9 got announced,

463
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,901
he passed away.

464
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,303
And, um...

465
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,045
It was really tough.

466
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:44,917
Because my dream
for RuPaul's Drag Race

467
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:52,091
was wrapped in the idea of him
getting to watch and see me,

468
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,994
because I know
he would have been proud.

469
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,530
And for me, the imagery

470
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,902
of having this Christian,
military, Black father

471
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:06,539
sitting in that audience
rooting for his son

472
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,709
was all I'd ever wanted.

473
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,912
When I felt like
I was coming to terms with that,

474
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,914
a month later to the day

475
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,150
my oldest sister passed away
from breast cancer.

476
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,186
And she was the one

477
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,888
that showed me
Supermodel Of The World.

478
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,725
Her and I used to strut around
that living room.

479
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,627
-Your soul sister.
-Yeah.

480
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:32,364
She encouraged me to be
the person that I am today,

481
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,402
and I felt really lost,

482
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,937
because I felt like

483
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,540
my two biggest cheerleaders
were now gone.

484
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,444
Though I miss them both
every single day,

485
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,647
I feel them with me.

486
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,518
My dad is half of who I am.

487
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:55,754
I carry him with me
everywhere I go,

488
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,491
and I know
that he's proud of me.

489
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,559
I know that.

490
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,729
Well, you can honor him
by living your best life.

491
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,698
Yeah.

492
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,700
Thank you. I will.

493
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,101
-Thanks, Shea.
-Thanks, Ru.

494
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,038
-Hi, Jujubee.
-Hi, Mama.

495
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,374
[laughs] You're making
something here.

496
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,510
-Do you sew?
-No.

497
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,844
[laughs]

498
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,613
I've done it before.

499
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:25,217
So here we are in the
Charles Family Backyard Ball.

500
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,585
Yes.

501
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,455
I know that there was some
back story with your family.

502
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,023
That your mother
had left the family.

503
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,057
Mm-hmm, yeah.

504
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,660
I was 15 and Dad died,

505
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,662
so it was me and my two sisters.

506
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:37,897
And six months afterwards,

507
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,733
she kind of had a meltdown
and left with some man.

508
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,635
And it was me
and my two sisters,

509
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:45,638
we became basically
wards of the state.

510
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,073
I was very lucky.

511
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,642
I got to live with my aunt,

512
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,844
but my two sisters
were put into foster homes.

513
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:52,978
-Really?
-Yeah.

514
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,147
Oh, my goodness.
And how long were they in there?

515
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,983
We disconnected
for about five years,

516
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,285
and then got back together.

517
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:03,088
So how have you created family
in your adult life?

518
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,658
I've had to let go of a lot
of the people in my past,

519
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,293
because
it wasn't healthy for me.

520
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,361
So most of my friends now

521
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,131
are my friends
that I meet at my meetings,

522
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,799
because we share
the same spirituality.

523
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,702
-We're all broken inside.
-Yeah.

524
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,271
But we're working on
becoming better human beings.

525
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,440
A couple years ago,

526
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,776
I made some decisions
that would affect my life.

527
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,179
I broke up with my fiancée
of 12 years,

528
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,181
and I also
made a conscious decision

529
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,917
to stop using drugs
and drinking.

530
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,854
And that has been
very impactful for me

531
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,057
not only as a human being,
but as a drag queen.

532
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:41,327
I'm not completely found,

533
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,896
but I'm not as lost
as I used to be.

534
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,531
If that makes any sense to you.

535
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,267
Ooh, that sounds like
a gospel song.

536
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,270
I wanna hear Albertina Walker
sing that song.

537
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,173
And you stick with those friends

538
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:57,676
in those places
that you and I both know about.

539
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,179
Because I think
what you're gonna find

540
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,114
is they will help you.

542
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,919

without those friends.

544
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,189
I wouldn't be here.

545
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:14,593
It's a beautiful moment for me,
because I needed this meeting.

546
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,762
I needed this, and I'm so happy

547
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,565
that there's somebody here
that I can relate to with this.

548
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,133
And it just so happens
to be the person

549
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,601
that I look up to the most.

550
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,004
It's a real, real gift.

551
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:26,338
Thank you.

552
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,673
And you can honor that gift

553
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,776
by shining and sewing
and cooking.

554
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,077
I'll bring my potato salad.

555
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,013
Is that your signature dish?

556
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,748
With raisins and MSG.

you got a piece of fabric here

565

that you have not cut,
you have not patterned,

a damn thing to.

Today we're getting ready

577
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,060
for the Charles
Backyard Barbeque Ball.

578
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,061
Girl, I still have
so much work to do, though.

579
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,797
Oh, I have so much to do. Ugh.

580
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:28,267
We have to present
the country cousin character,

581
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,902
and a high fashion
eleganza look

582
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,271
made from backyard
barbeque materials.

583
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,939
-So what's your eleganza here?
-Eleganza?

584
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,375
Well, whenever I show up
to a family function,

585
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,711
everyone always
points out my clothes,

586
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,713
and everyone around
is, like, what is that?

587
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,614
But also, like, "Oh, my gosh."

588
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:43,882
You know, like,
that's just my family.

589
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,617
So I wanted to do something,
like--

590
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,819
Extra. Extra St. Clair.

591
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,321
So all these items
are used in different ways

592
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,556
that are repurposed,

593
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,291
but you're not necessarily
gonna see all them,

594
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,093
because I'm trying
to give this high fashion look.

595
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,127
Right.

596
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,729
Okay, Blair.

597
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:00,132
We know.
You're so good, Blair.

598
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,067
Well, you better be,

599

because you have not won
a challenge yet, bitch.

Oh, this is looking good.

Oh, you know, it's still
in a million pieces,

602
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,309

603
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,744
Still, girl?

604
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:16,849
Yeah, because making this
out of dinner napkins was...

605
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,218
-a choice.
-It's a choice.

606
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,086
Because it's been unraveling.

607
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,957
But I also have not had a time
to, like, fit it on myself.

608
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,759
It looks nice, though.
I love the pants.

609
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,627
I would wear the pants.

610
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,396
Okay.

611
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,297
What to say about Alexis Mateo?

612
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:36,869
I'm still trying
to figure her out.

613
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,204
No, really. I'm really
trying to figure her out,

614
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,441
because I don't think that
she's giving us the true T.

615
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,309
Are you freaking out
or are you okay?

616
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,245
I'm freaking out a little bit,

617
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:50,616
just because if you don't win,
you're in the bottom.

618
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:55,254
There's only five of us left,
and Alexis Mateo is still here.

619
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:58,323
So that means
I am in danger of going home

620
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,958
if I wind up in the bottom,
you know what I'm saying?

So... [laughs]
I gotta carry this one out.

We also have to get ready,

623
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,567
and I still have, like,
a ton of sewing to do.

00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:13,105
So I'm just gonna
keep breathing.

and watch Juju eat her
watermelon slices over there.

You so fake over there,
eating your fake watermelon.

that that watermelon ain't real.

through y'all two bitches,

you're conspiring against me.

is conspiring against you.

what that means.

probably means

00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,860
I'm gonna vote the way that
I wanna vote at that second

644
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,096

for this specific vote.

no criteria, bitch.

as accommodating as they can be,

it's a lot of mixed feelings,

655
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,526
and I don't know how long
they're gonna hold this grudge.

00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,245
"things I could find
at the gas station."

705
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,580
Today I'm planning
to spill a little secret.

706
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,418
My doctor told me that Ru
isn't just my second cousin,

707
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,119
she's my perfect match,

708
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,256
and I could really use
a kidney right now.

709
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,458
[hacking cough]

710
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,994
Michelle: Stevie Hick.

711
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,729
RuPaul: Jujubee.

712
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,330
Jujubee: Sorry I'm late.

713
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,399
I didn't wanna come.
[laughs]

714
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,402
I'm RuPaul's Asian bestie,

715
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,572
'cause once you go Asian,
that's all you be cravin'.

716
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:45,844
My name is Ping, but everybody
in my family calls me "Amber."

717
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,946
I hope you like my outfit.

718
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,347
For the backyard fish fry,

719
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,384
I brought my famous
potato salad with raisins,

720
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:56,221
which I made with potatoes
and raisins

721
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,324
and my secret ingredient:
MSG.

722
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,659
Mmm.

723
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:03,695
Today I'm planning
on spilling a family secret.

724
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,697
RuPaul isn't just my bestie,

725
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,567
she's my psychological
mommy dearest.

726
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,802
[laughs] Bye.

727
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:12,838
Carson: She has hat it.

728
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,373
[all laugh]

729
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,410
RuPaul: Blair St. Clair.

730
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,946
Blair: I'm RuPaul's first cousin
twice removed

731
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,315
and then added again
for federal tax reasons,

732
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,550
from Indianapolis, Indiana.

733
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,919
My name is Darlene,

734
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,288
but everybody in my family
calls me "Stinky"

735
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,891
because I sure can
gas up a room real good.

736
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,093
[belch]

737
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,362
For this year's
backyard barbeque,

738
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,098
I brought my signature
Indiana surprise,

739
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,034
made with baby food
and amoxicillin.

740
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,704
The secret is to let it gel
for 30 minutes in the fridge

741
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,405
at 30 degrees Fahrenheit.

742
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,375
Today, I'm planning
on spilling a family secret.

743
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,777
Now, don't tell nobody,

744
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,346
but RuPaul isn't just
my first cousin twice removed.

745
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,982
Considering the paternity
of my newborn son,

746
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,718
RuPaul, you are the father!

747
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:02,254
[all laugh]

748
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:06,358
RuPaul: Those boots
were made for incarceration.

749
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,959
Shea Couleé.

750
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,261
Shea: Oh, hey, y'all.

751
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,165
It's me, RuPaul's
baby niece Sheaquita,

752
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,667
but everybody calls me
Lil Ki-Ki.

753
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:20,472
I'm wearing a one-of-a-kind
airbrushed T-shirt

754
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:21,573
by my cousin Pookie

755
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:25,544
in loving memory
of my Big Mama.

756
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,212
Today I was running
a little bit late,

757
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,947
so all I was able to bring

758
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,851
was the bag of "She
already done had her chips."

759
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,486
That was in
my glove compartment.

760
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,255
But my family secret

761
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,859
is that not only
is RuPaul my great auntie,

762
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:44,629
but she also my best friend.

763
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,798
For real, though, Auntie Ru.

764
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,000
Now, make sure y'all save me
some potato salad,

765
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,502
'cause I'm gonna be
right back.

766
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,903
Carson: Well, she left
the tags on this.

767
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,772
Michelle: She did.

768
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,141
RuPaul: Alexis Mateo.

769
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,311
Alexis: ¡Rrr!  ¡Hola y saludos!

770
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:05,750
I'm RuPaul's ex-housekeeper,
and my name is Carmencita.

771
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,622
But everyone in the family
calls me Carcita.

772
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,891
I'm going to hair school
on the weekdays,

773
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,926
but on the weekends,

774
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:20,265
I am the queen of salsa
in every bar, baby.

775
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,901
I'm bringing coquito
to the barbeque

776
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,837
because it's the best
Puerto Rican drink

777
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,706
in any party.

778
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:31,743
Today I want everybody to know
that RuPaul still owe me money

779
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:34,379
from back when
I was his housekeeper,

780
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,848
and I better get it back.

781
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,150
Michelle:
Wearing lime ain't no crime.

782
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,589
Category is
Backyard Ball Eleganza.

783
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:47,626
First, Miz Cracker.

784
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,761
Good girl gone badminton.

785
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,795
[all laugh]

786
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,031
Carson:
Hey, what's all the racquet?

787
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,434
Cracker:
Ladies, I am ready to serve.

788
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,104
I'm bringing Fifth Avenue
to the backyard,

789
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,572
and I'm bringing it to you

790
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,575
with a fascinator made out
of a racquet and a wiffleball.

791
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,143
I have wiffleball earrings,

792
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,178
I have a shuttlecock
on my throat,

793
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,647
I have a shuttlecock
on my shoes,

794
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,982
and I have a shuttlecock
under my skirt.

795
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,617
RuPaul: You know,
it's strange to see her alone.

796
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,352
She's usually with a net.

797
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,122
Michelle: Oh, my God.

798
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,290
RuPaul: Jujubee.

799
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,926
Carson:
Look at the melons on her!

800
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:23,228
Michelle:
Now, do you spit or swallow?

801
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,597
Oh, my--
The seeds, the seeds, guys!

802
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,065
RuPaul:
The seeds, the seeds.

803
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,134
Jujubee:
Ooh, girl, I am giving you

804
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:32,103
the only Laffy Taffy
Miss Taffy USA mama.

805
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,872
Mm. [tongue pop]

806
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,708
I'm wearing watermelons,
my favorite fruit.

807
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:40,912
My hair is just absolutely
perfect and coiffed.

808
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,314
Nobody's touching this.

809
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,182
I'm the watermelon lady.

810
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,151
Michelle:
She's got a peel.

811
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:49,120
[all snicker]

812
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,891
RuPaul:
I declare, Blair St. Clair.

813
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,926
Come on, Leg.

814
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,128
Carson:
It's curtains for her.

815
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,096
[all laugh]

816
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,431
Blair: My runway look

817
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,499
is giving you
high-fashion couture glamour.

818
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,168
There are pleated
ruche moments.

819
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,270
I'm giving you color blocking
and pattern blocking.

820
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,905
I have tassel moments going on,

821
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,141
and I am living for my
slicked-back, wet hair moment.

822
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,044
Feel the fantasy.
This is all real.

823
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,247
RuPaul: Fresh from the pool,
she's ready for Adult Swim.

824
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:19,584
[all laugh]

825
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:20,986
Shea Couleé.

826
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,922
Bebe: Oh, marry.

827
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:27,792
RuPaul: Who invited Grace Jones
to the picnic?

828
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:32,364
Michelle: Here comes the bride
all dressed in assless chaps.

829
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:35,500
Shea: I am serving you
backyard bridal realness.

830
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,070
I've got my jumpsuit
with my chaps

831
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,606
and my beautiful
mosquito net veil,

832
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,475
and all my family and friends

833
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,577
are here to see me
tie the knot.

834
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,546
Carson: She's putting the "ass"
back in "Kansas."

835
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,182
[all laugh]

836
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,518
RuPaul: Alexis Mateo.

837
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,520
Carson:
Is she wearing a cup?

838
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,658
Michelle:
She's performing a Solo act.

839
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,661
Darn it, I had that!
[all laugh]

840
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,630
Alexis: My runway look

841
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,832
is Alexis Mateo
the house down boots.

842
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:13,071
And I'm serving barbeque
extravaganza eleganza.

843
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,775
Michelle: Oh, she brought
her own flotation device.

844
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,146
Bam. I'm bringing
the kiddie pool, bitch,

845
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:23,448
and it's always wet
between my legs.

846
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,884
Carson: I like the way
this pools at the hem.

847
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,652
[all laugh]end act

848
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,022
Welcome, All Stars.

849
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,025
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

850
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,795
starting with Miz Cracker.

851
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,096
Hello.

852
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:40,698
-Hello, Miss Jocelyn Opal Rose.
-That's right.

853
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,335
AKA "She's got a lotta nerve
showing up here after all that."

854
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,370
[all laugh]

855
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,938
It looked like you had 47 cats

856
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,441
and may live in your car,
but it was really fun.

857
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:50,775
It was messy,
it was--it just--

858
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,977
we knew exactly
who this person was.

859
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,213
I thought
you were really into it.

860
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,981
It was hilarious.

861
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,784
Overall tonight,
from the barbeque monologue

862
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,353
to both of the outfits,
you're actually my favorite.

863
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,556
I love this dress, by the way.

864
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,958
What is the top made out of?

865
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,894
It's some kind of seatbelt
material for hauling cars

866
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,062
or some kind of rope.

867
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,431
It seems like stuff
for straight people.

868
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:15,300
[laughs]

869
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,869
It looks really beautiful
and it looks really fashion

870
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,870
and your makeup is gorgeous.

871
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,205
All the way down
to the details

872
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:25,009
of the shuttlecocks
on your feet,

873
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,478
it's really, really thoughtful.

874
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,812
Since the drag gods
are watching,

875
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,514
I should say one thing.

876
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,015
Some of the support that I got

877
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,218
and someone that was
a cheerleader for the people

878
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:36,287
in the room was Shea.

879
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,357
-Thank you, Miz Cracker.
-Thank you.

880
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,593
Up next, Jujubee.

881
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,428
♪ Hello ♪

882
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,664
-♪ Hello ♪
-♪ Ahh ♪

883
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,833
The first line of your monologue
was hilarious,

884
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,535
because that's basically
my life.

885
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,438
"Sorry I'm late,
I didn't wanna come."

886
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,806
That's--it was hilarious.

887
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:58,076
The character that you wrote
was really funny,

888
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,911
and the outfit
matched the character.

889
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,945
The hat was ridiculous.

890
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,715
Where do you find a hat
with a brim--

891
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,450
See, there's this guy
that I kind of hang out with,

892
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,485
and he had the hat,
and I borrowed it.

893
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,487
-Aha.
-I think he got it from Italy.

894
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,256
-Aha.
-Came in a huge box.

895
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,423
It sure did.

896
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,425
Nice melons, by the way.

897
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,660
[all laugh]

898
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,228
Let's talk about the dress,
though.

899
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,496
This is tablecloth.

900
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,633
All the melons that you see
came from this mat.

901
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,168
I think this is very pretty,

902
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:27,005
but the seam details
on both sides

903
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,573
are a little bit wonky.

904
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:30,642
When you turned on the runway,

905
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,343
that was kind of
a little bit of a giveaway.

906
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,912
I hate this challenge.

907
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,648
[all laugh]

908
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,851
But I'm very proud of myself,
because I actually made a dress,

909
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,653
and I also received help
from Shea,

910
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,521
and I'm very grateful.

911
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,822
So thank you, Shea.

912
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,924
Oh, love you. Thanks.

913
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,026
-Thank you, Juju.
-Thank you, Ru.

914
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:51,396
I declare, it's Blair St. Clair.

915
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,631
-Hi, Darlene.
-Hi. How are you?

916
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:58,970
So your character, I appreciated
the Gay-tona 500 moment.

917
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,638
Your look was really great,

918
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,808
but for me, all in all,
it wasn't a knee-slapper.

919
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,009
I wasn't dying of laughter.

920
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,145
I felt a lot of lulls
in the room.

921
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:09,280
It needed to be trashier for me.

922
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,416
Didn't really sell
the character.

923
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:14,819
This runway look,
I do see that you put that--

924
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,422
was that, like,
a lawn chair webbing

925
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,190
that you have on the hem?

926
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,125
To give it some movement,
but also, like, weigh it down.

927
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,561
It's looking
a little messy to me.

928
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,696
I can tell when you were walking

929
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,165
that something
was undoing back here,

930
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,766
because you were
kind of holding it in.

931
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,469
And if you're gonna do
that hair, I say go for it.

932
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,304
I think it needs
either some gloss or, like,

933
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,107
just make it look either slick
or make it look dry.

934
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,675
It's kind of in between.

935
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,744
I actually love
the Debbie Harry vibes,

936
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:40,979
like the Blondie vibes.

937
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,381
I just think
you're so beautiful,

938
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,616
and, like,
I really love your makeup.

939
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,551
Like, I would love
for you to do my makeup.

940
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,553
Call me.

941
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,421
-Thank you, Blair.
-Thank you.

942
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,224
Up next, Shea Couleé.

943
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,859
Hello, uh, Sheaquita.
Was that your alter-ego?

944
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:56,861
Yes, but you can call me
Lil Ki-Ki.

945
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:58,229
-Lil Ki-Ki.
-[tongue pop]

946
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:03,301
I thought your play cousin
couture moment was really great.

947
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:04,936
Immediately, we had
something to relate to

948
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:08,840
with the Grandrea from
your season, from 90210.

949
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,974
I thought that was genius.

950
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,543
Loved your monologue.
It was hilarious.

951
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,579
You had a bag of chips,
and you ate one of the chips.

952
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,014
Like, I couldn't stop
watching you.

953
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,348
Tonight on the runway,

954
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,285
you took a different approach
to the picnic attire.

955
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,953
I think it's fun,
I think it's different.

956
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,822
I think it's really fresh,
because it has a story to it.

957
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,825
Like, I would wear this.
Like, I think it's dope.

958
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,561
Those are the shuttlecocks
across the sweetheart neckline?

959
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,563
Mm-hmm, and I just found out

960
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,399
that y'all call these
"shuttlecocks."

961
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,733
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

962
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,734
I grew up
in a Christian household.

963
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,036
We called them "birdies."

964
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,672
We weren't playing with no cocks
up on our backyard.

965
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,140
[laughs]

966
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,610
The only thing, maybe,
there's a lot going on.

967
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,979
Maybe I would have made it
a tiny bit less busy,

968
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,914
but it's still really cool.

969
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,316
All right, thank you.

970
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:54,919
Obviously, you are one of
the seamstresses of the bunch.

971
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,087
Yeah.

972
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,088
Because it sounds like
you had enough time

973
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,724
to not only make
a couture garment,

974
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,025
but also to help everybody else.

975
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,093
Why not?

976
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,928
I just think
it's really important

977
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:09,100
that as, like, queer people,
that we all act as family.

978
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,869
I understand that
this is a competition,

979
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,706
but if one of us looks good,
all of us look good.

980
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,674
Thank you, Shea.

981
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,010
Bam. Alexis Mateo.

982
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,378
Hi-ee.

983
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:23,281
I loved this look tonight,
because when you came out here,

984
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:25,216
I knew right away
those were Solo cups.

985
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,151
And the hair is very you,

986
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,753
and then of course
the big reveal.

987
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:32,390
I've never seen a dress with
a kiddie pool built into it.

988
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,424
Like, I wasn't expecting it
to happen,

989
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,525
and then when it happened,

990
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,394
I was, like,
that's the best thing ever.

991
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,495
Like, I screamed.

992
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,663
I would say that this look

993
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,199
really floods
both your basement and mine.

994
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,533
[laughs]

995
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,035
But I don't love

996
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:48,139
the way this mermaid
kind of hemline is working,

997
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:51,242
because it's really
cutting off your lower half

998
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,111
into another half.

999
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,413
So the proportion
is a little wonky for me.

1000
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,482
The character in the beginning,

1001
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,484
I know how funny you are,

1002
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:01,886
and I felt
a little let down by her.

1003
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,455
The dress was plain
and bright green,

1004
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,959
and then the reveal,
the hair was really small.

1005
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,961
I just felt like
it was kind of flat.

1006
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,396
I wish you would have
kept the pink wig on.

1007
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:13,431
I didn't like the red wig.
I just liked the pink wig.

1008
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,800
I thought that
it was a great idea,

1009
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,802
but then there wasn't
quite enough there

1010
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:20,038
for me to sink my teeth into.

1011
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,840
Thank you, ladies.

1012
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,410
I think I've heard enough.

1013
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,912
We are at the point
in the competition

1014
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:31,616
that if you're not the top,
you're in the bottom.

1015
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,387
Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

1016
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,456
I've made some decisions.

1017
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,433
Miz Cracker.

1018
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,102
Con-drag-ulations.

1019
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,871
You're the top All Star
of the week.

1020
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,840
[applause]

1021
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,609
You've won
a five-night stay for two,

1022
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:04,782
plus airfare, at The Lalit
London in London, England.

1023
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,717
My favorite place in the world.

1024
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:12,757
Juju, Blair, Shea, Alexis,

1025
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,793
you are the bottom All Stars
of the week.

1026
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,328
[sighs]

1027
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:22,100
Miz Cracker, you need to decide
which bottom queen to send home

1028
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,569
if you win the lip sync

1029
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,940
against this week's
lip sync assassin.

1030
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,775
The rest of you need to vote

1031
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:35,880
for which bottom queen
you think deserves the chop.

1032
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,315
Thank you, ladies.

1033
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,016
You may leave the stage.end act

1034
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,824
[sighs]
Suddenly I'm a top four girl.

1035
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,427
[imitates explosion]

1036
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,761
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my goodness.

1037
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:53,431
I'm trying to appear calm,

1038
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,234
but inside, I'm like,
looka back, looka back,

1039
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:59,403
looka back, looka back,
looka back at it, looka back.

1040
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,938
Congratulations, Cracks.

1041
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,373
-Thank you.
-Yes, Cracker.

1042
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,141
-You worked really hard on this.
-Congratulations, Miz Cracker.

1043
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,276
Girl.

1044
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,044
And congratulations on top four.

1045
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,580
Thank you. That's
what means the most to me.

1046
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,650
How'd you feel about
the judges' critiques?

1047
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,387
I was really crushed,
I'm not gonna lie.

1048
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,156
I'm really frustrated right now,

1049
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,391
because they weren't
loving this,

1050
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,894
and I understand
and I respect opinions.

1051
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,262
I'm not gonna stand here
and be like, "No, it's right,

1052
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:26,564
and you should say it's right
because you're wrong."

1053
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:29,100
That's not me,
and you guys know that.

1054
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,969
Well, we're all in the bottom

1055
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,539
if you're not Miz Cracker
this week.

1056
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:39,544
Yeah, right. However, for me,
based on the report card,

1057
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:43,281
we have two ladies
that have won challenges,

1058
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,216
one of them twice.

1059
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,617
And if I'm gonna go
by the report card,

1060
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:51,889
it would have to be Alexis
and Blair in the bottom.

1061
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,092
Oh, so that's the game
we're playing.

1062
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,961
You're just gonna throw
your friend under the bus.

1063
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:59,730
If I was questioning my
friendship with Cracker before,

1064
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,833
I'm absolutely questioning
my friendship with her now.

1065
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,135
This is not an easy one.

1066
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:07,338
And because you guys
are very equal,

1067
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:11,576
I wanna take each of you aside
and talk to you

1068
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,277
so I can get that gut feeling.

1069
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,712
I think that's just gas.

1070
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,047
Oh, is that what that is?

1071
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,214
[Shea laughs]

1072
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,849
This is exactly
what I was afraid of,

1073
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,053
because I knew that in order
to remain in the competition,

1074
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,854
I really
had to win the challenge.

1075
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:28,292
So this dream turned
into a nightmare real fast.

1076
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,427
I'm gonna plead my case,

1077
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,629
and I'm gonna do it quickly
and clear, okay?

1078
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:34,599
Even though me and Blair
have done a great job,

1079
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,903
and pretty much neck to neck,
I just want you all to know

1080
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,905
that it means everything to me
to stay,

1081
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:45,343
and I think that
I do deserve to continue.

1082
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:49,213
I don't wanna cry because
I feel horrible doing it.

1083
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,815
No, don't feel horrible
about your feelings.

1084
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:56,854
Yeah, because I feel like,
you know, drag is joyful.

1085
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,155
Join the party.

1086
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,759
This is really hard,
and I'm very emotional.

1087
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,529
I know. My stomach is,
like, literally in knots.

1088
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,965
[sighs]

1089
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,305
How do you unregister to vote?

1090
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:17,174
[all laugh]

1091
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,809
I just cannot go home.

1092
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,813
I entered the werkroom, day one
I won the reading challenge,

1093
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,615
and I've never
landed on the bottom

1094
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,450
until we started having
a group bottom.

1095
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:30,254
And I don't think it's fair
to go home yet.

1096
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:33,557
I have put so much dedication,
fire, emphasis,

1097
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,292
love into this, passion.

1098
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,261
Yeah.

1099
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,597
We've had differences
this competition.

1100
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:40,865
Yeah.

1101
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,701
I hope that we've
put them all aside, you know.

1102
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:44,702
I hope you're hearing this
as a friend,

1103
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:48,305
because I do value
your friendship.

1104
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:52,043
I want you to know that whatever
the decision that I make is,

1105
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54,712
I'm not looking at
who's my best friend.

1106
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:57,114
I'm looking at
who's a powerhouse.

1107
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,282
Mm-hmm.

1108
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,619
Who's gonna go out there
and be an inspiration.

1109
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,854
Well, just remember I love you.

1110
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,223
I respect your decision because
it's your decision to make.

1111
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:09,293
I just cannot go home.

1112
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:13,964
Cracker was my friend
coming into this competition,

1113
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,232
but Cracker's not stupid,

1114
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,302
and I think Cracker sees me
as some competition.

1115
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,472
And I'm afraid that she might
find this as an opportunity

1116
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,941
to say, well, Blair,
you had weak critiques,

1117
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,409
and you're a threat
in my mind.

1118
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,445
Chop.

1119
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:30,481
I know you and Blair has a great
bond, you know what I mean?

1120
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,949
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1121
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:37,388
And I realize that because this
nonsense drama that happened,

1122
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,191
that probably
in everybody else head,

1123
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,425
I am also a choice.

1124
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,894
But I did a great job,
you know what I mean?

1125
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,430
-Yeah. I mean, you have.
-And I think I deserve to stay.

1126
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,666
You've been so consistently
up there, girl.

1127
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:51,635
So true.

1128
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,307
I just want this to be an
inspiration for everybody else,

1129
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:59,543
that you can still do what you
love to do when you're my age,

1130
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,011
and continue to be there.

1131
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,580
Yeah.

1132
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,548
So follow your heart.

1133
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:10,354
I just wanna say to you, Blair,

1134
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,791
I could not be
more proud of you

1135
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,393
and what you've done here.

1136
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,496
You really do inspire me.

1137
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:19,997
But do you agree

1138
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:23,234
that you and Alexis
were the weakest this week?

1139
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,170
[sighs] I mean, I agree

1140
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:30,074
that we had the weakest
two critiques of the week,

1141
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,077
but I think as a whole
in this competition

1142
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,781
I have consistently stayed safe

1143
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:39,617
or have risen to the top
every week,

1144
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:41,218
and have grown and grown
and grown and grown and grown.

1145
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,754
And, like,
I have so much more fire,

1146
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,423
so much more passion,
determination,

1147
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,225
talent left to show.

1148
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:49,827
In your opinion,

1149
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:54,398
who do you think remaining here
is the weakest?

1150
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,038
Didn't have to say a word.

1151
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,442
I have no idea
how the group is gonna vote.

1152
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,179
Juju and Alexis have a lot
of history with each other,

1153
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:11,182
and I know Shea
isn't Alexis' biggest fan.

1154
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,383
But that doesn't mean

1155
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:14,051
that she's necessarily
just gonna vote for her.

1156
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:15,119
And I sure as hell don't know

1157
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,921
how Cracker's gonna vote,
either.

1158
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:20,724
It's scary to think that
this could be my last day.

1159
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,234
There's one crown.

1160
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:31,502
[sighs]

1161
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,437
Fuck.

1162
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:34,905
I want to win this.

1163
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,508
I'm going to be there.

1164
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:39,143
Who else
is gonna be there with me?

1165
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,779
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.

1166
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,289
I think that you're fabulous,
extremely talented,

1167
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:57,628
and I know that you're going
to go very far after this.

1168
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,438
I love you,

1169
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:12,643
but I know you can still grow,
so that's my vote.

1170
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,982
Looking at these lipsticks,

1171
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:21,185
I feel the weight
of what I'm about to do.

1172
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:24,188
I could end someone's dream
tonight and it hurts,

1173
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,758
but we can't afford to feel
those feelings right now.

1174
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,827
My gut has already told me
what to do,

1175
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,696
but I'm like
is there any other choice?

1176
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,431
Do I have another option?

1177
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,303
Can you imagine?

1178
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,241
You want me to do it.

1179
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:47,378
You, like,
secretly want me to do it.

1180
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,949
I got it. I get it.end act

1181
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,819
Welcome back, ladies.

1182
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:59,490
Miz Cracker, would you like
to meet your opponent?

1183
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:00,991
I wanna meet my opponent, Ru.

1184
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,794
The time has come...

1185
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:11,835
To present this week's
lip sync assassin.

1186
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:14,972
Oh, it's gonna be
Trinity Taylor.

1187
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:22,079
Ru-veal yourself!

1188
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:28,085
Trinity. Nobody else
can afford feathers.

1189
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,021
Has to be at least
$65 worth of feathers.

1190
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:36,126
-Oh!
-Oh!

1191
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,229
-Yes!
-Yes!

1192
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:43,534
Bitch, it is
Miss Thick and Juicy,

1193
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:46,403
Roxxxy Andrews.

1194
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,739
I've gone to her show
in Fort Lauderdale.

1195
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:53,310
Roxxxy turns the party, y'all,
and everybody in the room,

1196
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,612
even the folks
in the back, back corner,

1197
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,582
still feel everything
that she's serving.

1198
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:03,087
Roxxxy Andrews,
welcome back, my dear.

1199
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:04,355
Hi, Ru.

1200
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,723
Is there anything
you'd like to say to me?

1201
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,891
I'm Roxxxy Andrews,
and I'm here to make it clear

1202
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:09,193
I know you love me, baby.

1203
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:12,363
That's why
you brought me here...again.

1204
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,697
[laughter and applause]

1205
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,866
Look at you,
spittin' them rhymes.

1206
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,102
[record scratches]

1207
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:22,506
Ladies, Roxxxy Andrews
holds the lipstick

1208
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,709
of the queen that the group
has voted to go home.

1209
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,978
Now, if Roxxxy wins,

1210
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,682
the queen on her lipstick
gets the chop.

1211
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,219
-Y'all ready to slay?
-Yeah, ma'am.

1212
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,454
I'm wearing a Spandex leo.

1213
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,591
Two queens stand before me.

1214
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:46,597
Miz Cracker, this is your chance
to impress me,

1215
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:51,869
win $10.000, and earn the power

1216
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:56,273
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.
