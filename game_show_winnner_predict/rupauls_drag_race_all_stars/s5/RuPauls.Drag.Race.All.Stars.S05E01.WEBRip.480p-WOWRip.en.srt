1
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,207
RuPaul: In 2016,

2
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,243
RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars

3
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:21,645
changed the rules forever.

4
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:25,983
I will not be eliminating
any queens this season.

5
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,518
Bitch, what?

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,953
Each week,
the top two All Stars

7
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:33,023
will lip sync for their legacy.

8
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,459
The winner of the lip sync
will be given the power

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,932
to eliminate
one of the bottom queens.

10
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:45,502
RuPaul: With great power
comes great responsibility.

11
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:51,308
It's a new decade,
a new season,

12
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,110
with new rules.

13
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:54,278
We're going to do eliminations

14
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,046
a little differently
this season.

15
00:00:56,047 --> 00:01:00,417
You never know what or who
fate may throw your way.

16
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:03,320
Ru-veal yourself!

17
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,857
The Ru-volution starts now!

18
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:14,031
I'm bla-ack.

19
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,335
I'm Shea Couleé.

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,771
I know y'all have missed me,
but it's all okay.

21
00:01:20,772 --> 00:01:22,706
Wow, Ru.

22
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,675
Love what
you've done with the place.

23
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:26,810
She's a great dancer.

24
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:29,279
She's a great entertainer.
She's a great actress.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,882
Oh! 23 skiddoo.

26
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,984
I won four challenges
on Season 9.

27
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:35,519
Vote, bitch.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,522
I felt really confident
that I had it in the bag.

29
00:01:38,523 --> 00:01:41,091
This was my spot on Season 9.

30
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,726
Feels kind of lucky.

31
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,094
I was really confident.

32
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:49,266
But as those rose petals fell

33
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,668
at the Season 9 finale,

34
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:53,670
it was like watching my dreams

35
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,772
just fall right out of my hands.

36
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:58,375
I felt like
such a disappointment.

37
00:01:58,376 --> 00:02:01,078
RuPaul: I'm sorry, my dear.
This is not your time.

38
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,615
Mine. This time, I came to win.

39
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:07,484
Season 9 was a taste.

40
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:08,719
That was the amuse-bouches.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,387
We're about
to get into the entree.

42
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:12,255
We might even get
a little dessert.

43
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,557
You're about to get served.

44
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:22,165
Infraction!

45
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,267
[laughs]

46
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,269
Guess who's
cracking the house, girl?

47
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,504
My name is Miz Cracker.

48
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,873
I am 35...

49
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:31,408
pounds heavier
than I was in Season 10.

50
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,077
Miz Cracker, you're nasty.

51
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:36,480
And I'm disgusting.
[all laugh]

52
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:38,482
Is there a hole
in the bottom of that box?

53
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,017
Absolutely.

54
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:43,320
The first time around
I did well,

55
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,590
but I was so worried about
being absolutely perfect...

56
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:47,691
Cracker, you did it
perfect once.

57
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,759
You can do it
that way again.

58
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,496
I fucked myself.

59
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,331
You'll never be good enough.

60
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:55,866
She's too interested

61
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:58,168
in trying to control
how we see her.

62
00:02:58,169 --> 00:02:59,336
It's, like, let it
all hang out, bitch.

63
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:02,806
Look at this woman!

64
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,376
So this time I'm just
gonna let things flow

65
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:08,211
from my distorted brain.

66
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:10,247
We've been trying
to get together and do a thing.

67
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:12,149
Yes. Yeah, we're doing
the biggest of things.

68
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,985
Shea Couleé is talented,
beautiful, funny,

69
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,121
and the worst thing is
she is a great person.

70
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,290
I hate her.

71
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,125
I thought they were gonna save
the best for last,

72
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,827
and I was the opposite of right.

73
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,195
[laughs]

74
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,902
Boricua in the house
to take the crown.

75
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,670
Sickening, no?

76
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,672
I'm Alexis Mateo
from Season 3

77
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,007
and All Stars 1.

78
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,242
Bam! Bam! Bam!

79
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:40,410
-Bam!
-Bam!

80
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,411
Bam.

81
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,581
I'm a fucking drag queen.

82
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:48,051
Michelle: Every time I
counted you out, you shut me up.

83
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:50,987
I am a well-rounded entertainer.

84
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:53,223
I can sing, I can dance,
I can act,

85
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:55,358
and I'm fucking Puerto Rican,
bitch.

86
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,427
Just like the movie Gremlins,

87
00:03:57,428 --> 00:04:00,230
I got wet one day
and had a drag baby

88
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:03,133
named Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

89
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:06,236
You know, when you have somebody
that is that gorgeous

90
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:08,872
and that messy,
you know it's my daughter.

91
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,441
Appreciate you.
Cut the check later, bitch.

92
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:12,776
You're welcome.

93
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,578
Coming into this competition,

94
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,180
I'm older and wiser
and stronger than ever.

95
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:20,984
It's Alexis world, and the rest
is fucking parking.

96
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,186
Feathers, feathers, feathers.

97
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,588
-Put them in a zoo.
-Exactly.

98
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,223
-I am molting today, girl.
-It's pretty.

99
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,391
[laughs]

100
00:04:30,427 --> 00:04:33,497
Well, I do declare.

101
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:36,600
Blair St. Clair
is all grownup now...

102
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:38,001
bitches.

103
00:04:38,002 --> 00:04:39,770
[all laugh]

104
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:41,404
I'm Blair St. Clair
from Season 10,

105
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:42,873
and I've finally
gone through puberty.

106
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,809
Well, almost.

107
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,211
You look really young.

108
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:49,212
-Bitch!
-Bitch!

109
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:50,981
Season 10 was terrifying.

110
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:53,316
It's actually been really hard
being here without my mom.

111
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:55,185
I think I was really
hiding who I was

112
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:56,820
because I wanted everyone
to like me.

113
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,021
Blair, hold on, Blair.
You okay?

114
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:59,656
I'm good. I'm happy.
I'm good.

115
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,726
Today I see myself
as a strong bitch.

116
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,694
She's always looking wet.

117
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,830
That's what your man said
last night.

118
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:07,831
[all laugh]

119
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:09,232
Strong, independent bitch.

120
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,401
And people needs to remember
that and watch out for that,

121
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:12,536
'cause I wanna win.

122
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:13,837
My drag's changed a lot,

123
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,405
and I think some people
are gonna be a little shocked.

124
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:17,474
But that's what I'm here to do.
I'm here to shock 'em.

125
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:20,043
-Yes.
-Uh-huh.

126
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:21,478
Blair St. Clair came out

127
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,381
with some good air
under her booty, baby.

128
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:27,284
Why you so cocky, girl?

129
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,486
She will crack
under pressure, though.

130
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,126
In a room full of 10s,

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,295
I'm always grand prize.

132
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:40,764
She's here to save the day.

133
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:44,201
I'm Mariah Balenciaga,
AKA Mariah Paris,

134
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:47,037
AKA Mariah Successful,

135
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,106
AKA Miss Queen
of All Stars Season 5.

136
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:53,109
Prepare to gag on my eleganza.

137
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,311
Aah!

138
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,546
We are the ones
who are innovators

139
00:05:56,547 --> 00:06:00,383
and the driving force
behind progress in humanity.

140
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:01,651
She has a beautiful face.

141
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,753
Season 3, I got
"You're poised,

142
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,822
you're beautiful,
you're elegant."

143
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,725
But my downfall
was my Snatch Game.

144
00:06:08,726 --> 00:06:10,493
That is not a wire hanger.

145
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,862
It's a wooden hanger.

146
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:12,929
It's too much.

147
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,632
Give me my pocketbook.
I'm leaving.

148
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:18,468
And it's taken me
almost 10 years

149
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:22,572
to refine my stage presence
and get back here.

150
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,207
And they're not
gonna goop me on this one.

151
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,675
Not this pageant.

152
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,210
Good to see you.
You look stunning.

153
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,945
I want to eat you
like a palm tree.

154
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,914
[all laugh]

155
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,651
Oh.

156
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:38,521
-I'm curious.
-More and more sparkles.

157
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:42,025
-Oh!
-Oh.

158
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,760
India 2.0 here.

159
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,631
Remodeled, remastered,
and ready for action.

160
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,132
Surprise, bitches.

161
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,166
♪ It's me ♪

162
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:53,203
India Ferrah
from Season 3.

163
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,404
Aow!

164
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:57,941
There is
a "hell, no" storm, okay?

165
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:00,810
On Season 3, I couldn't
break through my shyness.

166
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,178
Prison, honey.

167
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:04,648
I'm still waiting for your
personality to come through.

168
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:07,083
Sadly, one of the only things
I'm known for

169
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:09,619
is being picked up
by Mimi on first.

170
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,087
Get her off of me!

171
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:15,025
Drag is not a contact sport.

172
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,694
But there's so much more to me,

173
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:18,928
and I'm ready to show it.

174
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,196
Season 3 in the house.

175
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,698
Season 3, bitch.

176
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,333
Oh, look at this.

177
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:25,769
-We're a set.
-[laughs]

178
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,604
Same colors.

179
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:29,839
Ooh, is this a rerun
of Season 3?

180
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:35,145
Cue western music. [laughs]

181
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:36,146
[imitates gunshots]

182
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,480
She's nuts.

183
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:39,516
-Girl, I'm gonna need that.
-I'll trade you, bitch.

184
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:41,651
Of course,
I'll have to have it taken in.

185
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,386
I'll be absolutely
swimming in it.

186
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,722
[all laugh]

187
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:51,194
I'm Jujubee from Season 2
of RuPaul's Drag Race

188
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:54,364
and Season 1 of All Stars.

189
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:56,399
Third time's the charm.

190
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,102
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

191
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,304
Come on, Grandma Barbie.

192
00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,873
[all laugh]

193
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:07,277
I have never been blown
like that in my life.

194
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,814
Miss Jujubee,
you give good mouth.

195
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:12,415
Fuck you.

196
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,385
Tyra, was your barbecue
canceled?

197
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,520
Your grill is fucked.

198
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:19,022
[all laugh]

199
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:21,558
I made it to top three twice.

200
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:24,094
It is time to take the crown.

201
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:25,428
Why not Jujubee?

202
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:27,030
Give me the crown, RuPaul.

203
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,531
Can I have the crown?

204
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:30,200
Please.

205
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,237
Okay, I am so dressed
for all of your funerals,

206
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,271
'cause I'm gonna kill you all.

207
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:37,273
[all laugh]

208
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:38,308
Get ready, baby.

209
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,243
You've aged so well.

210
00:08:40,244 --> 00:08:42,579
Oh, like cheese.

211
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,948
Miss Jujubee
has stepped her pussy up.

212
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:48,418
This is like
I am the pussy staircase.

213
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,453
[laughs]

214
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,055
You know what's kind of funny.

215
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:54,057
It's like if we ink
in a printer,

216
00:08:54,058 --> 00:08:56,626
like, it runs out
by the time it gets...

217
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,362
[all laugh]

218
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:04,067
Whoo!

219
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,235
Oh.

220
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,838
Whoo!

221
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,774
Ooh, I did it again.

222
00:09:10,775 --> 00:09:12,675
Whoo!

223
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,878
I'm Derrick Barry
and I'm from Season 8.

224
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,446
It's Derrick, Bitch.
You know me.

225
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:18,181
-Hey, Derrick.
-[laughs]

226
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,582
When I first came to Drag Race,

227
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,786
I was focused on being the best
Britney Spears impersonator

228
00:09:22,787 --> 00:09:23,887
in the world.

229
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:24,921
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yeah.

230
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:27,791
I got so used to doing one thing

231
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,326
that I really struggled
to show people

232
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,361
what else I can do.

233
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,663
I put myself in a Britney box,

234
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,699
and I'm doing my best
to get out of that.

235
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,136
Since my season,
I've taken my drag

236
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:42,572
to a whole new realm.

237
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:45,208
And now I'm coming back

238
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,043
to show
I don't just do Britney.

239
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,312
There's also
this other part of me

240
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,648
that does all these other
amazing things.

241
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,183
-Hi.
-Hi.

242
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:55,218
-Hi, gorg.
-How are you?

243
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,553
What's going on?

244
00:09:57,954 --> 00:09:59,522
-Hi.
-Hey, girl.

245
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:01,825
There's only one queen
I don't get along with,

246
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:02,926
and it's India Ferrah.

247
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,928
She has got me, girl.

248
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,598
India has these online rants
that are negative.

249
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,933
She's toxic.

250
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:12,135
Maybe she's all good
with giving fake hugs,

251
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:15,605
but I really don't have
much to say to her.

252
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:22,112
I didn't come to crash a party.

253
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:23,713
I came to end it.

254
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:26,449
[cheers and applause]

255
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,184
I am Mayhem "The Drama" Miller.

256
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:29,686
from RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 10.

257
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:33,256
I think you look adorable.

258
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,891
I'm gagging over your look.

259
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:36,326
I started off strong.

260
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:38,228
The creativity
is off the charts.

261
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:39,596
I won the first challenge,

262
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,831
and then it kind of
just kind of went like this.

263
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:42,999
[laughs]

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,868
When I was here for Season 10,

265
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:46,102
I did not push myself

266
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,639
to the level of greatness
that I know I have.

267
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,707
I played it safe.

268
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,442
Did you say something
to your team?

269
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,578
No, because I wanted
to be a team player.

270
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:57,247
-Hi.
-Hello.

271
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:58,681
Season 10's in the house.

272
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,416
This time around,
I just can't hold back.

273
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,485
I wanna make believers
out of the non-believers

274
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:04,954
and show exactly
why she got the call.

275
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,324
You smell rich.

276
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:10,293
Thank you. I farted.

277
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,728

[rustling]

279
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:13,863
I hear something.

280
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,164
Dragging something?

281
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,501
-Oh.
-Oh.

282
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:21,604
So y'all thought
I'd never get here.

283
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:23,873
Sorry. I was stuck in traffique.

284
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,375
My name is Ongina.

285
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:27,877
I'm from the very first season
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

286
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:29,012
You look good.

287
00:11:29,013 --> 00:11:32,148
The one that started
this whole shenanigans.

288
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,984
-Ongina.
-Hi-ee.

289
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,654
Oh. Ooh, this ain't
no truck stop, honey.

290
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,023
My name is Connie Chung.

291
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,991
Because life is a celebration.

292
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,494
You're the winner
of this challenge.

293
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,362
[sobs]

294
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:48,698
Somebody said All Stars 5?

295
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,800
-Yes!
-Yes!

296
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,836
I'm finally on All Stars, bitch.

297
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:55,905
I'm so excited. [laughs]

298
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:57,607
But I'm super nervous

299
00:11:57,608 --> 00:11:59,809
because everything
literally has changed.

300
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,311
But I have been changing
as well,

301
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:04,047
and I'm excited to show everyone
my 10 year glow-up.

302
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,549
So here it is and enjoy.

303
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,585
You're welcome.

304
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:09,652
Ow! My eye!

305
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:10,954
Oh, my God. Sorry.

306
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:14,457
Sorry. I mean, at least
somebody fucking tried.

307
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,892
[all laugh]

308
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:17,927
Ongina is a Drag Race legend.

309
00:12:17,928 --> 00:12:19,662
Point blank, period.

310
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,164
Here's the T.

311
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:22,732
I hope y'all don't think

312
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:24,233
that we're just here
to play around.

313
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:25,435
Oh, I don't think so.

314
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,837
No. I believe
you guys might bring it.

315
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:29,172
Uh-oh.

316
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:31,140
-Oh.
-You already started?

317
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,809
I mean--look.

318
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,611
You know
I like to shoot quickly.

319
00:12:34,612 --> 00:12:37,113
You were also quick to finish
on your season, though.

320
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:38,748
Oh.

321
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,617
[all laugh]

322
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:41,818

324
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,289
Look who's here.

325
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,924
Yay!

326
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,193
Welcome home.

327
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,962
[cheers and applause]

328
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:57,233
[imitating an old woman]
My girls are all grown up.

329
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:01,604
Now, to earn your place
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame,

330
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:05,074
you need to do more
than just win challenges.

331
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,777
You need to win over your peers

332
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:11,814
or do whatever it takes
to outsmart them.

333
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:19,455
And this season, we're doing
things a little differently.

334
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:25,495
It's a new game
with new rules.

335
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:28,898
What's the gag, girl?

336
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,633
I've seen the show.
I know it's coming.

337
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:33,336
Oh, yes, honey,
the shit got heavy.

00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,805
-Fuck!

341
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:43,146
Wow.

342
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:44,580
Oh, there's a gag?

Everybody gets a vote?

Everybody?

362
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:38,367
We are in the upside down now.

363
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:39,902
-Wow, Ru.
-That's right, baby.

364
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,105
You all have the power,

365
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:44,507
and that's why we call it
a Ru-mocracy.

366
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,409
Oh.

367
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,678
-Okay.
-I see what you did.

368
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,880
But more on that later.

[evil laugh]

370
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,185
I have so many questions.

371
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,422
Now for your first
All Star mini-challenge,

372
00:14:59,423 --> 00:15:01,958

♪ Oh, Pit Crew ♪

376
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,066
Is it this way?

[cheering]
Oh, my God.

378
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:13,603
What?

00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:14,937
What, what, what?

380
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:20,009
Ladies, give
a big Drag Race welcome

Oh, my God. [laughs]

385
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:33,523
Now, Ricky, have you ever
read a queen before?

386
00:15:33,524 --> 00:15:35,124
No, but I would like to try.

387
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,759
Good.
Well, you can try on me.

388
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,195

Hmm.

I have no idea
what he just said,

394
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:58,014
but I didn't like
the sound of it.

395
00:15:58,015 --> 00:15:59,582
-You know what?
-What?

396
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,984
-You know what?
-What?

today's lesson

Now, Queens,

of Paris Is Burning.

409
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:30,279
it's time
for some serious reading.

410
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,848
Because reading is what?

411
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:33,349
-Fundamental.
-Fundamental.

412
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,717
That's right.

413
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:37,420
All right, first queen up,
Alexis Mateo.

There you go, mama.

417
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:44,660
Take these glasses
from Marek & Richard

418
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,128
and assume the position.

419
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:48,531
Ooh, these glasses
make you all look ugly.

420
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:51,033
Oh, it's not the glasses.

00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:55,271
Jujubee, I can't wait to see

00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:58,274
your clearance retail store
collection you brought.

424
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,076
-Ooh.
-Oh.

425
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:02,778
Blair St. Clair,
Bitch, you look hungry.

426
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:03,913
Eat a burger.

427
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,115
Girl, whatever weight I lost,
you found.

Well, look at you, papi.

Hey, mama, here you go.

431
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,856
Oh, my dear friend
Derrick Barry.

432
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,959
You are a Las Vegas showgirl.

433
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,495
And you're also
a lost Vegas showgirl.

434
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,397
'Cause why the hell
are you here?

Ongina.

437
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,736
I can't to put you
on top of my Christmas tree.

438
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:28,037
Hee hee hee.

439
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:29,105
-Mayhem Miller.
-Yes?

440
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:30,573
I think maybe you should

441
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:33,209
switch out the Miller
for Coors Light.

442
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,211
India Ferrah.

443
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:37,880
This shade is all real.

444
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:40,249
It's no wonder
you work in a place

445
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,550
called Piranha in Las Vegas

446
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:42,785
because with those teeth,

447
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:44,387
you're a walking billboard
for them.

448
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:46,422
[all laugh]

449
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,758
And also, I'm really surprised
to see you,

450
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,960
because I thought
you had retired,

451
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:52,662
and now I just see
that you're tired.

452

00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:58,501
Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

454
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:00,469
Great. You're here,
so we have to change the name

455
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,772
to RuPaul's Drag Race
Some Stars.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,314

Alexis Mateo.

463
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:18,354
I don't wanna be shady,

464
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:20,456
so I'm not gonna
bring up your weight.

465
00:18:20,457 --> 00:18:22,758
But when you work,
do they pay you in pounds?

466
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:25,328

467
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:30,666

Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

469
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,304
You look like what would happen

470
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:37,473
if Will Smith
absorbed Jada Pinkett.

00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:42,445
Thank you so much

474
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,313
for taking time
out of your busy schedule

475
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,881
of auditioning for All Stars

476
00:18:45,882 --> 00:18:48,150
to finally join us
on All Stars.

477
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:49,685
Wow.

India Ferrah.

479
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:54,724
I' not gonna read you 'cause
I'd never kick a man...

00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,027
While he's down.

482
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,596
Okay, Blair St. Clair.

483
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,098
-You know me.
-Mm-hmm.

484
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,265
I don't read somebody

485
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:06,302
unless I have
a genuine respect for them.

486
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:07,670
So I think we're done here.

[all laugh]

488
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:12,408
Oh, Miz Cracker,
you remind me of my childhood

489
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:13,843

Why so emotional, baby?

Every time I look at your face,

I'm always reminded
it's 5:00 somewhere.

-Oh!
-Oh!

498
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,328
Derrick Barry.

499
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:34,664
You give us Britney
like it's always 2008.

500
00:19:34,665 --> 00:19:37,033
Now, Ru, can we
go ahead and open the door

501
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:38,868
and #FreeBritney?

502
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:41,370
[all laugh]

503
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:44,607
Shea Couleé, you always say
that you've come to slay.

504
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,642
How hard are you
gonna slay this season?

505
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,578
Is that a question
or a read?

506
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:50,980
No, it's a read.

507
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,381
I'm trying my best, you guys.

508
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:53,616
Alexis Mateo.

509
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:56,218
You actually have
a really good chance

510
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:57,720
of winning this competition

511
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,855
because they've never had
a Puerto Rican

512
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,357
or a big girl winner.

513
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:02,358
Right.

514
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,692
Yeah.

00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,197
Okay, the crickets
aren't even laughing.

517
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:10,666
Derrick Barry. You know,
the girls in your season

518
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,535
said you weren't
a real drag queen

519
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:14,737
because you couldn't paint
and you could only do Britney,

520
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,472
but I completely disagree.

521
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:18,507
I don't really think
you can do Britney.

523
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:23,946
Mariah, girl I love you,

524
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:25,047
but your career
only has movement

525
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:27,183
because the earth
has to spin on its axis.

[all laugh]

527
00:20:30,387 --> 00:20:32,955
And India Ferrah.

Oh, I'm pausing so
we can all Google who you are.

00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,310
Would you please
tell the ladies who won?

535

So we have a tie.

-What?
-We do.

537
00:20:56,813 --> 00:21:00,549
We've got a tie

-Oh!
-Oh!

539
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,018

[cheering]

541
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,122
Wow!

542
00:21:06,123 --> 00:21:07,556
Con-drag-ulations.

543
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,893
You've each won
a $2.000 gift card

544
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,162
from Marek & Richard.

545
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:14,797
[cheers and applause]

546
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,901

548
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,339
Now, ladies, since 2017,

549
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,107
the Werq The World tour

550
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:28,043
has starred legends
like Aquaria,

551
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:29,712
Bob the Drag Queen,

552
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:30,880
and Violet Chachki,

553
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,148
just to name a few.

554
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:34,116
For this week's maxi-challenge,

555
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:36,318
you'll be headlining

556
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,954
in the Werq The World
variety extravaganza

557
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,456
with an act

558
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:43,993
showcasing your own charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

559
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,861
And for those of you at home,

560
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:48,931
you can go to
RuPaulsDragRace.com

561
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,867
to find out when the tour
is coming to your city.

562
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:55,037
All Stars, start your engines...

563
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,541
...and may the best woman win.

564
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,042
Come on, Ricky.

565
00:22:00,043 --> 00:22:01,610
-Thank you.
-See you later.

566
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,112
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

567
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,714
-Bye.
-Bye-ee.

568
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,083
Oh, my God.

569
00:22:08,084 --> 00:22:10,352
I already claimed my space.

570
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:12,321
Oh, my God, it's heavy.

571
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:13,355
Look what I'm doing,
Miz Cracker.

572
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:14,657
I'm taking both of ours over.

573
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:16,125
-Oh, my goodness.
-See?

574
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:20,062
I'll surely save you
if you're in the bottom.

575
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:24,333
Mariah, I found your size.

576
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:26,802
These are a 15.

577
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,637
So how you feeling
about this new twist

578
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,738
where we're all voting?

579
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,473
Like, is this
going by friendship

580
00:22:31,474 --> 00:22:33,042
or who likes who?

581
00:22:33,043 --> 00:22:35,477
But what is the lip sync
situation?

582
00:22:35,478 --> 00:22:37,046
That what I want to know.

583
00:22:37,047 --> 00:22:39,648
Like, will we still be
lip syncing for our legacy

584
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,749
and then like--

585
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,384
There's something missing
in here,

586
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:44,220
and I know Mama Ru
has something--

587
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:46,088
She cooking something, girl.

588
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,189
We've been doing the math,

589
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,991
and suddenly
it's not adding up.

590
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,859
[laughs] For real.

591
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,795
I'm gonna play it really fairly,

592
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:54,630
unless someone is, like,
being mean to me. Just kidding.

593
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,665
I mean, clearly me and Derrick
do not get along.

594
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,234
You don't?

595
00:22:58,235 --> 00:22:59,902
Mmm, juicy T.

596
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:01,337
I don't deal with fake people,

597
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,272
and that is--I can't.

598
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:05,774
I feel like
they're talking about us.

599
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:08,277
When I quit performing
at Piranha,

600
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:10,679
they hired Nebraska,
Derrick's boyfriend,

601
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,716
and she did a number
dedicated towards me

602
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:17,920
showing a lot of negative,
hateful bullshit.

603
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:19,288
What y'all talking about?

604
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:21,991
That me and Derrick do not
speak to each other at all.

605
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:23,525
Holy...

606
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,827
Derrick Barry.

607
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:26,595
Oh, so it's gonna be
some shit.

608
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:28,764
This is day one,

609
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:32,034
and the girls brought the beef
to this salad, baby.

610
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,169
Welcome to All Stars, people.

611
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,138
It's crazy, right?

612
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:38,607
Girl, the gag is real.end act

613
00:23:42,778 --> 00:23:44,680
-This is it, bitch.
-Bitch.

614

Mm, mm, mm.

615
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,483
-Derrick.
-Yeah?

616
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:48,684
What are you doing for talent?

617
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:50,619
Like, 15 impersonations
in a minute.

618
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,087
-Can you do that?
-Well, I hope so.

619
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:53,455
It's my talent I hope.

620
00:23:53,456 --> 00:23:55,190
I guess you're
talented enough to do it.

621
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,959
Just kidding.

622
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,927
We're getting ready
for our first maxi-challenge.

623
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:00,863
It's the Werq The World
talent show.

624
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:02,197
This is gonna be fun.

625
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:04,300
There's a lot of pressure
to show the judges

626
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:06,468
how much we've evolved.

627
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:07,770
Can you do me?

628
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:08,771
[imitating Ongina]
Can you do me?

629
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:11,240
[both laugh]

630
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,474
I'm scared about All Stars.

631
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:14,443
I am. I'm, like, nervous

632
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:16,612
because I haven't been
in this werkroom

633
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:18,747
for, like, 11 years,

634
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,583
and the competition
has gotten tougher.

635
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,118
Like, sometimes I sit there
and I watch it,

636
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,654
and I'm, like,
could I do that challenge?

637
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:28,090
Tell me about
this India Ferrah stuff.

638
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,124
Oh, why?

639
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,259
I just wanna know.

640
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,493
I'm such a gossip.

641
00:24:31,494 --> 00:24:32,695
I literally
just found out over there,

642
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:34,463
so I'm asking you about it.

643
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:35,464
I'm not surprised that India

644
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:37,533
can't keep my name
out of her mouth

645
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:40,569
because obviously
she's obsessed.

646
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,237
So are you guys not friends?

647
00:24:42,238 --> 00:24:43,572
I have her blocked
on everything.

648
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:46,208
She comes for girls
in every single season.

649
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,543
-She does?
-Mm-hmm.

650
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:48,844
Ooh, let me go ask
if she's come for me.

651
00:24:48,845 --> 00:24:51,313
-Nobody comes for you.
-Nobody comes for her.

652
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:52,314
No, literally.

653
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:54,183
You guys are mean.

654
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:56,218
I wanna be Regina George.

-We are the Mean Girls?
-We are.

657
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,759
What are y'all doing
for your talents?

658
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,361
Or are y'all trying to keep it
fucking top secret?

659
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:08,864
I'm doing the second version
of the reading challenge.

660
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:11,734
I thought I'd extend it
because I was so funny.

661
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:14,336
Yes.
[all laugh]

662
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:15,971
Well, Derrick was the one
that went in.

663
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,440
Ooh!

664
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,842
Do you guys both
live in Vegas right now?

665
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:20,843
Yeah.

666
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:21,910
Oh, so you work together a lot?

667
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,178
-I never work with her.
-Oh.

668
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:27,249
Girl, there is beef
between India and Derrick,

669
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,551
and everyone is eating it.

670
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:30,853
It is a brisket.

671
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:32,354
We are here for the pot luck.

672
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,390
Wait, so what's
the original beef?

673
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,091
I love this.

674
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:37,993
India got fired from Piranha.

675
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,028
I quit Piranha.

676
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,896
If you quit,
why do you need to say

677
00:25:40,897 --> 00:25:43,432
"this establishment
will hire anybody now?"

678
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:45,267
And it did.

679
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:47,503
You can't just be happy
for people.

680
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,539
If you quit, someone else
needs to get the job.

681
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,274
Why would I be happy for someone
that does a number

682
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:54,510
that disrespects me
and puts my name in it?

683
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,412
Why would I wanna
be happy for her?

684
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,046
That was after
you called her a pig in a wig.

685
00:25:58,047 --> 00:25:59,548
It was not to her.

686
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:01,216
Like, girl, she is a stick.

687
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:03,552
She is not a pig in a wig.
It was not to her.

688
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,288
You're two-faced, and I don't
fuck with two-faced people.

689
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,425
But you know what, India?

690
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:10,592
I think you being here

691
00:26:10,593 --> 00:26:13,395
is going to make you feel
more validated,

692
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:15,898
and I think that maybe
that's what you needed.

693
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:18,000
And so I'm happy
that you're here.

694
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:19,535
[laughs] Oh, my God.

695
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,804

Blocked.

697
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,975
Whatever you're saying
is bouncing right back to you,

698
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,011
and that's gonna hurt you
in the long run.

894
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:12,994
No, I'm just kidding.

895
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,963
So before I did All Stars,

896
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,298
I wanted to call some celebrity
friends for some advice.

897
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:19,267
So here's a little rundown.

898
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,770
Lady Bunny.
You'd better make top two,

899
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:24,672
otherwise you're just
a bottom to two boyfriends.

900
00:36:24,673 --> 00:36:26,074
[laughs]

901
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:29,477
Kaitlyn. So I have
some dresses of Chris's

902
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,513
if you need to borrow any.

903
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:34,816
Madonna. Wearing a kimono
is a no-go.

904
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,019
Tell Michelle Visage
that she's not me, but ask her

905
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,189
if she wants to adopt
or borrow a baby from Malawi.

906
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,958
Cher. You called me
after Madonna?

907
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,627
Fuck you!

908
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:51,232
Miley. Oh, my God,
my dad is gonna pitch a tent.

909
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:56,137
Celine. I think
you should go for it! Whoo!

910
00:36:56,138 --> 00:37:01,076
Cynthia. Show them
your cuckoo mis amores.

911
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:03,344
Laganja.
Yes, God, honey money,

912
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:05,346
the house down boots, okurrr?

913
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:07,082
[laughter and applause]

914
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,084
Thank you guys so much.
Have a good night!

915
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:16,024
I want to like Derrick's
so badly.

916
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,793
Wait, I did forget one.

917
00:37:18,794 --> 00:37:20,195
I also called Joan Rivers,

918
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,330
and she said,
"I didn't say anything.

919
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:25,934
I am dead,
you fucking moron. Ahh!"

920
00:37:25,935 --> 00:37:27,736
[laughter and applause]

921
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,841
Thank you!

Ladies and gentlemen,
the rules are very simple.

941
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,523
No lifting, no touching,
no holding, no moving.

942
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:58,760
Do not disturb the queen that
you see before your very eyes.

943
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,528
So listen up.

944

963
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:58,353
RuPaul: Welcome, ladies.

964
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,454
Hi.

965
00:39:59,455 --> 00:40:01,322
From this moment on,

966
00:40:01,323 --> 00:40:05,526
All Star rules
have been suspended...

967
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:06,895
forever!

968
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:10,064
-Bitch.
-What?

969
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:11,699
That's right,
we're gonna do eliminations

970
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,635
a little differently this
season.

971
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:16,738
Each week I'll choose
one top All Star,

972
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:18,339
not two.

973
00:40:19,874 --> 00:40:22,677
In the werkroom,
the top All Star

974
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:25,413
will secretly
choose the lipstick

975
00:40:25,414 --> 00:40:29,250
of the bottom queen
she thinks should go home.

976
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:32,920
And all of the rest of you
will cast your vote

977
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:36,257
for the bottom queen
you think should get the chop.

978
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,460
Oh, my God.

979
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:42,764
And yes, the top
All Star of the week

980
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:44,766
will lip sync for her legacy,

981
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:48,770
but she'll be
competing against...

982
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:51,939
[echoing]
a secret lip sync assassin.

983
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,141
Oh, my God.

984
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:54,342
-Oh.
-What?

985
00:40:54,343 --> 00:40:57,845
If the top All Star
wins the lip sync,

986
00:40:57,846 --> 00:41:01,049
the bottom queen she chose
will get the chop.

987
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,618
Now, if the lip sync assassin
wins,

988
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,820
she will reveal the lipstick

989
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:09,824
of the queen that the group
has voted to go home.

990
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:14,529
Miss Thing,
if I'd had lenses in these,

991
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,664
they would have popped out,
bitch.

992
00:41:16,665 --> 00:41:20,802
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward.

993
00:41:20,803 --> 00:41:21,869
Shea Couleé.

994
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:24,572
Blair St. Clair.

995
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:29,711
Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

996
00:41:29,712 --> 00:41:31,779
Jujubee.

997
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,451
You are all safe.

998
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,421
-Can I say something?
-Yes, please.

999
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:43,725
Mariah, your performance
had a very beautiful message,

1000
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:45,059
and the fact that
you brought that message

1001
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,694
I think is very important.

1002
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:48,763
So for that, I really thank you.

1003
00:41:48,764 --> 00:41:50,331
Thank you.

1004
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:51,899
Yeah.

1005
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,636
Safe queens may leave the stage.

1006
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:00,842
Ladies, you represent

1007
00:42:00,843 --> 00:42:03,745
the tops and bottoms
of the week.

1008
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:07,015
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1009
00:42:07,016 --> 00:42:08,516
starting with Miz Cracker.

1010
00:42:08,517 --> 00:42:09,851
Hello.

1011
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:11,819
It was really fun,
it was really funny.

1012
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,888
You stuck with
your pickle theme,

1013
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:15,490
and I thought your act
was hilarious.

1014
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,591
You're the real dill.

1015
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:20,294
That phallic entrance
was everything.

1016
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:21,996
I mean, you're talking
about pickles,

1017
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,365
I just saw a beautiful
phallic shape walking on stage,

1018
00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:25,366
and I loved it.

1019
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:26,367
That's funny, Ricky.

1020
00:42:26,368 --> 00:42:28,369
We think that
when we see you.

1021
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,338
[all laugh]

1022
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,241
You've created for yourself
this little lane

1023
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:35,376
that is so identifiable
with Cracker.

1024
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:37,645
And then you reveal
this glamour.

1025
00:42:37,646 --> 00:42:39,947
This is stu-un-ni-ing-uh.

1026
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:41,916
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Cracker.

1027
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,518
Shabbat shablam.

1028
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,153
Shabbat shablam, Ru.

1029
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:48,022
Up next, Alexis Mateo.

1030
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,223
Hi-ee.

1031
00:42:49,224 --> 00:42:51,259
I was blown away
by your performance tonight.

1032
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,260
Oh, thank you.

1033
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:54,162
I never wanted it to end.

1034
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:55,596
You were having so much fun.

1035
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:57,331
Everybody wanted
to party with you.

1036
00:42:57,332 --> 00:42:59,567
When you were on stage,
you were not alone.

1037
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:01,536
It was you
and all your ancestors,

1038
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,438
and I appreciated that.

1039
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:06,541
I'll even forgive that one-inch
heel that you have on your foot.

1040
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,477
Hey, you gonna like them,
goddamn it.

1041
00:43:09,478 --> 00:43:10,745
I stoned them for you.

1042
00:43:10,746 --> 00:43:13,514
[all laugh]

1043
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:16,350
Thanks, you guys.

1044
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,152
Up next, India Ferrah.

1045
00:43:18,153 --> 00:43:22,156
You know, India, it was good
to see you in particular here,

1046
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:24,091
because I know
that after your season

1047
00:43:24,092 --> 00:43:27,228
you had a very public break-up
with the art of drag.

1048
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,297
Yes. Drag stopped being fun
for a minute

1049
00:43:29,298 --> 00:43:31,399
because I let it get to me,

1050
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,570
and I took anger
and put it on the Internet

1051
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,538
and put it on social media,

1052
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:39,674
and I went into
a very deep, dark hole.

1053
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:41,943
Luckily, I was strong enough
to pull myself out,

1054
00:43:41,944 --> 00:43:44,946
and I'm in a much better place.

1055
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:46,247
You performed tonight

1056
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,182
like somebody
who has something to prove,

1057
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:50,885
and I loved it.

1058
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:52,420
I have one word for you.

1059
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,355
-Yes?
-Hairography.

1060
00:43:54,356 --> 00:43:56,591
-Yes!
-Ahh!

1061
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,392
-That was--
-Here, I'll get that for you.

1062
00:43:58,393 --> 00:44:00,761
-Aah!
-There you go.

1063
00:44:00,762 --> 00:44:02,063
-Explosive, baby.
-Thank you.

1064
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:03,197
Explosive.

1065
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:05,166
You killed every second
of this performance.

1066
00:44:05,167 --> 00:44:07,235
I thought it was nearly perfect.

1067
00:44:07,236 --> 00:44:08,469
Thank you.

1068
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:11,372
All right, up next,
Derrick Barry.

1069
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:13,107
I want to compliment you first

1070
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:16,444
on not coming out here
and just relying on Britney.

1071
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,645
Hey.

1072
00:44:17,646 --> 00:44:20,414
-However...
-Oh.

1073
00:44:20,415 --> 00:44:22,183
The impersonations
were not great.

1074
00:44:22,184 --> 00:44:25,520
If you did not tell us who
they were before you did them,

1075
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:27,488
I might have gotten maybe two.

1076
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:30,124
My advice, if you separate
a little bit

1077
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,726
between character and character,

1078
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:33,261
it would probably allow us

1079
00:44:33,262 --> 00:44:34,729
to kind of grasp
a little bit better.

1080
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,964
Here's what I would love
to get from you.

1081
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:39,133
Rather than
an impression of Britney

1082
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,470
or an impression
of 13, 14 other celebrities,

1083
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,539
I would just love
to get Derrick Barry.

1084
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,007
Who are you?

1085
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:47,742
What do you have to say?

1086
00:44:50,645 --> 00:44:53,381
All right,
up next, Mayhem Miller.

1087
00:44:53,382 --> 00:44:55,016
Let's talk about your diction.

1088
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:56,817
[laughs]

1089
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:59,754
I couldn't really understand
the words to the song,

1090
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:00,855
and if you can't hear
what you're saying,

1091
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:02,623
I'm losing the story.

1092
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:04,258
Okay.

1093
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:07,361
The entrance was very powerful,
and then it didn't take me

1094
00:45:07,362 --> 00:45:10,364
to where I thought
you were going to take us.

1095
00:45:10,365 --> 00:45:12,567
I was so excited
about where it was gonna go,

1096
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:13,935
and then when it went there,
I thought, oh,

1097
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:15,636
can we go back
to where we were?

1098
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:18,773
Up next, Ongina.

1099
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:20,241
Hi-ee.

1100
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:21,976
I love that you had
a whole production number

1101
00:45:21,977 --> 00:45:24,345
in the Drag Race theme,
and it was cute.

1102
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:27,615
It kind of didn't go anywhere
after you had two reveals.

1103
00:45:27,616 --> 00:45:28,616
You're kind of
just left there, like, okay,

1104
00:45:28,617 --> 00:45:30,084
I guess I'll just dance now.

1105
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:31,385
It stalled a little bit.

1106
00:45:31,386 --> 00:45:33,621
I just got super nervous
for some reason,

1107
00:45:33,622 --> 00:45:36,691
and that's really crazy,
because I perform.

1108
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,125
Like, I love performing.

1109
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:41,195
I know what kind of show
you can put on.

1110
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:45,499
I also know how nerves
can wipe that all out.

1111
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,069
I wish I could have done better.

1112
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:53,274
All right, ladies,
based on the judges' critiques,

1113
00:45:53,275 --> 00:45:55,076
I've made some decisions.

1114
00:45:57,445 --> 00:46:00,014
India Ferrah...

1115
00:46:00,015 --> 00:46:01,082
con-drag-ulations.

1116
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:03,284
You're the top All Star
of the week.

1117
00:46:03,285 --> 00:46:04,719
What?

1118
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,487
[applause]

1119
00:46:06,488 --> 00:46:08,756
That means the world to me.
Thank you.

1120
00:46:08,757 --> 00:46:13,261
You've won a five-day stay
in Reykjavik, Iceland,

1121
00:46:13,262 --> 00:46:18,599
hotel and airfare included,
courtesy of Pink Iceland.

1122
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,900
Yes!

1123
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:22,370
Derrick Barry,

1124
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:24,005
Mayhem Miller,

1125
00:46:24,006 --> 00:46:27,642
you are the bottom All Stars
of the week.

1126
00:46:29,777 --> 00:46:32,780
The rest of you are safe.

1127
00:46:35,683 --> 00:46:36,984
You may leave the stage.end act

1128
00:46:38,786 --> 00:46:40,521
Oh, someone feels good!

1129
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:43,391
Someone feels real good
right here.

1130
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:46,994
Oh, they all look so delightful.

1131
00:46:46,995 --> 00:46:49,630
Oh, bitch, I fucking did it!

1132
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:53,701
Now these girls
know to watch out.

1133
00:46:53,702 --> 00:46:55,436
-Congratulations.
-Oh, my God, congratulations!

1134
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,671
Thank you.

1135
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:58,339
Aah!

1136
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,340
How do you feel right now?

1137
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:00,374
It's crazy.

1138
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,943
It's so overwhelming
and exciting.

1139
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:07,381
And the bottom two
is Derrick and Mayhem.

1140
00:47:07,382 --> 00:47:08,582
I'm gonna be honest.

1141
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:12,019
I thought it was gonna be
Ongina and Mayhem.

1142
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,821
I was surprised, too.

1143
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:15,423
You guys, I don't know
what happened.

1144
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:16,924
I was like, okay,
I'm fucking this up.

1145
00:47:16,925 --> 00:47:18,125
I'm just gonna do
a little shimmy here

1146
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,460
and a little shimmy there.

1147
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,861
Well, that's what happens
when you get in your head.

1148
00:47:20,862 --> 00:47:24,031
Yeah, I know, and I've been
in my head all fucking week.

1149
00:47:24,032 --> 00:47:25,232
But, like, an All Star
believes in themselves.

1150
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:27,301
-I literally did not.
-I know.

1151
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,303
I wanna talk to each of you,
if you don't mind.

1152
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,871
Yeah, I would love to.

1153
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:32,707
I think
I'm gonna take you first.

1154
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:35,176
Okay. My fate
is in the hands of India,

1155
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:36,444
and that's a little scary,

1156
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:38,612
that I might be pleading a case

1157
00:47:38,613 --> 00:47:40,648
to a jury
that's already decided.

1158
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:45,386
I wanna know
why you wanna be here.

1159
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:48,122
I need to be here

1160
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:52,493
because people need to see
the fully realized queen.

1161
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:58,566
So my influences and my drag
is what I have to bring.

1162
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:00,301
Don't hide behind
the impersonations.

1163
00:48:00,302 --> 00:48:03,671
People need to see a fiercer,
darker, dramatic Derrick.

1164
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,406
If you're gonna deliver her.

1165
00:48:05,407 --> 00:48:06,807
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1166
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:07,975
I'll take that
into consideration.

1167
00:48:07,976 --> 00:48:09,076
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1168
00:48:09,077 --> 00:48:11,145
And congratulations.
You deserved it.

1169
00:48:11,146 --> 00:48:13,080
I love what you said
to the judges.

1170
00:48:13,081 --> 00:48:15,316
And knowing
that you are vulnerable

1171
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:18,753
is all I needed to know
that you are real.

1172
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:22,623
You guys know I was in
mock trial in high school,

1173
00:48:22,624 --> 00:48:24,158
and I've been to court
many times, so...

1174
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:26,327
[all laugh]

1175
00:48:26,328 --> 00:48:28,229
Let me tell you
about this real quick.

1176
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,563
I think I have more
than she does.

1177
00:48:29,564 --> 00:48:33,501
I think my drag
is more well-rounded,

1178
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:36,237
and I'm here
and I'm ready to work.

1179
00:48:36,238 --> 00:48:38,873
I know how magnetic you are,

1180
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,642
and I wasn't feeling
that magnetism.

1181
00:48:41,643 --> 00:48:44,044
I wasn't feeling
being drawn in as much.

1182
00:48:44,045 --> 00:48:45,579
I had a bad day.

1183
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,415
I still haven't decided yet,
so don't look at me.

1184
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:49,750
[all laugh]

1185
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:51,352
All the queens get a vote,

1186
00:48:51,353 --> 00:48:54,155
and I don't know
what criteria they're using.

1187
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:55,489
All I know is

1188
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,058
I was more entertained
by Derrick's performance

1189
00:48:58,059 --> 00:48:59,393
than I was with Mayhem's.

1190
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,529
Should she go home?
I don't know.

1191
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:04,632
RuPaul, what the fuck?

1192
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:06,500
♪ Hey, Derrick ♪

1193
00:49:06,501 --> 00:49:07,701
♪ Hey, Derrick ♪

1194
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:09,870
Can you tell us why
you're the one to stay?

1195
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:12,106
I thought
that it was successful,

1196
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:14,775
and the audience was laughing.

1197
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:17,344
Of course, I could have slayed
it as Britney and won, but--

1198
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:19,780
I thought you were doing Britney
the entire time.

1199
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,448
I swear to you.

1200
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:22,449
I also did kind of
think that as well.

1201
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:23,617
You did Britney in look.

1202
00:49:23,618 --> 00:49:24,819
Yeah, I kind of got that,
and I--

1203
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,020
Well, that's my drag, though.

1204
00:49:26,021 --> 00:49:27,087
I know.

1205
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:29,156
I really do feel like
if I wore this,

1206
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:30,524
then I'm a version of Britney.

1207
00:49:30,525 --> 00:49:31,659
Toxic Britney.

1208
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,960
If I'm wearing that,

1209
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:34,995
I'm Dream Within a Dream
Britney.

1210
00:49:34,996 --> 00:49:36,197
What about this?

1211
00:49:36,198 --> 00:49:38,966
This is giving me
red carpet Britney.

1212
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:42,136
Um...

1213
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:45,139
Oh, I didn't wanna do that.

1214
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,977
People are always saying,
I wanna see the real you.

1215
00:49:49,978 --> 00:49:51,612
Well, you're looking at it.

1216
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:56,951
It's like you tell me that
you want me to be somebody else,

1217
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,752
but you want me
to be somebody else

1218
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:02,489
from the somebody else
that I already am.

1219
00:50:04,925 --> 00:50:06,994
Bitch, I'm a fan of yours.
You know that.

1220
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:08,229
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1221
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,330
But it's a hard decision

1222
00:50:09,331 --> 00:50:11,866
because I didn't hear
all the lyrics,

1223
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:14,835
and I wanna know that
I'm not gonna see this again.

1224
00:50:14,836 --> 00:50:17,705
The thing is, I'm not giving up.

1225
00:50:17,706 --> 00:50:20,741
I wanna stay, and I feel
I deserve to stay.

1226
00:50:20,742 --> 00:50:21,742
Can I ask you something?

1227
00:50:21,743 --> 00:50:24,011
If I am ever in this position...

1228
00:50:24,012 --> 00:50:25,479
Okay, let's talk.

1229
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,481
-I mean...
-Let's talk.

1230
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,916
Would you get rid of me or...

1231
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:33,254
India's presenting to me
an alliance possibly.

1232
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:34,989
Hmm.

1233
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,223
Here's the deal.

1234
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:38,726
If I'm ever in that chair
and you over here,

1235
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:41,195
I got you.

1236
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:42,730
-Okay.
-You know what's up.

1237
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:44,198
Interesting. Okay.

1238
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:46,634
I came here to play,

1239
00:50:46,635 --> 00:50:47,968
and the more friends
