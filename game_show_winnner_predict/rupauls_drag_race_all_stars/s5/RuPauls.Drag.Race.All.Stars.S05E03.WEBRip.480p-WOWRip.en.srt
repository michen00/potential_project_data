1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,740
RuPaul: Previously
on All Stars...

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,711
You'll be debuting
the smash hit I'm in Love.

3
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,012
Oh, yeah!

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,047
Do you think that you voted
for the wrong person?

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,515
I should have brought in
some Wite-Out,

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,319
because Ongina,
you didn't believe in yourself.

7
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,421
Are we playing
mental warfare here?

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,223
I'm gonna get rid of her.

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,325
-I'll take it from you.
-I can just--

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,761
It's not the Cracker show.

11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,862
We have a time limit.

12
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,932
♪ I'm in love, I'm in love ♪

13
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,034
♪ I'm in love with him ♪

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,270
♪ He's tall, dark,
long, and lean ♪

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,238
♪ And he rocks my kitty world
like you never seen ♪

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,940
I did kind of find myself

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,043
wandering to other people
a little bit.

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,779
I liked your look more than
I liked your performance.

19
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,249
On these stages,
with all these animals,

20
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,585
you've gotta fight
for every moment that you get.

21
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,855
You don't have to deliberate
with me,

22
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:58,058
because these two do not deserve
to go home at all tonight.

23
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:02,429
I made your morning difficult
a while ago, and it was stupid.

24
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,465
Ru-veal yourself!

25
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:09,903
[cheering]

26
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,306
Shea Couleé,
you're a winner, baby.

27
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:16,977
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

28
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:19,079
Ongina.

29
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,749
Ongina, sashay away.

30
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,597
What...a...day.

31
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,834
Two girls have gone home now,
and it's starting to get real.

32
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,503
This is going to happen
every single week.

33
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,205
It's gonna get tough.

34
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,740
Feelings will get hurt.

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,910
But I'm feeling $20.000 richer.

36
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,714
Congratulations, Shea.

37
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,815
Yes, bitch.

38
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,249
How you feel?

39
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,520
It feels good to be
in a position like this,

40
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,993
but also it was really hard
to send our girl Ongina home.

41
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,895
But, um, I felt like
it was her time.

42
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,932
Ongina was mentally checked out.

43
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,635
I want to make sure
that whoever I keep here

44
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:20,774
is hungry and capable
of handling all the challenges

45
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,576
that this competition
throws our way.

46
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,344
I'm curious to see--

47
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,512
How everyone voted?

48
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,613
Well, open it.

49
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,914
Okay.

50
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,116
All right,
let's lay 'em all out.

51
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,918
One for Ongina, two for Ongina.

52
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,988
Ongina, Ongina,

53
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,557
Ongina, Ongina.

54
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,359
Unanimous.

55
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:47,934
I am still angry with her,
because she just gave up.

56
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,438
She was, like, doing damage
control before it happened.

57
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,641
If I went home and found out
someone else gave up,

58
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,309
I'd be devastated.

59
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,011
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime,

60
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,847
and there are so many girls
that would love to be here.

61
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,749
If anyone else wants to give up,

62
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,618
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

63
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,486
Mariah, how are you feeling
right now?

64
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,189
I'm letting my lady parts
calm down.

65
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,593
I'm still vibrating from being
that close to being sent home.

66
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,962
It just took my breath away,
not in a good way.

67
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:16,997
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

68
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,031
Ugh, yeah.

69
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,033
Oh, my gosh.

70
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,670
There is a little moment
of relief right now,

71
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,674
but with that relief
is a big old scoop of reality.

72
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,444
And I never wanna be
in the bottom again.

73
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,480
I know y'all spent the coin,
but I spent the mint, bitch.

74
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,781
[all laugh]

75
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,483
So y'all gonna have to shove,

76
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,752
kick me in the back of the head
with a high heel

77
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:39,986
to get me up outta here.

78
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,055
All right, girls,
let's take this off.

79
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,290
Let's take this--

80
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,725
Oh, God,
I could go for a corndog.

81
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,629
How do you feel
beating Alyssa Edwards?

82
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,598
I mean, bitch.

83
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,734
I'm like, what universe
am I living in?

84
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,137
Coming to the competition,

85
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,339
I thought Shea Couleé
was the queen to beat,

86
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,409
and she's in the top of the game
right now.

87
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,643
Alyssa Edwards?

88
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,012
-Girl, oh, my God.
-In a lip sync?

89
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,114
Girl, gag.

90
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,916
But I'm not scared
to compete with her.

91
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,420
I'm here to win the big prize,
not just a challenge.

92
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,389
And tomorrow
is a brand-new day, baby.

93
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,359
They better wake up and see me,
because I'm coming.

94
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,027
No one is safe.

95
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,298
Bam.

Mr. Cameraman, show me my mark.

Into the werkroom
and the fantasy.

113
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,012
Hold my hand and guide me
gently--gently to my place.

114
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,014
I'll take my mark now.

00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,557
I love you, Ongina."

119
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,092
Aw, we love you, Ongina.

120
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,295
Oh, it's not going anywhere.

121
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,297
Nobody's ever gonna accuse you
of being a domestic.

122
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,565
Well, girl, with $20.000,

123
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,568
you won't never have to
clean a mirror again.

124
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,002
Can I borrow a 20?

125
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:40,207
When I get home
and see Ongina, I know her.

126
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,642
She gonna be like, "I really
shouldn't have quit, huh?"

127
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,046
"I really--I really should have
stayed, you guys, huh?"

128
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,814
[all laugh]

129
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,284
So, Cracker,
this is the real talk.

130
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:55,121
What was the purpose
of going in to Ongina

131
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,656
in the beginning of the morning?

132
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,692
Do you think that you voted
for the wrong person?

133
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,193
I should have brought in
some Wite-Out,

134
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,862
because Ongina,
you didn't believe in yourself.

135
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,032
Like, is this a "strag-edy"

136
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,001
you're trying to do
with everybody's mind?

137
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,837
My intention was to say,

138
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,674
"Ongina, I want you
to believe in yourself,

139
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,544
because I need to see that."

140
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,180
And I went about it wrong.

141
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,383
I should have said that,
not what I said.

142
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,820
And, uh...
Are you okay, Mayhem?

143
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,689
[laughs]

144
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,058
Girl, I don't believe
not none of this.

145
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,226
-I'm just gonna be real.
-Right.

146
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,461
I really don't believe
none of it.

147
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,329
Same.

148
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,966
I smell shenanigans, foolery,
and some tricks and shows.

149
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,569
Is this for real, or are you
just playing a game?

150
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,940
It's not feeling authentic, sis.

151
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,176
All I can do is apologize
and say that I was wrong.

152
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,344
She's not here any longer,

153
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,647
and now you're gonna say
you apologize?

154
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,881
It's done.

155
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:59,486
From now on, we all have
to really show who we are.

156
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,222
I wanna get to know everybody
for real,

157
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,025
because if I ever in a position
to send anybody home,

158
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,194
if I don't trust you,
I'm gonna go against you.

159
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,697
Alexis wants you to be real,

160
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,499
she wants to be clear
about things,

161
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,769
she wants to trust you,
she wants to know who you are.

162
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,673
I think you're playing
head games, Miss Alexis,

163
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,375
and it's working on
some of these bitches.

164
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,914
I made one mistake, and--

165
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,149
It was not a mistake.

166
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,151
It was just a situation.

167
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,186
Okay.

168
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,954

Hey, All Stars,
welcome to the Ru-mada Inn.

You want room service?

175
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,040
Well, bitch,
here's a wake-up call.

176
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,211
Ain't nobody got time
for your baggage.

177
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,180
Ooh!

178
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,782
So who doesn't have time
for my baggage?

179
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,484
I love two-star hotels!

180
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,253
Hello, hello, hello, ladies!

181
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,355
-Hi!
-Hi!

182
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,622
Ooh! There you are.

183
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,224
Come on, resort wear.

184
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,159
[laughs]

185
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,995
Now, ladies, as All Stars,

186
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,266
you know firsthand that
VIP travelers these days

187
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,435
don't just want a room,

188
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,740
they want
an unforgettable experience.

189
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,741
I know I do.

190
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,676
In this week's maxi-challenge,

191
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,246
you'll be starring in the
hottest new hotel design show,

192
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,915
Shantay Enjoy Your Stay!

193
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,617
Now, working in teams,

194
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:42,489
you need to design and present
your own signature suite

195
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:48,128
worthy of a five-star
Ru-tique hotel.

196

198
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:56,336
Feel free to use materials
from the F&S Fabrics wall

199
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,605
and Objects furniture.

200
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,740
Now, we did
a random drawing earlier,

201
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,146
and the teams are Miz Cracker,
Mariah Paris Balenciaga,

202
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,147
and Shea Couleé.

203
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,349
-Oh!
-Okay!

204
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:14,988
The next team is Jujubee,
India Ferrah, and Alexis Mateo.

205
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:19,559
And last but not least, Mayhem
Miller and Blair St. Clair.

206

We are always together
on everything.

210
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,305
Today's maxi-challenge
has got to be

211
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,641
one of the most difficult
in RuPaul's Drag Race history,

212
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,976
because there are so many parts.

213
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,978
What are the things
that you like about

214
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,480
when you're staying
in a hotel?

215
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,115
Glamour and glitter.

216
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,249
I like glamour.

217
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,451
All right.

218
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,287
Not only do we have to create
a hotel suite,

219
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,023
we have to create a welcome
basket, a signature nightcap,

220
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,991
we have to give a room tour.

221
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,594
But most importantly,
we have got to sell this suite.

222
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,896
We can make everything,
like, gold, like, all golden.

223
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,965
Okay. Gold is rich.

224
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,133
-Gold is rich.
-It's exclusive.

225
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,335
Oh, my gosh,
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

227
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,407
Me and Blair
are teammates again. Ha-ha!

Hopefully we will be able
to vibe a little bit better

229
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,011
without Cracker.

230
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,913
We gonna win this week.
I can feel it.

231
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,216
I'm really kind of disappointed

232
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,418
that you guys had
"say something" hat day today,

233
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,153
and didn't tell me about it.

234
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,257
[all laugh]

235
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,960
So we need to pick a theme,
clearly.

236
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,162
Does anyone have any ideas, or--

237
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,264
-I think--
-Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

238
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:36,236
Wild Alaska. The room
is just all Alaska-themed.

239
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,372
There would be, like,
a river with salmon,

240
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,309
there would be, like, snow,
an Alaskan pipeline underneath.

241
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,545
Yeah, I don't wanna stay there.

242
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,314
This is really, really difficult
for me to admit,

243
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,551
but it's my third time here and
I've never won a main challenge.

244
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,586
I have to change that.

245
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,022
I really want something
kind of, like, tropical.

246
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,024
But this is a design challenge,

247
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,527
and I'm paired with two bitches
with questionable taste.

248
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,395
What are we gonna do,

249
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,798
like, a jungle or something
that is outside--

250
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,501
I actually really like
the whole jungle idea.

251
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,803
Let's be real. My taste
is questionable, too.

252
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,339
I shouldn't be here talking
shit about my teammates.shit

253
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,374
[laughs]

254
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:15,542
Write it out, bitch.

255
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,646
So we need to have
a clear concept.

256
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,715
Right, and one of my favorite
shows in the whole entire world

257
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,950
is The Golden Girls.

258
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,385
Baby, I can watch that

259
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:26,786
over and over and over again
on reruns.

260
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,456
I think, like, nostalgia
is a very powerful thing.

261
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,993
The Golden Gals,
the Golden Gals' Palace, the--

262
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,396
[gasps]
The Golden Gals' Palace.

263
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:40,533
My closest friend on Season 10
was anxiety,

264
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,837
and after the drama
this morning, she's back.

265
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,674
Beachy, eighties Miami.

266
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:48,908
-Miami.
-Right.

267
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:52,412
Okay. Right, okay.

268
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,013
The girls are not happy
with Cracker.

269
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:58,618
They think that
I am scheming and shady,

270
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,720
and I'm starting to spiral.

271
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,658
I think, honestly, the most
iconic bedroom is Blanche's,

272
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,627
with that banana-leaf wallpaper.

273
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,262
Yeah, that kind of thing.

274
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,897
Everybody knows a banana leaf.

275
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,132
Yeah. I think in Season 10,

276
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,969
I would have been like,
"I'm gonna fall apart right now.

277
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,705
It's happening. Here we go.
Aah!"

278
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,108
But do I wanna be in
the midst of a mental breakdown

279
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,745
when I go out
to perform for RuPaul?

280
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,013
Nerp.

281
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,049
Picture it. 1923, Sicily.

282
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,517
[laughs]

283
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,156
Ooh.

284
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,959
Oh, wow.

285
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,427
This is a big space.

286
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,263
It's time to design our suite,

287
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,066
and I see paintbrushes,
goggles, smocks.

288
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:51,638
I'm just, like, okay, I hope
they don't expect me to do it.

289
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:54,774
Now, I'm not used to doing,
like, labors.

290
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,342
I'm not that girl.

291
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,644
Ru's picture's right here.

292
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:59,445
The bed's right here,
the bar's right here,

293
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,813
the couch is right here.

294
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,181
Do you wanna see
how the couch looks?

295
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,282
And then--

296
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,317
Or--I mean--

297
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,185
I'm very delicate.

298
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm more delicate.

299
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,323
There is no butch queen
on this team.

300
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,791
Please be light.
Please be light.

301
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,959
-Lift with your legs.
-Oh, my God.

302
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,427
[grunts]

303
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,730
You guys, I can't find Blair.

304
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,465
[laughs]

305
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,102
The goal for our luxury suite
is to make it look expensive.

306
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,104
Oh, look at all this opulence.

307
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,306
We have a lot of rich stuff.

308
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,009
This gonna be Versailles,
this gonna be a palace.

309
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,878
This gonna be real fancy.

310
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,379
This gonna be the Gottis' house.

311
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,816
Should we take a step back
and look at this again?

312
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
No, trust our gut.

313
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,721
Juju, girl, what the hell?

314
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,990
That's how your makeup looks
the way it does.

315
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,425
Have you ever fucking
painted a room, bitch?bleep

316
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,526
Yes.

317
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,561
Now I got a clue who hasn't.

318
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:52,465
Oh, my God,
we are gonna be garbage.

319
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,969
I cannot help
this process at all.

320
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,205
Do we have a ladder?

321
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,708
Golden Gals.

322
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,276
I'm with you, girl.

323
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,078
I'm gonna put a seagull.

324
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,512
Yes! [laughs]

325
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,215
Fly the seagull
into that sunset.

326
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,718
Look. Already looks like
a winning room to me.

327
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:14,787
I'm on a team with Shea Couleé
on a bad day, which is great.

328
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,357
We have chemistry, and it makes
everything so much easier.

329
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,427
She's putting the "sis" back
in "Sistine Chapel," girl.

330
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,062
[laughs]

331
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,832
I'm gonna paint a beautiful
sunset in my Golden Gals' room,

332
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,700
where my spirit lives right now.

333
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,037
As long as the rattan furniture
has been Pledge-scrubbed,

334
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,371
everything's okay.

335
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,242
Oh, you guys,
this is super cute.

336
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:41,080
I could definitely see Shrek
loving this place.

337
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,281
So what's y'all's color palette,

338
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,983
like just like brown and green?

339
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,218
Yeah, like your foundation.

340
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,953
This is nice.

341
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,421
-Oh!
-Oh, really!

342
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,922
This is real nice.

343
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,394
These bitches, you know,
sometimes it gets annoying.

344
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,363
It's like being in a daycare.

345
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,532
Don't touch me,
because I got paint.

346
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,933
I'm just gonna let them bark.

347
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,903
I will put
the dogs to sleep later.

348
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,172
You're Xed outta this place.

349
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:08,174
Please continue walking
this way.

350
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,677
That green is drying
a lot darker than I imagined.

351
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,613
Yeah, and I love it.

352
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:18,484
This is an exclusive
motherfucking wild ridem-fucking

353
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,719
to the other side.

354
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,754
A one-of-a-kind experience.

355
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,056
Well, this is one of a kind.end
act

356
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,031
Runway day, runway day.

357
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,734
Today we're getting ready
to present our hotel suites.

358
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,837
Oh, yeah, that definitely smells
like a freakin' trouser snake.

359
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,540
I'm not completely confident
with what we're doing,

360
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,743
but I'm still
gonna sell this damn room.

361
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,977
I know you guys

362
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,714
are not very good into,
like, designing interiors,

363
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,951
but this is not just that.

364
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,187
It's also about
who we are as a group.

365
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,922
Right, it's also us being

366
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,957
exaggerated versions
of ourselves.

367
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,958
Right.

368
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,993
Our personalities need to shine.

369
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,062
I'm a little worried,

370
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:06,566
because I gotta present
a luxury hotel suite

371
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:09,368
with two very strong
personalities,

372
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,004
and stand out on my own.

373
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,172
I need to shave my face.

374
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,941
Do you guys
need help shaving your backs?

375
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,210
Why we don't leave
our backs hairy?

376
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,711
So it's really a 4D experience.

377
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,946
That's true.

378
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,181
But please make sure
you shave all your chins.

379
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:29,989
Girl, I could not sleep
last night.

380
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,793
This challenge is so hard, so--

381
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,462
But the more that
we work together on this,

382
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,564
the more I'm feeling more sound.

383
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,933
I mean, we had some challenges
in the last challenge,

384
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,168
and we pushed through that.

385
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,837
Because, like, I was
so thrown off by Cracker.

386
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,840
But I think, like, we got
each other in this challenge.

387
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,008
At this point
in the competition,

388
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,910
everything's
a little nerve-wracking.

389
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,546
But with Cracker not being
involved in this challenge,

390
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,948
Mayhem and I are doing
really great together.

391
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,917
I think what Cracker's
missing out on

392
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:01,254
is taking ownership
of her behavior,

393
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,222
and the things that she does
and the things that she says.

394
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,859
Instead of having an explanation
about everything,

395
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,362
just be like,
"You know what? I'm sorry."

396
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,964
And I just don't feel
the sincerity, unfortunately.

397
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,132
-Right.
-I don't.

398
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,870
That Miami sunset color palette,
you turnt it.

399
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,138
You picked the perfect colors.

400
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,007
We created a view, y'all.

401
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:23,109
I could sit there
and look at that sunset,

402
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,278
my little glass of sherry.

403
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,113
And some piping hot tea.

404
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,515
Oh, bitch, you--oh, we're
gonna be pouring it later.

405
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:33,586
My group is playing characters
inspired by The Golden Girls.

406
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:37,990
Shea's gonna be Shea D. Arthur,
Cracker is gonna be Rosebud,

407
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,827
and, of course, I'm gonna be
Balenciaga Devereaux,

408
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,262
kind of like the cheeky, slutty,

409
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,232
always flirting with the help
kind of girl.

410
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,200
It's right up my alley.

411
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,738
So, Cracker,
it was a little bit rough

412
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,675
at the table yesterday
with everyone.

413
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,911
I feel like people
are not happy with me,

414
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,913
and I took it
to a place in my head

415
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,951
where I was like, "I'm bad.
I'm bad Cracker." You know?

416
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,985
Right. [laughs]

417
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,553
And then it took me
a little while

418
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,322
and working with you guys
and seeing our success

419
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,223
to be like, "You know what?
Not bad Cracker."

420
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,593
Just, like, bad situation.

421
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,095
Well, I've definitely enjoyed
working with you this week.

422
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,930
I think it's all about
chemistry.

423
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,332
Yeah, definitely.

424
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:23,736
Like, the people that I respect
are Shea and Mariah and Juju

425
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,438
and those people
that I really look up to,

426
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,207
and those are people
that I am working well with.

427
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,445
So everything else, I will learn
and work on and get there.

428
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,380
So you don't respect me?

429
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,848
Is that
what you're trying to say?

430
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,950
Is that
what you heard from that?

431
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,985
Yeah.

432
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,088
[hiss]
Fuck!

433
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,389
I said I'm working with people
that I respect.

434
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,657
Yeah.

435
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,826
Girl, I am not ready
for the Alexis shark attack,

436
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,662
and she is going in
for the kill.

437
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,664
Listen, sweetheart, you're
trying to make a conflict--

438
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,966
Don't "sweetheart" me, because
I'm not sweethearting you.

439
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,469
I'm not deaf, so I can hear you.

440
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,872
I was saying that I am working
well with people that I respect,

441
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,474
and that makes me feel better,

442
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,342
and that the rest
is a learning curve.

443
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,277
And the reason why
yesterday morning

444
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,914
was so, like, intense for you
was because of me,

445
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,385
and I'm still waiting for you
to come to talk to me.

446
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,520
But it's easier for you
to just talk there.

447
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,490
I honestly don't think
that that is the T.

448
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,692
You know, I had asked her
just how she was feeling.

449
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,495
And her comment about working
with people that she respects,

450
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,397
I don't think that
that was, like, any shade.

451
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:28,100
Bitch, who was talking to you?

452
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,036
No one
was even talking about you.

453
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,638
We were having a tender moment
over here as a team,

454
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,640
talking about
how much fun we had,

455
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,742
and then you have to pipe up

456
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,311
and try and get into
my teammate's head.

457
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,414
You told me,
"Girl, you've gotta watch

458
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:42,748
the way you interact
with people."

459
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,950
And I walked away with that
to this group,

460
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,019
and I was, like,
I am going to make sure

461
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,121
that I am the best me
for this group.

462
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,424
So I really listened
to what you said.

463
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,459
At least you're aware
of what is happening in my head.

464
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,760
Does that make sense?

465
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,298
Many moments and years,
I have trouble communicating,

466
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,833
because this is not
my first language.

467
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,603
Second language, my ass.

468
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,338
I could be an asshole
and just say, you know what?

469
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm done with Miz Cracker.

470
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,275
I don't wanna get to know her.

471
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,877
You know,
I don't wanna be that diva.

472
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,580
How the fuck this bitch say
this is her second language,fuck

473
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,582
and she been going for hours?

474
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,250
[laughs]

475
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,219
A lot of girls talk about you
behind your back.

476
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,891
Oh, I could be one of them
and just go behind your back

477
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,694
and tell everybody how we gonna
get rid of you, but I'm not.

478
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,895
I know.

479
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,697
I'm not.

480
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,599
And I hear everything
that you're saying.

481
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,601
I think people
are piling on Cracker

482
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,837
because people
are threatened by Cracker.

483
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,039
They know that
she's tough competition,

484
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,908
and I feel like they actually
are getting in Cracker's head.

485
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,977
And I'm like,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

486
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,979
Hold up. Wait a minute.

487
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,514
Don't go there,
because I ain't with it.

488
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:52,585
That's my teammate, and we've
got a challenge to focus on.

489
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,286
I can't wait to see
how this turns out.end act

We feature reclaimed
rattan furniture,

515
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:15,134
which is also real fancy
for "used wicker."

516
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:19,004
We have a gorgeous armchair
with a heated afghan.

517

-Mm.

with free local calls.

521
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,950
So you could remind
your grandchildren

522
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,953
it's been a while
since they've seen you.

523
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,421
[disconnect signal]

524
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,122
Hello?

525
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:42,394
First, we're gonna hope
that you indulge yourself

526
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,396
in our complimentary
gift basket,

527
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,434
featuring an assortment
of girthy meats and cheeses.

528
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,935
I love girthy meats.

529
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,440
[doorbell]

530
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,641
What was that?

531
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,042
I think we have some company.

532
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,377
Well, let's not be rude.

533
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,812
Let's go welcome our guests.

534
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,680
-Oh, welcome!
-Oh!

535
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,983
Hi, hi, hi!

536
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,285
Some of the people
who've had their final rest here

537
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,355
include Frank Sinatra,
Bob Hope.

538
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,090
Oh, but there's
a waiting list, too.

539
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,659
We have the Lady Bunny
and the Bianca Del Rio.

540
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,428
Now, they expect to come by
very soon.

541
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,531
There is no Golden Gals' evening
complete

542
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:25,004
without a sinfully delicious
piece of cream cheese pie.

543
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:30,175
Cream cheese pie,
Rosebud?

544
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,510
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Cheesecake!

545
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,878
Yeah, there ya go.

546
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,180
Any time you need a little
extra assistance late at night,

547
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,450
we have a full-time gentleman
caller butler service.

548
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,388
All you have to do is hit
this emergency alert button...

549
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,723
[alarm]
and some dear gentlemen callers

550
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,793
will be with you right away.

551
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:48,994
Can I have that button?

552
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,497
-Full service.
-I could never.

553
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,033
Thank you so much
for visiting us here.

554
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,635
Make sure to tip the boys,
but just the tip.

555
00:23:56,635 --> 00:24:00,272
And don't hesitate to tell
everyone you know about us.

556
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,608
Now, thanks for coming, and...

557
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,144
[all] Thank you
for being a friend.

558
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,645
[laughs]

559
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,615
Where'd the cheesecake go?

560
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,485
RuPaul: Your RuPaul-iday
continues.

561
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,989
Next stop, let's get wild
in the Glamazone

562
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:20,859
with Alexis Mateo,
India Ferrah, and Jujubee.

563
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,771
Bienvenidos
to a wild adventure at the...

564
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,773
[all] Glamazone.

565
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,408
[all purr]

566
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,912
Come inside.
I've said that before.

567
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:43,182
It smells just like a jungle.

568
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:45,084
Lots of animals,
ah-ah-ah-ah,

569
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,752
and everything in the wild.

570
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,387
[growls]

571
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:49,722
We're wearing
leopard print dresses.

572
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:50,856
Mm-hmm.

573
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:51,957
[snarls]

574
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,560
Right here in our rhino room

575
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,662
you're gonna feel right at home.

576
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,897
Here I am, sitting on a chair
that my grandma made.

577
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,000
She made this
with her two bare hands.

578
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,134
I sat on her lap.

579
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,936
Oh, she was chewing tobacco.

580
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,571
All the stories I heard.

581
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,506
Didn't understand a word.

582
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,576
This is the P-P bar.

583
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:13,812
Party-Party bar, everybody.

584
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,315
My grandma
also made this chair.

585
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,752
Ahh. Ooh, your grandma
might wanna reinforce that.

586
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,854
Oh, don't talk
about my grandma, bitch.

587
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,893
We have our very own
golden showerhead,

588
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,997
and it's gonna leave you
with a warm sensation of joy.

589
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,600
[moans]

590
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,168
[all moan]

591
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,604
And this is where
all the magic happens.

592
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:43,976
These sheets are infused
with 15-karat Laotian gold,

593
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:45,344
and there is a mosquito net

594
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:48,514
to protect you from the live
mosquitoes we've released.

595
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,048
[buzzing]

596
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,483
But not to worry,

597
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:56,221
because in our welcoming basket
we have mosquito Ru-pellent.

598
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,923
-Ooh, yes.
-Ooh.

599
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,526
And of course we include the
most exotic fruit we can find.

600
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,693
What the hell just happened?

601
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,497
Bananas, oranges,
apples, and grapes.

602
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,865
[all growl]

603
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,967
-[hiss]
-Hi, ladies.

604
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,237
All: Welcome to The Glamazone.

605
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,605
Mmm. Smells like bananas.

606
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:16,508
You're just in time
for our signature nightcap.

607
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,510
-Yes!
-I love a drink!

608
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,712
Oye, oye.

609
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,981
There goes our butler.

610
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,483
-Oh!
-Oh!

611
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:29,254
Our signature nightcap
is a mix of natural flavors,

612
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,357
and, of course, a mysterious
ingredient to help you relax.

613
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,358
Ooh!

614
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,428
It's the ultimate place to stay

615
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,831
if you're excited
about the jungle.

616
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:42,434
Not only can you pet the pets,
but they pet you back.

617
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,303
Wow, that is wild.

618
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,638
This only happens at...

619
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,675
[all] The Glamazone.

620
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,109
[all growl]

621
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,144
[hiss]

622
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,215
Come on, lay with me.

623
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,016
Did your grandmother
make this, too?

624
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,218
-Oh, yes, girl.
-Oh, boy.

625
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,853
You know how long
it took her to make this?

626
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,221
-No, how long?
-Now lay down.

627
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,722
-Okay.
-Do you see the stars?

628
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,858
Oh! I see the stars.

629
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,226
You guys are gonna be protected.

630
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,228
It's like a giant condom.

631
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,596
-Oh, look at that!
-Oh, thank you!

632
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,763
Night-night!

633
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,332
-Night-night.
-Have sweet dreams.

634
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,768
Oh, my God, they are ready
for bed, everybody.

635
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,371
So come see us soon here at...

636
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,573
-The Glamazone.
-The Glamazone.

637
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,842
[soft growls]

638
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,380
RuPaul: For our last Ru-sort,

639
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,984
we're going for the gold
in the 24-karat Experience,

640
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,420
presented by Blair St. Clair
and Lamé.

641
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,731
Oh, hi there.
I'm Blair St. Clair.

642
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,900
And I'm Lamé.

643
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,837
Have you ever wondered
what it would be like

644
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,207
to vacation
like an A-list celebrity?

645
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,843
Everybody wants to be
a celebrity.

646
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:03,115
Here in the 24 Karat room,
you can do just that.

647
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,084
So let's take a look
in our fullest of fantasies.

648
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,185
Mm-hmm.

649
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:12,257
The 24 Karat room is luxury.

650
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,126
-Rich.
-How rich?

651
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,661
Very rich.

652
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,862
So rich.

653
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,263
Daddy rich.

654
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,803
We offer you
your very own selfie chaise.

655
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,205
Just look and click.

656
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,640
[whispers] Expensive.

657
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,908
-Rich.
-Rich.

658
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,178
You wanna know who else
has been here, Blair?

659
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,179
Tell me.

660
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,614
The Kardashians.

661
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:36,682
All of them?

662
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,517
-Even Rob.
-[gasps]

663
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,252
Can you name all the Jacksons?

664
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,353
All of them?

665
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,754
Even Rebbie.

666
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,457
Boo. A magic mirror.

667
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,225
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

668
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,228
who is the fairest
and the goldest of them all?

669
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,364
It's you, bitch.
You are fierce as hell.

670
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,600
You can slay
the house down boots.

671
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,768
Yes, God, okurr?

672
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:59,638
I feel rich!

673
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:01,073
[whispers] Expensive.

674
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,474
Rich.

675
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:05,510
[whispers] Expensive rich.

676
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,549
In our gift basket, our guests
will receive Golden Mist.

677
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,084
It smells like what?

678
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,719
-Success.
-Oh!

679
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:17,255
And this,
a golden bath bomb nugget,

680
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,224
made from pixie dust
and pirate lust.

681
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,561
I love gold bath bombs.

682
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,963
Lamé, do you hear that?

683
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,599
Ooh, I just hear
the money coming.

684
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,134
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

685
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:32,270
Welcome to the 24 Karat room.

686
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,573
The glamour
is almost unbearable.

687
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,008
Can't you feel the power?

688
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,276
[whispers] You smell rich.

689
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,878
We are rich, darling.

690
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,281
Golden God?

691
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,916
Of course we have
a signature nightcap,

692
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,819
a golden elixir that is made
from leprechaun tears

693
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,289
and infused with
golden goose juice.

694
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,790
Shaken, not stirred.

695
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,492
-Ooh.
-What do you taste?

696
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,626

872
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,132
RuPaul: What?

873
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,967
-Ooh.
-Oh.

874
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,403
RuPaul: Wait a minute now.

875
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,839
I'm telling the story
of Anastasia.

876
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,442
We have a Fabergé egg,
the princess herself,

877
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,378
and the princess on the run
after the Revolution.

878
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,879
RuPaul: Wow.

879
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,047
Nicole: I love it.

880
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,183
RuPaul: Shea Couleé.

881
00:36:58,183 --> 00:37:01,119
[all laugh]

882
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,420
-Wow.
-Whoa.

883
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,022
Shea: My three-in-one look

884
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,658
is based off of
the rosy maple moth

885
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,360
mixed with
a Lisa Frank character.

886
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,862
RuPaul: You larvae it?

887
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,597
Michelle: I larvae it.

888
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:16,901
I'm trailing my gorgeous,
iridescent organza skirt,

889
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,637
and then I come out
of my chrysalis.

890
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,272
RuPaul: I'm getting Kate Moth.

891
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:24,542
[all laugh]

892
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,977
-Oh!
-Ooh!

893
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,278
-Oh!
-Oh!

894
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:30,782
I spread my wings, bitch,
and take flight,

895
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:34,486
because I know the judges
are living for this look.

896
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,920
Ross: Are those
two wings on your back,

897
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,288
or are you just happy
to see me?

898
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,423
[all laugh]end act

899
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,792
Welcome, All Stars.

900
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:45,530
Based on your performances
and runway presentations,

901
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,765
I've made some decisions.

902
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,970
My favorite suite
this week is...

903
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,308
The 24 Karat Gold Experience.

904
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,878
-Did she say that for real?
-Yeah.

905
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,212
Shut the fuck up. [laughs]fuck

906
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,347
You're lying.

907
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,816
But the best performance
of the week

908
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:08,620
was by a queen
from another group.

909
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,492
Jujubee, con-drag-ulations.

910
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,261
You're the top All Star
of the week.

911
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,196
All right.

912
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:19,664
-Thank you.
-Yes.

913
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,001
I've been waiting a really
long time to win something.

914
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:26,404
Thank you.

915
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,373
You want a carrot?

916
00:38:28,373 --> 00:38:30,441
[all laugh]

917
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,810
You've won a seven-night stay
for two

918
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,312
in the penthouse suite

919
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,983
at the Grand Resort and Spa
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

920
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,752
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

921
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,086
Thank you.

922
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:45,490
Jujubee, you need to choose
one of the bottom queens

923
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,294
to send home
if you win the lip sync

924
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:53,765
against this week's
secret lip sync assassin.

925
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,634
The rest of you need to vote

926
00:38:56,634 --> 00:39:01,573
for which bottom queen
you think deserves the chop.

927
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:06,945
Jujubee, Blair, and Mayhem,

928
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,613
you may leave the stage.

929
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,282
Thank you.

930
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,488
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.

931
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,660
First up, Alexis Mateo. Bam.

932
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,928
Hello.

933
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,164
In the Glamazone,

934
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,166
I thought you had
some really funny moments.

935
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:31,369
You are a queen
that is effortlessly funny.

936
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,705
You can truly just,
like, blink at people

937
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,006
and to me, it's funny.

938
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,545
I thought your suite
was spectacular.

939
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,946
I loved the P-P Bar.

940
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,314
[all laugh]

941
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,150
Tonight on the runway,
your three-in-one looks,

942
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,355
you actually really did
three fully different looks,

943
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,589
and I appreciate that.

944
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,860
With that said,
they were a lot to look at.

945
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,363
Was this, like, a circus theme?

946
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,464
Yes.

947
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,199
Okay, well, particularly
the middle outfit

948
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,701
I just thought didn't work
in between the two.

949
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,371
India Ferrah.

950
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,705
Hi.

951
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,241
The three looks
were all very, very different,

952
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,509
but they were related.

953
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,278
They looked like they came
from the same planet.

954
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,813
The outfits were amazing.
I love the fabric.

955
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,882
By the way, when you're finished
with it, I wanna do a chair.

956
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,584
[all laugh]
Ooh.

957
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,387
In the hotel suite,
what did you bring to that?

958
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:24,656
The golden shower
was, like, the main thing

959
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,357
that I was, like,
supposed to, like, focus on

960
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,625
and really embrace.

961
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,294
You know, Martyn,
you have to pay a little extra

962
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:30,828
for the golden shower.

963
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,398
[all laugh]
Yeah, but it's worth it.

964
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:37,969
In the Glamazone zone,
between Alexis and Juju,

965
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,171
you were kind of the one
that fell back for me.

966
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,808
You just were kind of getting
lost in the background.

967
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,411
You always wanna be on a team
of strong people, right?

968
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:47,812
But then what can happen

969
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,981
is if you don't elbow
your way to the front,

970
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,317
you're suddenly in the shadows.

971
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,352
I'm sorry.

972
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,855
Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

973
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:58,957
Tonight on the runway,

974
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,425
I mean, you always
look beautiful, Mariah,

975
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,861
but I will say taking
a jacket off is not a look.

976
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,430
Okay.

977
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,365
So Golden Gals' Palace,

978
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:12,136
you three set yourself up
for a very big job,

979
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,572
because I am
a Golden Girls fanatic,

980
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,040
I know Ru's
a Golden Girls fanatic,

981
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,775
I know Ross
is a Golden Girls fanatic.

982
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:21,879
And the thing that was missing
were jokes.

983
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,948
There were no jokes.

984
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,819
Your room, from the palm leaves
to the whole vibe, I loved it.

985
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,620
I thought the room
looked really great.

986
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,757
But the dodgy old bedsheets
and the weird pillow,

987
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:35,293
that didn't look like anything
I wanted to get into.

988
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,428
Miss Devereaux

989
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,965
is one of the greatest
characters ever written.

990
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,367
She was
the original Samantha Jones.

991
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:45,303
She just,
she owned her sexiness,

992
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,505
and I wanted more whore.

993
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,707
It's why I love Michelle Visage
so much.

994
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,875
[all laugh]

995
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,611
[French accent]
Miz Cracker.

996
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,279
Mademoiselle.

997
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,316
I was just so enthralled
by the entrance.

998
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,984
Each look was great.

999
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,386
Okay.

1000
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:02,987
You were Rosebud.

1001
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,323
There were a few things
that really made me laugh.

1002
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,457
Hello?

1003
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,460
But there was a lot
of fun moments and ideas

1004
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,329
that just fell flat.

1005
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,531
I thought you were really funny,

1006
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,167
but, like, I think
you're missing a little bit

1007
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:18,703
of being spontaneous
and in the moment.

1008
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,605
[sighs]

1009
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,407
Are you okay?

1010
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:28,613
Yeah. It's been, like,
the wildest ride of my life.

1011
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:32,250
And I think as Alexis will know,

1012
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,754
sort of having a hard time
connecting with people.

1013
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,389
Fuck that. Who cares?fuck

1014
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,658
Don't listen to anybody.

1015
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,560
You're you.
You are fabulous.

1016
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,530
Be you. Who cares about
what anybody else is saying?

1017
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,332
Thank you, Cracker.

1018
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,535
Up next, Shea Couleé.

1019
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:51,569
Hey!

1020
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,037
[all laugh]

1021
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,106
I love how colorful it is.

1022
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,542
I love how bright it is.

1023
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,343
But it is a little crafty.

1024
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,880
It could be a little refined.

1025
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,050
Your room, it really felt
like a Golden Girls set,

1026
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,318
which I loved.

1027
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:10,855
But I did feel that
your character was a little off.

1028
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,293
Shea D. Arthur, Bea Arthur,

1029
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:18,863
I think you had
her seriousness down.

1030
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,765
She just wasn't funny.

1031
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,401
You also, like, set up
some jokes that didn't pay off.

1032
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,670
Like, the "picture this" moment
was super fun,

1033
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,438
and then there was, like,
no more of that.

1034
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:32,143
I mean, you were using Sophia's
catchphrases as Dorothy,

1035
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,479
which I think--
I didn't read the whole bible,

1036
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,380
but I don't think
you're allowed to do that.

1037
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,717
[all laugh]

1038
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,452
Everyone could have just
turned it up to a 10.

1039
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,654
I feel like everyone
was playing it safe.

1040
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,724
It turned into a hotel room
with just three elderly women.

1041
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:51,462
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1042
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,264
Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

1043
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,666
I've made some decisions.

1044
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,075
Alexis Mateo.

1045
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,611
Miz Cracker.

1046
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,247
You are safe.

1047
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,185
India Ferrah.

1048
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,087
Shea Couleé.

1049
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,456
Mariah Paris Balenciaga.

1050
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:21,459
You are the bottom All Stars
of the week...

1051
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:28,332
and will be up for elimination
officially.

1052
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,467
You may leave the stage.end act

1053
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,973
-Hi!
-Hi!

1054
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:36,974
Come on in.

1055
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,743
Bone-jour.

1056
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:43,948
Girl, I am gooped, gagged.

1057
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,217
I am in the bottom three.

1058
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:50,821
I could be going home tonight,
and I'm feeling so fragile.

1059
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,823
Con-drag-ulations, Miss Winner.

1060
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:53,858
Thank you.

1061
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,059
I mean, I'm very grateful

1062
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,394
and I'm very happy
and I'm very excited.

1063
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,528
It was my first win.

1064
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,897
-Yes. Con-drag-ulations.
-Thank you.

1065
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:03,434
But I didn't get to be up there
to hear what happened.

1066
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,136
I'm in the bottom three.

1067
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,071
Yes, they're bottom three.

1068
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,372
-Again?
-Oh, again.

1069
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,374
India, myself, and Shea.

1070
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,276
What?

1071
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,778
They did not like my look.

1072
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:17,748
They said that they did not
enjoy the experience.

1073
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:21,986
Literally, they said that it was
a room full of three old ladies.

1074
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,921
I personally think
that's a good time.

1075
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:26,424
-I'm so confused.
-Oh, you're confused?

1076
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:30,194
I keep providing good drag.
I keep providing India.

1077
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,798
For once, for once
in my fucking life,fucking

1078
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:38,536
I am proving who I am as India,
and I couldn't be happier.

1079
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:42,406
But I did a challenge in between
two fucking amazing
queens,fucking

1080
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,243
and now I have the chance
that I'm getting sent home

1081
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,979
on something
I've waited eight years for.

1082
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,114
And I don't wanna...

1083
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,182
Right.

1084
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:52,917
I don't.

1085
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:55,886
Oh, wow.

1086
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:00,124
These girls are so emotional.

1087
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:01,125
Like, dang.

1088
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,960
This is hard.

1089
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,462
It's really hard.

1090
00:46:04,462 --> 00:46:05,963
Whew.

1091
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,500
I guess I have to do
what I've gotta do, right?

1092
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,002
Who--

1093
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:12,403
I'll go.

1094
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,804
-You wanna go first?
-Let's do it.

1095
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,207
I am so frustrated.

1096
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:17,975
Michelle's critique
about my runway look

1097
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,411
is bullshit
with a bow wrapped around
it,bullshit

1098
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,146
because I don't do
any half on anything.

1099
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,214
Jujubee:
All right, girl.

1100
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,616
And I just really didn't think

1101
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,151
I was gonna be
in the bottom three.

1102
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,719
You already know
that I love you.

1103
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,788
This whole competition
is, uh--

1104
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,390
-Full of surprises.
-Yes.

1105
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,557
Mm-hmm.

1106
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,693
Coming into this competition,
I came back,

1107
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:37,728
wanted to push myself
and push my boundaries,

1108
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,296
and have a good time doing it.

1109
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,731
Do I need to work harder

1110
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:44,168
on pushing my personality
out on camera?

1111
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:48,739
Yes, but I'm light-years
ahead of where I was.

1112
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,074
That doesn't make it easier
for me at all.

1113
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,108
-No, it doesn't.
-No.

1114
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,410
We came into this

1115
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,111
knowing that we have to make
these tough decisions.

1116
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,646
I know.

1117
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,847
But, like, it sucks.

1118
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,817
Anything worth doing
is not always easy.

1119
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,420
I just wanna stay.

1120
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,723
So this week was a miss for me.

1121
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:14,865
I just hope that I've earned
your guys' respect enough.

1122
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,667
Girl, you have a track record,

1123
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,637
and an American track record--

1124
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:22,840
But everyone gets to make
their decision for themselves.

1125
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,842
This is what's great
about All Stars.

1126
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,278
Nobody knows
what's going to happen.

1127
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:30,915
You could fuck up every day
and land in the top four.fuck

1128
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:33,884
You could slay it
and get manila-ed

1129
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,153
because you are at the mercy
of other queens,

1130
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,289
and queens are crazy.

1131
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:40,691
We all know that Shea
is a powerhouse of a queen.

1132
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,259
Absolutely.

1133
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,629
But honestly, she got the worst
critiques on the runway.

1134
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,999
Right. We all know that
she is a huge competitor.

1135
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,768
Yeah.

1136
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:52,703
So do we send the competitor
home tonight?

1137
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:58,042
I wanna tell you
that I want to be here.

1138
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,882
This is my dream.

1139
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:09,220
And I'm just really hoping
that you see it in yourself

1140
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,556
to give me a second chance.

1141
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,358
The decision is so hard to make.

1142
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,693
Mm-hmm.

1143
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,828
It's easy to say, "Oh, well,
I'm gonna play fair."

1144
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,131
I wanna beat
the best of the best.

1145
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,200
But if you want that crown,
you're gonna play the game.

1146
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,535
And Shea is in the bottom.

1147
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:27,271
I could vote for Shea to leave.

1148
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:30,107
Ooh, is this strategy, bitch?

1149
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,476
I do hope
I make the right decision.

1150
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,311
How do you feel?

1151
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,514
Second week, bottom three.

1152
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:39,450
I did not want to be
in this position again.

1153
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,886
Sometimes it's not your day,
you know?

1154
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:43,788
No, it's not, but sometimes
it might be my last day.

1155
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:45,489
And hopefully,
that's not the case tonight.

1156
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,825
And honestly, Cracker,

1157
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:48,926
I didn't know
how I was gonna feel

1158
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,227
being on a team with you,

1159
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,063
because of the static
and tension that your group had

1160
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,431
in last week's challenge.

1161
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,002
And I must say, I really
thoroughly enjoyed myself,

1162
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,870
and I wouldn't
have traded my group.

1163
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,806
-I wouldn't.
-[sniffles]

1164
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,642
It hurts being
in the bottom three again,

1165
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,577
but I'm still proud.

1166
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,745
You should be.

1167
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:09,547
You always should be.
You're Mariah.

1168
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,148
-Bitch.
-[laughs]

1169
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:12,983
I'm gonna toast
to my motherfucking
self.m-fucking

1170
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:14,018
[laughs]

1171
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:27,231
If I go home tonight,
I will be absolutely devastated,

1172
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,799
because I worked so hard
to get here.

1173
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,002
And to have it end this way,

1174
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,940
ugh, it would just be
so disappointing.

1175
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,711
Coming from the top,

1176
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,480
there's only one way
to come down.

1177
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:01,265
[sighs] I just don't know

1178
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:05,636
how I could even possibly fathom
making this decision.

1179
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,972
World out there,
it's harder than you think.

1180
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,139
Don't judge me for being sappy,

1181
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,541
because this
really is difficult.

1182
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,976
I'm sorry.

1183
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:19,383
No matter who I pick,
Imma make someone mad.

1184
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,119
Mariah's like my best friend
in this competition,

1185
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,889
but I made a deal
with another girl.

1186
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,423
I can't go back on my word.

1187
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,759
And then we got the bitch
that's been doing good

1188
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,195
that just had a bad week.

1189
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:34,031
If I vote for her,
she might hate me.

1190
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:38,335
But I'd rather have someone
go home that's a threat

1191
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,038
than a friend,
because I need votes.

1192
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,240
You're forever sickening, bitch.

1193
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,077
This is All Stars.

1194
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,646
Ain't nobody safe.

1195
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,816
Do you wanna know
what's in my mind?

1196
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,919
Because I know you wanna know.
I know you're asking.

1197
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:59,023
What's going through
my mind right now is...

1198
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:00,524
oh, I miss my cats.

1199
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:01,959
They don't judge me.

1200
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,562
They do, but they
have to live with me.

1201
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,431
I feed them.
I also scoop their poops.

1202
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,534
I feel like I would be a crazy
cat lady if I had one more cat,

1203
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:14,738
but two is enough for now.

1204
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,542
Meow, meow, bitches.end act

1205
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:23,047
Welcome back, ladies.

1206
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:28,419
Jujubee, are you ready
to meet your lip sync opponent?

1207
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,387
Mm-hmm.

1208
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,256
Good.

1209
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,757
The time has come

1210
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:39,830
to present this week's
lip sync assassin.

1211
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,598
[thunder]

1212
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,401
Whew.

1213
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,072
Who is this?

1214
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:49,640
Could this be the Babadook?

1215
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,241
Oh, my God, who could that be?

1216
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:56,046
Ru-veal yourself!

1217
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,183
I live for the pop.

1218
