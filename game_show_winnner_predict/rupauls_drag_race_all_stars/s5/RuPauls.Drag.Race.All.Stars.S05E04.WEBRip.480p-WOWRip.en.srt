00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,607
RuPaul:
Previously on All Stars...

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:11,445
You need to design and present
your own signature suite

3
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,681
worthy of a five-star hotel.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,550
[laughter and applause]

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,486
A lot of girls talk about you
behind your back.

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,188
Oh, I could be one of them

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,324
and tell everybody how we gonna
get rid of you, but I'm not.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,525
I'm not.

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,227
-Come on in.
-Come inside.

10
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,162
I've said that before.

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,364
Thanks for coming.

12
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:34,034
And thank you
for being a friend.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,370
If you don't elbow
your way to the front,

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,505
you're suddenly in the shadows.

15
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,773
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,509
The thing that was missing,
there were no jokes.

17
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,713
Jujubee, con-drag-ulations.

18
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,715
You are the top All Star
of the week.

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,450
[applause]

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,885
Thank you.

21
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,620
Sometimes it's not your day.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,122
But sometimes
it might be my last day,

23
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,857
and hopefully,
that's not the case tonight.

24
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,625
I am in the bottom three.

25
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,394
I could be going home tonight.

26
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,230
We all know
that Shea is a powerhouse.

27
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,865
But she got the worst critiques.

28
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:08,101
Ooh. Is this strategy, bitch?

29
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:12,806
Ru-veal yourself!

30
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:17,244
[cheers and applause]

31
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,346
Monét X Change,
con-drag-ulations.

32
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,580
You're a winner, baby.

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,052
The $10.000 will be added
to next week's tip.

34
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:29,423
Which queen has the group chosen
to get the chop?

35
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,525
Mariah.

36
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,228
Mariah, sashay away.

37
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,905
[sighs]

38
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,440
Another day down.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,741
Pblblblbl. Uh!

40
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,509
Oh, that was insane.

41
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,678
I feel great
that I dodged a bullet

42
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,847
and that I'm still here.

43
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,017
But I kind of
walked into this competition

44
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:01,488
hoping that I would just have
this beautiful, untouchable,

45
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:06,426
flawless journey to the crown,

46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,295
and that is not exactly
how it's going.

47
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:12,599
I've just gotta, you know,
pick myself back up

48
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,901
and live to slay another day.

49
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,738
Thank y'all for keeping us,
you know?

50
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,772
Yes.

51
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,640
Well, we don't fully know that.

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,908
Okay, well, I don't know
what y'all vote was,

53
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,811
but I'm looking at these girls
right here, so...

54
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,846
Do you guys
wanna look in the box?

55
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,080
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,683
One Mariah.

57
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,353
Two Mariah.

58
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,288
Three Mariah.

59
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,457
One Shea.

60
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,794
-Who's that?
-Two Shea.

61
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,396
Touché!

62
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,464
[all laugh]

63
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,900
I'm sorry. What, what, what,
what in the what-what?

64
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,035
One India.

65
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,338
Well, if today
is full of only one thing,

66
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,572
it is surprises.

67
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,041
-Yeah.
-Is that your Mariah?

68
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,108
That's my Mariah.

69
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,978
So four Mariahs,
two Shea, India.

70
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,246
Wow.

71
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,814
Well, y'all know
who my vote was.

72
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,350
-I voted for Mariah.
-I voted for Mariah.

73
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,318
We all know Shea's a powerhouse.

74
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:08,789
I thought the group was gonna
be, like, Shea's in the bottom?

75
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,824
Let's get her out.

76
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:13,293
[laughs]

77
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,929
This backfired on my ass.

78
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,565
I'll be honest.
Shea, I voted for you.

79
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,667
-Okay.
-It was not personal at all.

80
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,402
It was the hardest vote.

81
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,572
Like, I respect each and every
one of you so much as artists,

82
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,973
and I've gotten to know you guys
even more

83
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,776
since we've been here,
and I consider you my friend.

84
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,180
But Mariah is like my sister,

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,083
and I just couldn't do it.

86
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,452
I mean,
there were two votes for me.

87
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,787
The next vote for Shea was me

88
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:45,058
just because I didn't
wanna send Mariah home.

89
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,994
Personally, I didn't wanna deal
with that inside me.

90
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:52,666
I saw Mariah work so hard
that I couldn't do that to her.

91
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,634
So you didn't think
that I worked hard?

92
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,838
I did. I think you did great,
like I say to you before.

93
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,773
No, you said
you didn't wanna choose Mariah,

94
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,007
so you chose Shea.

95
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,409
Why not India?

96
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,478
Oh, India was
out of the question for me,

97
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,913
because I think
her performance was great.

98
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:11,751
So it went down to the critiques
that were the hardest for me.

99
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,820
India was in the bottom twice,

100
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,692
so how is it that India
is, like, not even an option

101
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,961
when out of all the girls
that are remaining here

102
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:25,432
I'm the only one that's won
a challenge and a lip sync.

103
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,200
So...

104
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,437
It just puts a lot of things
into perspective.

105
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:34,107
It just literally shows that it
could be any one of us any day.

106
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,842
At any time.

107
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,479
I'm not terribly surprised

108
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,281
at how these two girls
are playing the game,

109
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,884
because if I were scared,
I would do the same thing.

110
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:47,254
But, girl, I'm always going
to be thinking about the fact

111
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,723
that you tried to send me home.

112
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:54,895
These girls have no idea
the kind of games I can play.

113
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,366
So let's have some fun.

114
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,470
RuPaul: The winner

I got my first win last week.

Good Juju is here.

132
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,916
She says, "Thanks for making
this a better experience.

133
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,387
"Love, Mariah,
aka Balenciaga, aka Paris,

134

"aka successful,

135
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,924

-"Mug 4 dayz."
-"Mug 4 dayz."

137
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,429
-Oh, I love Mariah!
-This bitch!

138
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,231
She is the most extra person.

139
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,299
Knowing damn well
I gotta get ready there,

140
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,068
we gotta clean this up.

141
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,269
Let me show you how to do this,

142
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,904
because I know
you haven't done this before.

143
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,740
You just take--
[all laugh]

144
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,709
With each elimination,

145
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,245
you start to realize...

146
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,846
"I'm doing something right."

147
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,182
I'm still here, bitch. Ha!

148
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:27,721
I feel like this is some kind
of bad juju Santería curse

149
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,257
or something that
every time you win a challenge,

150
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,925
the winner finish in the bottom.

151
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,460
-[laughs]
-Or if you're in the top--

152
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,563
Wait, is that--
is that what's been happening?

153
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,131
-Yes.
-Yeah.

154
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,299
I feel like, yes,
you were in the bottom.

155
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,533
And then you were in the bottom.

156
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,602
-Uh-huh.
-Then you.

157
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,970
And...

158
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,939
-Juju.
-Juju.

159
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,907
Oh, don't put no bad juju
on this.

160
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,376
[alarm]

161
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,144
RuPaul: Ooh, girl.

162
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,247
She done already
done had herses.

163
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,884
My All Stars,
a dangerous woman once said,

164
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,588
"There's no such thing
as bad publicity,"

165
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,991
because if you can handle
a scandal,

166
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:09,362
your walk of shame could
lead you to the Hall of Fame.

167
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,466
-A scandal!
-Sandal!

168
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,634
Right?

169
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,870
Hello, hello, hello!

170
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,240
-Hi!
-Yay!

171
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,144
Ladies, when they go low,
we go high.

172
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,547
But sometimes
you just gotta love

173
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:31,017
some good old Hollywood gossip.
[laughs]

174
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,987
So for this week's
maxi-challenge,

175
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:36,723
you'll be caught behaving badly

176
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:42,562
on the nationally syndicated
gossip show SheMZ.

177
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,800
[all laugh]

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,801
Oh, my God.

179
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,903
#AllStars5.

180
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,707
Working in teams,
you need to improv your way

181
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,343
through some
scandalous situations.

182
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,877
Okay.

183
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,212
And you gotta be funny.

184
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,347
Make me laugh.

185
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:03,083
Team number one
is India and Mayhem.

186
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,818
-Oh!
-All right.

187
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,252
Come on over here, bitch.

188
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,121
[all laugh]

189
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:12,659
India, you'll play a celebrity
who's a chronic shoplifter.

190
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,463
And Mayhem, you'll play
the thirsty shop girl

191
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,531
who catches her in the act.

192
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,301
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

193
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,970
Team two is Jujubee, Blair,
and Cracker.

194
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,473
-Oh!
-Okay!

195
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:31,044
Jujubee, you'll play
an overprotective drag mother.

196
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,379
Oh!

197
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,082
Blair, you'll play her
obnoxious, ungrateful daughter.

198
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,684
Oh, okay.

199
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,187
And Miz Cracker,
you'll play a shady queen

200
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,191
at the center
of a college admissions scandal.

201
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,626
-Oh, yes!
-Wow!

202
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,597
And that means team three
is Shea Couleé and Alexis Mateo.

203
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,532
Uh... [laughs]

204
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,002
Oh, shit.

205
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,738
Shea, you'll play
an icy drag queen

206
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:03,276
who's been fired from
The Fake Housewives of Tuckahoe

207
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,545
for being too fake.

208
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:09,716
Alexis, you'll play
a messy drag queen

209
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:14,154
who's been fired from
the same trashy reality show

210
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,089
for being too trashy.

211
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,958
Typecast.
We're just typecasts.

212
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,329
All Stars, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

213
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,964
-Yes!
-Whoo!

214
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,400
Come on, white boys.end act

215
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,474
Ahh. Bitch, we're about
to act a fool up in here.

216
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,342
And SheMZ? How clever.

217
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,512
Today's challenge is SheMZ.

218
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,414
Let me tell you,
I love a gossip,

219
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,916
and I like to talk shit.

220
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,186
So this is right up my alley.

221
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,955
-This is gonna be funny.
-It is.

222
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,623
Because I know
that you're a thief.

223
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,293
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.
Absolutely.

224
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,828
Because, you know,
I've seen you

225
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:58,431
over in my closet over there
a couple times.

226
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,001
I didn't say
that I was a smooth thief.

227
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,436
So you're not a smooth criminal.

228
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,872
No, I'm not a smooth criminal.
I'm just a criminal.

229
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,540
[clears throat]

230
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,444
Being the good Christian lady
that I am,

231
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,914
I am assigned the shoplifter.

232
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,516
Déjà vu.

233
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,985
It's funny, because all honesty,

234
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,888
when I started drag,
I would steal stuff.

235
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,692
Like, I absolutely
was a shoplifter.

236
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,694
And I got caught one time
stealing three dresses,

237
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:30,797
and I had to go to court
for that.

238
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,332
Clearly, I'm not proud of that,

239
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,902
but I did my community service,
thank you.

240
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,437
-You know what I wanna do?
-What?

241
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,306
I wanna steal this win
from everyone else.

242
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,308
That's what we need to do.

243
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,644
Last time when I did
an improv challenge,

244
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,879
I went home.

245
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,247
It's big!

246
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,515
Okay, all right.

247
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,116
And long!

248
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,118
I just wanted you
to go further with it.

249
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,187
You can't be too big.

250
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,424
I wanna prove to Ru I'm not
that girl from Season 10.

251
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,827
This time, I'm coming to win.

252
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,964
[both laugh]

253
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,801
When I've worked on a team
with someone,

254
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,570
they've gone home.

255
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,604
Right.

256
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,672
So I'm hoping
we can break that curse.

257
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,974
Oh, we gonna break it open.

258
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,176
We're gonna break it,
because I'm not going home.

259
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,113
If someone goes home,
it better be you, bitch.

260
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:23,182
Oh! Well, I already know
that I have your vote.

261
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:28,321
I do not trust Alexis
as far as I can throw her,

262
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,089
and y'all know that ain't far.

263
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,058
But I am going to put

264
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,028
my most professional
panties on right now,

265
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,330
and we're gonna get
this job done,

266
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,366
and I'll handle
our personal stuff after this.

267
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,102
So you playing
a little Miss Perfect.

268
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,938
Yes, so that's--

269
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,741
"She's a control freak
and have major rage issues."

270
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,777
Okay, okay.

271
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,011
"She's fake."

272
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:56,249
Oh, this is
so, so close to real life.

273
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:00,687
[laughs]

274
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,522
Ha ha ha ha!

275
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,526
So wait. I wanna read
about your character.

276
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,527
Uh-huh.

277
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,063
Alexis Mateo, the hot mess.

278
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,998
"She thinks Shea
is an uptight bitch."

279
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,800
I think so.

280
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,368
[both laugh]
I'm getting in character.

281
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,337
Well, yes, I understand.

282
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,471
"She got kicked off the show

283
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,273
"because even though
she was great TV,

284
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,643
she was such a liability
she became difficult to insure."

285
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:24,777
Right.

286
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,879
"She'll do anything
for fame and attention,

287
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,648
and she's pretty open
about that."

288
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,682
Right, like me.

289
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,150
[laughs] Yes.

290
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,455
Our scene is called
Eating with the Enemy.

291
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,224
We try to put an act on
like we're good friends,

292
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,326
but then we're throwing shade
under our breath.

293
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,461
Right.

294
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,528
We just look at each other,
like...

295
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,764
hmm.

296
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,399
[laughs]

297
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,468
it's very on-point with us.

298
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,702
I feel like these characters

299
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:52,639
are actually pretty, like,
spot-on for us to play.

300
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,773
Right.

301
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,608
Especially, like,
off of each other.

302
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,412
So this is gonna be
a super fun challenge

303
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,415
or a disaster in the making.

304
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,150
You know, it's, like,
this challenge

305
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,586
is really about, like, how--

306
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,655
first of all, I see this
as a comedy challenge,

307
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,756
but it's how quick you are.

308
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,790
Mm-hmm.

309
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,958
- Because it's improv.
-Yeah.

310
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,426
And we have to have
a lot of fun with it.

311
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,827
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

312
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,865
I have a good Juju on my team,
but I also have bad juju,

313
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:22,435
because I think Blair might
have been plotting against me.

314
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,604
In the interest of what Alexis

315
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:28,307
has been saying
about full honesty,

316
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,210
I just wanna say a few things.
I'll make it quick.

317
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,745
[tongue pop]

318
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,414
Okay.

319
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,683
Blair, you and I have
been friends for two years.

320
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,217
-Mm-hmm.
-Facts.

321
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,485
We had a challenge

322
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,690
where feathers were ruffled
for you and Mayhem.

323
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,895
Another fact. In this very room,
Alexis strongly suggested

324
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:53,599
that you and perhaps Mayhem
were discussing strategies

325
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,569
to push me
out of this competition.

326
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,737
What?

327
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,941
I've never once
tried to strategize

328
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,076
to get you
out of this competition.

329
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,444
-Okay.
-And you could ask Mayhem.

330
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,745
You can ask anyone else
in this entire room,

331
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,913
in this entire competition.

332
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,948
There's been some tension
between us

333
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,949
the past few days
we've been here,

334
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,384
but it's because
I needed my space.

335
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,885
-Yeah, same.
-I've needed my space.

336
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,022
It's not because I didn't want
whatever was going on

337
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,925
or whatever had been said
to continue.

338
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,926
Right.

339
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,028
But I don't wanna push you out.

340
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,629
Okay.

341
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,398
Hmm.

342
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,201
Right now,
the investigation is saying

343
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,270
she is not not not guilty.

344
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,506
But I hope we can put
any differences aside

345
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,574
and move forward.

346
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,608
Yeah.

347
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,343
Everything's not one hundred,

348
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,546
but I also wanna win
this goddamn challenge.

349
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,648
I do value our friendship,

350
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,484
and I felt like
my friendship with you

351
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,252
was kind of compromised,
and that's what frustrated me.

352
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,653
Yeah.

353
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,223
Yeah, I would rather compete
with you as a friend, honestly.

354
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,657
Like, I would rather

Jujubee, Juju,
why did you bribe Miz Cracker

00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,649
to get your daughter
into Drag U?

515
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,319
Because Drag U was the most
prestigious college out there,

516
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,555
and I want my daughter
to succeed.

517

I think she is
the next drag superstar.

519
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,093

to go to Drag U!

I follow you in Instagram?

529
00:21:56,182 --> 00:22:00,219
I know you're going down, too,
if we play our cards right.

530
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,854
What?

531
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,223
I'm wearing the butterfly ring
you gave me.

532
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:08,594
Oh, please, let your butterfly
flap a little more for me, love.

533
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,497
All you have to do
is tell these reporters

534

nothing going on with us.

536

than your foundation stick,

542

but it's time
for us to stick together.

543

544

It's in my pocketbook.

Perhaps possibly maybe.

550

nerve, and also Photoshop.

even need to wear sunscreen

Didn't she get busted
a few years ago for shoplifting?

It seems she's been, uh,
mopping some expensive items.

585

and this angry-ass shop girl

of Fred Shegal.

and you took everything.

-No, I bought everything.
-No, no, no.

607

and then you put some other
stuff in your bag, girl.

because I've been in therapy.

00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,586
How you feeling, India?

704
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm feeling good.

705
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,157
I feel like I delivered my best,

706
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,491
and I feel like

707
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,727
that was probably
one of my best challenges.

708
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:53,165
Now, are you afraid that might
not be enough for the judges,

709
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,867
or are you, like,
confident on that?

710
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,235
I mean,
there's always that thought.

711
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,370
Because, you know,
it's always, like--

712
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,471
There's always that thought.

713
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,505
-There's always a moment.
-It's a gag.

-You'll never feel safe.
-Girl, yeah.

715
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,076
Here's a question.

716
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,144
Has anybody in this werkroom

717
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:11,216
been involved in anything like
celebrity blogs, maybe SheMZ?

718
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,884
I have.

719
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:17,422
The weekend I was eliminated
from Drag Race,

720
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,693
there was this article that
went around about me on TMZ,

721
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:26,098
and people uncovered
that I had a DUI in my past.

722
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,767
It was, like, a really, really,

723
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,268
really hard time for me
in my life,

724
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,872
because I had to read about it
splashed across TMZ.

725
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,208
All these people, like,
are reading about me

726
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,876
and talking about me,
and they didn't even get to,

727
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:41,046
like, hear my story
of, like, who I am.

728
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:46,918
Right. Actually, Blair, um,
I, in my younger days,

729
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:51,990
made some really bad choices
that I'm not proud of.

730
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,827
I have two DUIs.

731
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,529
Whoa.

732
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,066
I am lucky and blessed

733
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:05,904
that those foolish choices
did not hurt anybody.

734
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,572
-Yeah.
-Or myself.

735
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,443
When you have that pressure on
you to be the life of the party,

736
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,346
you wanna drink,
you wanna do the drugs.

737
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:18,283
So I would do the most,
and I had no limits.

738
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,186
It just became this thing
of how messy can May be?

739
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:25,791
And no one wants to admit
if they have a problem, and...

740
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,831
I got arrested in drag
both times.

741
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,965
-[gasps]
-Oh, my God.

742
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,969
-Jesus Christ.
-It was very terrifying.

743
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,173
They made me strip down naked.

744
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,240
Oh, my God.

745
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,077

in front of everyone else

746
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,978
that was being booked
that night.

747
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:51,016
And actually, one of the
officers took a picture of me,

748
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,552
and they laughed.

749
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,454
Listening to Mayhem's story

750
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:58,523
about her being arrested in drag
is painful.

751
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,126
I've never experienced
anything like that.

752
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,728
It breaks my heart.

753
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:06,665
I did, you know,
serve some time and stuff.

754
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:10,102
What?
I didn't even know that.

755
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,536
Oh, yeah.

756
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,771
It was a moment that I was like,

757
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,607
I can't ever be
in this position again.

758
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,843
And after I got out of jail,

759
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:22,047
I went to classes
and tried to get some help.

760
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,251
I had no idea.
That is insane.

761
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:28,186
-Thanks for sharing.
-Yeah, thanks for sharing that.

762
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,788

Aw, thank you!

764
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:35,427

I was trying to hold back.

765
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,296
I was, like,
I'm just gonna keep to myself.

766
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,532
And I feel this time
at Drag Race

767
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:44,536
I'm more in my skin
and I feel comfortable

are in this werkroom with me.

I'm actually happy to share,

to share a little bit of me,

00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:24,516
I know camo is supposed to be
like I'm hiding, but not me.

877
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,052
I want you to see me coming.

878
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,287
Carson:
Weapons of ass destruction.

879
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,623
[all laugh]

880
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,425
RuPaul: India Ferrah.

881
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,527
Michelle:
Ooh, she's wearing a cam-o-no.

882
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,828
She certainly is.

883
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,763
Sarah:
Look at all that latex.

884
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,799
Michelle: Slaytex.

885
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:45,003
India:
I am serving video game vixen,

886
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:48,673
straight out of a movie
camouflage couture.

887
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,909
I'm giving you
slicked-back hair,

888
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:55,613
over-the-top makeup,
full kimono, full bow.

889
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,149
I am living the camo fantasy.

890
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,350
Michelle: It's a wrap.

891
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,453
[RuPaul laughs]end act

892
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,522
Welcome, All Stars.

893
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,259
Based on your performances
in the challenge

894
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,096
and your runway presentations,

895
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,597
I've made some decisions.

896
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,734
When I call your name,
please step forward.

897
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,271
Shea Couleé.

898
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,008
Blair St. Clair.

899
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:29,748
You are both safe.

900
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,552
You may leave the stage.

901
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,321
Thank you so much.

902
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,995
Ladies, now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

903
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,532
First up, Jujubee.

904
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:52,003
There were so many great moments
in your SheMZ.

905
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,939
In this whole group, I kind of
count on you for the funny,

906
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,708
and I think you delivered it
really well.

907
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:58,343
I think
what was so great about it

908
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,912
was that you had many layers
to your character.

909
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,480
You're going down.

910
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,150
You waited, you took your time,
you listened.

911
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,920
You were always a "yes, and"
type of improv actor,

912
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,055
and I really, really
appreciated that.

913
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,790
Tonight on the runway,
you looked stunning.

914
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,960
I was getting kind of I'm
married to a very rich hunter.

915
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,762
Uh, he's married to me.

916
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,866
Okay, whatever it is
is beautiful.

917
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,068
The only criticism I would have

918
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,937
is that I would love
one little something

919
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,940
that would give us
that extra little wow factor.

920
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,341
Mm-hmm.

921
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,710
-Mish Cracka!
-Hello.

922
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,546
The thing about you, Cracker,

923
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:37,615
is you tend to get in your head
a little bit too much.

924
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,850
And when Cracker
gets in her head,

925
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,585
a lot of voices start going,

926
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:43,221
and sometimes
they get in your way.

927
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:46,124
In this challenge,
that was not the case.

928
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,392
Uh-huh. Pblblblbl.

929
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,627
From the minute you were
looking through the window,

930
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,596
it was a joy to watch you.

931
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,699
I definitely felt like you were
the leader of the challenge.

932
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,202
The way that you interacted
with everyone, including Ross,

933
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,237
was absolute perfection.

934
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:01,839
I gagged the entire time.

935
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,542
This look on the runway
is the bomb.

936
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,611
Hee hee hee.
That was a joke!

937
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,213
-That was a joke, yes!
-Yes!

938
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,316
I think it's a great concept,
giving us kind of that camo,

939
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:14,552
but a little bit more of like
a Britney/showgirl kind of vibe.

940
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:19,290
Like if Ariana Grande
and Destiny's Child Survivor,

941
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,526
if they had a baby, that's you.

942
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,527
That's the outfit.

943
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,696
I'm just so proud of you
tonight.

944
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,532
Tonight was a really good moment
for Cracker.

945
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,800
Thank you.

946
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,636
Up next, Alexis Mateo.

947
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,438
Hi.

948
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,939
Your runway look tonight,

949
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,942
I love that you went
with a deer hunter camo.

950
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,211
You came out
in a winter camouflage.

951
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,146
It's full-on drag.

952
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,681
You're giving us
a drag queen fantasy.

953
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,918
It is fantasy,
it is snow queen eleganza,

954
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:51,222
and a real standout amongst the
more literal, you know, camo.

955
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,223
It's stunning.

956
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,025
In the acting challenge,

957
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,928
I think the key for you,
it's about really listening.

958
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,697
Don't worry about filling
the silence all the time.

959
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:03,668
I think when you get excited,
you tend to cut people off.

960
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,637
So you were cutting Shea off
a little bit.

961
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:08,239
My favorite part is when
you shoved food in your titties,

962
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,774
and you said,
"Saving it for later.

963
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,009
Do not waste the good food."

964
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,977
I get what
everybody's saying, though.

965
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,748
You do find gold
when you listen to your partner.

966
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,384
Up next, Mayhem Miller.

967
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,685
Hey.

968
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,522
In your performance,
it started our really strong.

969
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,758
But it kind of fizzled for me,

970
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,027
and I felt it took a long time

971
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,895
to get where y'all
were gonna go.

972
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,864
I thought the concept was great.

973
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:37,135
The creativity was this kind of
John Waters kind of wackiness.

974
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,303
But I have to agree
with Michelle.

975
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:40,271
It did take a long time
to get there.

976
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,977
For tonight's runway look,
I love this color palette.

977
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,413
It's really, really beautiful
on your skin.

978
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:51,349
With the hair, your makeup,
it's gorgeous.

979
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,152
Stunning.
Maybe not enough concept for me.

980
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,020
Like, I wish
there was more to it,

981
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,456
like who are you,
what's your story.

982
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,691
I'm Black Barbie
going to combat.

983
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:00,792
That's what I am.

984
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,161
Okay.

985
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:04,662
Um, I just feel like

986
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,831
it's a little bit light
on look for me.

987
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,900
All Stars
is really frickin' tough,

988
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,568
and y'all can't get offended,
because May,

989
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,470
I feel like a little bit
of an attitude from you.

990
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,738
I don't have an attitude.

991
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,406
-A little bit.
-I'm just kiki-ing.

992
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:19,510
This is difficult,
and this is part of this gig.

993
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,745
You know, and we're here

994
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:23,548
to help you shine
the best that you can shine.

995
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,918
Up next, India Ferrah.

996
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,186
Hi.

997
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,287
Your runway look tonight,

998
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,355
I'm obsessed
with this hair and makeup.

999
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,256
-Can you do this on me?
-Absolutely.

1000
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,324
Thank God.
[all laugh]

1001
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,927
This looks
very different for you.

1002
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,529
Normally, I don't like a
black lip and super dark makeup,

1003
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,198
but I think this all works,

1004
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:42,767
especially with the touches
of black leather at the waist,

1005
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,635
combined with
the slicked-back hair.

1006
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,371
I think it's refreshing, and
I think it's what we wanna see.

1007
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:47,872
Like, surprise us.

1008
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,240
Thanks.

1009
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,476
You started out
so strong in yours.

1010
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,678
I mean, a girl with hair
and boobs like that,

1011
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,413
with all them shopping bags?

1012
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,914
I was in it.

1013
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,951
And then I kind of
felt you deviate,

1014
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,353
just kind of
get flatline, really.

1015
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,522
I think maybe you lost your way
a little bit.

1016
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,357
It was a little bit
of a one-note for me,

1017
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,026
where it was kind of
a lot of the same.

1018
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,062
You know that it got
a little, like, meh

1019
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,797
towards the middle and end.

1020
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:15,366
But dropping vases
from your puss is always great.

1021
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,667
[glass shatters]

1022
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,336
-Can I say that?
-Of course.

1023
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:19,370
-You're doing it right now.
-Okay, great.

1024
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,672
[laughs]

1025
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:26,044
Ladies, it's getting down
to the best of the best.

1026
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,946
So based on
the judges' critiques,

1027
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,083
I've made some
very difficult decisions.

1028
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,892
Miz Cracker...

1029
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,561
Con-drag-ulations. You are
the top All Star of the week.

1030
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,999
[applause]

1031
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,467
Thank you all.

1032
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:53,504
You've won a four-night stay
in Montreal, Canada,

1033
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:59,877
including hotel and airfare,
courtesy of Tourisme/Montreal.

1034
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,612
[growls]

1035
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,847
Jujubee.

1036
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,650
Alexis Mateo.

1037
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,187
You are safe.

1038
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,057
Thank you.

1039
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,994
That means India Ferrah
and Mayhem Miller,

1040
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,262
I'm sorry, my dears,

1041
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,898
but you are the bottom two
All Stars of the week.

1042
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,137
Miz Cracker, you need to decide

1043
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,673
which of the bottom queens
you will eliminate

1044
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:31,175
if you win the lip sync

1045
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:36,013
against this week's
secret lip sync assassin.

1046
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,249
And the rest of you
will cast your votes

1047
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:42,954
for which bottom queen
you think should get the chop.

1048
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,724
Now, while you deliberate
in the werkroom,

1049
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:50,761
the judges and I
will be baking cookies.

1050
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,631
Ooh!

1051
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,033
Thank you, ladies.
You may leave the stage.end act

1052
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,604
Hello.

1053
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,205
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

1054
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:04,375
It feels so good
to win the challenge.

1055
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,377
I'm so relieved.

1056
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,479
It's like being
a 39-year-old woman in Hollywood

1057
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,814
and getting an Oscar.

1058
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:14,185
You're like... [exhales]

1059
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:15,686
What's going on, guys?

1060
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,021
Did you win?

1061
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,022
I won.

1062
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,023
-What?
-Congrats!

1063
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:20,024
Thank you.

1064
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,959
♪ I'm in the bottom ♪

1065
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,962
-♪ I'm in the bottom, too ♪
-What? You're lying.

1066
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,097
What did you guys think
it was gonna be?

1067
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:28,165
We thought that you guys
would be in the top.

1068
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,001
-The top, yeah.
-Same.

1069
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,737
[both laugh]

1070
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,305
If this was a court of law,

1071
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,374
I'm definitely
gonna say objection,

1072
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,075
because, no, ma'am.

1073
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,810
Why am I in the bottom?

1074
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:44,782
Now is time for me
to talk to two people

1075
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,350
that I thought murdered this

1076
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:49,487
about why they think
they should stay.

1077
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,188
Pleading your case in this game

1078
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,823
is like lip syncing
for your life.

1079
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,126
I'm trying to see
which of these girls

1080
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:57,194
is going to turn it out
on the sofa.

1081
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,529
I just wanna hear from you

1082
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,933
why you wanna be here,
why you deserve to be here.

1083
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,634
Of course I wanna be here.

1084
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:07,738
I want to be here because I want
to prove that I am an All Star.

1085
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:11,142
I wanted to prove that
I am that girl, you know?

1086
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:15,146
I am that queen,
and I am one of the best.

1087
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,282
This sucks.

1088
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,917
Right now, I don't know
what my strategy is,

1089
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,920
because I'm sad, I'm mad,

1090
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,258
and the one person I don't
wanna have to plead my case to

1091
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,426
is Cracker.

1092
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:35,032
Do you feel like you showed
something different this season

1093
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,801
than you showed in Season 10?

1094
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:40,037
When I left Season 10,
I was destroyed,

1095
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,739
because I felt like
I was a failure,

1096
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,343
and I felt like
I did not represent me.

1097
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:49,046
This time around,
I feel like me has been here.

1098
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:52,083
And you have, like,
come out of your shell so much.

1099
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:58,122
We've had friction here,
but any troubles that we have

1100
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,924
have absolutely nothing to do

1101
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,727
with the decisions
I make today at all.

1102
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:06,764
However the vote goes today,
it's just a game.

1103
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,633
And I accept the fate,
what it is.

1104
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,568
Yeah. [sighs]

1105
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:12,870
I feel like
this is an opportunity

1106
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,473
for us to hear out
our sis India.

1107
00:46:15,473 --> 00:46:17,408
Yeah. How are you feeling
right now, India?

1108
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:21,879
Crushed, because I felt like
I delivered something so strong,

1109
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,614
and I felt like
I was gonna be in the top.

1110
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,750
I felt I delivered
the whole scene.

1111
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,152
I felt very comfortable,
I felt funny.

1112
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:29,887
Yeah.

1113
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,523
And I felt like she held back

1114
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,226
in the performance
just a little bit.

1115
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,161
Where they said
that it laid flat,

1116
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,362
she could have built that up.

1117
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,264
I'm not going home.

1118
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,099
I'm not giving up, no.

1119
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,467
No signs of weakness here.

1120
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,070
I'll fight. I am a monster.

1121
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,073
Why do you think you should
be here, deserve to be here?

1122
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:51,976
I think that
everyone can see my drive

1123
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,412
and they can see my passion
for drag.

1124
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,247
Like, it's in my blood.

1125
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,849
I felt very strong
about the performance.

1126
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,985
I stepped out of my comfort zone
completely.

1127
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,319
I'm not tapping out.

1128
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,221
-I don't wanna go home.
-Yeah.

1129
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:05,790
Bitch, I wanna be here.

1130
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,559
Do you feel that Mayhem

1131
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,962
has shown everything
that she has to show?

1132
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:15,599
I was a little upset during
the challenge working with her,

1133
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,734
because prior to it,

1134
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:19,203
we were so, like,
oh, we're gonna do this.

1135
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:22,740
And when we got out there,
like...girl.

1136
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,842
You felt like she didn't
get in there and get dirty.

1137
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,110
Yeah.

1138
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,479
And you feel like
you did not hold back at all?

1139
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:30,281
I didn't. Absolutely not.

1140
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:33,184
I will say this about India.
She's fighting hard.

1141
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,153
She's like,
"Look, I need to be here.

1142
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,855
"I could be in the bottom
to the very end.

1143
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,724
I'll bottom my way to the top
if I have to."

1144
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:41,859
Go on.

1145
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,327
I'm really gagged.

1146
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,362
We did not see it
going this way.

1147
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,364
I had fun
with the challenge yesterday,

1148
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,800
I felt comfortable
with the challenge,

1149
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,936
and I stand by it.

1150
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,037
We were committed.

1151
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,939
I'm proud of my scene partner,

1152
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:58,542
because she stepped up

1153
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,245
and was committed
along with me.

1154
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:05,449
I can't say anything else
other than I'm gagged, too.

1155
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,019
I guess I'm just trying
to take everything in.

1156
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,590
It's always interesting to hear
what the judges have had to say.

1157
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,924
But you know what?
This is our choice.

1158
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,993
-Exactly.
-It's our choice.

1159
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,896
What matters to me
is what my peers think,

1160
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,031
because you know
what a good queen is.

1161
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:26,237
So if you see me,
that's what matters to me.

1162
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,873
I'm happy with
whatever the outcome is.

1163
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,642
God.

1164
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,479
The first week I vote for her,
and she's crazy upset,

1165
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,047
and she's taking it personally.

1166
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,550
And now, honestly, I don't know

1167
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,252
why she's not
fighting harder for herself.

1168
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,321
Like, who is this Mayhem,
and why have you checked out?

1169
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,065
Now, I know what
y'all are thinking.

1170
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,001
This is India's third week
in the bottom.

1171
00:48:57,001 --> 00:49:01,138
But Mayhem voted
for me to go home last week,

1172
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:07,411
so I feel like it would be rude
of me to not return the favor.

1173
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,787
Oh, my gosh.

1174
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,030
I love you so much.
I'm so proud of you.

1175
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:31,168
I was a fan of drag
before I became a drag queen.

1176
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:34,238
India, I'm a fan of yours.

1177
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:41,011
Mayhem and I
traveled a rocky road,

1178
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:44,849
but it feels like she's blooming
in this competition,

1179
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,685
and there's a part of me that
wants to see what happens next.

1180
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:51,789
But does India deserve
to go home tonight?

1181
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:55,292
I just have to do what RuPaul
says:
"Don't fuck it up."

1182
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,162
Don't fuck it up, Cracker!end
act

1183
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:03,667
Welcome back, ladies.

1184
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,504
Miz Cracker, are you ready
to meet your opponent?

1185
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,240
I'm ready to tear it up.

1186
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,507
Good.

1187
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,676
It's time to present

1188
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:17,882
this week's lip sync assassin.

1189
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,589
Is that even a person?

1190
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,025
Ru-veal yourself!

1191
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,862
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

1192
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,698
O-M-G.

1193
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,939
-Aw, sis!
-Oh!

1194
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:43,474
That's my sister.

1195
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,243
Oh, my God!

1196
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:47,444
Aah!

1197
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:53,350
Holy shit,
the queen, Morgan McMichaels.

1198
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,586
[applause]

1199
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:56,921
[laughs]

1200
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,356
She's like, "Why you mad?
Why you mad? Why you mad?"

1201
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,791
I'm like, "I don't know,
I'm not mad!"

1202
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,797
The lip sync assassin
is my best friend, best friend.

1203
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:10,000
Like, my best friend,
best friend, best friend.

1204
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,970
For 20 whole years,
Morgan McMichaels,

1205
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,439
and I'm in the bottom.

1206
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:19,076
Awkward.

1207
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,645
Ladies,
Morgan holds the lipstick

1208
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:27,184
of the queen the group
has chosen to go home.

1209
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:33,023
Now, if Morgan wins, the queen
on her lipstick gets the chop.

1210
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,726
Are you ready to slay?

1211
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,161
Yes, Mother.

1212
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:38,629
Yes, Mama Ru.

1213
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:40,798
Two queens stand before me.

1214
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:45,736
Miz Cracker, this is your chance
to impress me,

1215
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:48,939
win $20.000,

1216
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,442
and earn the power

Morgan McMichaels.

1258
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:37,374
You're a winner, baby.

1259
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,343
Thank you very much.

You've earned a cash tip
of $20.000.

1267
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:06,970
Thank you, Mama Ru.

1268
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:12,609
And a tie means two queens
could be going home tonight.

1270
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:17,748

Oh, my God.

1272
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,953
Will the bottom queens
please step forward?

1273
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:31,728
With great power
comes great responsibility.

1274
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:38,669
Morgan, which queen
has the group chosen

1275
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,237
to get the chop?

1276
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,642
The group has chosen...

1277
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,414
Mayhem.

1278
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:59,022
Miz Cracker, which queen
have you chosen to get the chop?

1279
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,157
I've had to split hairs

1280
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:02,859
to figure out
who should go home today,

1281
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,662
but listening to my heart,

1282
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,899
I would like
to send Mayhem home.

1283
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,373
As it is written,

1284
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,975
so it shall be done.

1285
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:23,947
Mayhem, you are
and will always be an All Star.

1286
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:28,218
Now sashay away.

1287
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,687
Thanks for inviting me
back to the party.

1288
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,689
I love you so much.

1289
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,358
Kill it, bitch.

1290
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:36,193
Even though I've been doing drag
all these years,

1291
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:37,794
you still learn and grow.

1292
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:38,829
Don't be sorry.

1293
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:39,896
I'll see you
in a little bit, girl.

1294
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,164
We gonna go to Sizzler.

1295
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,767
I leave here
in a better head space

1296
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,169
than I did
when I left Season 10,

1297
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:47,437
and that's what I wanted to do.

1298
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:50,107
I wanted to push myself
and learn something new about me

1299
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:51,408
and have a good time,

1300
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,709
and I did all of that,

1301
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:56,647
So my journey here is exactly
what I wanted it to be.

1302
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:59,016
I am the queen!

1303
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,150
[all laugh]

1304
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,754

the last person at a party.

You gotta know
when it's time to leave.

Con-drag-ulations, All Stars.

1309
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,767
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1310
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,969
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1311
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,470
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1312
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,272
-Amen!
-Amen!

The girl who's been in
the bottom three weeks in a row

1326
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,948
is taking a risk?

1327

Yeah.

as one of the best Snatch Game
performances in history.
