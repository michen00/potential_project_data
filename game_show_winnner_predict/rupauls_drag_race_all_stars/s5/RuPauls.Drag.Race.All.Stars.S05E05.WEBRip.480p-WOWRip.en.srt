00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,707
RuPaul:
Previously on All Stars...

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,876
One Shea.

3
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:09,877
Touché.

4
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:10,911
What in the what-what?

5
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,179
Shea, I voted for you.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,281
The next vote for Shea was me.

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,917
For this week's maxi-challenge,

8
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:23,156
you'll be caught behaving badly
on the gossip show SheMZ.

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,424
Miz Cracker! Miz Cracker!

10
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,226
Oh! Miz Cracker!
One question!

11
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,962
You just came into my store,
and you took everything!

12
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,964
I'm addicted to licking.
It makes me feel good.

13
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,700
Lick it! Lick it!

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,035
That can't be safe.

15
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,405
It took a long time to get
where y'all were gonna go.

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,173
It was a little bit
of a one-note for me.

17
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,011
Miz Cracker, con-drag-ulations.

18
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,679
You are the top All Star
of the week.

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,916
[applause]

20
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:52,085
What matters to me
is what my peers think.

21
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,421
I'm happy
with whatever the outcome is.

22
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,124
Who is this Mayhem,
and why have you checked out?

23
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,593
Ru-veal yourself!

24
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,729
-Oh!
-Oh, sis!

25
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,897
[cheers and applause]

26
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,867
Morgan McMichaels,
you're a winner, baby.

27
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:11,171
Miz Cracker,
you are also a winner, baby.

28
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,011
Which queen has the group chosen
to get the chop?

29
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,513
Mayhem.

30
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:23,016
Miz Cracker,
which queen have you chosen?

31
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,019
I would like
to send Mayhem home.

32
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,723
Mayhem, sashay away.end recap

33
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,704
Let's have a seat
over here, darling.

34
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:49,209
Being in the werkroom
after Mayhem's gone feels weird.

35
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:53,380
Four girls have gotten chopped,
and it is a tight competition.

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,183
But no matter what, I got a win!

37
00:01:56,183 --> 00:02:00,087
Congratulations
on your $20.000 win.

38
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,521
$20.000.

39
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,623
Girl, I feel like I am 35

40
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,993
after a four-minute club remix.

41
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,128
I was just exhausted.

42
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,396
How do you feel?

43
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,965
Uh, I am so glad
to still be here.

44
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,433
Thank you.

45
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,936
That could have been
a double elimination.

46
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,337
Like, gag.

47
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,473
That was insane to me.

48
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,674
Ooh, we were, like, arr?

49
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,543
Should we look in the box
and see the votes?

50
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,245
-You have the power.
-Oh, yeah, stretch it. Oh.

51
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,347
Girl, stretch those long arms.

52
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,348
Girl.

53
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,983
Mayhem.

54
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,352
Mayhem. Mayhem.

55
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,689
Mayhem.
Mayhem.

56
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,924
She voted for herself.

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,462
I feel like
if you vote for yourself,

58
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,930
what you also
should be voting for

59
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,732
is an ass-whipping
from the rest of the cast

60
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,234
for taking up a slot.

61
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:51,304
I did not come here
to give up, okay?

62
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,739
I can't even spell that.

63
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,342
Imma call my mama, and she
gonna come and whup yo ass.

64
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,780
You never give up
on your dreams.

65
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,516
Do you guys feel like anyone
is the clear winner

66
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,850
or top right now?

67
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,720
If we're going based off of,
like, performance,

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,689
it would probably be
frontrunner, second,

69
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,492
and I'm pulling up
right behind.

70
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,362
Juju, I think you are
the frontrunner right now.

71
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,097
No, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't say that.

72
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,199
What about
Miss Quiet over here, too?

73
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,901
No, she has been consistent
like me,

74
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,336
but, like, we haven't win yet.

75
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,471
Yeah, we haven't won yet.

76
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,373
But I am tired,
and I wanna get outta drag,

77
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,108
so good night.

78
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,811
Started from the top.
Now I'm in the bottom.

79
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,512
Three weeks in a row.

80
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,114
#PowerBottom.

81
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,649
It's just so fucking tight.

82
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,950
Ooh, it's so tight.

83
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,285
-It's knotted.
-Oh, my God.

84
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,488
Headed into this week,
I need to get crazy, get wild.

85
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,556
Pblblbl.

86
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,790
[laughs]

87
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,626
I really need to just let loose.

88
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,596
I could just barely
get my finger in it.

89
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,699
Ooh, I'm so excited
I wanna shake it a little.

90
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,800
Oh, it's so tight!

91
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,304
Shea, just do it!

92
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:01,308
I've still got a ton of tricks
up my sleeve and my pants leg.

93
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,913
RuPaul: The winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars

94

because even if I bottom today,

107
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,119
y'all can't get rid of me.
I just won.

me getting eliminated

-Oh, my goodness.

111
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,326
I am the queen!

112
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,327
-Girl.
-Aw.

113
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,363
"Short and simple,
just like me."

114
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,797
I love you, queen.

115
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,132
-I love you, queen!
-She's the queen!

116
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,301
-Queen girl!
-Queen of the party!

117
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,736
Party!

118
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,105
[alarm]
Oh!

119
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,239
RuPaul: Ooh, girl.

120
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,008
She done already
done had herses.

121
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,576
Here we go!

122
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,279
Roses are red,
violets are blue-ish.

123
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,782
I hope you meet a nice boy
as long as he's Jewish!

124
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,117
Yay!

125
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:20,754
So snatchmaker, snatchmaker,
make me a match,

126
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,323
and the crown
could be yours, bubbeleh.

127
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
Let's hope he's a mensch.

128
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,361
[laughter and applause]

129
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,863
-Yes! Make me a match!
-Yes!

130
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,997
I think we all know
what that means.

131
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,566
I think we know
what's happening.

132
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,634
Hello, hello, hello.

133
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,102
-Oh, hi!
-Hi, ladies!

134
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,404
Festive!

135
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,073
-It's so groovy!
-Nice shoes.

136
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,943
My babushkas, I'm kvelling!

137
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:46,179
Now, for this week's
maxi-challenge,

138
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,148
we're gonna be playing...

139
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,382
the Snatch Game of Love.

140
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,651
[cheers and applause]

141
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,720
#AllStars5.

142
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,189
So get ready to open your hearts

143
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,260
and bust out your funniest
celebrity impersonations.

144
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,496
And remember, if you do well
in Snatch Game,

145
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,198
everyone remembers.

146
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,133
And if you bomb,

147
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,502
they really remember.

148
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,503
No pressure.

149
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,340
All Stars, start your engines,

150
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,408
and may the best woman win.

151
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,310
[laughs]

152
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,945
-Yes!
-Yes!

153
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,449
Come on, All Stars 5.
Let's get snatch-ning.

154
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,717
-Snatch-ning!
-Yes!

155
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,655
Snatch Game
is the hardest thing

156
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,257
that any human being
will ever do.

157
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,326
But I'm excited
for the Snatch Game of Love,

158
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,594
because it's all about

159
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,464
what would your character do
to snatch some love.

160
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,798
I never got to do Snatch Game.

161
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,734
-Oh, you didn't?
-No.

162
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,903
It's not like "Michelle Visage
is so old that--"

163
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,606
and you're like, what would
Alice in Wonderland say

164
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,275
about Michelle Visage, you know.

165
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:55,148
I wanna know if I should wear
this black turban or...

166
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,286
this black turban?

167
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:02,522
I'm doing Eartha Kitt
for my Snatch Game of Love.

168
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,192
She was Catwoman, and I don't
know if you guys know this,

169
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,395
but my best friends
are my two cats.

170
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:12,799
Here's Pris. Here's Mister.

171
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,769
I know! [kisses]

172
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,237
Wait, didn't Valentina do that?

173
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,238
-She did.
-She did.

174
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,306
How are you gonna beat that?

175
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,076
I'm going to play up
her movements

176
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,211
and her catlike... [purrs].

177
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,447
Eartha Kitt's been done
two times, girl.

178
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,615
By Chi Chi Devayne...

179
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,949
[all laugh]

180
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,518
And by Valentina.

181
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,219
Monotonous!

182
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:38,158
So I am going to stand out by
serving up this piece of pussy.

183
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,793
[cat yowls]

184
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,561
-Shea.
-Yes, ma'am?

185
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,996
Who are you doing?

186
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,231
Let's see if you can guess.

187
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,203
Oh, my God.

188
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,172
-Flavor Flav?
-Flavor Flav?

189
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,207
Yeah. [laughs]

190
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,209
-That is so great.
-Wow.

191
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,245
I mean, like, who else for
a dating show of love, right?

192
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,246
Any fears?

193
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,782
Oh, yes.

194
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,919
Look, I was safe
with Naomi Campbell,

195
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,555
but safe is not the way to go.

196
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,190
Flavor, what time is it?

197
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,491
Uh, my batteries are out.

198
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,661
Flavor Flav is drag.

199
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,796
Flavor Flav
is camp.

200
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,899
But it could be a risk,
playing a guy for Snatch Game,

201
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,102
and I'm skurt.end act

202
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,174
I'm nervous.
I'm not gonna lie.

203
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,076
It is a very difficult
challenge.

204
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,981
Today's maxi-challenge
is Snatch Game of Love.

205
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,983
I did not do Snatch Game
on my season,

206
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:41,454
so this has been the one
that I've been dreading.

207
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,290
You need to make RuPaul laugh.

208
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,325
A lot of pressure.

209
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,727
Hey, All Stars!

210
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:48,862
Hey!

211
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,630
It's time for me
to get an impression

212
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,432
of your impersonations.

213
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,967
-Oh, wow.
-All right.

214
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:54,968
Oh, really?

215
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,636
Alexis Mateo.

216
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,871
Hello, RuPaul.

217
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,173
Now, you ain't gotta tell me
who that hair is.

218
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,908
-I know whose hair that is.
-Who is it?

219
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,243
That's Walter Mercado, baby.

220
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,712
Yes, Walter Mercado.

221
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,147
Do you know about
Walter Mercado?

222
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,214
Are you kidding?

223
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,550
Walter Mercado is a superstar.

224
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,789
In Latin America, this is,
like, the iconic Liberace.

225
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,891
How will you make
Walter Mercado funny?

226
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,293
The fact that he relies so much

227
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,129
on horoscope, planets,
and energy.

228
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,498
So if I ask Walter Mercado
right now,

229
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,667
what did you have for breakfast,
Walter Mercado?

230
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,404
I really have Uranus
for breakfast.

231
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,373
-[laughs]
-How about that, Ru?

232
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,942
It's exaggerating
what he already is.

233
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,179
Yes, well, I can't wait
to see Walter Mercado out there.

234
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:43,349
And I am so excited for him
to read you your future.

235
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,285
All right.
See you in a minute.

236
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,253
Bye, Ru.

237
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,755
-Hello, India.
-Hi, Ru.

238
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,623
Now, you've never done
Snatch Game before.

239
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,959
I've never, and so I want
to take a risk, and--

240
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,661
-Oh, you're gonna take a risk.
-I'm taking a risk.

241
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,264
Oh, the girl who's been in
the bottom three weeks in a row

242
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,632
is taking a risk.

243
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,704
So I have chosen
Jeffree Star.

244
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,573
-Jeffree Star.
-Jeffree Star.

245
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:07,574
Wow.

246
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,542
Beauty icon, YouTube sensation,

247
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,512
which is a risk
because many people love him,

248
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,680
and many people hate him.

249
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,814
Kind of like my life story.

250
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,484
But, no, no, I think
that's a fabulous idea.

251
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,419
Just how you gonna
make him funny?

252
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:22,422
He's actually already, like,
funny with his quirky remarks,

253
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,524
and he's very, like,
girl, shook.

254
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:25,925
Like, can't relate.

255
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,894
It's very those little remarks.

256
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,830
You know, I always tell people,
you gotta have those one-liners

257
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,434
that are ridiculous
but always work.

258
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,469
I can always
answer someone with,

259
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,137
"I don't see how that's
any of your business."

260
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,239
Ask me a question.

261
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,740
What do you think
of the weather outside?

262
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,408
I don't see how
that's any of your business.

263
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,544
[all laugh]

264
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,415
-It's always funny.
-It is so good, yeah.

265
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,184
And so, you know,
have those prepared.

266
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,286
If I ask you a question,
like Jeffree Star,

267
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,021
what'd you have for breakfast
this morning?

268
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,156
Um, I had some fucking
marijuana,

269
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,093
and, yeah, that's
none of your business.

270
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,830
So, yeah, I've got
a lot of preparing to do.

271
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,398
All right, baby.
I'll see you out there.

272
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,700
Thank you so much.
Comedy?

273
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,936
Me? Yeah.

274
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,639
Oof.

275
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,575
Why, I declare, Blair St. Clair.

276
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,010
Hey, Ru, what's up?

277
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,680
I see a short little
bobbed wig over there.

278
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,749
Oh, okay, yeah,
I know who it is already.

279
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,950
You're gonna do Ellen.

280
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,951
Ellen DeGeneres.

281
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,419
Have you done Ellen before?

282
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,988
I haven't, but people told me
that they get Ellen from me.

283
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,624
So if you're Ellen,
I'm gonna ask you a question,

284
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,195
and you answer me
in your Ellen voice, okay?

285
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,532
Hey, Ellen, what'd you have
for breakfast?

286
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,901
Oh, I had a kid.
It's a baby goat.

287
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,269
I--I--I love baby goats.

288
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,504
Baby goats are my favorite.

289
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,205
You know,
I--I--I love baby goats.

290
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,206
Baby goats.

291
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,174
I think I'm a kid at heart.

292
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,309
-Okay.
-Yeah.

293
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,344
Your Ellen
didn't make me laugh just now.

294
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,514
It was an interesting
character study,

295
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,715
but it didn't make me laugh.

296
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,617
-Okay.
-I want you to succeed.

297
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,786
I want all you kids to succeed.

298
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,354
I want you to make me laugh.

299
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,056
This is scary.

300
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,224
I know.

301
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,460
[mouthing words]

302
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,595
Maybe I should rethink this.

303
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,896
Yeah, mm.

304
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,799
RuPaul's not buying
Ellen DeGeneres,

305
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,634
but there is no option B for me.

306
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,806
It's A or nothing.

307
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,874
Make me friggin' laugh.

308
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,276
-I will.
-Okay. All right.

309
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,446
Ooh.

310
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,981
Ugh!end act

311
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,683
Michelle:
From the heart of Hollywood,

312
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,820
it's time to play
Snatch Game of Love.

313
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,057
And here's the snatchmaker
himself, RuPaul!

314
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,661
Welcome.
Love is in the air.

315
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,798
So let's meet
our celebrity snatchelorettes.

316
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:51,404
First up, Oscar, Grammy,
Golden Globe winner Lady Gaga.

317
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,805
Hello, Ru.

318
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,508
You know, there could be
a hundred people in a room,

319
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,910
and maybe 99 of them
don't believe in you.

320
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,047
But one of them has $100.000
to give away,

321
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,049
so I'm happy to be here.

322
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,351
Okay. Up next,

323
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:10,423
it's the legendary astrologer
Walter Mercado.

324
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,659
Thank you, divine,
for having me.

325
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,327
Now, do you see love
in your future?

326
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,130
I see many big things
in my future.

327
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,398
Oh, really, like what?

328
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,666
One of them is not love.

329
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:22,335
[laughs]

330
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:26,305
And next, we have makeup mogul
Jeffree Star is here.

331
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,907
Hi, how are ya?

332
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,208
Now, Jeffree, I wanna know.

333
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,112
What's the foundation
for a healthy relationship?

334
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,684
Oh, baby, the foundation
is all body fluids.

335
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,553
All body fluids.

336
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,288
It's a really strong foundation.

337
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,057
All right.

338
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:48,695
Lovers, are you ready
to play the Snatch Game of Love?

339
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,630
Ooh, I'm divine even.

340
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,066
Let's close that sugar wall.

341
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:57,570
All right.
Originally from the A-T-L,

342
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,874
our first snatchelor
is a real peach.

343
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,143
Welcome, Tommy Dorfman.

344
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,647
[cheers and applause]

345
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,115
-Hi, Tommy.
-Hi, Ru.

346
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,017
Look at that outfit.
That is so gorgeous.

347
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,118
Thank you.

348
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,053
Tommy, are you feeling the love?

349
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,855
Primarily from my gut down.

350
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,290
Oh, from your gut down.
That's a good sign.

351
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,358
But it might be because the belt
is cutting off my circulation.

352
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,627
[all laugh]

353
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,197
All right, now
here's how the game works.

354
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,967
You ask our celebrities
some very personal questions,

355
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,304
and they try to woo you
with their answers.

356
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:35,508
Now, when the buzzer goes off,
you choose your dream snatch.

357
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,877
All right, let's get started.

358
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,814
Okay, contestant number one,
finish this sentence.

359
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,885
Women are jealous of my blank.

360
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,221
My sense of smell.

361
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,555
Aw.

362
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,257
Is that too on the nose?

363
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,525
Perfect.

364
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,659
Contestant number two.

365
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,029
-Mm-hmm.
-Women are jealous of my blank.

366
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,799
Women are always jealous
about my sixth sense,

367
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,768
because I can
predict the future,

368
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,736
and I can see the present.

369
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,105
I bet you you have a belt
right now.

370
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,242
[laughs]
Wow, that's uncanny!

371
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,243
That is unbelievable.

372
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,778
Incredible.

373
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,346
Contestant number three.

374
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:18,684
Women are jealous
of my big pink vault.

375
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,553
Vault?

376
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,388
It holds many things.

377
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,523
Oh, like money and stuff.

378
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,159
And private belongings.

379
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,160
Oh, okay.

380
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,997
All right.

381
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,867
It's hard to watch.

382
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,202
Contestant number two,

383
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:40,173
based on what contestant
number one is wearing right now,

384
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,375
what would their fashion line
be called?

385
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,477
Well, I'm looking here,

386
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,579
and I think the fashion line
could be called

387
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,581
A Star is Born Into Poverty.

388
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,717
It was my question, dumb bitch.

389
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,519
[all laugh]

390
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,688
But you didn't see
that one coming!

391
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,557
I did.

392
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,659
Well, do you wanna answer?

393
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,629
Yes. It looks like
purple toilet paper.

394
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,765
That's all.

395
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,533
All right,
contestant number three,

396
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,837
gently blow
into contestant two's face.

397
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,471
[blows]
Contestant two,

398
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,874
what does contestant three's
breath smell like?

399
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,109
It smells like confusion.

400
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,845
[all laugh]

401
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,947
And lots of regrets.

402
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,449
But I could have tell you that

403
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,451
without even smelling
her breath,

404
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,120
because I am a psychic,
and I can tell.

405
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,090
She's confused
and she regrets being here.

406
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,027
[all laugh]

407
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,295
Contestant three,

408
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,665
what does contestant
number two's breath smell like?

409
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,936
Whew. Smells like a cheap wig,
cheap dollar-store cosmetics,

410
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,771
vodka, with a splash of regret.

411
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,174
-Mm.
-Whew.

412
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,508
You didn't see
that one coming.

413
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,244
Mm-mm. Neither did you.

414
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,347
[all laugh]
Oh!

415
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,615
Contestant number one,

416
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,984
what flavor of ice cream
best describes you,

417
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,686
and convince me
why I should lick you.

418
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,288
Well, as an Italian New Yorker

419
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,558
who's a New Yorker
with an Italian background,

420
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,695
I don't think I'm an ice cream,
I'm more of a gelato.

421
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,598
And if you wanna know about
my flavor, I can't remember.

422
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,799
I forgotto.

423
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,434
[all laugh]

424
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,103
Can't relate.

425
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,774
I thought I was
an American horror story.

426
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,009
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

427
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,744
The Star is Unborn.

428
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,747
Jeffree Star
is unborn right now.

429
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,083
I keep it very simple, you know.

430
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,453
Just like my hair,
I'm gonna say vanilla,

431
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,789
because everybody loves
fucking vanilla, man.

432
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,890
Pick me.

433
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,725
[all laugh]

434
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,661
It doesn't take
a sixth sense, baby.

435
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,062
[all laugh]

436
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,131
I'm gonna space.

437
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,599
[all laugh]

438
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,034
Contestant number three.

439
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,469
Well, I wrote a little
something for you, okay?

440
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,638
I'll give you Dairy Queen,

441
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,641
pink dreams,
tongue all on your ice cream.

442
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,210
Open up my thighs,
show you the surprise.

443
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,679
Oh, wow.

444
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,680
Ahh.

445
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,348
I didn't see that one coming.

446
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:05,084
Nope.

447
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,619
It was dark.

448
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,521
To cool that down.

449
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,323
-Contestant number three.
-Mm-hmm?

450
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,425
If you could possess
one superpower,

451
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,127
what would it be
and how would you use it on me?

452
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,597
Probably to fly, so we can
get up outta this bitch,

453
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,366
I can grab you, we can fly,
and I can feed you

454
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:24,070
this ice cream sandwich
between these legs.

455
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,137
He don't want it.

456
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,639
-[laughs]
-He don't want it.

457
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,040
I can see it in your future.

458
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,275
Did you see that in the stars?

459
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,379
It's in the universe now.

460
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,314
[all laugh]

461
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,650
[buzzer]
Oh, there's our buzzer.

462
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,652
Time's up, Tommy.

463
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,520
Who do you choose?

464
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,290
Will it be
snatchelorette number one,

465
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,760
number two, or number three?

466
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,329
I'm gonna have to go
with contestant number two.

467
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,965
[cheers and applause]
Oh, I saw that coming.

468
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,500
I am psychic.

469
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,203
But before you meet
snatchelorette number two,

470
00:18:57,203 --> 00:19:00,072
let's meet
who you didn't choose.

471
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,708
Tommy, meet Lady Gaga.

472
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,412
Whoa!

473
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,047
Such a pleasure.

474
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,183
Oh, my goodness. Mwah.

475
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,320
Tommy, say hello
to Jeffree Star.

476
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,955
Hi, how are you?

477
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,123
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

478
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,457
Call me.
He's not a real psychic.

479
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,759
He'll never see it coming.

480
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,661
[all laugh]

481
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,663
All right, Tommy, a sugar wall

482
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,932
stands between you
and your dream snatch.

483
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,968
-Whew.
-Move that wall!

484
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,704
Tommy, it's Walter Mercado!

485
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,006
-Tommy, little Tommy!
-Wow.

486
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,007
Come here.

487
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
Give a hug.
Gimme a hug.

488
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,444
You smell good.

489
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:42,214
I was looking in my future,
and I saw you coming.

490
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,251
Yes.
[all laugh]

491
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:49,855
Well, there you have it.
Another snatch made in heaven.

492
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,057
[cheers and applause]
Don't go anywhere.

493
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,958
We'll be right back

494
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,227
with more Snatch Game of Love
after this.

495
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,629
After you!

496
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,497
Good luck, you two.
Have fun.end act

497
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,637
Welcome back
to the Snatch Game of Love.

498
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:09,375
Let's meet our next batch
of celebrity snatchelorettes.

499
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,445
First up, it's America's
sweetheart,
Ellen DeGeneres.

500
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,647
How are you, Ru?

501
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,715
Now, Ellen,
when it comes to romance,

502
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,751
how important
is a sense of humor?

503
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,885
Romance?

504
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,288
I already have a wife at home.

505
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,722
You do, don't you?

506
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,058
Yeah, what am I doing here?

507
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,461
All right,
she's back, back, back again.

508
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,464
It's the legendary Eartha Kitt.

509
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:35,000
[purrs] Hello, kitty girl.

510
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,272
Yes. Now, Eartha,
does love have nine lives?

511
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,176
-Love has many lives, like cats.
-Yes.

512
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,245
And I know Ellen
likes pussy, too.

513
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,849
[all laugh]

514
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,319
The godfather
of reality dating shows,

515
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,454
it's Flavor Flav.

516
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,124
Flavor Flav!

517
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,025
What's up, my boy Ru?

518
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,193
Hey, Flav.

519
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,896
I'm so excited to be here,
I'm on cloud nine.

520
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,865
I feel like my feet
can't touch the floor.

521
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:06,899
Look at 'em!

522
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,336
RuPaul, she scares me.

523
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,504
Is it she?

524
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,106
Gender is a construct, man.
Tear it apart.

525
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,309
I'm stranger than fiction,
but better than art!

526
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,347
You know what I'm saying?

527
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,615
Whoo!

528
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,383
Oh, this is gonna be good.

529
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:29,088
All right, are you all ready
to snatch a snatchelor tonight?

530
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,089
Never been readier.

531
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,191
I love a good snatch. Whoo!

532
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:35,561
Close the sugar wall!

533
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:41,500
Our next snatchelor hails
from the Great White North,

534
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,669
but why it gotta be white?

535
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,671
Please welcome
Jeffrey Bowyer-Chapman.

536
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,277
Hi, Jeffrey.

537
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,912
Hi. It's been a while.
You look good.

538
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:53,913
Thank you.

539
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,549
So you're single again, I see.

540
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,117
Looking for love.

541
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:01,353
Wait. Wait a minute.

542
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,298
Is that the shirt I bought you?

543
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,466
It still smells like you.

544
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,503
[record scratch]

545
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,171
[exhales]

546
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,312
Okay. Let's play
the Snatch Game of Love.

547
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,546
All right, let's do this.

548
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,082
Contestant number one,
finish this sentence.

549
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,220
When people meet me, the first
thing they notice is blank.

550
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,754
I'm gay!

551
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,356
[all laugh]

552
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,124
And you know,
it's working out for me now.

553
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,028
No complaints and not many
symptoms these days.

554
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,763
All right, contestant
number two, same question.

555
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:50,970
The first thing somebody notices
about me is my big, wet smile.

556
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,172
[all laugh]

557
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,207
-[purrs]
-Contestant number three.

558
00:22:55,207 --> 00:23:02,081
What they normally notice
is my big, fat, 14-inch clock.

559
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,949
You know what time it is?

560
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:06,619
No, really, I'm asking.

561
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,022
My clock's been stuck on 4:20
since 1985.

562
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,223
[all laugh]

563
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,126
Whoo!

564
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,461
[purrs]

565
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,297
Contestant number two,
I'm originally from Canada,

566
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,233
so if we went up there
for a winter visit,

567
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,202
how would you
keep me warm at night?

568
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:26,972
I would sensually
walk to the thermostat...

569
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:35,180
and turn up the thermostat
to a sensible 74.

570
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,351
[all laugh]

571
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,722
I need a woman like you
in my life.

572
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:44,790
If this shit don't work out,

573
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,358
we should bang
in the parking lot.

574
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,427
[all laugh]

575
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,030
Juju and Shea
are doing so great,

576
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,032
I should feel terrible.

577
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:56,168
But I'm laughing too hard
to worry about that.

578
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,404
This is a masterpiece.

579
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,873
Contestant number three,
same question.

580
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,608
The best way to keep warm

581
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,678
is to pile in a bed
with six other bitches.

582
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:09,248
And by bitches,
I mean teacup Pomeranians.

583
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,749
Them dogs are so cute.

584
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,117
[all laugh]

585
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,085
They're all fuzzy and shit.

586
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,520
And contestant number one.

587
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,789
Well, you know, I'd have to
bring the necessities with me.

588
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,257
I'd have to bring
my butler Batu,

589
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,961
my gardener Rosa,
and my housekeeper Jennifer,

590
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,996
and we'd all pile up together
like penguins

591
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,331
and squawk to keep warm.

592
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,699
[squawks]

593
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,033
All right.

594
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,468
[crickets]

595
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,636
White people, right?

596
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,772
Back in my day,
we called this "white noise."

597
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:34,873
[all laugh]

598
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,475
Contestant number three,

599
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,011
starting with the line
"roses are red,"

600
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,715
recite a romantic poem
about why I should pick you.

601
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:43,816
[clears throat]

602
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:48,654
Roses are red, buses is yellow,

603
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,223
I just realized...

604
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,825
that you are a fellow.

605
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,294
[all laugh]

606
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,062
Yeah, boy!

607
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,497
[all laugh]

608
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,732
And contestant number two.

609
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:03,202
Roses are red, violets are blue,

610
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,739
pick me 'cause I love you.

611
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,740
[all laugh]

612
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,009
That was mad creative.

613
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,845
You know, you remind me
a lot of my mama.

614
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,713
She was baldheaded, too.

615
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,815
[all laugh]

616
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,050
Contestant number one,

617
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,819
pretend that you're a frog
and I'm a prince,

618
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,654
and convince me to kiss you.

619
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,857
I don't think
I could seduce you.

620
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,493
I think I'll have to
pass it on to the next one.

621
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,794
All right.

622
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,929
Contestant number two,
same question.

623
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,432
Ribbit, ribbit.

624
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:39,071
I am a lady frog,
and you are a sweet prince.

625
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,141
I am convincing you.

626
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,442
[all laugh]

627
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,911
Oh, shit,
there goes my gold-plated ring.

628
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,782
You know how many child support
checks I didn't turn in

629
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,517
just so I could get
this shit?

630
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,786
[buzzer]

631
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:57,689
Oh, Jeffrey,
that means time is up.

632
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:02,127
It's time to decide
who snatched your heart.

633
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,298
Is it snatchelorette
number one,

634
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,468
number two, or number three?

635
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,103
Contestant number three.

636
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:14,706
Contestant
number three.

637
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:18,544
Flavor Flav, yeah!

638
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,779
[laughs]

639
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,815
That's what's up!
That's my boy!

640
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,616
Whoo!

641
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,751
All right, Jeffrey,

642
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,353
let's meet
the two snatchelorettes

643
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,655
you didn't choose.

644
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:32,558
Say hello to Ellen DeGeneres.

645
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,526
-Hi, there.
-Howdy! I'm Ellen.

646
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,528
-Good to meet you, Ellen.
-Let's take a selfie.

647
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,564
[all laugh]

648
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,565
-Adios.
-That's amazing.

649
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,633
Arrivederci, avocado!

650
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,968
[all laugh]

651
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:47,473
Jeffrey, say hello
to the great Eartha Kitt.

652
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,576
[purrs]
You're lost, my darling.

653
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,244
[all laugh]

654
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:55,013
Jeffrey, only
a thin, pink sugar wall

655
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,851
stands between you
and the snatch of your dreams.

656
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:04,156
Say hello to Flavor Flav!

657
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:08,494
Yeah, boy, what's up, what's up?

658
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,530
Aow, aow, aow, aow, aow, aow!

659
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,333
So what, we going
to Red Lobster or what?

660
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,534
Yeah, you got it.

661
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,036
All right. Biscuits on you!

662
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,873
And maybe later on me! Aow!

663
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,107
[all laugh]

664
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,877
Till next time,
everybody say, love.

665
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,178
-Love!
-Love!

666
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,581
Everybody say, Jeffrey,
why didn't you call me back?

667
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:33,452
Oh, Ru, you had me
at hello, hello, hello.

668
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:34,920
-What?
-Yeah.

669
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,923
[cheers and applause]

670
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,662
Way to go, RuPaula!

671
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,764
[cries]end act

672
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,903
Girl, yes!

673
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,006
Oh, my camel toe's
pretty loud, though.

674
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,708
Love that moose knuckle.
She's calling me.

675
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,311
I'm feeling pretty secure
about my performance yesterday.

676
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,847
I thought my Snatch Game
was amazing,

677
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,082
and I think I could win.

678
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,219
[kisses]
Send it to the universe.

679
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,554
[laughs]

680
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:09,788
You killed it.

681
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,423
I was surprised.

682
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,659
As I was doing it,
I was, like, oh, my God.

683
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,028
I loved your character, too.

684
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,263
-I think you did a good job.
-Eartha Kitt?

685
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,464
I know, third time's the charm.

686
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,066
That's right.
[both laugh]

687
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,135
If I have to say
f somebody is in trouble,

688
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,269
it might be India, right?

689
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,371
Here's the thing.

690
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,175
If she's in the bottom again,
then what do we do?

691
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:34,813
Because this would be,
what, her fourth time?

692
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,615
Her fourth time.

693
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,483
That is crazy.

694
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,652
India is my Season 3 sister,

695
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,088
so of course there's
more connection there

696
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,289
than the other girls.

697
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,224
I don't wanna see her
going home,

698
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,661
but I might be worried
for my sister.

699
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,830
How are you feeling, India?

700
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,532
I'm feeling good.

701
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:56,201
I mean, I've never done
Snatch Game before.

702
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,469
I'm sure
I could have made it funnier.

703
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,906
But you know what?
I did it. It's over with.

704
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,507
You feel proud?

705
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,076
Yeah.

706
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,213
-Hey, Walter Mercado.
-Huh?

707
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,449
Can you predict
who you think is in the top

708

I don't know that I get
the prom, necessarily,

871

to my prom looking like that,

872

how great she looked.

00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:35,293
do an impersonation of you
walking down the runway.

886
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,296
Because on your season,
she had on a fur coat,

887
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,899
and she walked to the end
of the runway, and she went ooh!

888
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,434
Shh.

889
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,269
[all laugh]

890
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,771
She's cold.
Don't tell anybody she's cold.

891
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,173
It's a secret!

892
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,474
Oh, my God.

893
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,176
Oh, shit,
I'm gonna pop something.

894
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,544
[all laugh]

895
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,279
Oh, my God. Oh.

896
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,647
The Snatch Game,
I felt that

897
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,850
you were kind of giving me
the same note throughout.

898
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,387
You know, relying
solely on lesbian jokes.

899
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,522
I mean, I'm gay, but not
every joke that I make

900
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,990
is about, like,
hot dogs and eggplants.

901
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,860
You get a big A for effort,
because it was really good.

902
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,229
It just wasn't that funny.

903
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,131
Thank you, Blair.

904
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,532
Shh.

905
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,167
Thank you so much.

906
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,770
-Up next, Jujubee.
-Hi.

907
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,472
Hey, you didn't choose me.

908
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,073
[all laugh]

909
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,408
What was I thinking?

910
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,510
You weren't.

911
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,048
Con-drag-ulations on serving
the best Eartha Kitt

912
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,117
that I've ever seen
on this show.

913
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,151
-Yes.
-Okay.

914
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,019
Wow.

915
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,354
If any other queen

916
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:38,556
ever wants to do Eartha Kitt
again in Snatch Game,

917
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,824
they gotta come to you

918
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,326
and you gotta give 'em
an Eartha Kitt kit.

919
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:45,396
This look tonight, Juju,
I just wanna eat you up.

920
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,465
You're just like
a little lavender lollipop.

921
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,901
You're the only one to really do
an eighties spin on prom.

922
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,970
And it brought me back
to my youth.

923
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,339
No, Michelle, I mean the 1980s.

924
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:58,243
[all laugh]

925
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,111
All right, thank you, Juju.

926
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,112
Thank you, Ru.

927
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,815
Up next, Shea Butter Couleé.

928
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:04,916
Hey.

929
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,384
So I have this thing

930
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:11,122
with doing cis male hetero
characters on Snatch Game,

931
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,924
because, you know,
this is a drag show,

932
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,259
and if you're gonna do that,

933
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:18,797
it needs to be a huge
personality like Flavor MF Flav.

934
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,066
[all laugh]
You hit it out of the park.

935
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,402
I think that will go down

936
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,739
as one of the best Snatch Game
performances in history.

937
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:31,276
No one's ever done Flavor Flav,
and it's about time.

938
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:34,746
[all laugh]

939
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,181
When I go home tonight,

940
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:38,116
this is the look
that I'm going to remember.

941
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,819
You look incredible.

942
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,153
We're getting kind of

943
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,958
a Carrie-meets-Sasha Velour
at the finale.

944
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,459
Yeah, that's right on.

945
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:52,096
I just wanted to base a look
around a moment

946
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,966
where I thought I was
gonna be queen of the prom,

947
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,268
and it didn't turn out
like that for me.

948
00:38:57,268 --> 00:39:00,605
And for, like, the next year
at meet-and-greets,

949
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:04,442
fans would take off their hats
and rose petals would fall out.

950
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,144
Because I was the butt
of this joke,

951
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:10,348
and I wanted to find an
opportunity to reclaim my rose.

952
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,251
I find it interesting that you
felt like the butt of some joke.

953
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,687
You know, I would never
think of you as a joke.

954
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,189
Um...

955
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,125
I was really devastated.
I'm not gonna lie.

956
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,630
And it took me being surrounded
with people who loved me

957
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,033
and kept me inspired
and pushed me to keep going,

958
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,236
because those...

959
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,804
those are the very people

960
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:35,540
that are responsible
for me standing here right now.

961
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,775
Well, count us amongst them.

962
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:38,943
Thank you.

963
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,044
Love you.

964
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,112
I love you, too.

965
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,747
-Thank you, Shea.
-Thank you.

966
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,649
Thank you, ladies.

967
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,619
Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

968
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,856
I've made some decisions.

969
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:02,700
Shea Couleé, con-drag-ulations.

970
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,802
You are the top All Star
of the week.

971
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,771
[applause]
Oh, my God. [laughs]

972
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,274
Oh, thank you guys so much.

973
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:12,243
You've won a seven-night stay

974
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,146
at a luxury apartment
in Paris, France,

975
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:19,217
airfare included,
courtesy of misterb&b.

976
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,085
Holy shit.

977
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,187
I'm just trying to think of
something real cute to say,

978
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,958
but that's a cute prize.
Thank you.

979
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:30,428
Now, ladies, starting today,

980
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,132
there will be
no more safe queens.

981
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:36,567
What?

982
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:42,106
If you're not the top All Star,
you are in the bottom.

983
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,476
This is crazy.

984
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,979
I did so well in the
Snatch Game and in this runway,

985
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,481
and I can go home tonight.

986
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,484
Shea Couleé, you need to decide

987
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,253
which of the bottom queens
to send home...

988
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:00,358
if you win the lip sync

989
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:03,661
against this week's
lip sync assassin.

990
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,063
The rest of you need to vote

991
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:10,234
for which bottom queen
you think deserves el choppo.

992
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,736
[stifled laughter]

993
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:15,306
So while you queens deliberate
in the werkroom

994
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,375
on Objects furniture,

995
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:20,845
the judges and I
will be writing poetry.

996
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,984
You may leave the stage.end act

997
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,954
Ooh, yes.

998
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:33,991
This is how you elegantly
walk into a room, ladies.

999
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,426
Show the children
how to walk, mama.

1000
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:39,030
It wouldn't be All Stars 5
without another twist.

1001
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,832
[laughs]

1002
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,101
-Baby.
-Ru tells us

1003
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,370
if you're not in the top
from here on out,

1004
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,872
you're in the bottom.

1005
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:51,743
Thank God I'm in the top
this week. Ha!

1006
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,878
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

1007
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,614
How does it feel
to get a second win?

1008
00:41:56,614 --> 00:42:00,318
A second win is cool,
but this was Snatch Game.

1009
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,487
To win such
an important challenge

1010
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,856
was really validating for me.

1011
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,725
Oh, my gosh, guys, are you
as gagged as I am right now?

1012
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,761
Everyone's in the bottom
except for Shea.

1013
00:42:09,761 --> 00:42:11,162
Except for Shea.
I hate that.

1014
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:16,567
I mean, honestly, it feels like
I'm in the clear bottom two

1015
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,169
based on the critiques.

1016
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,471
So you say bottom two.

1017
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,839
Based on the critiques,

1018
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,875
who do you think
is in the bottom with you?

1019
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,244
I think India and I
are in the bottom together.

1020
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,514
Alexis, how are you feeling?

1021
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:31,315
This is the first time
of me in the bottom,

1022
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:35,853
so it's strange. Yeah.

1023
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:39,924
This is not fair that on a day
that I got good critiques,

1024
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,160
RuPaul throw this twist on us.

1025
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,295
What the fuck, man?

1026
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:45,696
I'm not gonna lie.

1027
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,299
There's been this lingering
thing in the back of my head

1028
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,567
where I was just all, like,

1029
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,471
Alexis Mateo tried to get me
out of this competition.

1030
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,640
And I just wanna know why

1031
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,443
I should pick somebody else's
lipstick over yours.

1032
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:00,078
When I did that vote,

1033
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,447
I was doing it
to sleep at night,

1034
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,549
to keep friendships.

1035
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,184
Nothing against you.

1036
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:10,888
It was in my heart, and I knew
you were not going anywhere.

1037
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:15,159
I would never do something
to none of you on purpose,

1038
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,527
to anybody.

1039
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:21,299
Now, that being said,
don't try to come for me

1040
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,502
just because you might feel
like, oh, she voted against me.

1041
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:25,937
If it's in your nature

1042
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,674
and that's your truth
to send me home,

1043
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:32,977
remember, everything you do,
every action has a consequence,

1044
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,545
and you have to live with that.

1045
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,249
Do you wanna talk one-on-one?

1046
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:42,487
No, I feel like I have
everything that I need.

1047
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:47,825
Can I request that I talk to you
one-on-one, if you don't mind?

1048
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,260
Oh, yeah, sure.
No, I don't mind.

1049
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,529
-Yeah, here, let's talk.
-I would like to.

1050
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:54,098
I am hearing
complete bullshit.

1051
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,533
I know the T,

1052
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:58,736
and if I happen to leave
this competition tonight,

1053
00:43:58,736 --> 00:43:59,837
I'm not leaving

1054
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,406
without letting Shea know

1055
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,475
the juice
that I'm about to spill.

1056
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,810
I can't sit there

1057
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,846
hearing something
that is weighing on me.

1058
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,382
Do you remember when you were in
the bottom with me and Mariah?

1059
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,483
Mm-hmm.

1060
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,452
Alexis and Mayhem came to me,

1061
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,187
asking me to put your lipstick.

1062
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,089
-What?
-Yes.

1063
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:21,158
They came to me and asked me
to put your lipstick in.

1064
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,595
Plotting? Against me?

1065
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:29,000
I felt like there was
some shady shit going on,

1066
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,668
and now all of a sudden

1067
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:34,739
I have someone telling me
right to my face that there was.

1068
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,574
I'm not asking you
to vote her out,

1069
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:38,075
but I can tell you
I need to be here.

1070
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:39,110
Yeah.

1071
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:43,614
So I need you
to keep me here, please.

1072
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,149
I need you to think about that.

1073
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,717
I really appreciate
you telling me this.

1074
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,420
-Yeah.
-I really appreciate that.

1075
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,857
I'm not about this whole
"she said, she said" business.

1076
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,626
So I wanna bring it up in front
of the rest of the girls

1077
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,395
and see what really went down.

1078
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,830
India and I had a conversation,

1079
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,402
and she let me know
that when I was in the bottom,

1080
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:07,271
you and Mayhem came up to her,

1081
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,174
telling her that
she should choose my lipstick.

1082
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,410
I did that to you, India?

1083
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,879
-When?
-You and Mayhem both.

1084
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,582
The night me, Mariah,
and her were all in the bottom,

1085
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:21,018
said, "Are we doing it?
Did you get Shea's lipstick?"

1086
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,354
And I said,
"No, I did Mariah's."

1087
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,555
No, I didn't.

1088
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,291
India is the queen of stunts.

1089
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,094
She should have her own show
in Vegas called The Stunt Queen,

1090
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,264
because this is
the biggest shenanigans

1091
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,498
I ever heard in my life.

1092
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,033
You said it wasn't personal,

1093
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:40,338
but to campaign to get me out
of this competition

1094
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,872
feels personal.

1095
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,040
I did not. I did not.
You're lying.

1096
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,408
I'm not lying, girl.

1097
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,876
Did I campaign
with you guys?

1098
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,079
No, I--not to us.

1099
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,616
I did not say
"Let's get rid of Shea."

1100
00:45:51,616 --> 00:45:52,950
My vote, I did it

1101
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,886
because I didn't wanna do that
to Mariah personally.

1102
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,556
Lies, lies, lies.
Big lies.

1103
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,491
Well, then why not vote
for India?

1104
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,692
Because India,
I thought we were friends,

1105
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:04,629
but now I realize
we're not.

1106
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:07,898
My vote and my conscience
is clean.

1107
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,367
You can really sit there
and say that?

1108
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,235
I am. I am, because
you know what, that is--

1109
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,770
-That shocks me.
-That's a lie.

1110
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,505
I'm real.
I'm not here to play a game.

1111
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,873
That's been weighing
on my shoulders.

1112
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,341
-No, you're playing a game.
-I wanna be here.

1113
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,376
Let me tell you
why you're playing the game.

1114
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:19,477
I'm not playing the game.

1115
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:20,745
Because you know
you are about to go home,

1116
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:22,813
because you have been
in the bottom for so long.

1117
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:26,117
And now you need a little plug
to save yourself.

1118
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,618
I have never say anything

1119
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,187
about getting rid
about nobody here.

1120
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,290
I am so aggravated right now,

1121
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,494
because I know Shea
is not 100% secure with me,

1122
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,229
and also, this stunt

1123
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,864
can cause the other girls
to vote against me,

1124
00:46:39,864 --> 00:46:42,199
and I can probably just go home

1125
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,101
for something
that I didn't even do.

1126
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,637
I can sit here
with a very clean conscience

1127
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,973
-and look in your eyes...
-This is stupid.

1128
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:51,075
and say that I am not
playing games.

1129
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,176
This is not for me.

1130
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,577
Why else would I pull you
to the side?

1131
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,079
Maybe it's a little shady of me,

1132
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,481
but I actually wanna see
if this is real,

1133
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,050
because somebody here is lying.

1134
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:04,722
This is the biggest stunt
in the history of All Stars.

1135
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:06,691
Are you lying to me
or is she lying?

1136
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,025
No, I'm not lying to nobody.

1137
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,094
Because I trust you.
A lot.

1138
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:12,096
You cannot do that, Juju,

1139
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:13,931
because you know
I would never lie to you.

1140
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,866
-For why would I lie to you?
-I know, I know.

1141
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,968
I didn't vote for her because
I wanted to get rid of her.

1142
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:21,372
I just didn't want Mariah
to feel bad.

1143
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,040
I'm so confused right now.

1144
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,042
I don't even know
what's real anymore.

1145
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,310
Now I'm starting to feel like

1146
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,512
there is this person
that is here in the competition

1147
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,614
who's playing two games,

1148
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,384
and that's where I'm starting
to become concerned,

1149
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:37,555
because do I want to keep
that type of competitor around?

1150
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,726
Shea, can we talk?

1151
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,160
-Yeah, sure, girl.
-Please.

1152
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,162
Yeah.

1153
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:48,999
This whole setup
about you going home, girl,

1154
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:52,570
if I was gonna campaign, it was
not gonna just be me and Mayhem.

1155
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,938
-We needed everybody.
-Yeah.

1156
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:57,174
For a campaign,
you gotta campaign.

1157
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,243
Not with one or two.

1158
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,245
You gotta campaign
with all the girls.

1159
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:05,149
It doesn't work if the majority
of the votes are not in.

1160
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,418
Hands down.

1161
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,086
Politics.

1162
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,622
What saddens me the most,

1163
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,824
she's campaigning
on that sofa right now

1164
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,392
for me to go home.

1165
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,862
Why would she throw you
under the bus like that?

1166
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:20,030
I don't know,
and she was my friend.

1167
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,734
This competition can bring
the worst of everybody,

1168
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:28,539
and now I understand
Derrick very well.

1169
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,609
This was a very clear
fuck-you

1170
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,379
in your face, Alexis, moment.

1171
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,549
And even though India's makeup
and hair is pretty,

1172
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:41,852
you got some ugly demons
inside you, girl.

1173
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:52,196
India has
one of the worst report cards

1174
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,331
in Drag Race history right now.

1175
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,201
But she has made us
look very hard at Alexis.

1176
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,937
Mayhem style.

1177
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,710
You're a liar,

1178
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,613
and this is why
Derrick don't like you.

1179
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,024
I don't know what to feel.
I am so confused.

1180
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,525
Oh, why not?

1181
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,027
No, I'm kidding.

1182
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,029
If India is lying,

1183
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:28,132
she would have been
a better actor,

1184
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,602
which means she would have been
better at Snatch Game.

1185
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,172
Is it Alexis?

1186
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,411
Is Alexis the villain?

1187
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:44,615
Oh, my gosh.

1188
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,918
Oh, my gosh.

1189
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:59,363
The truth shall set you free.

1190
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:03,434
Girl, stop acting a fool.

1191
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,907
I came into this

1192
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:14,345
wanting to judge these girls
based off their performance,

1193
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:17,848
and India has been in the bottom
four times.

1194
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,584
But I've been, like,
roped into some other game

1195
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:25,322
where Alexis potentially
has campaigned to get rid of me.

1196
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,291
[sighs] Oh, God.

1197
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:31,896
I don't know if I can survive
allowing someone like that

1198
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:33,964
to continue
competing against me.end act

1199
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,504
Welcome back, All Stars.

1200
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:45,376
Shea Couleé, are you ready
to meet your lip sync opponent?

1201
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,444
Well, I guess so.

1202
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:50,314
[all laugh]

1203
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:53,751
The time has come...

1204
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:58,923
to present this week's
lip sync assassin.

1205
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,059
Is that Laganja?

1206
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,527
Laganja?

1207
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,062
I think it could be Trinity.

1208
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,199
Ru-veal yourself!

1209
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,172
That's a short heel for Laganja.

1210
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,142
Somebody with little feet.

1211
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,444
Aah!

1212
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,280
[screaming and laughter]

1213
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,648
[laughs]

1214
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,383
You're damn right!

1215
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:30,287
The lip sync assassin
is Vanessa Vanjie, my daughter.

1216
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,522
I cannot even enjoy the moment

1217
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,891
when I see
my drag daughter again,

1218
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:38,729
because if she wins the lip sync
and she holding my lipstick,

1219
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:41,031
it could be humiliating for me.

1220
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:44,435
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo, welcome.

1221
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,803
Thank you.

1222
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:50,607
Ladies, Miss Vanjie
holds the lipstick

1223
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:54,044
of the queen that the group
has voted to go home.

1224
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,046
If Vanjie wins the lip sync,

1225
00:51:56,046 --> 00:52:00,317
the queen on her lipstick
gets the chop.

1226
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:06,924
And the $10.000 will roll over

win $10.000,

1234

1235
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:33,684

the chop.

to get the chop?

At first, I felt like
I had my mind made up

1294
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,823
about who I was going to pick
to send home.

1295
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,259
But one of the bottom queens
revealed to me

1296
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:38,662
that someone here may or may not

1297
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:42,332
have been campaigning to
send me home a few weeks back.

1298
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,537
[sighs] I thought
long and hard about this,

1299
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:51,708
and the queen that I've chosen
to go home tonight is...

1300
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,245
India.

1301
00:56:56,513 --> 00:57:00,017
As it is written,
so it shall be done.

1302
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:07,824
India Ferrah, you are
and will always be an All Star.

1303
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:11,261
Now sashay away.

1304
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,997
Ladies, I want you
to remember the four Hs, okay?

1305
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,400
I want you to live happy.

1306
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,736
I want you to listen
to your heart, okay?

1307
00:57:19,736 --> 00:57:24,241
I want you to remain humble,
and most of all, be honest.

1308
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,113
The old me would be
so disappointed in leaving.

1309
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,349
Now I can leave
with my head held high

1310
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:35,419
because I got to show all
the different sides of India.

1311
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:38,188
I was not lying to you.

1312
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,924
I'm not gonna be at home
sitting on my couch,

1313
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:44,027
being, like,
"I wish I had done more."

1314
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,764

so fucking proud of myself.
