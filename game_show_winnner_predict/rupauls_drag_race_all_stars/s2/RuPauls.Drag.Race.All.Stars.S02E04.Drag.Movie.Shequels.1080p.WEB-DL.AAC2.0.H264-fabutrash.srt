1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,534
        - Previously            
         on "AllStars..."       

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:08,205
    You'll be performing        
    a lip sync extravaganza.    

3
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:14,278
         Herstory             

4
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:17,480
      - Do you think that       
      the girls in the top      

5
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,415
       are going to stick       
         to our idea of         

6
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:21,817
    what do the judges          
        have to say             

7
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:23,752
         and that's who         
     we're going to choose?     

8
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:25,387
   - I'm iffy of one of them.   
             - Who?             

9
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:27,389
            - Alyssa.           

10
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:30,458
       - Alyssa Edwards,        
     you're a winner, baby.     

11
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:35,929
          Which queen           
        have you chosen         

12
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:37,330
        to get the chop?        

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,865
          - Sometimes           
      being in the bottom       

14
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,434
        could just be           
    a one night kind of gig.    

15
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:45,370
        So the queen            
    that I'm sending home,      

16
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:48,272
        that's Ginger.          

17
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:51,876
    - Ginger Minj, sashay away. 

18
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:03,253
         - Whoo, shit.          

19
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:04,987
            - Oh...             

20
00:01:05,056 --> 00:01:07,155
     - Good old Minj Ging.      

21
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:08,924
        - What we said          
        we were gonna do        

22
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:11,659
    was eliminate the girl      
who got the harshest critiques. 

23
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,297
I just feel that Katya got      
harsher critiques than Ginger,  

24
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,231
        so the vibe             
    in the room right now       

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,000
    is kind of like             
    what just happened?         

26
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:24,003
    - I wanna say that          
    both of you guys            

27
00:01:24,072 --> 00:01:27,473
    got feedback that was       
    kind of on the lower end,   

28
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,873
        but when                
    I really talked to you guys 

29
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:31,476
    after looking at last week  
        and the week before     

30
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:32,576
      and taking all that       
      into consideration,       

31
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:33,677
    I think you're consistent   

32
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,211
    and I think you have        
    so much more to give.       

33
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,811
         I think                
     you just fell short today. 

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,147
      I think what Ginger does  
            is fabulous,        

35
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:41,448
    but I didn't feel like it   
    was fair send to Katya home 

36
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:44,017
    'cause I was going          
    based off consistency.      

37
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:45,018
        Katya, I know           
        you looked at me        

38
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:46,152
        and you were            
    a little surprised,         

39
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:47,720
    but you should never        
        be surprised.           

40
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,487
        I think                 
    you deserve to be here,     

41
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,422
    and that's just me          
    following my heart          

42
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,290
      and keeping it real       
         with you guys.         

43
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,392
    I think Ru would have       
    taken into consideration    

44
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:57,927
    what she just did the week  
    before in the Snatch Game.  

45
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:00,930
       She hit a homerun,       
   so tough decision to make.   

46
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:02,932
    I stand by my decision 100%.

47
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,667
    Detox, how did you feel?    
        I mean...               

48
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:07,736
    - I based my decision       
    off of the critiques.       

49
00:02:07,805 --> 00:02:08,737
            - Okay.             

50
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:11,039
    - And my decision was you.  

51
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,573
    And you know how much       
    I fuckin live for you.      

52
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:13,807
        - Of course.            

53
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,408
    - And this is a fuckin      
    tough decision to make.     

54
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,110
   - I hope that that you see   
 that just consistency for me-- 

55
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,477
        - No, and I do.         

56
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:21,647
        - Me personally,        
    I would still go with you   

57
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:24,249
        only because            
    I said from day one         

58
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:25,649
        I was going             
    to play it that way.        

59
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:27,283
    Alyssa switched it up.      

60
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:28,918
      It's pretty obvious.      

61
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:31,019
    Katya, should have          
    gone home tonight.          

62
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:33,588
        I feel that             
    if Ru was up there judging, 

63
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:35,389
        she would have          
    actually sent you home.     

64
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:39,859
        - I'm struggling        
        with the thought        

65
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:41,961
    that maybe the other girls  

66
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,964
      don't think this was      
      a fair elimination.       

67
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,466
     - Katya, you're here.      
         Let it all go.         

68
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,802
    I'm very confident          
    with my decision.           

69
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:54,071
        We can all agree        
        to disagree.            

70
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,973
    Alyssa keeps bringing up    
    consistency, consistency,   

71
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:59,375
        and I don't know        
    which way she's gonna go.   

72
00:02:59,444 --> 00:03:02,178
    So if she wins again,       
    who's going home?           

73
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,983
    - The winner of "RuPaul's   
    Drag Race AllStars"         

74
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:10,550
    receives a one year supply  

75
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,919
    of Anastasia Beverly Hills  
        cosmetics,              

76
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:15,721
    a coveted spot              
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame,  

77
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,057
        and a cash prize        
        of $100,000.            

78
00:03:19,126 --> 00:03:22,426
With extra special guest judge  
    Nicole Scherzinger.         

79
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:23,961
    -  "RuPaul's Drag Race"   

80
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,295
        -  May the best woman 

81
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:27,530
      -  Best woman win       

82
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:33,368
      - New week, new me.       

83
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:35,336
         - Yeah, baby!          
             - Yep.             

84
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:36,870
    - We're walking             
    into the workroom,          

85
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,005
       and I notice that        
    there's a little letter     

86
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:41,407
    written by old Ging Minj.   

87
00:03:41,476 --> 00:03:45,210
    - "PLay a fair game         
and be proud of your choices,"  

88
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,913
    - So is she implying that   
    the game hasn't been fair?  

89
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:49,514
        - You know why?         
        I think because--       

90
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,848
    Look, let's be honest.      

91
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,683
            We all said         
      that we were gonna pick   

92
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,951
            who Ru said was,    
     you know, the weakest link,

93
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,886
    and Alyssa switched it up.  

94
00:03:56,954 --> 00:03:58,353
     - No, I didn't switch      
       nothing up, baby.        

95
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,288
    - No, I'm saying--          
    Will you let me finish?     

96
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:02,123
    - No, but let's choose      
    our words wisely.           

97
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,724
        - I am.                 
    You didn't let me finish.   

98
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,593
        What I'm saying         
     is you switched it up,     

99
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,661
    which you did,              
    and in all honesty,         

100
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,662
    they critiqued you          
        on your--               

101
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,130
        Hold on, baby.          
        Let me finish.          

102
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:13,199
    They critiqued you on your  
    runway and your performance.

103
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,969
    - Phi Phi is a little       
    hung up on the decision     

104
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:19,638
because I think in her head,    
she probably could be thinking, 

105
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:22,273
        okay, well,             
    this could affect me.       

106
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:24,141
    I was in the bottom         
    the first time.             

107
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,343
    There was a lot of factors  
    taken into consideration,   

108
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:28,811
      but I do think I was fair 
            in my opinion.      

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,179
       I think, you know,       
           it's hard.           

110
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:32,548
    It's very hard,             
    but I stand by it.          

111
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:33,948
    - Katya, how do you feel?   

112
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:36,050
    - I mean, you know,         
    she made the decision.      

113
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,784
    She feels proud of it.      
    I'm happy to be here.       

114
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:38,885
      End of story. Boom.       

115
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:41,253
    - Ha! Take that, everyone.  
        You're back.            

116
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,288
- I am ready to shrug off       
the guilt and shame and doubt   

117
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:46,056
    like a lice-ridden coat.    

118
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,823
- It's going to be interesting  
    to see what happens         

119
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,057
    down to the nitty gritty    

120
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:50,926
       how fair the game        
    continues to be played.     

121
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:53,094
    - If y'all send me home,    
        it was rigged.          

122
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:56,631
       Riga-morris, girl.       
   It was riga-morris, girl.    

123
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,199
        - Who's Morris?         

124
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,867
          Rigormortis.          
      - Is it rigormortis?      

125
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:05,804
        (all laugh)             

126
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,772
    - Hello, hello, hello.      

127
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,840
             - Oh!              
           (applause)           

128
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,407
        - You look gorg.        

129
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:15,344
    - Ladies, for this week's   
        maxi challenge,         

130
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:19,348
    you'll be starring          
    in drag shequels.           

131
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:22,417
      Parodies inspired by      
  some of my favorite movies.   

132
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:24,485
        #DragShequels.          

133
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:25,952
        - Oh.                   
        - All right.            

134
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,821
    - You'll be working         
        in pairs,               

135
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,459
        so first, I want you    
    to pick your acting partner.

136
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:36,162
            Go.                 

137
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:37,396
        - All right.            

138
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,231
    - I look and see Roxxxy,    

139
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,465
    I look and see Phi Phi,     

140
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,900
        and I'm thinking,       
    where the fuck is Detox?    

141
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,134
            - Well?             

142
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:45,368
            - Detox.            

143
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,537
    So I grab her because       
    I am not gonna be stuck     

144
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:49,905
    with a weak performer       
    for this challenge.         

145
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,306
        - All right.            

146
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,943
    - Now, I've green-lit       
    the following films.        

147
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:57,378
    First up, "Showsquirrels,"  

148
00:05:57,447 --> 00:06:01,682
    starring Phi Phi O'Hara     
    and Roxxxy Andrews.         

149
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,450
            - Yes!              

150
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:06,386
    - Next, "Velma and Weezy,"  

151
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:09,121
    starring Katya and Detox.   

152
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,222
            - Yes.              

153
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,291
    - Last but not least,       

154
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:15,560
       "Wha' Ha' Happened       
          To Baby JJ?"          

155
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,364
        starring Alaska         
      and Alyssa Edwards.       

156
00:06:19,432 --> 00:06:21,598
    To create your characters,  
        you can use wigs        

157
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,800
    provided by Weaven Steven.  

158
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:26,603
        And if the script       
    calls for it, the pit crew, 

159
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:30,506
        in or out of their      
    Andrew Christian underwear. 

160
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:33,476
        Gentlemen,              
    start your engines,         

161
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,411
            and may             
      the best woman win.       

162
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,846
        (applause)              

163
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:40,948
    - The parody shequel.       

164
00:06:41,017 --> 00:06:45,118
    Katya and I are assigned    
 the "Velma and Weezy" script,  

165
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,286
    which is a shequel          

166
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,655
            to another          
        very famous movie       

167
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:51,624
        with similar            
        character names.        

168
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,058
    Are we doing accents?       

169
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:54,091
        - I think so.           
        - I think so.           

170
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,692
      - We have to. Yeah.       

171
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:58,828
If you can't eat your friends,  
    who can you eat?            

172
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:00,896
        - (laughs)              

173
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,598
    - "Showsquirrels."          

174
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,565
  Mama Versayce, a middle-aged  
        former showgirl.        

175
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:05,766
        - Accurate.             

176
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,734
     - We chose to make me      
         Mama Versayce          

177
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,002
     and Phi Phi's gonna be     
         Lil' Versayce.         

178
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:13,372
    - No, you were just         
    a tired-ass showgirl.       

179
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,373
     - You were just            
     a tired-ass showgirl.      

180
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:17,375
    Now go back to obscurity    
       where you belong.        

181
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:18,542
        - Oh, my God.           

182
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,109
    I've heard that somewhere.  

183
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:22,544
        - I feel like           
        I'm typecasted.         

184
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:24,413
        - Okay, let's get       
    these costumes together.    

185
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:27,549
            - No pressure,      
      but like I'm the only one 

186
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:29,617
    left of the girls that      
    has not been in the top yet.

187
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:31,852
    What if we switched it      

188
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:34,188
    and like you were           
    the big pageant girl?       

189
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:38,758
It's all about taking chances   
    and doing something.        

190
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,360
      Switching the roles       
      is a brilliant idea.      

191
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,227
I'm telling you, I just think   
that would be so much funnier.  

192
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,062
         And then you--         
      - You're scaring me.      

193
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,132
        I just get scared       
        of those things,        

194
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,899
     but I know that you're good
            at what you do.     

195
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,234
  - I really think we should.   
            - Okay.             

196
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,871
    - I know it's a risk,       
    but I'm gonna take it.      

197
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,140
    And Roxxxy has no choice    
        but to follow.          

198
00:07:58,576 --> 00:07:59,608
        - Coming up...          

199
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:02,877
    - We take the crown.        
    We wear the shaw.           

200
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:06,781
            - Cut.              
      Um, what's a shaw?        

201
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:08,249
            - Huh?              

202
00:08:10,052 --> 00:08:11,952
        (RuPaul laughs)         

203
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:16,521
        (RuPaul laughs)         

204
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,558
     - I was never a whore.     
        I was a dancer!         

205
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,860
       - You were suh--         
           [stammers]           

206
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:24,061
    - That's not the line.      

207
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,296
        - For this week's       
        maxi challenge,         

208
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,464
    Alyssa and I are assigned   

209
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,266
       "Wha' Ha' Happened       
          To Baby JJ?"          

210
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:35,203
        (evil laugh)            

211
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,903
            For me,             
      there's no question.      

212
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:38,671
    I have to play Baby JJ.     

213
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,442
    She's old and crazy         
        and evil.               

214
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:46,344
Where do you think you're going,
      you miserable bitch?      

215
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:49,580
             - No!              
  - There's really no choice.   

216
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:50,581
         Sorry, Alyssa.         

217
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:52,583
        I work alone.           

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,218
        - I hope we win.        

219
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:57,520
         I'd like to be         
      at the top two once.      

220
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,422
        Thank you.              

221
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:02,589
        - How does that         
        make you feel?          

222
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:04,324
    - I'm a little intimidated, 
        to be honest.           

223
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,659
    Since Alyssa changed it up, 

224
00:09:06,728 --> 00:09:08,327
    which--even though she      
    wants to pretend she didn't.

225
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:10,729
        - You feel like         
    she flipped the script.     

226
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:12,864
        - I don't feel.         
    She did flip the script.    

227
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,332
I'm not saying I don't want you 
here, but you know what I mean? 

228
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,233
    - No, no, no, no, no.       
    I completely get it.        

229
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:17,668
    - Like, is that gonna be,   
        like, oh, well,         

230
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:19,903
Phi Phi's never been in the top,
    so let's get rid of her.    

231
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,971
        So I don't know.        
    We'll see what happens.     

232
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,239
        I'm a little frustrated.

233
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:24,473
            I don't want        
      to leave the competition  

234
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,307
    until I've had a chance     
       to make the world        

235
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,009
    fall in love with Phi Phi.  

236
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:30,478
      And I need a win now      
to prove that I need to be here.

237
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:36,049
            - Howdy.            

238
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,617
     - Hi, Katya and Detox.     
          - Hi, y'all.          

239
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:38,750
        - So pretty.            

240
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,752
        - So it's time          
        for Detox and I         

241
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,321
   to perform in our shequel,   
       "Velma and Weezy."       

242
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,957
And I have never felt more sexy 
       in my entire life.       

243
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:50,260
    - Your parody shequel.      
        And action!             

244
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:52,095
    - We don't need money,      
        Velma.                  

245
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,429
        We're zombies.          

246
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:56,131
       - We need the cash       
         to get drunk.          

247
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,966
        Fuck. Buy booze.        

248
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,700
    - Yeah, we need the cash    
        to buy booze.           

249
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,269
    - Um, start over, okay.     

250
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:03,403
            - Bitch,            
      this is the shequel!      

251
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:06,472
            - Uh!               

252
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,872
        Fuck. I forgot.         

253
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,141
        - Cut.                  
    Get those lines down        

254
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,710
    so the back and forth       
    can be more organic.        

255
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,244
    - Have fun with this.       

256
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,081
One of the first rules of acting
is reacting to the other people.

257
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,215
        - I'm not totally       
        in the moment.          

258
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:21,484
  I just think, what the hell   
     would Amy Sedaris do?      

259
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,285
        - And action!           

260
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:24,452
        (knock on door)         

261
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,587
   - You order room service?    
             - No.              

262
00:10:26,656 --> 00:10:27,922
      - Oh, motherfucker.       

263
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,691
        - (laughs)              

264
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,761
        - 'Cause suddenly       
        I'm very hungry.        

265
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,095
        - Whoo-hoo!             

266
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:39,031
   - Weezy, you zombie skank,   
       you motherfuckin--       

267
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:40,098
      I just fuck you.          

268
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,565
    If I wasn't dead already,   
        I'd--                   

269
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:43,800
        - And cut.              
        Best one yet.           

270
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:45,836
        - Great.                
        - Fantastic.            

271
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,807
    Hello, Alaska and Alyssa.   

272
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:53,108
            - Hi.               

273
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,610
      - "Wha' Ha' Happened      
          To Baby JJ?"          

274
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,777
            Action!             

275
00:10:56,846 --> 00:11:01,515
- Guess who's in a wheelchair   
    now, Bland?                 

276
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:03,517
        - You know              
    I haven't been able         

277
00:11:03,586 --> 00:11:05,552
    to use my legs              
    since the accident.         

278
00:11:05,621 --> 00:11:07,220
        - And cut.              

279
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,221
    Alyssa, you're scared       
    of your sister,             

280
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,889
    but you still have a voice, 
        so you don't--          

281
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,256
        Every (mumbles)         

282
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,724
          Let us hear           
      what you're saying.       

283
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:15,392
            - Okay.             
            - Action!           

284
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:18,828
      -  Camptown ladies,      
        sing this song         

285
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:21,864
    -  Doo-wah, doo-wah       

286
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:22,864
            - Cut!              

287
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,932
        - It's doo-dah.         
         Doo-dah              

288
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,500
        -  Doo-dah            
        - Correct.              

289
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,168
    You just have to say...     

290
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,403
   - [both] Doo-dah, doo-dah.   

291
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:31,638
        Here we go.             

292
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:35,641
        -  Camptown ladies     
        sing this song         

293
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,911
    -  Doo-wah, doo-wah       

294
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,480
     -  Camptown racetrack     
       five miles long         

295
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,148
            - Cut.              
            Doo-dah.            

296
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:45,950
        - Doo-dah.              
        - Doo-dah.              

297
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,352
    - Oh, to do--               
     oh, da doo-dah           

298
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,888
        - Welcome,              
    Phi Phi and Roxxxy.         

299
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:54,122
            - Hi!               

300
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,790
    - "Showsquirrels."          

301
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:57,959
     All right. Here we go.     
           - Action!            

302
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:01,928
        - I used to love        
        eating dog chow.        

303
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:09,136
- Ugh. So you're telling me     
that not only be conce--line.   

304
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,004
    - I thought being conceived 
        in a swimming pool.     

305
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,573
    - So you're telling me      
    being conceived in a swim-- 

306
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:16,909
        - No. Ugh.              
    I thought being conce--     

307
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:18,643
        - Oh. Ugh.              

308
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:22,046
   I thought being conceived    
 in a swimming pool was gross.  

309
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,514
            (gags)              

310
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:26,883
            (gags)              

311
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:28,084
            - Cut.              

312
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:30,653
        - I just want you       
    to give me more character.  

313
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:32,454
    I feel like I'm seeing      
    a lot of Roxxxy in there.   

314
00:12:32,523 --> 00:12:34,155
        I think that            
    you could do something      

315
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:35,389
    to push it to another level.

316
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,159
            - Okay.             
         - And action!          

317
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:41,762
    - We take the crown.        
    We wear the shaw.           

318
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:45,766
            - Cut.              
      Um, what's a shaw?        

319
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,203
            Roxxxy?             
            - Huh?              

320
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:53,406
    - We take the crown.        
    We wear the shaw.           

321
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:55,741
     - We take the crown.       
     We wear the shaw, the...   

322
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,675
            - Sash.             
      - How you spell it?       

323
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:58,876
            - Sash?             

324
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,244
           - S-A-S-H?           
            - Yeah.             

325
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,246
        - Sha...sha...          

326
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,614
            - Sash.             
            - Sash.             

327
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:08,783
    Oh, God. This isn't another 
    sequins moment, is it?      

328
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:11,519
    - I'm afraid so, honey.     

329
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:13,821
    - That is a wrap            
    on "Showsquirrels."         

330
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,922
    - See you on the runway.    

331
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:16,556
    - In the end, I want to say 

332
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,658
        that we                 
    might not be the best,      

333
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:21,894
    but Team Phoxxxy did A-OK.  

334
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:22,961
        - Coming up...          

335
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,096
    - You're gorgina.           
    - You did a great job.      

336
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:28,032
    - Little things in this     
    situation have to matter.   

337
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,067
        (RuPaul laughs)         

338
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:33,670
        (RuPaul laughs)         

339
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:40,142
        -  Covergirl,          
    put the bass in your walk  

340
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:47,582
       Covergirl, put the bass 
            in your walk       

341
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,585
             Head to toe,      
      let your whole body talk 

342
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:52,752
         Covergirl            

343
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:55,488
            - Wow.              

344
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:57,023
        (RuPaul laughs)         

345
00:13:57,091 --> 00:14:01,460
- Welcome to the main stage of  
"RuPaul's Drag Race AllStars."  

346
00:14:01,528 --> 00:14:06,098
   Star of the classic film,    
 "Boobarella," Michelle Visage. 

347
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:09,000
    - And the TV show,          
    "Leave It To Cleavage."     

348
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:10,935
        - (laughs)              

349
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:13,304
        Style superstar,        
        Carson Kressley.        

350
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,905
    I love what you're wearing. 

351
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,572
          - Thank you.          
(misprounouncing) It's Versayce.

352
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:19,975
      - (laughs) The incredible 
            Todrick Hall.       

353
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:21,977
        Now, how'd it go        
    with my girls yesterday?    

354
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:24,946
    - Ru, I'm gonna have to give
    your girls two thumbs up.   

355
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:27,715
        - Try three.            
    They'll enjoy it much more. 

356
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,149
        (all laugh)             

357
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:34,087
And the devastatingly gorgeous  
and talented Nicole Scherzinger.

358
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:35,322
      You finally made it.      

359
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,822
        - Yes, my love.         

360
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:38,890
        You're giving me        
        fierce tiger fish       

361
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,158
    with that dress right now.  

362
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:42,593
          - Thank you.          
      So glad you're here.      

363
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,895
        Now, this week,         
    we challenged our queens    

364
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:47,330
    to star in movie shequels.  

365
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,867
And tonight, it's double trouble
    on the runway               

366
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:54,570
      because the category      
      is two looks in one,      

367
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,172
    inspired by Violet Chachki. 

368
00:14:57,241 --> 00:15:01,776
 Gentlemen, start your engines, 
  and may the best woman win.   

369
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,677
    -  Gotta go now           

370
00:15:03,746 --> 00:15:05,779
        -  Sexy, sexy         

371
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,314
    - Up first, Phi Phi O'Hara. 

372
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,014
    - Ooh, she's crowning.      

373
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,616
            - She is.           

374
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:13,551
    - That's a nice ascot.      

375
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,686
        - Ah, yes.              
        - Beautiful.            

376
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:16,853
        - I'm super proud       
        of this look.           

377
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:18,887
    I came up with              
    the design myself,          

378
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:20,722
      and I feel gorgeous.      

379
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,222
        - If it's yellow,       
        let it mellow.          

380
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,223
        (all laugh)             

381
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,258
        - Roxxxy Andrews.       

382
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:26,692
        - Flamenco.             

383
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,662
          - Sombrero.           
             - Yes.             

384
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:31,830
             - Oh!              
         - Yes, please.         

385
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:32,897
      Selena in the house.      

386
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,466
            - Hello.            

387
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,533
     - If anybody knows anything
            about a reveal,     

388
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,235
    she, me, her, she does.     

389
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,170
    I'm serving Latina diva     
        on this runway.         

390
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,639
        - Bitty, bitty, bum-bum.

391
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,074
    - That's a Spanish fly girl.

392
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,509
            Katya.              
      Ooh, Barbara Eden.        

393
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,544
      - I dream of weenie.      

394
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:50,811
    - Oh, there she goes.       

395
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,646
            - Oh!               

396
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:56,550
        - Oh, thank you.        
           - (laughs)           

397
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:59,385
    - I'm giving you full health
    by a Sharon Tate fantasy.   

398
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:04,290
   It's Rosemary's babushka,    
and I feel (deep voice) amazing.

399
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:08,027
    - Not tonight, Satan.       
        Not tonight.            

400
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:09,594
            Detox.              

401
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:11,229
          - Dark lady.          
            - Sexy.             

402
00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:13,798
             - Oh.              
           - Oh, yes.           

403
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,433
    Oh, and there's more.       

404
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:18,567
        - Every time            
    I step on the runway,       

405
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:19,668
        I want it to be         
      something different.      

406
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:20,702
    I want to blow them away.   

407
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,204
            - Oh!               

408
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,939
      - And that's the fun      
         of drag to me.         

409
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,307
        - Kung-pow.             

410
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,809
    - Ancient Chinese secret,   
        huh?                    

411
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:30,544
        - (giggles)             

412
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,547
        - Here she comes,       
        Alyssa Edwards.         

413
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:36,216
    Ooh, the Le Croix poof.     

414
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:38,351
            - Yes.              
            - What?             

415
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,852
    - I'm ready for my closeup. 

416
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,954
        - Ah.                   
        - Oh, I love it.        

417
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:45,590
   - Girl, please. I'm taking   
selfie to a whole 'nother level.

418
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:46,791
        Paparazzi who?          

419
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:49,893
   Oh, I see why you love me,   
            darling.            

420
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:51,695
    - That is amazing.          

421
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:54,565
       - Kodak mammaries.       

422
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:57,367
        Up next, Alaska.        

423
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:00,169
        What?                   
    It's like a Fellini film.   

424
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:02,237
            (gasps)             
          - What the--          

425
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:03,738
             - Oh.              
          (all laugh)           

426
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:07,174
    - It's Little Poundcake!    

427
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,075
        (all laugh)             

428
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:12,612
        - Little Poundcake      
    is the insane pageant girl. 

429
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,047
        She's stunning,         
    and I'm really excited      

430
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:16,882
    to get to bring her to life.

431
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,750
    - I think she needs         
    some go-go juice.           

432
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,086
    -  Sexy, sexy drag queen  

433
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:24,621
    - Welcome, ladies.          

434
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,325
It's time for the world premiere
    of your movie parodies.     

435
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:34,196
    First, Phi Phi O'Hara       
    and Roxxxy Andrews          

436
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:38,067
  starring in "Showsquirrels."  

437
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:41,236
        When last we saw        
     our troubled showgirl,     

438
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:43,405
      she was hitchhiking       
          to Hollywood          

439
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:47,541
    after crashing and burning  
        in Sin City.            

440
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,075
        Now, years later,       

441
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:53,179
        her own daughter        
    is a junior pageant queen   

442
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:55,281
    bitten by the showbiz bug.  

443
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,717
    - All right. Five minutes   
    till the talent competition.

444
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,185
        - You heard him.        
           Only five,           

445
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,220
    fa-five, five, five minutes.

446
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,389
    - Thanks, darling.          

447
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,692
    - Hey, little Versayce.     

448
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:11,627
    I just know you're gonna win

449
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:14,530
         the Wee Little         
 Miss Pacoima Goddess Supreme.  

450
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,265
    - That wouldn't suck.       

451
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,399
        - Now, remember,        
        Little Versayce,        

452
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,301
            when you get        
      in front of them judges,  

453
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,804
  do some of them dance moves   
 your mama taught you in Vegas. 

454
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:28,675
    - I'm a little too young    
     for that whorish look.     

455
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:29,943
            - Ooh!              

456
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,711
  But you are a whore, mommy.   

457
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:36,848
    - Versayce, how dare you?   

458
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,618
      I was a dancer. Huh.      

459
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,188
    - I don't know what the hell
        you did in Vegas,       

460
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,323
    but it sure wasn't dancing. 

461
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,192
    - I was the biggest star    
        on the strip.           

462
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,529
        They could've gotten    
    LaToya Jackson, Paula Abdul,

463
00:18:54,598 --> 00:18:56,898
        but The Stardust        
        went with me,           

464
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:59,667
        and, frankly,           
        I still got it.         

465
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,936
        - You are just          
    a tired-ass showgirl!       

466
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:06,406
    Go back to obscurity        
    where you belong!           

467
00:19:06,475 --> 00:19:08,375
        - Obscurity?            

468
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:13,412
            (laughs)            

469
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:17,616
    Now, go on, show them what  
    you got, Little Versayce.   

470
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,718
    - Don't worry about me,     
        mommy.                  

471
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:22,554
            I will.             

472
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,555
            - Aah!              

473
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:28,224
        (all laugh)             

474
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,325
    Mommy, how could you?       

475
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:34,862
    - I guess you don't...      
        know me.                

476
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:37,098
             - Oh!              
          (all laugh)           

477
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:42,602
    - Up next, Katya and Detox  

478
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:45,872
          starring in           
       "Velma and Weezy."       

479
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:50,508
        When last we saw        
        Velma and Weezy,        

480
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:52,209
    they were taking a short cut

481
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,178
        to the bottom           
    of the Grand Canyon.        

482
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:59,182
    They may be dead,           
but they're still best friends. 

483
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:03,386
        - Where is she?         

484
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:07,656
        Velma,                  
    what took you so long?      

485
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,958
    I think I'm having          
    a nervous breakdown.        

486
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:12,126
    - The Quicki-mart           
    didn't sell brains,         

487
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:14,962
  so I ate the clerk's brains   
            instead.            

488
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:18,064
             - Ah.              
 - Oh, and I robbed the store.  

489
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:21,001
     - We don't need money,     
             Velma.             

490
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:22,302
        We're zombies.          

491
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,103
            Hold on.            
      I got a great idea.       

492
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:25,404
            - Oh.               
            - Whew.             

493
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:26,973
            Selfie!             

494
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:30,742
        - Whoo-hoo-ee!          

495
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:32,743
        (knock on door)         

496
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:34,678
   - You order room service?    
             - No.              

497
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:35,779
        - Motherfucker!         

498
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:43,284
        'Cause suddenly         
        I'm very hungry.        

499
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:44,652
        - Whoo-hoo!             

500
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,754
   If it isn't that handsome    
      Brad Pitt lookalike       

501
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:49,655
    that stole all our money.   

502
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:51,290
    What are you doing here, BJ?

503
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,661
- You come back to give us that 
money you stole from us, baby?  

504
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:57,195
        With interest?          

505
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:59,396
    - Maybe he's just here      
    to see what it's like       

506
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:03,967
        to get some head        
     from the walking dead.     

507
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,502
      - Bitch, he's mine!       

508
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,003
            - Oh!               

509
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,438
    Bitch, this is a shequel!   

510
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:13,509
   - Weezy, you zombie skank!   
       You motherfuckin--       

511
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:15,978
        (both shouting)         

512
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:20,147
            Aah!                

513
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:21,181
    Look what you did!          

514
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,050
      - Look what you did!      

515
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:29,288
        - Thanks, ladies.       

516
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:34,358
   - That sexy son of a bitch   
     took our money again.      

517
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,460
    - No matter what happens,   

518
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:40,664
    I'm glad I got to be        
    a zombie with you.          

519
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:44,733
    - I've never felt more...   
        dead?                   

520
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,935
    Hey, Velma, do you mind     

521
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:49,137
          if I partake          
    in your little arm here?    

522
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:53,273
- If you can't eat your friends,
    who can you eat?            

523
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:56,209
        (all laugh)             

524
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,377
             - Yes.             
         - Oh, my God.          

525
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:01,479
        - That's so cute.       

526
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:05,415
    - All right. Up next,       
    Alyssa Edwards and Alaska   

527
00:22:05,484 --> 00:22:09,552
    in "Wha' Ha' Happened       
        to Baby JJ?"            

528
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,621
    When last we saw Baby JJ,   

529
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:17,792
    she nearly killed her sister
        Bland on the beach.     

530
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:19,627
        But she survived.       

531
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:23,331
      Now, 50 years later,      

532
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,068
they're still trapped together  
    at the senior home.         

533
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,170
        (door creaks)           

534
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:44,684
        (beeping)               

535
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,658
        - Guess who's in        
    a wheelchair now, Bland?    

536
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,361
         Just kidding.          
            You are!            

537
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,395
        - Baby JJ?              

538
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,865
You know I haven't been able to 
use my legs since the accident. 

539
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:07,069
      I'd escape from you       
   if I wasn't 109 years old.   

540
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:10,672
    - But you are, Bland.       
        You are!                

541
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:12,373
        Look over here.         

542
00:23:12,442 --> 00:23:13,975
    It's your din-din.          

543
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:15,108
            - Oh, no.           

544
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:18,378
    - I made your favorite.     

545
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:19,746
        Pork chops!             

546
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,147
            - Aah!              

547
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:23,883
        - (evil laugh)          

548
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:27,351
            Come on.            

549
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,787
       We gotta rehearse        
      for the talent show.      

550
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:34,757
        - Oh, my God.           

551
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:36,392
        - My music's over there.

552
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:38,527
        - (grunts)              

553
00:23:38,596 --> 00:23:39,594
        Never mind.             

554
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:44,499
      I'm gonna do this one     
            Acapulco.           

555
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:48,402
  (off-key)  Camptown ladies   
        sing this song         

556
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:50,938
    -  Doo-dah, doo-dah       

557
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:52,839
            - Hey!              
            - Ow!               

558
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:55,574
    - Sorry, sis, I work alone. 

559
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,275
      - Somebody help me!       

560
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:59,477
    She's emotionally disturbed!

561
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:03,047
    - Where do you think you're 
    going, you miserable bitch? 

562
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:05,883
            - No! No!           

563
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:09,219
        - Oh, girl down.        

564
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:11,654
    - My sister Bland fell.     

565
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:13,422
        Can you help her?       

566
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:14,857
        - Of course.            
        Come on, Bland.         

567
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,093
            - Oh!               

568
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,463
    See? Even the nurse         
    likes you better.           

569
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:25,899
    -  Camptown ladies         
    sing this song             

570
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,333
    -  Doo-dah, doo-dah       

571
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:29,735
    -  You already know       

572
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:32,004
         - I work solo.         
            - Okay.             

573
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:34,173
       -  Camptown races       
        all night long         

574
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:36,475
        (applause)              

575
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:41,412
        - Now, it's time        
    for the judges' reviews.    

576
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,047
        - Coming up...          

577
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:44,781
        - You were like         
       the Dustin Hoffman       

578
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,717
  of, like, queens for acting.  

579
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,118
    - You needed a lot of work. 

580
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,986
    We shouldn't give you passes

581
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,422
 because we've all been guilty  
     of going, that don't--     

582
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,790
        she's so funny,         
    that don't even matter.     

583
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,257
        No, but it does.        

584
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:57,292
        (RuPaul laughs)         

585
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:01,362
        (RuPaul laughs)         

586
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:04,898
    - Ladies, now it's time     
    for the judges' reviews.    

587
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:07,366
    First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.   

588
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,034
    - Let's talk about          
    your runway look.           

589
00:25:09,103 --> 00:25:12,337
       Each of the looks        
    individually, hmm, okay.    

590
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:14,038
    What I think you executed   
        so well                 

591
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:16,273
     was how it converted.      
           - Mm-hmm.            

592
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:18,275
          - That took           
      a lot of ingenuity.       

593
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:20,476
    If this doesn't work out,   
    you could work at NASA.     

594
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:23,178
    - As far as the performance,

595
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:25,647
    you know it's my all-time   
        favorite movie.         

596
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:26,814
            - Yeah.             

597
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:29,450
     - And I was literally      
        so proud of you.        

598
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,718
        - Oh, thank you.        

599
00:25:30,786 --> 00:25:33,753
    - Not only did you look     
    just like Mama Versayce,    

600
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:35,487
        but you embodied        
        the character.          

601
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:37,855
     - You did a great job.     
             - Yes.             

602
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:39,823
    I've been trying so hard    

603
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:42,926
        throughout this         
    entire competition. Ah!     

604
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:46,896
    And you guys like it,       
    I don't know what to say.   

605
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:48,163
          - All right.          
      Thank you very much.      

606
00:25:48,232 --> 00:25:51,166
    Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.    

607
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:52,601
       - You're gorgina.        
           - You are.           

608
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,737
    Like, I don't even want     
to look at you you're so pretty.

609
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,640
    - Ah! The outfit.           
    I want to borrow that.      

610
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,074
        It's so creative,       
        so beautiful.           

611
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:04,177
    - The bad part for you      
    was Phi Phi was so strong   

612
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,779
    that it was hard to keep up.

613
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:09,014
    With you, I think           
    you had to work harder      

614
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,182
           and it was           
       a bit more forced.       

615
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,317
    - Phi Phi was just          
    stealing the scenes,        

616
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:13,618
    whereas your character      

617
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,552
    should've been the character
    that stole the scene.       

618
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,755
And unfortunately, it kind of   
    got lost a little bit.      

619
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:20,523
        - Up next, Katya.       

620
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:22,491
        - Let's talk            
        about the runway.       

621
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,926
    I didn't think the two looks
    were wildly different,      

622
00:26:24,995 --> 00:26:27,395
      but I liked the humor     
            behind it.          

623
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:28,696
        - Thank you.            

624
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:31,331
- Your conversion told a story, 
    and I liked that.           

625
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,034
    - In your movie, I think    
    that you were in your head  

626
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:36,569
        a little bit            
        in the beginning.       

627
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,905
- But as soon as Michelle and I 
talked to you, you delivered.   

628
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:43,075
    The scene with you and Detox
    is my favorite of the three.

629
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:46,143
        - Up next, Detox.       

630
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:47,944
    - As far as your scene goes,

631
00:26:48,013 --> 00:26:50,713
        you were 100% in        
      from the beginning.       

632
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:52,347
    - And it was really         
    collaborative.              

633
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:53,881
    You worked well             
    off of each other.          

634
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,918
        Let's talk about        
    your Ms. Peking Tuck look.  

635
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:59,787
    When I see, like,           
    a two-for-one look,         

636
00:26:59,856 --> 00:27:01,222
    I want to see it, like,     
        you know,               

637
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,424
    turn from, like, a toaster  
    into, like, a Nissan Sentra.

638
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,392
    So not the most             
    amazing transition,         

639
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,127
    but I loved the end result. 

640
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:11,196
        - All right,            
        Alyssa Edwards.         

641
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:12,364
    - You needed a lot of work. 

642
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:14,166
        I think                 
    the biggest problem for me  

643
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,333
    was your enunciation,       
    because nobody understood   

644
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,834
 that you were saying "nurse".  
            - Nurse!            

645
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,168
    - All we heard was Na-a-ah. 

646
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,637
         - I don't care         
      about your diction.       

647
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,206
    All you have to do is, like,
    make weird, big googly eyes 

648
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:25,707
      and do funny things       
        with your mouth         

649
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:27,942
    and that mumble, aah, aah.  

650
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:30,344
       I think your fans        
    got their money's worth.    

651
00:27:30,413 --> 00:27:31,845
      I think it was okay.      

652
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:33,546
    - As far as the runway look,

653
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:35,014
    I don't feel like           
    it was a great reveal,      

654
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,882
    but it didn't even matter.  

655
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,084
    The cameras everywhere      
    was just so wacky.          

656
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:40,953
        - Can I add             
    something to that?          

657
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:43,888
    Little things in this       
    situation have to matter.   

658
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,590
        - I don't care.         
        I love this look.       

659
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:47,991
    It's funny and it's smart   

660
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,427
    and I like to see stuff     
like that come down the runway. 

661
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:51,961
       - But we shouldn't       
        give you passes,        

662
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,196
because we've all been guilty   
    of going, that don't--      

663
00:27:54,265 --> 00:27:55,464
        she's so funny,         
    that don't even matter.     

664
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:56,531
        No, but it does.        

665
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,433
      - Thank you, Alyssa.      

666
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:01,201
     All right, let's move      
       on down to Alaska,       

667
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,403
    tonight on the runway       
    as Little Poundcake.        

668
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:07,874
Now, Little Poundcake was your  
concoction on your season.      

669
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:11,477
- Lineysha Sparx and I made her 
    for a mini challenge.       

670
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:13,711
- Coming out as Little Poundcake
    tonight was brilliant.      

671
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,313
    You picked the right time   
        to do it.               

672
00:28:15,381 --> 00:28:17,581
    You looked fantastic,       
    and it's so fun.            

673
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:19,416
    - The acting was so good.   

674
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:22,552
You were like the Dustin Hoffman
of, like, queens for acting.    

675
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,954
        - You were born         
      to play Bette Davis.      

676
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:27,557
        All the nuances,        
        the insanity,           

677
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,526
          it was just           
       so, so brilliant.        

678
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:31,760
        - Thank you.            

679
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:32,994
    - Anything you want to say? 

680
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:35,730
    - You're not my real mom    
    and you never will be.      

681
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,899
        (all laugh)             

682
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,034
    - Well, thank you, ladies.  

683
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:42,269
    Based on your performances  

684
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:45,004
        and your                
    two-in-one runway looks,    

685
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:46,806
    I've made some decisions.   

686
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:52,943
    Phi Phi O'Hara, Alaska,     

687
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:54,177
    con-drag-ulations.          

688
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:57,447
    You are the top two AllStars
        of the week.            

689
00:28:57,516 --> 00:29:00,516
        (applause)              

690
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:05,386
    You've each won $1,000      
shopping spree at Fabric Planet.

691
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:07,154
        - Oh, fuck.             

692
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:09,523
    I'm finally in the top two? 

693
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:11,624
   My heart's ready to, like,   
      jump out of my chest      

694
00:29:11,693 --> 00:29:14,260
    because I'm so happy        
        right now.              

695
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:18,531
    - Detox, you are safe.      

696
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,936
    That means Roxxxy Andrews,  
    Katya, Alyssa Edwards...    

697
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,773
    You are in the bottom three.

698
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:31,676
    - I'm a little upset        
    because I don't feel like   

699
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:33,010
    I should be in the bottom   
        this week.              

700
00:29:33,078 --> 00:29:34,911
        But here I am.          

701
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,049
     - Phi Phi and Alaska,      
  each of you needs to decide   

702
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:43,519
    which of the bottom three   
        you'll eliminate        

703
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:46,823
    if you win the lip sync.    

704
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:50,859
        So while you queens     
    deliberate in the workroom, 

705
00:29:50,928 --> 00:29:54,095
   the judges and I will make   
       prank phone calls.       

706
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:56,163
            (ring)              

707
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:58,699
    You may leave the stage.    

708
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:00,900
        Coming up...            

709
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:02,669
- This is Alyssa's first time   
    being in the bottom,        

710
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:03,969
        but I do believe        

711
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,136
    that you got the harshest   
    critiques out of the group. 

712
00:30:05,205 --> 00:30:06,337
        - We've only had        
        four challenges.        

713
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:07,638
    You've been in the bottom   
        twice.                  

714
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:10,307
    - Katya and I both have     
    been in the bottom twice.   

715
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,376
        (RuPaul laughs)         

716
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,413
        (RuPaul laughs)         

717
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:22,050
 - I feel like I should be safe 
   based off my performance,    

718
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,420
but I don't know if the other   
girls agree with me or not.     

719
00:30:25,489 --> 00:30:27,655
    - We have this really       
    difficult decision          

720
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:29,356
    that we're going to have    
        to be making.           

721
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,557
    - Do you guys know how      
    you're going to do it?      

722
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:32,925
    - I said from the get-go    
       I was going to do        

723
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:35,927
    what I felt the judges      
    said was the weakest.       

724
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:37,828
    But it really is close.     

725
00:30:37,897 --> 00:30:40,297
    - I mean, does anyone       
    who's in the bottom         

726
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,999
           think that           
     it wasn't that close?      

727
00:30:43,068 --> 00:30:45,267
- This is Alyssa's first time   
    being in the bottom,        

728
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:46,635
        but I do believe        

729
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:48,569
    that you got the harshest   
    critiques out of the group. 

730
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,503
- They did like my runway,      
and they liked a lot of things  

731
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:51,537
           about what           
       I was doing in it.       

732
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:53,005
         We've only had         
        four challenges.        

733
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:54,306
   You've been in the bottom    
             twice.             

734
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,506
    - Katya and I have both     
    been in the bottom twice.   

735
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:56,774
    - So that's why I don't feel

736
00:30:56,842 --> 00:30:59,075
    that I should go home       
    because of one challenge.   

737
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:02,111
             - Ooh.             
      - That's how I feel.      

738
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,847
     - I know that normally     
       we do one-on-ones.       

739
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:09,050
    In my case, I don't know    
    if I really need to do that.

740
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,617
    - I want to do one-on-ones  

741
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:14,120
    with the three girls        
    who are in the bottom.      

742
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,058
        Thank you               
    for coming to my office.    

743
00:31:20,126 --> 00:31:21,492
    - Do you want me to plead   
    my case really quick?       

744
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:23,227
        - Yes, I do.            
        - All right.            

745
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:24,495
    So I stumbled a little bit  
        getting warmed up       

746
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:26,096
    in the challenge,           
    but then nailed it.         

747
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:28,097
         On the runway,         
   I agree the transformation   

748
00:31:28,165 --> 00:31:29,565
    wasn't as dramatic          
    as it could've been,        

749
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:32,634
but I think the overall look    
was different and good and fun. 

750
00:31:32,703 --> 00:31:34,402
    Okay. Thanks, mom.          

751
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:35,536
      - Thank you, honey.       

752
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,672
        Can you send in         
    the next model, please?     

753
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,841
        Hi, honey.              

754
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:43,710
           - (sighs)            
         As my partner,         

755
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:44,944
    I don't want you to feel    
    like I let you down.        

756
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:46,278
        I really did try.       

757
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:48,580
      I took their notes        
and I was full-out every time.  

758
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:50,181
      Just, I fell short.       

759
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,317
    - If not you, then who?     

760
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:54,752
    - I definitely think        
    it's one of them two.       

761
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:55,986
    They've been in the bottom. 

762
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:57,454
    But I don't want            
    to pick one of them.        

763
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:58,688
          I just want           
       to talk about me.        

764
00:31:58,757 --> 00:31:59,788
          I was great           
      in the talent show.       

765
00:31:59,857 --> 00:32:01,824
    I came prepared             
    for the Snatch Game.        

766
00:32:01,892 --> 00:32:04,526
    Got showed up in, you know, 
    the dance challenge,        

767
00:32:04,595 --> 00:32:06,028
    and I just fell short today.

768
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,296
    That's like if you were     
    in the bottom tomorrow.     

769
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:12,399
    And your development,       
I couldn't judge you like that. 

770
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:14,902
    So I hope that, Alaska,     

771
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,070
    you take into consideration 
        all of the accounts.    

772
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:20,372
    - I will, and I have        
    a lot to think about.       

773
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,174
        - I understand.         
        Thank you.              

774
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,408
            - Oh.               

775
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:25,909
    - It's a conflicting moment,

776
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,044
    so can you plead your case? 

777
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:32,248
 - Yes. I know I wasn't as well 
  as Phi Phi in my challenge.   

778
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,183
    Acting's not my thing,      

779
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,752
   but I feel like I did well   
       in this challenge.       

780
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,223
    And I've been in the bottom 
    twice and so has Katya.     

781
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,058
        I don't feel like       

782
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,826
    this is a challenge         
    I should go home for.       

783
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,296
        - It's going to be      
    a really difficult decision.

784
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,532
- I just want you to know that  
send me home or not, I love you.

785
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,534
      I feel like I should      
        still stay here         

786
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:55,002
    because I wasn't the worst, 
    so why send me home now?    

787
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:56,503
      - I have a question.      

788
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,638
        Do you have             
    that little pink thing      

789
00:32:58,707 --> 00:33:00,773
    that you wore in the video? 

790
00:33:00,842 --> 00:33:02,141
            - Yeah.             

791
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:03,975
    - 'Cause I want to wear that
    on top instead of, like...  

792
00:33:04,044 --> 00:33:05,043
      - Oh, my God, yeah.       

793
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:06,311
        Let me                  
    safety pin it on you.       

794
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:09,213
    - I have a question,        
    though for Phifs.           

795
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:11,181
        I feel like             
        when Phi Phi says       

796
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,516
    that she doesn't need to do 
        one-on-ones,            

797
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:15,118
        it's kind of            
    a little bitchy, honestly.  

798
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:16,886
        It's like               
    she couldn't be bothered    

799
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:19,588
    with having to know         
    what their opinions were.   

800
00:33:19,657 --> 00:33:22,190
         Usually we all         
      take everyone aside       

801
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:24,192
    and, like, have our little  
    pow-wows and one-on-ones.   

802
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:26,260
            What made you       
      come up with the decision 

803
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:28,695
            to not do that      
      with these girls tonight? 

804
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,263
    - I just don't want people  
        talking in my ear       

805
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:31,330
      and trying to beg me      
            to stay.            

806
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:33,031
    I want to just listen to Ru 

807
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,900
      and go through my head    
            and think.          

808
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:38,503
    - All of a sudden, like,    

809
00:33:38,572 --> 00:33:43,007
    this kind of snarky, bitchy 
    monster is coming out.      

810
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:44,474
    It's definitely interesting,
    especially for her saying   

811
00:33:44,543 --> 00:33:47,810
    she wants to avoid that     
    appearance this time around.

812
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,945
    But it looks like           
    she's just coming back      

813
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:53,314
      to how she was portrayed  
            on season 4.        

814
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:54,548
        (telephone rings)       

815
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:55,816
      - (old woman) Hello?      

816
00:33:55,885 --> 00:34:01,121
    - I'm looking for Mike,     
        last name Hunt.         

817
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:04,657
    Has anyone seen Mike Hunt?  

818
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:05,924
        (all laugh)             

819
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:07,726
      This never gets old.      

820
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,694
        - Never, never.         

821
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:13,530
        - Silence!              

822
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,534
      Bring back my girls.      

823
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:23,605
         - I feel great         
       about my decision.       

824
00:34:23,674 --> 00:34:25,340
         I'm constantly         
     just going in my head,     

825
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:29,209
    what did the judges say,    
    what did the judges say?    

826
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,544
        I'm sure                
    the queen that I chose      

827
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:33,213
    is not going to take this   
        very well,              

828
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,382
    but it's part of the game.  

829
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:39,517
    - It's really hard          
    to contemplate              

830
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:42,853
        the idea                
    of sending a friend home.   

831
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:44,621
    I've made up my mind,       

832
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,825
        but I hope              
    it's the right decision.    

833
00:34:51,663 --> 00:34:53,629
        (RuPaul laughs)         

834
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:57,298
        (RuPaul laughs)         

835
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:03,203
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

836
00:35:03,271 --> 00:35:07,340
        Two top AllStars        
        stand before me.        

837
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:13,646
    Ladies, this is your chance 
    to impress me, win $10,000, 

838
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,447
       and earn the power       

839
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:20,452
        to give one of          
    the bottom queens the chop. 

840
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:25,356
    The time has come           
    for you to lip sync         

841
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:30,594
    (echoing) for your legacy.  

842
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:31,728
    - I really want to show Ru  

843
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,529
    that Phi Phi's a force      
    to be reckoned with.        

844
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:38,233
            - Good luck,        
      and don't fuck it up.     

845
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,302
        (music plays)           

846
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:48,542
        -  What you think, ah 

847
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:49,743
     I think I love you, baby 

848
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:52,579
     What you feel now        

849
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:54,113
     I feel I need you, baby  

850
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:56,282
     What you know, ah        

851
00:35:56,351 --> 00:36:00,352
         To be real           

852
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:07,625
        Ooh, your love's       
         for real now          

853
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:10,795
     You know that your love   
        is my love             

854
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:12,863
         My love is your love 

855
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:18,634
   Our love is here to stay,   
        ay, ay, ay, oh         

856
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:21,636
     What you think, ah       

857
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:23,037
     I think I love you, yeah 

858
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:25,339
     What you feel now        

859
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:27,474
     I feel I need you         
        to be real             

860
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,642
     Got to be real           

861
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,776
        Got to be real        

862
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:31,944
         To be real           

863
00:36:32,012 --> 00:36:33,111
     Got to be real           

864
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:35,012
        Got to be real        

865
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:36,480
         To be real           

866
00:36:36,548 --> 00:36:38,115
       Real, real, real       

867
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:44,854
            - Yeah!             
     (cheers and applause)      

868
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,628
    - Ladies, I have made       
        my decision.            

869
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,133
    Alaska, con-drag-ulations.  

870
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:02,101
    You're a winner, baby.      

871
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,305
      You've earned a cash tip  
            of $10,000.         

872
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:07,472
        - Thank you.            

873
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,341
       - Phi Phi O'Hara,        
         you are safe.          

874
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,442
        - Thank you.            

875
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:18,648
    - Will the bottom three     
    please step forward?        

876
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:27,089
    Alaska, with great power    
    comes great responsibility. 

877
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:33,427
     Which queen have you chosen
            to get the chop?    

878
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:36,964
        - As it gets            
        fewer and fewer,        

879
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:39,165
        it gets                 
    more and more difficult.    

880
00:37:39,234 --> 00:37:41,967
        And so                  
    I hope that this queen,     

881
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:44,469
        who I consider          
        to be my sister,        

882
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:49,040
    will understand the decision
    that I've made tonight.     

883
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:50,475
        So the queen            
        I've selected...        

884
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,579
        is Alyssa Edwards.      

885
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,315
            (sobs)              

886
00:37:58,383 --> 00:38:00,784
        I'm so sorry.           

887
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:09,625
        - Alyssa Edwards,       
        as it is written,       

888
00:38:09,694 --> 00:38:11,760
      so it shall be done.      

889
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:14,762
       You are an AllStar       

890
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:18,098
      always and forever.       

891
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,098
        - Thank you.            

892
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:22,401
      - Now, sashay away.       

893
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,069
    - I'm so sorry.             
    I love you so much.         

894
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:25,570
    - Don't be sorry, girl.     

895
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,140
      Well, I was a lovely      
        fifth alternate.        

896
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:33,210
          (all laugh)           

897
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:36,847
      Always and forever,       
        Alyssa Edwards.         

898
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,419
        I'm going to take       
        my own advice.          

899
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,487
   Winning isn't everything,    
       but wanting to is.       

900
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:48,822
There are so many people that   
want to be in this competition, 

901
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,157
        and I'm                 
    one of the lucky ones.      

902
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:54,160
        A true champion         
        isn't the one           

903
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:56,294
    that necessarily            
    leaves with a trophy.       

904
00:38:56,363 --> 00:38:58,296
            (alarm)             

905
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:01,867
    - Alyssa, it ain't over.    

906
00:39:03,436 --> 00:39:05,635
    Con-drag-ulations, AllStars.

907
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:08,772
        Now, remember,          
    if you can't love yourself, 

908
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,376
     (muffled) how the hell     
 you gonna love somebody else?  

909
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:25,253
      - "It's not personell,    
            it's drag.          

910
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,088
        P.S. log off."          

911
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,456
            Aw.                 

912
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:30,190
            - Alyssa            
      was just eliminated,      

913
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:34,194
and it feels like a giant chunk 
   of the Drag Race tapestry    

914
00:39:34,263 --> 00:39:35,995
      was just burned out.      

915
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:38,397
      - I feel like I sent      

916
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:41,533
    my really good Judy         
    away from here,             

917
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:43,901
      and I feel like shit      
          about that.           

918
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,769
        - So who did you choose?

919
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,106
        - I also agreed.        
        It was Alyssa.          

920
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:51,007
          And can I be          
       completely honest?       

921
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:54,644
 I am sick of hearing them say  
  you can wear shit on stage,   

922
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:56,545
         but it's okay          
     'cause you're Alyssa.      

923
00:39:56,614 --> 00:39:59,848
     It really bothered me      
  and I just kind of felt like  

924
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:01,817
 it's not fair that the judges  
      just let her slide.       

925
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:04,052
        If that was me,         
  I'd get my ass served to me.  

926
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,319
        It was sloppy.          

927
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:07,454
        I think that concept    
    was cool, but it was sloppy.

928
00:40:07,522 --> 00:40:09,923
    And if any of us did that,  
    we would get read for filth.

929
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,825
It was like she kept saying,    
like, you shouldn't send me home

930
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:14,827
    because I've only been      
    in the bottom once.         

931
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,161
    And she was too concerned   

932
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,028
    about saying this is your   
    second time in the bottom,  

933
00:40:17,097 --> 00:40:18,396
      you should go home.       

934
00:40:18,464 --> 00:40:21,865
    What even, like, made that  
    decision even easier for me 

935
00:40:21,934 --> 00:40:24,601
    is it seemed to me          
    she was more concerned      

936
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,537
    about throwing you two under
    the bus during deliberation.

937
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,242
      - What? Oh, my God!       

938
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,609
    - Oh, fuck! My God.         

939
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:36,310
    - What is going on here?    

940
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:38,479
            - Boom!             

941
00:40:38,547 --> 00:40:41,247
          - Face crack          
       of the millennium.       

942
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:44,083
  All of the eliminated girls   
are standing behind the mirror. 

943
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:47,052
         They look mad.         
     They look really mad.      

944
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,420
      - What the fuck?          

945
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,489
          - Oh, shit.           
    There's Alyssa Edwards.     

946
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:53,723
    I'm surprised the bitch     

947
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,658
      hasn't dove through       
     the fuckin mirror yet.     

948
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:58,693
      - Trust the duchess       
      when she says this.       

949
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:00,895
    Y'all thought you all       
        had packed me?          

950
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,830
        It ain't over           
        just yet, baby.
