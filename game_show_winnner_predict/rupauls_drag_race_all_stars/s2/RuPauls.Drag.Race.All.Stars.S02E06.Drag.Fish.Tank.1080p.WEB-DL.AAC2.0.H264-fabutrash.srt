1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,834
        - Previously on         
         "AllStars... "         

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:08,872
  It's time for the returning   
  queens to get their revenge.  

3
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:12,342
  The top two returning queens  

4
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:13,709
         will lip sync          
         for the power          

5
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:17,947
         to give one of         
   the bottom queens the chop   

6
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:23,252
  and get the right to return   
      to the competition.       

7
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:26,788
   - We're in the company of    
  some amazing queens tonight.  

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,156
            - Where?            

9
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:29,690
          (all laugh)           

10
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,025
         - The rosebuds         
      were in full bloom.       

11
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:35,295
    - The assholes were out,    
           literally.           

12
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:36,829
          (all laugh)           

13
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,530
       - Roxxxy Andrews.        

14
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:40,298
   - I thought your entrance    
          was strong,           

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,400
  and then it was like someone  
took the needle off the record. 

16
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:44,936
     - With the--with the--     
  with the glory hole, right?   

17
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:46,337
       - Phi Phi O'Hara.        

18
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,572
         - You had some         
     funny jokes in there,      

19
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:51,174
  but for me, it turned into,   
      like, a scene study.      

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,208
          - Hmm, okay.          

21
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,879
          - Tatianna,           
     you're a winner, baby.     

22
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:02,616
      And Alyssa Edwards,       
     you are also a winner.     

23
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:04,484
            - Yeah!             
      - We're gonna do it.      

24
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:09,255
 - Alyssa, which queen have you 
    chosen to get the chop?     

25
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,258
       - Tonight, I chose       
   Phi Phi O'Hara to go home.   

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,258
          - Tatianna.           

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,758
       - Phi Phi O'Hara.        

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,461
       - Phi Phi O'Hara,        
          sashay away.          

29
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:30,773
       - Congratulations,       
        we made it out!         

30
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:32,407
      - We're here, girl.       

31
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,209
   Not one, but two of us now   

32
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,111
      are officially back       
      in the competition.       

33
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:40,013
       Phi Phi went home.       
    It was a unanimous vote.    

34
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:44,818
   - "I wanted to avoid hugs    
       because of tears."       

35
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:48,187
             - Huh.             

36
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,389
        I was taken back        
         a little bit.          

37
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,925
      - That's okay. Bye.       

38
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:58,696
    - Do I believe Phi Phi's    
          explanation           

39
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,730
    for not hugging Alyssa?     

40
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:02,364
              No.               

41
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:03,865
   - I was just freaking out    

42
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,634
  that both of them were going  
   to be going home tonight.    

43
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:08,702
  Obviously, I'm very excited   
   that Roxxxy's still here,    

44
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:10,069
          but it sucks          
     to see Phi Phi leave.      

45
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:12,638
      But if she had to go      
 in order for my girl to stay,  

46
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,373
      I'm happy with that.      

47
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,740
          - Six again.          

48
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:18,309
           - I know.            
         What the fuck?         

49
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:21,345
     We go from a top five      
         to a top six.          

50
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:23,146
      That kind of sucks.       

51
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:24,747
        - At this point         
      in the competition,       

52
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:27,316
     stakes are so high and     
  everybody's on their A game.  

53
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:28,651
      We all want to win.       

54
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:33,755
      I can't wait to see       
      how this turns out.       

55
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:38,992
   - The winner of "RuPaul's    
      Drag Race AllStars"       

56
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:40,761
   receives a one-year supply   

57
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:43,129
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills   
           cosmetics,           

58
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,698
       a coveted spot in        
  the Drag Race Hall of Fame,   

59
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,268
        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000.          

60
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,471
With extra special guest judge, 
         Graham Norton.         

61
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,038
   -  "RuPaul's Drag Race"    

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,405
      May the best woman      

63
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,674
        Best woman win        

64
00:03:01,145 --> 00:03:02,477
      - I don't jump guns.      

65
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,213
    I am the boom-boom gun.     

66
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:06,580
         - Here, let me         
     put this gig back up.      

67
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:08,515
         - New morning          
        in the workroom,        

68
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:12,051
      and one bitch down,       
       two bitches back.        

69
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,354
I just want everyone to go home 
     so I can win already.      

70
00:03:15,356 --> 00:03:16,721
      - Are you refreshed?      

71
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:19,357
     - I was concise, I was     
  consistent, I was confused.   

72
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:21,559
           - Mm-hmm.            
  - About all this conflomba.   

73
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,427
          (all laugh)           

74
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:27,564
  - We going down to the worm   
     with the bottle, girl.     

75
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,399
     - Hello, hello, hello.     

76
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,033
            - Hello!            
             - Hi.              

77
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:33,669
   - Ladies, I want to share    
            with you            

78
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,304
   the secret to my success.    

79
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:40,576
   All the big business deals   
  are made on the golf course.  

80
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:43,877
             - Oh!              
             - Oh!              

81
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,914
       - So I've invited        
   designer Andrew Christian    

82
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,749
     and these sexy beasts      

83
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:54,853
        to help us play         
       a few rounds of...       

84
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,421
        butt-butt golf.         

85
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,888
          (all laugh)           

86
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,058
     Ladies, take a moment      
 to get into a quick golf drag  

87
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,760
          and meet us           
       on the back nine.        

88
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,095
              Go!               

89
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:08,529
  - Where's my plaid at, girl?  

90
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,699
           - Choices.           
      - Oh, I feel so hot.      

91
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,668
      - All right, ladies,      
         it's tee time.         

92
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,672
           Why, look,           
    it's Dinah Shore weekend    

93
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:21,608
    at "RuPaul's Drag Race."    

94
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,843
  First, you swing your thing   

95
00:04:23,845 --> 00:04:27,579
    to hit the ball through     
  the legs of these manimals.   

96
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,582
        And the AllStar         
     that can sink the ball     

97
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:35,219
     into the big pink hole     
   in the fastest time wins.    

98
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:38,656
   First up, Roxxxy Andrews.    

99
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,392
       Go! Keep your eye        
          on the ball           

100
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,827
            and not             
    their Andrew Christians.    

101
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:44,927
  - These balls are so saggy.   

102
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:46,796
  - You should be used to it,   
             girl.              

103
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,463
     - You're gonna have to     
    back up into that, girl.    

104
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:49,798
             - Ooh.             
             - Oh!              

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,699
   - All these hot mens can't   
    disturb me today, honey.    

106
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:53,835
     I need to get the ball     
          in the hole.          

107
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:59,372
          - Oh, yeah.           
      A hole-in-one hour.       

108
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:00,873
             Detox.             
          - Uh-oh. Oh.          

109
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,374
         - She's doing          
       the side maneuver.       

110
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,943
         Her technique          
        is very unusual.        

111
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:06,243
            - Move.             

112
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:08,311
             - Oh!              
             - Oh!              

113
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:11,347
          (all laugh)           

114
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:14,349
   - Okay, Detox, time is up.   

115
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:16,617
  I'm afraid we're gonna have   
   to pull the butt-butt plug   

116
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,718
          on this one.          

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,919
          (all laugh)           

118
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:21,021
           Tatianna,            
      look at the thrust.       

119
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,689
           Now, that            
   is how you play this game.   

120
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,190
           - Oh, wow!           

121
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,592
         - Hole-in-one.         
    - That's a hole-in-one.     

122
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:27,192
        - She's getting         
        the swing of it.        

123
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,327
             - Yes.             
        Alyssa Edwards.         

124
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,028
     - I'm taking my time.      

125
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,229
  I'm getting good technique.   

126
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,598
        - Girl! (laughs)        

127
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,666
         I think Alyssa         
      know what she doing.      

128
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,968
        She may not have        
       the fastest time,        

129
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,470
   but she's clearly winning    
           this game.           

130
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:44,005
       Katya. It's tense        
    on the green right now.     

131
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:46,007
      She's between a rock      
       and a hard place.        

132
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:47,808
      A really hard place.      

133
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,343
             - Oh!              
           (cheering)           

134
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:52,011
             - Yes!             

135
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,113
            Alaska.             

136
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,747
           Oh, yeah.            

137
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:58,851
     Wow, she is aggressive     
        in her approach.        

138
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:01,085
     Looks like she's going     
       for the full--yes!       

139
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:04,188
  Yeah, get it in there, girl.  

140
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,557
            She's in            
     the home stretch now.      

141
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:09,492
           All right!           

142
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,860
           - (growls)           

143
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:12,261
      - All right, ladies.      

144
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:15,430
        The winner is...        

145
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:16,431
           - Alaska.            

146
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,332
             - Yay!             
             - Yay!             

147
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:23,436
          - You've won          
     a $2,000 prize package     

148
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:26,406
      from Klein, Epstein       
           & Parker.            

149
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:30,343
  Suits made to measure, like   
 the suits I'm always wearing.  

150
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:31,610
             - Wow.             

151
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:34,813
    - And we're posting more    
      butt-butt golf video      

152
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,048
         at LogoTV.com.         

153
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,218
    Ladies, now that you've     
   played with the big boys,    

154
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,021
      it's time to show me      
    that you mean business.     

155
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,490
        For this week's         
        maxi challenge,         

156
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,392
       you need to create       
          merchandise           

157
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:53,061
     worthy of your unique      
         AllStar brand,         

158
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:57,332
  and then shoot a commercial   
  that really sells the goods.  

159
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,834
        And the top two         
      will get their merch      

160
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:04,304
      produced and sold at      
  the next RuPaul's Drag Con.   

161
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:06,573
           (applause)           

162
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:10,076
     - Think "Shark Tank,"      
          but fishier.          

163
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,379
       #RuPaulsFishTank.        

164
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,880
           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines,       

165
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:18,149
  and may the best woman win.   

166
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:19,651
             - Bye.             

167
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:21,118
         - Coming up...         

168
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,021
  - My product is going to be   
  the Roxxxy Andrews wig glue.  

169
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:26,923
      - Why does that glue      
        make it special?        

170
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,191
     - It's called Katya's      
        Crisis Control.         

171
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:32,294
     - The only crisis here     
        is the product.         

172
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:34,229
        (RuPaul laughs)         

173
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,999
        (RuPaul laughs)         

174
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,101
         - For today's          
        maxi challenge,         

175
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:45,104
       we have to create        
    self-branded merchandise    

176
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:47,673
  and then shoot a commercial   
          to sell it.           

177
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,844
    - I want to make, like,     
  a trash-talking receptacle.   

178
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,146
       Anytime you, like,       
       throw trash away,        

179
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:56,247
     it, like, yells at you     
         and reams you.         

180
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:57,615
           - (laughs)           

181
00:07:57,617 --> 00:07:59,016
    - What you doing, girl?     

182
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:03,586
   - I'm marketing executive    
     opulence fashion tape.     

183
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:05,788
     - Oh, that's fabulous.     

184
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,356
       What do you think        
   I got going on over here?    

185
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:10,258
   - It looks like you've got   
     Alyssa's go-go juice.      

186
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,759
           - (laughs)           
     - Is that what it is?      

187
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:14,462
      - It's a shot of G3,      
         the go-go-go.          

188
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:15,696
             - Ooh.             

189
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:17,430
      - When people think       
       of Alyssa Edwards,       

190
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:18,965
   they think of high energy.   

191
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,968
      It don't have to be       
    a Tuesday or a Saturday.    

192
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,203
   Full speed, full throttle,   
           full out.            

193
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,506
           - I mean,            
      I guess I'll try it.      

194
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:37,348
   My name is Alyssa Edwards,   
  and this is the true secret!  

195
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,551
  It's substantial shenanigans  
  and buffoonery and goonery.   

196
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,419
            A score!            

197
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,823
           - (laughs)           
         - Hey, ladies.         

198
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,457
       We've got company.       

199
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,661
  Say hello to Marcus Lemonis   
   from CNBC's "The Profit."    

200
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:52,929
        - Hello, ladies.        

201
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:54,596
             - Hi.              
            - Hello.            

202
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:56,698
         - Hey, Roxxxy,         
      meet Marcus Lemonis.      

203
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,032
     - How are you? Marcus.     
     very nice to meet you.     

204
00:08:58,034 --> 00:08:59,700
      - Nice to meet you.       
      - On this challenge,      

205
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:02,269
      where you are going       
    to market your product,     

206
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:04,738
        this is the man         
     you need to run it by      

207
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,606
         to figure out          
   if it's gonna work or not.   

208
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:08,140
   - So what's your product?    

209
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:11,109
  - My product is going to be   
  the Roxxxy Andrews wig glue.  

210
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,444
   - Why did you choose glue?   

211
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:13,944
       - I'm always known       
       for my hair flips.       

212
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:16,480
      - See, now, Marcus,       
    we wear lace-front wigs     

213
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,147
     where you have to glue     
         the side down.         

214
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,581
   - What would be different    
         from that glue         

215
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,682
       or any other glue        
          I could buy?          

216
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,884
       Why does that glue       
        make it special?        

217
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:26,286
        - I'm gonna have        
      to think about that.      

218
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,487
           - (laughs)           

219
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,288
     - You have to convince     
           everybody.           

220
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,223
    That glue is going to be    
     packaged differently,      

221
00:09:32,225 --> 00:09:35,259
    and there's going to be     
 instructions connected to it.  

222
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:36,527
       - You've got a DVD       
        that's included,        

223
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:37,694
   and I'm going to show you    

224
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:38,694
        exactly how much        
     you can flip your hair     

225
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,496
   without it going anywhere.   

226
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,431
         - This is what         
        you're selling.         

227
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,767
 Your expertise, your knowledge 
 and the glue is just a bonus.  

228
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:46,901
            - Okay.             
       - Oh, my goodness.       

229
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:49,170
          You just got          
    a million dollar lesson.    

230
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,437
          - Yes, girl.          

231
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,239
     - I cannot wait to see     
       your presentation.       

232
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:53,806
  See you in a minute, Roxxxy.  
   - Thank you so much, guys.   

233
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:55,975
          - All right.          
          Hey, Katya.           

234
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,276
        - Hello, mother.        

235
00:09:57,278 --> 00:09:59,678
    - We are excited to hear    
     what your product is.      

236
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,180
        - So it's called        
    Katya's Crisis Control,     

237
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:04,615
     and it's a refreshing      
           body mist,           

238
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:06,750
       and it also packs        
 the right amount of thorazine  

239
00:10:06,752 --> 00:10:11,453
    to protect from anxiety,    
fear, hallucinations or ghosts. 

240
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:12,454
     - So you're selling...     

241
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:14,256
    - I'm selling a feeling,    

242
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:16,324
  a sensation of, like, um...   

243
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,459
- You know that's the first way 
        to kill a brand         

244
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:20,828
      is to sell something      
    that doesn't have value.    

245
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,231
So I think you have a little bit
  of branding identity crisis.  

246
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,633
      - Okay. Well, that's      
     very on-brand for me.      

247
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:30,003
 - I think, right now, the only 
  crisis here is the product.   

248
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,071
 I want to have something that  
somebody actually wants to buy. 

249
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:35,274
      Just lose the bottle      
      and the whole idea.       

250
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:36,575
          Start over.           

251
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:37,742
            - Okay.             
          - I'm sorry.          

252
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:39,377
        - Thanks, Katya.        
          - Thank you.          

253
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,814
             Whoo!              

254
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:45,982
          (all laugh)           

255
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:48,649
        - Hey, Tatianna.        
             - Hey.             

256
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,317
     - What's the product?      

257
00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:53,286
       - It's a tea set,        
    perfect for talking shit    

258
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:56,689
   or "spill tea," as we like   
     to say it in the biz.      

259
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:58,390
        - So you've got         
         this tea set.          

260
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,258
      How's the commercial      
        going to unfold?        

261
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,060
       - It's going to be       
   very much just me walking,   

262
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,727
     saying, hey, you like      
         talking shit?          

263
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,130
   You can now spill the tea    
         with me, Tati.         

264
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:09,198
      And then they'll be       
        cutaways of me,         

265
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,665
       like did you hear        
         what she did?          

266
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,033
            - I see.            
            - Girl.             

267
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:14,068
  - You basically hooked me in  

268
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,937
    by asking me if I wanted    
  to talk crap about somebody.  

269
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:18,972
  If anybody says they don't,   
         they're lying.         

270
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:22,642
  The commercial was maybe the  
 best presentation I've heard.  

271
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:24,043
             - Wow.             
         - Well, blam.          

272
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:26,011
   - Well, get back to work.    
     Can't wait to see it.      

273
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:27,378
           - Will do.           
          - Thank you.          

274
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,379
          - Thank you.          
          - Good luck.          

275
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:31,181
        - See you. Okay.        

276
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:32,748
      - All right, ladies,      
         gather round.          

277
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,184
     Now, in a few moments,     
 you'll shoot your commercials  

278
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:39,687
      with Michelle Visage      
      and Carson Kressley.      

279
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:43,290
          So good luck          
     and don't fuck it up.      

280
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,558
          - Thank you.          
          - Thank you.          

281
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:49,028
         - Oh, my God,          
     what are you gonna do?     

282
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,929
     'Cause I just--I heard     
     that they were saying,     

283
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:52,797
    like, nope, start over.     

284
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,064
   - Yeah, I don't have time    
         to start over          

285
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,899
      and I like my idea,       
    so I'm just gonna do it.    

286
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,768
     - Katya's walkthrough      
  didn't really go that well,   

287
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,206
and when somebody kind of shoots
   the shit your entire idea,   

288
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,840
        that's a little         
        nerve-wracking.         

289
00:12:04,842 --> 00:12:08,810
     - I'm not gonna panic      
because I don't do that anymore.

290
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,779
      It's gonna be okay.       

291
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,280
         - Coming up...         

292
00:12:13,282 --> 00:12:15,682
       - Want to wake up        
       and just be cute?        

293
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:18,218
 - If you're selling an energy  
 drink, you gotta be energetic. 

294
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,085
            - Okay.             

295
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:24,823
- And I might even show you some
of the best wig reveal secrets. 

296
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:26,658
           - (laughs)           

297
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,626
        (RuPaul laughs)         

298
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:32,329
        (RuPaul laughs)         

299
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,633
          - Hi, Katya.          

300
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:38,034
        - So for today's        
        maxi challenge,         

301
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:42,170
   we have to pitch a product   
    that reflects our brand.    

302
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:44,972
      - You've got props,       
      you've got pit crew,      

303
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,139
    and you've got furniture    

304
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,174
    courtesy of our friends     
         at Riverworks.         

305
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:49,642
       - Is there a pig?        

306
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,510
     Oh, there's a turkey.      
      That's even better.       

307
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,877
           - (laughs)           

308
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,779
  - I'm gonna hold the turkey.  
       I'm in a kitchen.        

309
00:12:54,781 --> 00:12:57,081
      - You look confused.      

310
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,349
   So you're in the kitchen.    

311
00:12:58,351 --> 00:12:59,950
     - I'm in the kitchen.      
            - Okay.             

312
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:00,950
      And you're gonna be       
        standing there.         

313
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:02,785
        - Standing here         
        in the kitchen.         

314
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,820
      - What's your lines?      

315
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:09,892
    - Um, these days, being     
    a woman is really hard.     

316
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,125
          Keep going?           

317
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,260
        - Is there more?        
       - Oh, yeah, yeah.        

318
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:14,194
  That's the whole commercial.  

319
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:16,162
          - So Detox,           
        ready to try it?        

320
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,429
           - Mm-hmm.            

321
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:19,397
     I'm nervous going into     
     shooting my commercial     

322
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,765
       because I focused        
     a lot of my attention      

323
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,735
      on making my little       
    trash can come to life,     

324
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,870
     so I'm kind of winging     
      everything as I go.       

325
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,472
         - And action.          

326
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,441
       - (laughs) Sorry.        

327
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,843
     Detox's trash-talking      
        trash receptacle        

328
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:35,677
    has many catch phrases.     

329
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,346
          I've had it.          
          Officially.           

330
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,081
     This tastes like shit.     

331
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,116
    - This tastes like shit     
       is a catch phrase?       

332
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,517
   - It's gonna be new ones.    

333
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,319
           - (laughs)           
          - Oh. Smart.          

334
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:50,856
            - Alaska            
    Thunderfun Fashion Tape.    

335
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:53,525
    Anus-thing is possible.     

336
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:54,725
          (both laugh)          

337
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:56,927
            - Great.            
         - Great. Next?         

338
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,196
   How many more do you have,   
            Alaska?             

339
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,631
       - Um, there's 14.        

340
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,866
       - Are you serious?       
            - Yeah.             

341
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,467
        - You might want        
         to prioritize.         

342
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,235
            - Okay.             

343
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,837
   - I can't wait to see how    
  this feature film turns out.  

344
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,139
   Thank you, James Cameron.    

345
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:15,008
      Alyssa. And action.       

346
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,977
         - Why wake up          
        and just be cute        

347
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:22,081
     when you can spring up     
   and be drop dead gorgeous?   

348
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:25,883
   - What you just did wasn't   
     really full of energy.     

349
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:27,451
             - No.              
            - Okay.             

350
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:29,619
 - If you're selling an energy  
drink, you got to be energetic. 

351
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:32,321
            - Okay.             
      - Oh, yes. Ooh, ooh.      

352
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:34,389
    Oh, the phone's ringing,    
      the phone's ringing.      

353
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:35,824
     Oh, someone's calling.     

354
00:14:35,826 --> 00:14:37,091
         To the camera,         
         to the camera.         

355
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,260
      - Pick up your step.      
           Yeah, yes.           

356
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,062
      And kick and layout.      

357
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:43,130
        Yes! Whoo! Whoo!        

358
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,831
    - Come on, Debbie Allen.    

359
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,567
            - Right?            
           - (laughs)           

360
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,737
     All right, here we go.     
          And action.           

361
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,639
    - I'm going to show you     
     all of my wig tricks,      

362
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:58,243
 and I might even show you some 
of the best wig reveal secrets. 

363
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,144
             - Cut.             

364
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:03,480
       Um, your wig line        
   is really back right now.    

365
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:05,315
   Oh--yeah, there you, girl.   

366
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:06,382
          - Schnappy.           

367
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:07,884
           - Action.            

368
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:12,487
            - Mmm...            

369
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,622
             - No?              
             - No.              

370
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:16,423
         You're selling         
        this wig reveal.        

371
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,424
   - This is the money shot.    

372
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,391
    - This is the money shot.   

373
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:19,626
     - Of the whole video.      

374
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,795
    - And it's not working.     
       It's got to work.        

375
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,998
         Ms. Tatianna.          
          And action.           

376
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,466
      - She says her face       
       is on billboards,        

377
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:31,403
    but I hear it's actually    
   on wanted signs. (laughs)    

378
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:34,072
   - Cut. Yeah, Tatianna, you   
  should probably be bitchier   

379
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:35,239
  to stay with the character.   

380
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:37,942
        - Done and done.        
           - Action.            

381
00:15:37,944 --> 00:15:40,444
      - She says her face       
       is on billboards,        

382
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:43,346
    but I hear it's actually    
        on wanted signs.        

383
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,548
     (laughs) Stupid bitch.     

384
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,117
          (both laugh)          
            - Brava.            

385
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,251
      - Is that everything      
          you wanted?           

386
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,385
      - I think so, yeah.       
          - All right.          

387
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:51,452
       - Okay, great job.       

388
00:15:51,454 --> 00:15:52,586
          - Thank you.          

389
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:54,121
        - No, thank you.        
          - Thank you.          

390
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:59,391
         - Another day.         

391
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,593
          - Doll, boo!          

392
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:03,194
         - The rooster          
   has done cockadoodle-doo,    

393
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:07,097
   woke us wide awake, 'cause   
     today's category is...     

394
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,067
      pants on the runway,      
           darlings.            

395
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,138
 Pants on the runway, pants on  
the runway, pants on the runway!

396
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,373
      Pants-- (all laugh)       

397
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,675
          I can't wait          
   to see how this turns out.   

398
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,642
             - Hmm.             

399
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,781
   - Detox, you have a really   
     specific, like, brand,     

400
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:28,282
    which I think is, like,     
       really important,        

401
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,450
     especially with, like,     
     a challenge like this.     

402
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,051
      - Yeah, completely.       

403
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,653
  You know, I let myself down   
being here the first time around

404
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:34,920
          just 'cause           
    of everything going on,     

405
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:38,257
    and I feel so much more     
      in tune to who I am.      

406
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:41,426
 It's been such a needed thing  
       for me to be here.       

407
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:43,527
        And you as well,        

408
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:45,828
        getting in tune         
      with who Alaska is.       

409
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,096
   I've been so proud of you.   

410
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:51,133
          - Being here          
     is, like, so important     

411
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,202
    and there's nowhere else    
        that I would be         

412
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:56,203
       rather than, like,       
    right here in this room.    

413
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:57,237
    - Right here, right now.    

414
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:58,271
         That's exactly         
          how I feel.           

415
00:16:58,273 --> 00:16:59,305
       - Now doing this.        

416
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:01,473
  My biggest weakness Season 5  

417
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:04,809
   was my mind was scattered    
      all over the place.       

418
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:06,777
  Now I'm working really hard   

419
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:10,847
       on having a laser,       
         precise focus.         

420
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,283
- You've, like, topped yourself,
        like, times 10.         

421
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:15,851
          - Thank you.          
             - Yes.             

422
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:17,852
         - This will be         
   the most Relaskatox moment   

423
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,420
       they'll ever have        
        on this season,         

424
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:22,122
   and I love it 'cause it's    
  a beautiful, like, genuine--  

425
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,624
         - Oh, my girl.         

426
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,993
          - Relaskatox          
       is not in effect.        

427
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:28,961
         I know it may          
     come across that way.      

428
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:31,696
       We definitely love       
    and support each other,     

429
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:32,964
       but we're not here       
        to be a clique.         

430
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:35,866
   - I just got my foundation   
         all over you.          

431
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:40,170
- So the thing I like about you 
  is that you are very quiet,   

432
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:43,173
        but you're also         
       really out there.        

433
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:45,875
 - I'm really, really selective 
about who I spend my time with. 

434
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,577
    People who can call you     
         when you shit          

435
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:48,778
        if you're, like,        
         getting grand          

436
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,078
       or you're starting       
       to feel yourself,        

437
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,379
   I just get really fearful    

438
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:55,082
     of letting the quality     
    of my shit deteriorate.     

439
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:56,749
        And those, like,        
      right or die friends      

440
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:58,851
   are really good at holding   
    you accountable to that.    

441
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:01,954
  - I don't see how you could   
    deteriorate any further.    

442
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,788
  - I was gonna say it, bitch.  

443
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,091
           - (laughs)           

444
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:08,825
         - Sounds like          
        a drunk seagull.        

445
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:11,194
           - (laughs)           
     Oh, my God, you got--      

446
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:14,764
      you gutted, rotted,       
     paint-scraping fucking     

447
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,366
  IRS-cheating, Gila monster.   

448
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:19,368
         - (all laugh)          

449
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:25,072
        (RuPaul laughs)         

450
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:28,576
  -  Cover girl, put the bass  
         in your walk          

451
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:36,015
          Cover girl,          
  put the bass in your walk    

452
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:39,651
          Head to toe,         
   let your whole body talk    

453
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,352
          Cover girl          

454
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,822
           (applause)           

455
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:49,292
 - Welcome to the main stage of 
 "RuPaul's Drag Race AllStars." 

456
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:53,596
     A lady who's always up     
in my business, Michelle Visage.

457
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:56,799
      - Darling, I own 51%      
        of this company.        

458
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,200
         - Oh, really?          
          (all laugh)           

459
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:03,738
Style superstar Carson Kressley,
  you buying what I'm selling?  

460
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,040
       - If I can put it        
          on layaway.           

461
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,043
- The new star of "Kinky Boots" 
          on Broadway,          

462
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:12,978
  the incredible Todrick Hall.  

463
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,216
    - Hello, Ru. You better     
  put some lace in that walk.   

464
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:20,285
     - And the one and only     
         Graham Norton.         

465
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,586
        - Beyond excited        
        to be here, Ru.         

466
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:24,421
    I just hope some of your    
   fabulousness is catching.    

467
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:27,157
       - Darling, there's       
     an ointment for that.      

468
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,657
          (all laugh)           

469
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,892
           This week,           
    we challenged our queens    

470
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:35,330
      to create and pitch       
    their own AllStar merch.    

471
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:40,635
   And tonight on the runway,   
     the category is pants.     

472
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,003
         Pants, I said.         

473
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,403
          (all laugh)           

474
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:46,006
           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines,       

475
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,508
  and may the best woman win.   

476
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,414
   Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.    

477
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,681
      - That is Wigstock.       

478
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,816
   - Oh, she's putting the ho   
        back in Navaho.         

479
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:00,518
  - This outfit represents me   
          and my brand          

480
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,019
      because it's always       
     going to be glamorous      

481
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:05,321
  and you can see every piece   
    of my bootylicious self.    

482
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:08,625
   - Now, that's what I call    
      a power bell-bottom.      

483
00:20:08,627 --> 00:20:10,259
          (all laugh)           

484
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:11,393
             Katya.             

485
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,762
        The Russians are        
    taking over the runway.     

486
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:17,298
     - I'm giving you 1980s     
    lesbian literary agent,     

487
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,934
   disinterested, pissed-off    
     Ellen Barkin fantasy.      

488
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:22,468
         Comrade Katya.         

489
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,603
   - To androgyny and beyond.   

490
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:26,038
       - Alyssa Edwards.        

491
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,307
        - She's showing         
        a lot of beaver.        

492
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:30,841
      - I'm giving you all      
      a rich white woman.       

493
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:35,979
      "Dynasty," "Dallas,"      
      Joan Collins, rich.       

494
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:40,317
     My hair is so coiffed,     
 I don't care if my fur's fake. 

495
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,285
        - All that tail.        

496
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:43,786
             Detox.             

497
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:45,455
   - I always wanted to know    
 what happened to Raggedy Ann.  

498
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:46,956
        - My runway look        
          is inspired           

499
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,525
          by a vintage          
      Terry Leclair look.       

500
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:52,795
      But it's very, like,      
    futuristic cruise-wear.     

501
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:55,263
       - Now, this is how       
   they wear capris in Capri.   

502
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:56,998
           - I think            
      it's a clam digger.       

503
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,868
        - What the fuck         
        did you call me?        

504
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,935
            Alaska.             

505
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:03,938
  The other Miss Ross, Betsy.   

506
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,306
            - Yeah.             
          (all laugh)           

507
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:08,476
         - I feel like          
    a real American she-ro.     

508
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:10,110
  These pants are very bizarre  

509
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:13,446
          and I guess           
   that's very much my brand.   

510
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:15,781
 - You know, I love the fringe  
 benefits of a government job.  

511
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:18,750
  - That's her lunatic fringe.  
           - (laughs)           

512
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:20,251
           Tatianna.            

513
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:24,755
  - Ooh, all T-Boz, all shade.  

514
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,490
            (laughs)            

515
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:31,295
 - I'm choosing to work it out  
   to my T-Boz impersonation.   

516
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:35,499
  So I break out the slide and  
 the "Waterfalls" choreography. 

517
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,333
   You know, I'm always known   
     as, like, the pretty,      

518
00:21:37,335 --> 00:21:39,502
          but I can do          
       other things, too.       

519
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,370
     - She ain't too proud      
            to drag.            

520
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:42,504
            - Uh-uh.            

521
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:45,039
    - Now, don't go chasing     
          waterfalls.           

522
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,074
          Coming up...          

523
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:47,208
        - You never want        
        to be forgetful.        

524
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,143
      - It's just so ugly.      

525
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:51,111
    It's a really piss-poor     
           prototype.           

526
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:53,814
        (RuPaul laughs)         

527
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,550
        (RuPaul laughs)         

528
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,885
       - Welcome, ladies.       

529
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,786
       Let's take a look        
      at your commercials.      

530
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,556
           First up,            
      Foxy Roxxxy Andrews.      

531
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:06,390
             - Oh.              

532
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,258
      I'm Roxxxy Andrews,       
          and I'm here          

533
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,560
        to give you what        
  you've all been waiting for.  

534
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:14,630
 The Roxxxy Andrews Wig Tricks  
       Instructional DVD.       

535
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,765
            You ever            
      been making whoopie       

536
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:19,500
      and all of a sudden       
       you lose your wig?       

537
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:21,034
   Or performing at the club    

538
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:24,404
   and you show the audience    
 how much hair you really have? 

539
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:28,041
         Baby, this wig         
      ain't going nowhere.      

540
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:32,378
   I'll even show you some of   
  my best wig reveal secrets.   

541
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:35,847
             - Yes.             

542
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:38,182
      - If you order now,       
     I'm going to throw in      

543
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:41,018
        Roxxxy Andrews'         
     super tacky Wig Glue.      

544
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,953
       Now, go out there        
   and get your life, honey.    

545
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,255
           (applause)           

546
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:47,824
       - Here's the thing       
        with the video.         

547
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:51,594
 Even though the sight gag was  
  there with losing the hair,   

548
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:52,560
        it's almost like        
      when you see it once      

549
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:53,695
     and it's really funny,     

550
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:54,829
        then next time,         
      it's like, oh, okay.      

551
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,265
          That made it          
    a little bit forgetful,     

552
00:22:57,267 --> 00:22:58,666
         and you never          
     want to be forgetful.      

553
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,268
    - You wore that kind of,    
  sort of beige nude under it.  

554
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,805
      It was a bit sort of      
    granny on her honeymoon.    

555
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:06,806
    But it just looked like     
  it needed a good boil wash.   

556
00:23:06,808 --> 00:23:08,474
            - Okay.             

557
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:11,175
 - But I love this bell-bottom  
  look that you have going on.  

558
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:14,111
   I think it really accents    
      your womanly shape.       

559
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:15,713
          - All right.          
        Thanks, Roxxxy.         

560
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:18,382
          - Thank you.          
   - Up next, Comrade Katya.    

561
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:21,516
       - (Russian accent)       
     Riddled with anxiety?      

562
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:24,786
   Crippled under the burden    
      of existential pain?      

563
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:26,621
            (groans)            

564
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:29,491
         Hello, my name         
      is Katya Zimuchkiva.      

565
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:33,094
     You know, these days,      
    being a woman is tough.     

566
00:23:33,096 --> 00:23:35,129
    When I'm not struggling     
         with my weight         

567
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:36,764
   or worried about wrinkles,   

568
00:23:36,766 --> 00:23:38,832
         I am bombarded         
         by a cacophony         

569
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,834
       of demonic voices        
    in my head telling me...    

570
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,069
          (deep voice)          
    you're not good enough.     

571
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:46,772
      That's why I created      
        Crisis Control,         

572
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:49,675
   a moisturizing body spray    
     that provides relief,      

573
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:54,645
 while heavy doses of thorazine 
  shield the psyche from pain.  

574
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,682
          So go ahead,          
       control yourself.        

575
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:05,054
    (laughter and applause)     

576
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:07,156
      - That is ge-nee-us.      

577
00:24:07,158 --> 00:24:08,623
        Your commercial         
         is brilliant,          

578
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:11,392
     just very, very funny      
     the whole way through.     

579
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,560
   - You were really working    
    within your whorehouse--    

580
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:15,095
      I mean, wheelhouse.       
           - (laughs)           

581
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:17,697
       - Let's talk about       
       this runway look.        

582
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,265
      You looked gorgeous.      

583
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,900
You really, like, were modeling 
      the shit out of it.       

584
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:24,969
   - The outfit is so wrong,    
          it's right.           

585
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,236
     - Everything you did,      
        your commercial,        

586
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:28,205
   your product and your look   
         are on brand.          

587
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:29,639
          - Thank you.          

588
00:24:29,641 --> 00:24:33,310
   - Up next, Alyssa Edwards.   

589
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,511
     - My fellow Americans.     

590
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:40,415
     Now, I know you've all     
  been dying to know my secret  

591
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:46,253
 and I'm here to share with you 
the latest energy enhancer, DDG,

592
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:48,021
      Drop Dead Gorgeous,       

593
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:50,123
   that puts the go in go-go.   

594
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:52,892
      So if you're looking      
      to refuel your life       

595
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:56,462
    and get a nice good kick    
          and a boost,          

596
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,897
  why wake up and just be cute  

597
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:03,068
     when you can spring up     
   and be Drop Dead Gorgeous?   

598
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,804
   Not only am I a consumer,    
    I'm also the president.     

599
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:10,207
    (laughter and applause)     

600
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,343
     - So let's talk about      
       your runway look.        

601
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,778
  I love it. I think you look   
      like Cruella DeVille      

602
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,579
         decided to go          
       all the way black.       

603
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,916
    And once you go black...    
      - You never go back.      

604
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:21,618
       - The commercial.        

605
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,486
     Why were you in front      
      of the White House?       

606
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:27,022
    - For my season, I tried    
     to develop a perfume.      

607
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,557
    - Oh, I know. I've seen.    
            - Okay.             

608
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,193
         The Americans          
      have been asking me       

609
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,894
   for the last three years,    
  what is really your secret?   

610
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,729
         So I was doing         
      a press conference.       

611
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:35,864
          - I thought           
        it was all about        

612
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,164
    you being the president     
        of the company.         

613
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:40,267
       - Yeah, that, too.       
          (all laugh)           

614
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,236
   Fortunately, everyone was    
  laughing when it was airing,  

615
00:25:43,238 --> 00:25:45,471
    so you got the job done.    

616
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,105
   - I love the energy drink.   
     I think it will sell.      

617
00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:48,772
I think you should've called it 
      Tongue Pop, though.       

618
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:50,039
            - Okay.             

619
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:51,140
     - Give me some of that     
       Tongue Pop, baby.        

620
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:52,140
            - Okay.             

621
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:53,207
   - I'm a marketing genius.    

622
00:25:53,209 --> 00:25:55,209
   I marketed subversive drag   

623
00:25:55,211 --> 00:25:56,743
  to 100 million motherfuckers  
         in the world.          

624
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:01,180
 I'm a marketing motherfucking  
       genius over here.        

625
00:26:01,182 --> 00:26:03,382
        Up next, Detox.         

626
00:26:05,351 --> 00:26:08,285
       - Oh, hey, there,        
        it's me, Detox,         

627
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:10,453
      everyone's favorite       
  trash-talking transvestite,   

628
00:26:10,455 --> 00:26:13,489
       here with Detox's        
Talking Trash trash receptacle. 

629
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:17,359
           Hi, Detox.           
              Oh.               

630
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:19,127
     Detox's Trash Talking      
        trash receptacle        

631
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:21,830
    has many catch phrases,     
           such as...           

632
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:28,303
        And new takes on        
   your old favorites like...   

633
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,441
     Detox's Trash Talking      
        trash receptacle        

634
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:36,509
    is made of 100% plastic.    

635
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,912
     More plastic than me!      

636
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:42,081
          Only 35.99,           
    batteries not included.     

637
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,850
         - Oh, my God.          

638
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:46,951
      - This look, I think      
     it's really gorgeous.      

639
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:49,353
      It's sort of fresh.       
       It's continental.        

640
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:51,255
It's a real kind of head turner 
        on the catwalk.         

641
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:53,257
     - I thoroughly enjoyed     
        the commercial.         

642
00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,092
       A trashy trash can       
       is very much you.        

643
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,326
      - One of the things       
        that bothered me        

644
00:26:57,328 --> 00:26:58,794
    is that you were moving     
        your hand there.        

645
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:02,296
      Then it became like       
a ventriloquist type of moment, 

646
00:27:02,298 --> 00:27:03,664
        where it wasn't         
        supposed to be.         

647
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,232
      - It's just so ugly.      

648
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,501
             I know             
     it's just a prototype,     

649
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:08,868
       but it's a really        
      piss-poor prototype.      

650
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,037
      - He didn't mean it.      

651
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,871
            - I did.            
          (all laugh)           

652
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:14,572
          - All right.          
       Thank you, Detox.        

653
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:17,341
          - Thank you.          
       - Up next, Alaska.       

654
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:18,776
            - Hi-ee.            

655
00:27:20,078 --> 00:27:24,413
   In a world of oppression,    
        I speak my mind.        

656
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:26,581
       (deep voice) Anus.       

657
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,951
    That's why I use Alaska     
    Thunderfun Fashion Tape.    

658
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:34,287
    What makes this product     
   different, you might ask?    

659
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:37,356
   That's a stupid question.    

660
00:27:37,358 --> 00:27:39,524
    It makes you beautiful.     

661
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:41,025
         Ooh, tighter.          

662
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:43,427
   It makes you fashionable.    

663
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:47,464
          And it costs          
     lots of lots of money.     

664
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,367
   (whispering) I'm so rich.    

665
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,670
           Available            
   in three unique shades...    

666
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,976
       Alaska Thunderfun        
         Fashion Tape.          

667
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:04,679
    Anus-thing is possible.     

668
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,181
    (laughter and applause)     

669
00:28:07,183 --> 00:28:08,549
       - I had high hopes       
      for your commercial,      

670
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,950
         and you really         
       didn't disappoint.       

671
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:13,052
     It was properly funny,     
    really kind of captured     

672
00:28:13,054 --> 00:28:15,721
    that sort of pretentious    
       1990s perfume ad,        

673
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:16,755
    like an old legal tease.    

674
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:18,256
    It was very, very good.     

675
00:28:18,258 --> 00:28:20,025
       - You had so much        
        to get through,         

676
00:28:20,027 --> 00:28:21,725
       but you were able        
       to change on time.       

677
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:24,194
    - You, like, Spielberged    
      the shit out of it.       

678
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:25,628
          - You know,           
    it's what I love to do.     

679
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,930
     It's, like, my passion     
      and it's my calling.      

680
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:30,432
       - The runway look,       
      from the neck down,       

681
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,302
      you're going to some      
   fabulous Studio 54 disco,    

682
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:36,638
         but your hair          
       is going bowling.        

683
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,607
      - Up next, Tatianna.      

684
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:41,908
     - Do you like gossip?      

685
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,542
    Do you spreading rumors?    

686
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:45,444
          Do you like           
       just talking shit?       

687
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:46,845
  If so, then you're in luck.   

688
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:49,146
       Hi, I'm Tatianna,        

689
00:28:49,148 --> 00:28:51,548
    here with Spill the Tea     
           with Tati,           

690
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,950
       a designer tea set       
    designed by yours truly.    

691
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:55,951
   It's perfect for any wear.   

692
00:28:55,953 --> 00:28:58,921
       Wearing chartreuse       
  doesn't work for everybody.   

693
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:01,957
       (laughs) Choices.        

694
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,527
   She literally shit herself   
        down the stairs.        

695
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:08,129
    Cleanup on aisle feces.     
          Am I right?           

696
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,598
        My teacups work         
  for all kinds of beverages,   

697
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,468
  like coffee, cocoa or sake.   

698
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,538
        You also receive        
   my handy travel tea tote,    

699
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,506
        perfect for when        
       you're on the go.        

700
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,441
     She's a fucking cunt.      

701
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:27,045
  So make sure that you spill   
     the tea with me, Tati.     

702
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:28,346
           Thank you.           

703
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:31,382
    (laughter and applause)     

704
00:29:31,384 --> 00:29:33,551
 - On the runway, you came out  
      and we were gagging.      

705
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:35,419
   I mean, it's really good.    
          - Thank you.          

706
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:38,389
      - Would you please,       
 just for my own satisfaction,  

707
00:29:38,391 --> 00:29:40,657
         do that dance          
        that T-Boz does?        

708
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,458
         Ooh, love it.          
          - Yeah, yes.          

709
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,059
           - TLC tip.           

710
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:46,161
          - Moving on           
       to the commercial.       

711
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:47,295
   Even though you were being   

712
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:48,629
             really             
   see you next Tuesday-ish--   

713
00:29:48,631 --> 00:29:49,963
           - Choices.           

714
00:29:49,965 --> 00:29:51,098
     - We still liked you.      

715
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,899
         You're really,         
        really charming.        

716
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:57,269
       What you didn't do       
 is really feature the product. 

717
00:29:57,271 --> 00:29:58,269
    That was a miss for me.     

718
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,337
            - I saw             
    what you were going for,    

719
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:02,739
   but I felt like maybe you    
 didn't get all the way there.  

720
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:04,508
           - Gotcha.            
      - Thank you, ladies.      

721
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,008
  I think we've heard enough.   

722
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,245
           I've made            
    some business decisions.    

723
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:15,350
         Alaska, Katya,         
       con-drag-ulations.       

724
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:19,220
  You are the two top AllStars  
          of the week.          

725
00:30:19,222 --> 00:30:25,093
  You've each won a custom wig  
  wardrobe from Weaven Steven.  

726
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,494
             - Oh!              

727
00:30:26,496 --> 00:30:31,098
   - Plus, a limited edition    
     of your AllStar merch      

728
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,635
      will be available at      
the upcoming RuPaul's Drag Con. 

729
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:38,871
             - Yes.             
           (applause)           

730
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:43,408
    - Alyssa Edwards, Detox,    

731
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,243
         you are safe.          

732
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:51,514
   That means Roxxxy Andrews    
         and Tatianna,          

733
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,983
     you're the bottom two.     

734
00:30:55,787 --> 00:31:00,589
   Alaska, Katya, each of you   
        needs to decide         

735
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:02,857
    which of the bottom two     
        you'll eliminate        

736
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:05,727
    if you win the lip sync.    

737
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:10,497
      So while you queens       
  deliberate in the workroom,   

738
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,500
        the judges and I        
    will be skeet shooting.     

739
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:16,135
         - I don't know         
        what that means.        

740
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:18,671
   - You may leave the stage.   

741
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:21,205
          Coming up...          

742
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:23,574
         - Who the fuck         
    do I send home tonight?     

743
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,509
  Roxxxy's been in the bottom   
      however many times,       

744
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,577
      but Tatianna hasn't       
   been here the whole time.    

745
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,947
        (RuPaul laughs)         

746
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:35,750
        (RuPaul laughs)         

747
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,420
           - (sighs)            

748
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:40,954
        This is bizarre,        

749
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:44,391
     because it is the same     
    exact top and bottom two    

750
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:45,892
      from the Snatch Game      
            episode.            

751
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:50,363
 - We're lip synching yet again 
      against one another.      

752
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:51,531
   - And we're in the bottom.   

753
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:52,865
        - With those two        
         in the bottom.         

754
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:55,067
     - Oh, my God. I didn't     
     even think about that.     

755
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:56,468
         - It's dj vu         
        all over again.         

756
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,470
           Let's hope           
      that this doesn't go      

757
00:31:58,472 --> 00:32:00,438
      the way that it did       
     the first time around.     

758
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,641
 - I'd like to talk one on one  
 with you guys if you want to.  

759
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:04,908
            - Sure.             
     - I'll be over there.      

760
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,009
            - Fuel.             
       - Actually, Detox,       

761
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,144
          can we talk,          
       like, over there?        

762
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:10,078
            - Sure.             

763
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:16,116
         - Who the fuck         
    do I send home tonight?     

764
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:17,684
     - I don't want to see      
       my sister go home,       

765
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,086
  but out of who's left, she's  
  been in the bottom the most.  

766
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:22,622
 - Roxxxy's been in the bottom  
      however many times,       

767
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,690
 but Tatianna hasn't been here  
        the whole time.         

768
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,559
 - She's missed two challenges  
       until her return.        

769
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:29,593
  - I need to hear these hos.   

770
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:31,228
     - So before we start,      

771
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,562
    I just want to give you     
      a couple of moments       

772
00:32:32,564 --> 00:32:34,797
  to give me some compliments   
        about my outfit.        

773
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,199
         - Uh, living.          

774
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,400
           - (laughs)           

775
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:39,700
       - Living out loud.       

776
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:41,034
   - I'm so glad you did that   
         on the runway.         

777
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:42,902
          - Thank you.          
     - How are you feeling?     

778
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:46,338
      - I know that maybe       
  I tripped on this challenge,  

779
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,839
        but the next one        

780
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,274
   I'm going to fucking pick    
  that shit up and keep going.  

781
00:32:50,276 --> 00:32:53,409
    I definitely think that     
I was brought back for a reason.

782
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:56,211
        I've been given         
        a second chance,        

783
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:58,413
           and I want           
      to fucking be here.       

784
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:01,116
     I really think that my     
 performance speaks for itself. 

785
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:04,285
  Roxxxy's commercial was not   
    as entertaining as mine,    

786
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:05,954
       and my runway look       
          was better.           

787
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,022
     - How are you feeling,     
             honey?             

788
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:11,591
- You know what, I'm so thankful
       to still be here.        

789
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:14,027
     At the end of the day,     
       I don't feel like        

790
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:16,896
  I got the harshest critiques  
         like usually.          

791
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:18,697
        And I don't know        
      if this is my time,       

792
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:21,166
   but God does, so we'll see   
    what he decides for me.     

793
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:26,371
And regardless of what happens, 
     I am so proud of you.      

794
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,205
          - Thank you.          

795
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:30,707
     Thanks for letting me      
        borrow this top.        

796
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,408
       - You're welcome.        

797
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,477
   I've fallen in the bottom    
            so much,            

798
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,347
  my drive is a little lacking  
           right now.           

799
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,815
 But I feel like my commercial  
  was better than Tatianna's,   

800
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:43,618
   so if we're sticking true    
 to our plan, I should be fine. 

801
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,886
     - How are you feeling?     

802
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:47,122
         - I felt like          
   I had a great commercial,    

803
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,858
   but what I've been giving    
  has landed me in the bottom,  

804
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,060
        so I don't know         
 what else I can do, you know?  

805
00:33:53,062 --> 00:33:56,096
    If you decide me, no T.     

806
00:33:56,098 --> 00:33:59,766
   If you decide to keep me,    
             no T.              

807
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:02,268
        It's up to you.         
    I don't care either way.    

808
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,369
    I've been in the bottom     
          four times.           

809
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:07,105
     - If you're not trying     
           to express           

810
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:08,839
            how much            
     you want to stay here,     

811
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:11,041
   that must mean that you're   
    kind of ready to hit it.    

812
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:13,777
   And to that, I say hit it.   

813
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:15,778
      - All right, well...      

814
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,447
       - I love you. Mmm.       
        - Love you, too.        

815
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:21,584
 - Based on my last experience, 
Alaska didn't send Roxxxy home, 

816
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:24,786
     and that's an alliance     
    that's very evident now.    

817
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:26,220
            - Girl.             

818
00:34:26,222 --> 00:34:29,156
 - Although, I'm not going out  
    without a fight at all.     

819
00:34:29,158 --> 00:34:31,424
       Today was possibly       
     a missed opportunity,      

820
00:34:31,426 --> 00:34:33,092
  but this isn't deterring me   
          from, like,           

821
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,728
  wanting to fucking kick ass   
  in this fucking competition.  

822
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:37,596
        I clawed my way         
         back in here.          

823
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:40,899
      Like, that's a huge       
         fucking deal.          

824
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,735
 So, yeah, I'm not ready to go  
         by any means.          

825
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:46,304
     I will never say, oh,      
   what happens happens. No.    

826
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:48,406
  To you, I say keep a bitch.   

827
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:53,643
            - Pull!             

828
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:55,778
        (rooster crows)         

829
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,512
         Ooh, I got it!         

830
00:34:57,514 --> 00:35:01,516
    (laughter and applause)     

831
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,551
     All right, all right.      
            Silence.            

832
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:07,220
      Bring back my girls.      

833
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,459
 - After talking with Tatianna  
  and Roxxxy in the workroom,   

834
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,894
    I kind of go with my gut    
      with this decision,       

835
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:19,030
           and I feel           
      pretty comfortable.       

836
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:24,700
     - I still have no idea     

837
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:28,470
         whose lipstick         
      I'm going to choose.      

838
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:30,238
    If I send Tatianna home,    

839
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,440
      then people will say      
    that I'm favoring Roxxxy    

840
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:34,241
    because she's my friend.    

841
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:36,643
     If I send Roxxxy home,     

842
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:39,112
      then I'll look like       
        kind of a bitch         

843
00:35:39,114 --> 00:35:41,748
      because she lent me       
  this shirt that I'm wearing.  

844
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:48,153
        (RuPaul laughs)         

845
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,989
        (RuPaul laughs)         

846
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:57,793
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

847
00:35:57,795 --> 00:36:02,064
        Two top AllStars        
        stand before me.        

848
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:06,200
  Ladies, this is your chance   
         to impress me,         

849
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:09,937
          win $10,000,          
       and earn the power       

850
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:14,408
         to give one of         
  the bottom queens the chop.   

851
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:20,313
       The time has come        
          to lip sync           

852
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:23,783
   (echoing) for your legacy.   

853
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:27,719
    - Katya's really amazing    
        at lip syncing.         

854
00:36:27,721 --> 00:36:29,921
    I beat her once before,     

855
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:32,289
      but who knows what's      
    gonna happen this time?     

856
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,522
          - Good luck,          

857
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,860
     and don't fuck it up.      

858
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,563
         (music plays)          

859
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,633
    -  Can't stay at home,     
     can't stay at school      

860
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:48,370
         Old folks say,        
     you poor little fool      

861
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:52,173
        Down the street,       
    I'm the girl next door     

862
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:55,910
          I'm the fox          
   you've been waiting for     

863
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:59,780
         Hello, Daddy,         
          hello, Mom           

864
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:03,449
            I'm your           
  ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb   

865
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,986
         Stone age love        
   and strange sounds, too     

866
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:11,156
         Come on, baby,        
     let me get into you       

867
00:37:11,158 --> 00:37:14,325
           Bad nights          
    causing teenage blues      

868
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:18,296
      Get down now 'cause      
  you've got nothing to lose   

869
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:21,966
         Hello, Daddy,         
          hello, Mom           

870
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:26,036
            I'm your           
  ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb   

871
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:44,620
        Hey, street boy,       
       want some style?        

872
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:48,423
       Have you, grab you      
       till you're sore        

873
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:51,893
         Hello, Daddy,         
          hello, Mom           

874
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,763
            I'm your           
  ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb   

875
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:59,901
         Hello, world,         
      I'm your wild girl       

876
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:03,203
            I'm your           
  ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb   

877
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:05,672
         Cherry bomb          

878
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:10,443
          Cherry bomb         

879
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:15,547
    (laughter and applause)     

880
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:23,821
           - Ladies,            
     I've made my decision.     

881
00:38:27,626 --> 00:38:32,129
            Alaska,             
    you are a winner, baby.     

882
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:33,429
          - Thank you.          

883
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:35,864
           (applause)           

884
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:37,232
      - Con-drag-ulations.      

885
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:42,203
    You've earned a cash tip    
          of $10,000.           

886
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:44,672
      - Second time losing      
    the lip sync to Alaska.     

887
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:47,974
         Ugh. It sucks.         

888
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:51,344
     - Katya, you are safe.     
          - Thank you.          

889
00:38:51,346 --> 00:38:52,512
         - You may join         
        the other girls.        

890
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,918
      Will the bottom two       
      please step forward?      

891
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:08,124
    Alaska, with great power    
  comes great responsibility.   

892
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:12,795
  Which queen have you chosen   
        to get the chop?        

893
00:39:12,797 --> 00:39:15,965
     - One of these queens,     
        week after week,        

894
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:20,702
      has brought a level       
     of prestige and beauty     

895
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:23,537
         and excellence         
         to this runway         

896
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:26,440
      and to the art form       
            of drag.            

897
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:28,308
    And one of these queens     
         is the person          

898
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,944
  who lent me this very shirt   
   that I'm wearing tonight.    

899
00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:34,814
       So based on that,        
         I've chosen...         

900
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,352
           Tatianna.            

901
00:39:44,357 --> 00:39:46,156
       Tatianna, I think        
        you're stunning.        

902
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:47,423
           - Thanks.            

903
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:50,826
      - As it is written,       
      so it shall be done.      

904
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:54,130
           Tatianna,            
      you are an AllStar.       

905
00:39:54,132 --> 00:39:58,400
        Now sashay away.        

906
00:39:58,402 --> 00:40:01,035
          - Thank you.          

907
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:04,205
          - Thank you.          
          (all laugh)           

908
00:40:10,846 --> 00:40:14,114
    (laughter and applause)     

909
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,750
         - Even though          
    I didn't get to feature     

910
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:19,751
  everything that I wanted to,  

911
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:22,253
     I think I showed a lot     
       while I was here.        

912
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:23,888
   I got to introduce myself    

913
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,590
   to people who didn't know    
       who Tatianna was,        

914
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,693
      and I got to impress      
           the people           

915
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:32,028
  who have been my supporters   
         from the jump.         

916
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,563
           And that,            
       I'm very proud of.       

917
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:35,898
           Thank you.           

918
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,836
       - My fierce five,        
       con-drag-ulations.       

919
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,741
   You're one step closer to    
  the Drag Race Hall of Fame.   

920
00:40:46,743 --> 00:40:49,510
         Now, remember,         
  if you can't love yourself,   

921
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:51,144
        how in the hell         
 you gonna love somebody else?  

922
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:52,612
       Can I get an amen        
          up in here?           

923
00:40:52,614 --> 00:40:53,813
            - Amen!             
            - Amen!             

924
00:40:53,815 --> 00:40:56,181
          - All right.          
    Now, let the music play.    

925
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:58,116
    -  Throw you hands up     

926
00:40:58,118 --> 00:41:00,485
       Time to get down       

927
00:41:00,487 --> 00:41:03,887
       Time to get down,       
    down, down, down, down     

928
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:05,923
     Throw your hands up
