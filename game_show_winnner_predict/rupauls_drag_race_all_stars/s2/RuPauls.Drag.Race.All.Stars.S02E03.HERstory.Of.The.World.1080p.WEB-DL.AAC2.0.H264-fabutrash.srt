1
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,401
          - Previously          
        on "AllStars..."        

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,403
    It's time for Snatch Game.  

3
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:07,570
            (cheering)          

4
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:08,638
    - Why don't you come on up  

5
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,706
    and fuck me in the ass      
        sometime?               

6
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:12,107
            - Oh.               

7
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:13,441
        - They remove           
        their testicles.        

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,242
        - (laughs)              
        - Brrr.                 

9
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:17,377
        - Is that a wig         
        on your head?           

10
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:19,245
        - If you're not         
        wearing wigs,           

11
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:21,180
    then you're not doing drag. 

12
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:23,482
    - Let's hear you sing       
        to them.                

13
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,851
        (no sound)              

14
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:27,385
            Oh.                 

15
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:30,855
        Alaska,                 
    you're a winner, baby.      

16
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,958
        (applause)              

17
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:37,561
     Which queen have you chosen
            to get the chop?    

18
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,464
        - The queen             
    that I have chosen...       

19
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:42,865
        is Tatianna.            

20
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:47,103
        - Tatianna, sashay away.

21
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:59,248
            - (sighs)           

22
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:01,516
    - Tatianna's been eliminated
        and it's sad,           

23
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:07,922
    because she's a fierce,     
    fierce, fierce queen.       

24
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,324
      Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.       
          - Thank you.          

25
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:11,992
        - Thank you.            
        - Thank you.            

26
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,293
            - Thank you.        
            - Thank you.        

27
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:16,296
- I think Tatianna's amazing,   
    and I'm really glad         

28
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:19,832
    that she's sort of being    
    reintroduced to the world.  

29
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,401
    - And I think that the fear 
        that she had            

30
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:25,003
    about not getting the chance
    to do that is unfounded.    

31
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:29,107
    - Can I ask you what was    
the determining factor for you? 

32
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:34,144
            - Sure.             
      Roxxxy and Tatianna       

33
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:37,147
        both floundered         
      in the Snatch Game,       

34
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:39,716
but Tatianna did not bring it   
    on the runway               

35
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:41,484
    in the way that Roxxxy did. 

36
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:42,953
        - Thank you.            
        - Yeah, girl.           

37
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:46,389
I'm proud of Alaska for going   
off of the judges' critique,    

38
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,958
    and I'm even more proud     
    that she kept her word.     

39
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,093
    - Tatianna is an AllStar.   

40
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:54,328
- Some of us agreed it should   
be based on judges' critiques   

41
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,531
who we send home, and if you're 
  the weakest link that week,   

42
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,166
    then, sorry, but that's     
    just what we agreed on,     

43
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,735
    and I think that's fair.    

44
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,103
    Katya, can we ask who       
    you were gonna send home?   

45
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:04,771
        - Oh, yeah. Um...       

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,106
    I chose Tatianna as well    

47
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:09,342
    for the same reason         
    that Alaska just said.      

48
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,676
    Roxxxy slayed the runway.   

49
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:11,677
            - Slayed.           
            - Slayed.           

50
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:13,678
        - I feel like           
        in this instance,       

51
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:15,913
    it was a lot easier         
    to be objective about it.   

52
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:17,014
            - Yeah.             

53
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:18,448
    - I know you wanted         
    to get critiqued.           

54
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:22,318
    - I feel like I finally     
really stepped outside of my box

55
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:24,620
    as far as the aesthetics go.

56
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:27,755
        So I'm safe for         
    the second week in a row.   

57
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,091
    I felt like my Snatch Game  
    was really, really strong,  

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,927
         and I'm giving         
     glamour toad realness.     

59
00:02:32,996 --> 00:02:35,028
    What the hell else          
    do I have to do             

60
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:37,063
    to get a little recognition 
        in this gin joint?      

61
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:39,166
         - Girl, we are         
      really sitting here.      

62
00:02:39,234 --> 00:02:41,367
     One, two, three, four,     
       five, six--eight.        

63
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:43,035
        - There's seven.        
            - Seven.            

64
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:44,870
    - One, two, three...        
    - You can't count.          

65
00:02:44,938 --> 00:02:47,305
      - Four, five, six--       
           top seven.           

66
00:02:47,374 --> 00:02:48,639
       - You were looking       
   at yourself in the mirror,   

67
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,740
        so you counted          
        yourself twice.         

68
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:52,276
        (all laugh)             

69
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,044
    - Lookit! She's still       
    looking in the mirror.      

70
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,177
- She's just talking to herself 
    in the fucking mirror.      

71
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:56,745
            - Ah-ha!            

72
00:02:56,814 --> 00:02:57,879
        - On that note...       
        - On that note...       

73
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:01,282
    - Good day, good night,     
        you shady lady!         

74
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,550
        (all laugh)             

75
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:04,251
        - I love Alyssa,        

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,786
        but someone needs       
    to take her go-go juice away

77
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,020
        'cause she's a little...

78
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,955
        - But you look so right!

79
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,024
    - Alyssa, take my hair off! 

80
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,859
                        (laughs)

81
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,094
      - I wish you would snatch 
            my wig, girl.       

82
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,228
        I wish you would!       

83
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:20,730
        Come on! Come on!       
        Come on, bitch!         

84
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,266
        - Oh, my Jesus.         
        Just nonstop.           

85
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,668
    I mean, at this point,      
    it's just background noise. 

86
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:28,336
    I gotta focus on me.        
    I can't listen to this.     

87
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:30,437
        (all laugh)             

88
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:32,039
    She is funny sometimes.     

89
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:33,474
        Sometimes.              

90
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,944
    - Come get me up, baby.     

91
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:42,214
    - The winner of "RuPaul's   
        Drag Race AllStars"     

92
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:43,748
    receives a one-year supply  

93
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:46,284
            of Anastasia        
      Beverly Hills cosmetics,  

94
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:49,053
        a coveted spot in       
    the Drag Race Hall of Fame  

95
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,522
        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000           

96
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:55,725
        with extra special      
    guest judge Jeremy Scott.   

97
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,126
    - ¶ RuPaul's Drag Race ¶    

98
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,360
    - ¶ May the best woman ¶    

99
00:03:58,428 --> 00:04:01,062
      - ¶ Best woman win ¶      

100
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,500
    - So it's a new day         
    in the workroom.            

101
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:11,269
    I hate those new day        
    in the workroom bites.      

102
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:13,237
        I have? Okay.           

103
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:14,838
        It's a new day          
        in the workroom,        

104
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:17,040
    and I'm feeling very good   
        and sexy                

105
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,776
      and really grateful       
          to be here.           

106
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,079
            (laughs)            

107
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:25,380
            What kind of        
      vindictive machinations   

108
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:26,814
          do you think          
       they've concocted?       

109
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:29,449
 - I hope Todrick makes a video 
      and we're all in it.      

110
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:30,984
    - That would be so rad.     

111
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:32,552
        - Did he lend you       
        this jacket?            

112
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,021
    - Log off, B. Log.          

113
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,723
    - Don't log off.            
    Delete the account.         

114
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,057
        (all laugh)             

115
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,258
      - You're so stupid.       

116
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:41,492
    Girl, you looked over       
    at Detox yesterday          

117
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,060
    and said, you're a beast.   

118
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:45,428
            Beast!              
            - Beast!            

119
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,629
             - Beast!           

120
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:48,096
            - You're like       
      the Gila monster, though. 

121
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:49,364
    - You're a Gila monster.    

122
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:52,166
    - If you are that grotted,  

123
00:04:52,234 --> 00:04:57,470
    you could be a monster,     
   a Gila monster or a beast.   

124
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,071
        - Beast!                
        (all laugh)             

125
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,906
            - Beast!            

126
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:02,707
    - Hello, hello, hello.      

127
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:05,409
            - Hi!               
            - Hi!               

128
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:08,512
    - Ladies, for this week's   
        maxi challenge,         

129
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:12,616
    you'll be performing        
    a lip sync extravaganza     

130
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:16,819
    that salutes the baddest    
    bitches in herstory.        

131
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,487
      #HerstoryOfTheWorld.      

132
00:05:18,556 --> 00:05:19,588
        - (snaps fingers)       

133
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,256
    - Alaska, you'll play       

134
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:23,090
          the original          
       naughty girl Eve.        

135
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:25,459
            - Sss...            

136
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:28,295
 - Phi Phi O'Hara, you'll play  
      the face, face, face      

137
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:32,332
      that launched 1,000 ships,
            Helen of Troy.      

138
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:33,600
            - Oh.               

139
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:34,900
    - Ginger Minj, you'll play  

140
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:39,104
    Russian ruler supreme       
    Catherine the Great.        

141
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,573
    Detox, you'll play          
    the queen of cakes.         

142
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,342
        You know, cakes,        

143
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,611
        Marie Antoinette.       

144
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,912
    Alyssa Edwards, you'll play 

145
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,249
    gun-slinging superstar      
        Annie Oakley.           

146
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,884
    Roxxxy Andrews, you'll play 

147
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:59,021
    Argentina's former          
    first lady Eva Peron.       

148
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,890
    And Katya, you'll play      

149
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:04,993
    the people's princess,      
    Diana, Princess of Wales.   

150
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:08,063
    Now, ladies, you'll be      
    performing together,        

151
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:11,699
    but you need to do whatever 
    it takes to steal the show. 

152
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:13,334
        Later today,            
        you'll be meeting       

153
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:18,072
with choreographers Ant and Ash 
   from the Squared Division.   

154
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,073
        - Nice.                 
        (applause)              

155
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:20,840
        - And you know          
        they work with          

156
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:25,745
     pop goddesses Britney,     
  Taylor Swift, Kylie Minogue.  

157
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:28,480
    So don't fuck it up.        

158
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:30,482
        (laughs)                
        (applause)              

159
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:35,519
    - Oh, is that--that's       
    the Helen of Troy outfit?   

160
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:36,687
            - It is.            
            - (gasps)           

161
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:39,622
        It is so cool.          

162
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,990
        Can I try it on?        
            - Yeah.             

163
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:42,725
            (crunch)            
          - Um, okay.           

164
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:43,859
    You need to calm down.      

165
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,995
            I thought           
      that you had resolved     

166
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:47,963
        all this anger          
        from your season.       

167
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,330
    This is so cool.            
    This is so pretty.          

168
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,131
        - Thank you.            

169
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,067
    - Thank God you're talented 
        at something.           

170
00:06:56,838 --> 00:06:59,338
    - My dress is so shitty     
 compared to everybody else's.  

171
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,740
   - I think this is the most   
     iconic Diana, though.      

172
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:04,175
        - Yeah. It's just       
        a little wrinkly.       

173
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,610
        During my season,       
    we had a similar challenge, 

174
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:09,079
    and I bombed it so hard,    
    it landed me in the bottom. 

175
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:10,780
        Damn, girl.             

176
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,414
          - It's long.          
      - It's really long.       

177
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:16,384
    We could literally perform  
    the number on your train.   

178
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,953
    - What I've come to realize 

179
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,488
    is that I have to cut off   
        the fucking train.      

180
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:23,356
       And now it's just        
    a simple wedding dress,     

181
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,426
  but there's just absolutely   
no way I can perform with it on,

182
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:29,362
        even though it is       
    my dead grandmother's dress.

183
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,796
    It's actually my friend's   
    dead grandma's dress.       

184
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:33,965
    Rest in peace, grandma.     

185
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,167
        Oh, my God.             

186
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,103
 - Girl, I need to--I need to-- 
     I need to--I need to--     

187
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:43,339
        I need to get up in this
        Annie Oakley get-up gig.

188
00:07:43,408 --> 00:07:46,976
    On season 5, I hated playing
    anything other than Alyssa. 

189
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:48,410
    But I want to prove to Ru   

190
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,913
        that I'm more           
    than just some pageant queen

191
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:53,514
        that can kick and twirl.

192
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,948
    I can be a character.       

193
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,116
    - What are you doing        
    with your hair?             

194
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,652
    - I think I like her.       

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,187
            - Oh.               

196
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:12,398
    - Girl, you better believe  

197
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,165
    I'm gonna do my best        
    to steal the show.          

198
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:15,567
        That's the name         
        of this game.           

199
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:21,138
    - Alyssa's like fuckin      
    batshit fuckin funny, crazy,

200
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:23,640
    but I don't think she knows 
    how to really channel that  

201
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,975
    into, like, the acting      
    or, like, the comedy.       

202
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:32,313
    She's definitely a star.    

203
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:34,448
    She's feeling it. Like,     
    she thinks she's sickening. 

204
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,684
        - Girl, please.         
    - Alyssa's too concerned    

205
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:38,885
        about how many GIFs     
    she can get made after this,

206
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:42,155
    and, you know, what T-shirt 
    she's gonna sell next.      

207
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:45,390
        - Coming up...          

208
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:48,960
    - I'm Annie Oakley          
    and this is my band.        

209
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,763
            - Okay.             

210
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,798
            This can be         
      obviously really funny.   

211
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,567
    It kind of looks like       
    you're taking a shit.       

212
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:01,003
        (RuPaul laughs)         

213
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:05,473
        (RuPaul laughs)         

214
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:06,473
            - Hello.            
             - Hi.              

215
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,108
             - Hi.              
           - Welcome.           

216
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,509
    - Our maxi challenge        
        this week               

217
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:13,012
        is a bad girl           
    lip sync extravaganza.      

218
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,380
    Now it's time to hit        
    that main stage             

219
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:16,948
    and start rehearsing our    
 choreography with Ash and Ant. 

220
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:19,083
    - Hi, I'm Ashley.           
    - Hey, I'm Anthony.         

221
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,317
    - And together, we're       
    the Squared Division.       

222
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,152
        It's wonderful          
        to meet you all.        

223
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,220
       - Oh, my gosh, I'm       
   fan-girling a little bit.    

224
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:27,556
       Two choreographers       
    that I respect so much.     

225
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,557
    They're beyond creative.    

226
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:29,891
    - Catherine the Great.      

227
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,093
    So Ginger, are you a dancer?

228
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,862
            - Nope.             
            - No.               

229
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,797
      - I'm a Tony Danza.       
           - (laughs)           

230
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:36,898
        - So you've got         
       a lot to deal with       

231
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,699
    'cause you're gonna use     
        a horse prop.           

232
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,267
    You'll use it like a cane.  

233
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:41,935
    - I'm a little resentful    
        at Ginger               

234
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,437
    because she gets the part   
    not only that's Russian,    

235
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:45,738
    but also fucks a horse.     

236
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:46,938
        (horse neighs)          

237
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,707
      - My dress is huge.       

238
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,775
    It's got a cape with        
    a little bit of a train.    

239
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,510
    - Gosh, you've got a lot    
    to contend with, don't you? 

240
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,012
            - I do.             
  - Okay, so from after this,   

241
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:56,680
        you'll bring it         
    behind your head and...     

242
00:09:56,749 --> 00:09:58,181
      - Okay. Oh! Sorry.        

243
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,950
    This is going very well.    

244
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:01,418
       Well, I'm a little       
          freaked out.          

245
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:03,052
      Not only is dancing       
      not my strong suit,       

246
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:05,855
    as anybody who watched      
    Season 7 will attest to,    

247
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:09,324
    I also have this giant      
    Catherine the Great costume.

       and even Mr. Ed ¶        

249
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,329
      - It's just timing.       

250
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,530
    And your dress              
    is not gonna help.          

251
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:20,167
    - Coming into "AllStars"    
    with a group of gals        

252
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:23,503
who are so larger than life     
and so amazing at what they do, 

253
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:24,870
    it's a little intimidating. 

254
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,438
    But I can't let that        
        get to me.              

255
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:28,673
        I've got to get         
      right back in there.      

256
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:31,609

    is my shtomping ground ¶    

257
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:33,611
        - Yes, exactly.         
        Gorgeous.               

258
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,145
        - I may be 5'2,         

259
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:37,981
   but I'm gonna stand above    
 all these other motherfuckers. 

260
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,982
              Ha!               
        - That's better.        

261
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,350
        We're moving on.

    guys can just take a rest.  

263
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,820
            - Okay.             

264
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:55,330
    - I like Phi Phi a lot,     

265
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,400
    but I think Phi Phi had     
    certain notions in her head 

266
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:01,235
      when she walked into      
        this competition        

267
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:03,337
    about what she needed to do 

268
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:06,040
    to redeem her reputation    
        from her season,        

269
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,775
    what she needed to do       
    to last a while,            

270
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:10,243
    and all of those things     

271
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:12,912
    don't necessarily mesh well 
        with one another.       

272
00:11:18,185 --> 00:11:21,251
    So sometimes it feels like  
    she goes out of her way     

273
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,487
to ruffle somebody's feathers   

274
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:27,057
       or to plant a seed       
         of self doubt.         

275
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:28,925
        It's weird.             
        - All right.            

276
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:30,793
             Annie.             
          So we shoot.

278
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:35,665
    I'm Annie Oakley,           
    and this is my band.        

279
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,866
    - During rehearsal,         
    I'm ready to work.          

280
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,167
      Bitch is clocked in.      

281
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:40,602
    Bang, bang, bang, bang.     

282
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,203
         You stumble.           
     Bang, bang, bang, bang.    

283
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:45,305
    And your gun shoots--       
    shoots all the girls down.  

284
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:47,441
            Exactly.            

285
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,608
        - Bang, bang.           

286
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,208
        - Yeah, bang.           

287
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:52,176
    Ha! The steps are there.    

288
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,144
        You need to now         
      work on the balance       

289
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,478
    between it looking hot      
        and proper,             

290
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:56,712
    'cause you're a dancer,     

291
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:59,647
    but then characterizing that
        at the same time.       

292
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,383
            - Okay.             

293
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,388
- (off-mike) And that's decent. 
        Walk into, um...        

294
00:12:07,457 --> 00:12:08,756
      (continues off-mike,      
          indistinct)           

295
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:10,890
        - All right,            
        let's move on.          

296
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,258
        Marie Antoinette.       

297
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:15,060
      Detox, you're gonna       
   give it, like, almost like   

298
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:17,729
   a<i> chasse, pas de bourree,</i>    
       and then<i> soutenu.</i>        

299
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:19,797
      - What the fuck?          

300
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:23,367
    -<i> Chasse, pas de bourree,</i>   
        <i> soutenu.</i>               

301
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:26,503
      It's step, cut, cut, cut, 
            phoom, phoom.       

302
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,371
    It has to be like a little, 
        um, a little waltz.     

303
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,505
    Let me see that again.      

304
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:30,539
        - And be funnier.       

305
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:32,707
        - All right. Ooh.       

306
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:35,476
    - It kind of looks like     
    you're taking a shit.       

307
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,178
            - Yeah.             

308
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:39,246
    - This can be obviously     
        really funny,           

309
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:40,513
        and I don't think       
    it's quite that funny yet.  

310
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:42,181
    It's missing something.     

311
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,749
    - Right now, I'm just trying
    to focus on this little bit,

312
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:45,416
    so I'm, like, in here.      

313
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,550
            - Okay.             

314
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:48,318
    - I'm not believing it.     

315
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,920
    - It could be so funny,     
    and I'm not getting that.   

316
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:53,289
    - A lot of work to do.      

317
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,895
- This is the baddest bitches   
    in herstory, honey.         

318
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:02,996
    - I'm sitting next          
    to the baddest bitch        

319
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:08,701
 in RuPaul's Drag Race herstory 
   right here, if you ask me.   

320
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,335
    You were like, this bitch   
        is annoying me,         

321
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,537
     so I'm going to fuckin     
        talk about her.         

322
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:13,972
    - I have no apologies.      

323
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,372
      I wasn't going to be      
      something I wasn't.       

324
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,873
    Alyssa, you know this.      

325
00:13:16,941 --> 00:13:18,307
        Like, that drag         
    just was not something      

326
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:20,176
    I grew up with in Texas.    

327
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:22,678
    It was all about how many   
    pageant titles you had.     

328
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,146
    So when I see someone       
        like Sharon             

329
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:25,280
            and I saw that      
      she was winning everything

330
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:26,714
        and I saw her as,       
        like, a threat          

331
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:28,249
    and I think that's where    
 a lot of the anger came from.  

332
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:30,417
        It didn't help me       
        afterwards.             

333
00:13:30,486 --> 00:13:31,584
    - What happened afterwards? 

334
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,719
    - I think that people       
    couldn't look past.         

335
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:36,522
I watch reality TV and I don't  
like people on there, too,      

336
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,156
    but I would never go        
    and, like, threaten them    

337
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,191
    or want to throw acid       
    in their face.              

338
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,026
        - People threaten       
    to throw acid on your face? 

339
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:44,394
            - Yeah.             
        Actually, in L.A.       

340
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,729
      You know who really       
   hated me during my season?   

341
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:48,697
            Detox.              

342
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,832
           - Really?            
           - Did you?           

343
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:54,368
    - I was evil to her because 
    there was this fucking cunt 

344
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:55,869
      who was evil and rotten   
            to everybody        

345
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:58,404
    and, of course, I wanted    
    to protect my sister.       

346
00:13:58,473 --> 00:13:59,805
    That's my family,           
    you know what I mean?       

347
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,707
So, like, every week, I would,  
like, attack three people.      

348
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,608
        You blocked me          
        for a while, too.       

349
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,442
    Here in California, we      
    all look after each other,  

350
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,945
    and so when somebody        
    is coming for our girls,    

351
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:11,413
    we are in full attack mode. 

352
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:12,981
    - Did that ever hurt        
    your feelings, though?      

353
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,716
    - I literally had           
    one breakdown moment,       

354
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:16,217
         and I remember         
       crying in the car.       

355
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:17,317
            - Aw.               

356
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:18,618
        - After season 4,       

357
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,854
    there was a slight period   
    of time I almost quit drag. 

358
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,689
          It was just           
      too much to handle.       

359
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:25,791
    I just didn't feel safe     
        going anywhere.         

360
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,626
People really take it seriously 
and they wanted to hurt me.     

361
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,427
So they just were, like, maybe  
it's best you don't show up.    

362
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:31,828
        - That is insane.       

363
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:33,029
         - That is awful.       

364
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:35,864
- Obviously, time has passed,   
    we're friends.              

365
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,966
    But I do feel bad.          

366
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,667
        I feel guilty           
    and a little responsible    

367

00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,101
    you're not doing drag.      

534

everything that Phi Phi is now.

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,653
    Like, she's a cosplay queen.

542
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:42,122
    She's not trying to be      
    this pageant queen anymore.

          little mind,          

546
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,597
    the way I picture           
    the future of drag          

547
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:58,435
is that whole retro Brady Bunch 
    space age kind of design.   

548
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,670
    - In the future, we'll all  
    have hair like Chaka Khan.  

549
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,472
        - Yes, we will.

    - I'm practically naked     
    walking down the runway,    

555

    and I look like a sexy,     
    silver fembot fuck toy.

    my beaded wig on, girl.     

562
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:31,262
    I got the horns.            
    I got the moon boots.       

563
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:33,697
        I am giving y'all       
            everything.         

564
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:35,599
    - Oh, I just noticed        
        the boots.              

565
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:36,733

566
00:24:36,802 --> 00:24:38,968
    - Now, is that a fascinator 
        on her head             

567
00:24:39,037 --> 00:24:40,368
        or a doggy bag?         

568
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,870
            - Ha-ha!            

569
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,438
        - Roxxxy Andrews.       

570
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:46,206
             - Ugh!             
   - She just fixed herself.    

571
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,340
        - (laughs)              

572
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:49,341
    - I feel like a warrior     
        in my outfit.           

573
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,512
   It's Wonder Woman/goddess    
       of planet Roxxxy.        

574
00:24:54,581 --> 00:24:56,948

576
00:24:58,785 --> 00:25:01,118
        Katya. Whoo.            

577
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:03,553
- I'm pretty sure this is my    
Aunt Harriet at a Bat mitzvah.  

578
00:25:03,622 --> 00:25:05,988
    - I'm giving you            
    intergalactic mom.          

579
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:09,358
   The piece de resistance of   
 this outfit is the giant hair. 

580
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:11,894
    It's kind of like a doughnut
        on acid.                

581
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:14,529
It is the most glamorous I've   
ever looked in my entire life.  

582
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:17,531
    - Live long and prostitute. 

583
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,600
        (all laugh)             

584
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:20,834
        Welcome, ladies.        

585
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:23,836
            Now it's time       
      for the judges' critiques.

586
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:26,338
        First up, Alaska.       

587
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:28,506
            - Aah!              

588
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,040
             - Aah!             

589
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,977
             - Huh.             
          (all laugh)           

590
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,379
           - Your Eve           
      was truly enjoyable.      

591
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:36,513
    You started off the show,   

592
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:38,848
    so you needed to nail that  
        and you did.            

593
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,383
        - Tonight,              
    the future of drag.         

594
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,451
    Yes, it's great,            
    it's fun, it's Alaska.      

595
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,352
    But Alaska is an alien      

596
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:46,554
    and comes from              
    the planet Glamtron.        

597
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:49,090
    I was expecting you to go   
    completely all the way.     

598
00:25:49,158 --> 00:25:51,892
    - Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.  

599
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,926
        - As far as             
    scene-stealing went,        

600
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:55,961
     to me, you did fade in     
  the background a little bit,  

601
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,429
         but I will say         
     tonight on the runway,     

602
00:25:58,498 --> 00:26:01,332
        this is really,         
     really fantastic work.     

603
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:02,433
        - Thank you.            

604
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:03,801
    - Yeah, the laser gun       
        is amazing,             

605
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,369
    and you didn't give us      
        just silver,            

606
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:06,670
    which I'm seeing a lot of.  

607
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,506
    - I am so proud of you,     
    as far as evolution goes,   

608
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:11,841
    from where you were in your 
    season to where you are now.

609
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:12,908
            - Yay.              

610
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:15,844
    - Up next, Ginger Minj.     

611
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:18,814
      - You should have         
a one-woman show on Broadway.   

612
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:20,147
        You're a star.          

613
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,582
- But there were some moments   
      where I was like,         

614
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,749
    oh, look, she's still in,   
    and then some moments       

615
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:23,850
    she kind of faded           
    into the background.        

616
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:26,185
    - This look is not          
    one of my favorites.        

617
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:28,286
    There's a whole lot         
    of everything going on.     

618
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:30,454
    Like, I need Ritalin        
    to look at you right now.   

619
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:33,957
    - Yeah. It's just           
    a little bit wah-wah.       

620
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,925
    - Well, these light up,     
    all these things light up.  

621
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,627
    - Why aren't they?          
    - They are lit up.          

622
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,395
    I just didn't realize       
    you couldn't see them.      

623
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,630
        - Oh, right.            

624
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,064
    - I actually quite liked it 

625
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,965
    'cause don't take this      
    in the wrong way,           

626
00:26:45,034 --> 00:26:48,001
I felt like you were channeling 
  Miss Piggy, "Pigs in Space."  

627
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,870
           - (laughs)           
       - Up next, Detox.        

628
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,972
    - I loved Ne-Antoinette.    

629
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,708
    She could've been           
    a whole collection.         

630
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:58,943
And, of course, your iconic     
jaw movement was at play there. 

631
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:01,012
            - And then          
      you came out tonight.     

632
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,113
    What you did and the way    
        you executed it,        

633
00:27:03,182 --> 00:27:05,415
      it left us gagging.       

634
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:07,684
      - Thank you very much.    
            (sniffles)          

635
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:10,052
      - Don't cry, Detox.       
          You'll rust.          

636
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:11,554
        (all laugh)             

637
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:16,025
Up next, the always understated 
    Alyssa Edwards.             

638
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:19,027
    - Annie got her gun and she 
    murdered the competition.   

639
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,129
        I could not             
    take my eyes off you.       

640
00:27:21,197 --> 00:27:23,564
- Yeah, and the challenge was,  
you know, stealing the scene.   

641
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,866
      You stole the show.       
          - Thank you.          

642
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:29,402
    - But I have no idea        
    what is going on tonight.   

643
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:32,338
    We are part Cleopatra,      
part Saturday night takeaway.   

644
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:35,074
        - I will just           
    come out of the closet here 

645
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:38,010
    and say that this is fashion
        and I love it.          

646
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,779
- It's just epic and only you   
    could pull this off.        

647
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:42,180
    - Thank you very much.      

648
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:45,416
    - Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.  

649
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:47,451
      - Don't cry for me,       
        Roxxxy Andrews.         

650
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,120
    Your Evita was spot on.     

651
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:51,588
    - But tonight on the runway,

652
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:54,157
    I do think this is plain    
    compared to everybody else. 

653
00:27:54,226 --> 00:27:56,659
       - Maybe this isn't       
   my favorite of the looks,    

654
00:27:56,728 --> 00:27:58,060
         but it's very          
      Queen of the Night,       

655
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:00,195
    Whitney Houston kind of,    
             um...              

656
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,263
    - Buy "The Bodyguard"       
    soundtrack, track 9.        

657
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:03,997
        (all laugh)             

658
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,199
        - Up next, Katya.       

659
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,234
    - I love that you took      
    Princess Leia's bun         

660
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:11,370
    and blew it up and made     
    one giant hairdo out of it. 

661
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,206
- Right, but I'm not just crazy 
    about the outfit.           

662
00:28:14,274 --> 00:28:15,940
    I think it's a little too   
        covered up.             

663
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:17,575
    And your Princess Diana,    

664
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:20,844
    the overall performance was 
    a little monotone for me.   

665
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:22,379
        - It felt almost        
        a bit solemn.           

666
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:25,549
- But I felt that out of all    
the lip syncs, you were spot on.

667
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:28,684
    - But I wish the sleeves    
    were obnoxiously poofed     

668
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:29,851
    like the gown was.          

669
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,753
         I wish you had         
      a 5,000 foot train.       

670
00:28:31,822 --> 00:28:34,022
    Also, the hair was more     
    like Ellen DeGeneres        

671
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,856
    than it was Princess Di     
        for me.                 

672
00:28:35,925 --> 00:28:38,325
 - It needed to be more of that 
   feathered back iconic look   

673
00:28:38,394 --> 00:28:40,527
    so we're not figuring it out
            from the lyrics.    

674
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,562
    - Now, in Katya's defense,  

675
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,897
            Princess Diana      
      is really the only figure 

676
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:47,200
        that we remember        
     what she looked like.      

677
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,102
        The other characters    
    were open to interpretation.

678
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:52,471
        Listen, everybody       
        was so fantastic,       

679
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,773
     so we have to pick at      
   some of the smaller things   

680
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:58,376
    because ain't much          
    to criticize here.          

681
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:03,346
    But decisions must be made. 

682
00:29:03,415 --> 00:29:06,983
        So based on             
    the judges' critiques,      

683
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:13,956
      I declare that Detox      
      and Alyssa Edwards,       

684
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:16,324
    you are the top two AllStars
        of the week.            

685
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:18,894
       - Congratulations.       
           (applause)           

686
00:29:18,962 --> 00:29:22,096
       - You've each won        
     a three-night getaway      

687
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,899
    to Palm Springs, California,

688
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:28,969
        from                    
    VacationPalmSprings.com.    

689
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,171
    Con-drag-ulations.          
    - Thank you.                

690
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:35,842
    - When I call your name,    
    please step forward.        

691
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,945
        Ginger Minj.            

692
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:42,147
            Katya.              

693
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:45,417
    You are the bottom two      
        of the week.            

694
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,486
        - Oh, good Lord.        

695
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,721
     Being in the bottom two    
         is bad enough.         

696
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,125
    Being in the bottom two     
against my best friend is worse.

697
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,227
     I don't like how this      
  is going to end either way.   

698
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,128
    - That means Detox          
        and Alyssa,             

699
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:04,699
    each of you needs to decide 
    which of the bottom two     

700
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:08,403
       you will eliminate       
    if you win the lip sync.    

701
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:09,637
            - (sighs)           

702
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:13,773
     - So while you queens      
  deliberate in the workroom,   

703
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:17,143
    the judges and I will be    
 giving each other mani-pedis.  

704
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:21,046
    You may leave the stage.    

705
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,947
        Coming up...            

706
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:25,882
         - Do you think         
   that the girls in the top    

707
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:27,850
    are going to stick          
        to our idea             

708
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,152
    of what did the judges      
        have to say             

709
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:31,986
         and that's who         
     we're going to choose?     

710
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:33,488
    - I'm iffy of one of them.  

711
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:34,689
            - Who?              

712
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:39,259
        (RuPaul laughs)         

713
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:42,928
        (RuPaul laughs)         

714
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:47,064
            - (sighs)           

715
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:49,166
          I feel like           
      this is going to be       

716
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:52,669
       a really difficult       
         deliberation.          

717
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:54,170
      All of the critiques      

718
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:57,940
       were really, like,       
    equal across the board.     

719
00:30:58,009 --> 00:31:02,444
 I mean, Katya's critiques were 
  slightly worse the Ginger's,  

720
00:31:02,513 --> 00:31:05,047
    but, still, it's very close.

721
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:08,183
 - Congratulations still go out 
     to everyone, honestly,     

722
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:11,252
   because, girl, we killed.    
     - What a fucking show.     

723
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:12,453
            - Right?            

724
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:14,187
    - Did they really rate      
    anybody's performance?      

725
00:31:14,256 --> 00:31:17,390
   - Uh, yeah, they said mine   
       was, like, solemn.       

726
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:21,126
      - Katya, come here.       

727
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:26,730
    I wanted to call you out    
        over here               

728
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,898
'cause I just kind of saw that  
you're going through something. 

729
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:28,898
        Are you okay?           

730
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,234
      - Um, on my season,       

731
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:35,604
    I was just like crippled    
    with, you know, with fear.  

732
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:38,139
      And then, this time,      
          coming here,          

733
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:42,176
          I feel like           
      an enormous change.       

734
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,511
    I actually feel like a star.

735
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,979
        I'm not nervous.        
            - Right.            

736
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:50,550
- But if you don't your A-plus, 
plus, plus, plus game, poof.    

737
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,585
    - I wasn't expecting them   
    to read so much into, like, 

738
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:54,886
        the whole costuming     
    and outfits and everything. 

739
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,021
- All the things they said      
of course made perfect sense,   

740
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,323
    and I'm just like, fuck.    

741
00:31:59,392 --> 00:32:03,027
 - I honestly was not expecting 
    this, so it feels weird.    

742
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:07,264
- There is definitely a grim    
undertone to our conversation,  

743
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:11,668
    so I would not be surprised 
    if she chose me to go home. 

744
00:32:11,736 --> 00:32:13,136
    And I really want to stay.  

745
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,440
    - It's so hard because      
    that's my best friend.      

746
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:22,076
    - I know, but I feel like   
    if we continue to stay true 

747
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:24,278
to how we've been wanting to,   
    I think it's Katya.         

748
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:26,513
        - Katya                 
    had the most critiques.     

749
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:28,714
        - Oh, God.              

750
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,750
        - Katya, come on.       

751
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,119
    My mind is racing.          

752
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,821
It's very easy for us to take   
one critique and run with it.   

753
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,557
    But there's so many factors 
    to take into consideration, 

754
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,392
        so I'm conflicted.      

755
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,827
            Do you feel if      
      I were to win the lip sync

756
00:32:45,896 --> 00:32:47,095
    that I should save you?     

757
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:49,631
    - I can't make that decision
        for you.                

758
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:54,701
    - In my opinion, I think    
    there's so much more to you 

759
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,169
    than just one challenge     

760
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:58,471
    or maybe one runway look    
        that didn't work.       

761
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,006
        But do you think        
     falling short tonight      

762
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:01,773
       should remove you        
     from this competition?     

763
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:05,577
            - Um...             

764
00:33:05,646 --> 00:33:08,146
      - Katya's defeated        
and you have to be confident.   

765
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:09,747
        That's                  
    the disheartened part.      

766
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:12,316
    But I see the emotion       
        in her eyes.            

767
00:33:12,385 --> 00:33:13,651
    She wants to be here.       

768
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:18,754
       - So do you think        
   that the girls in the top    

769
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:20,656
    are going to stick          
        to our idea             

770
00:33:20,725 --> 00:33:23,392
    of what did the judges      
        have to say             

771
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,060
         and that's who         
     we're going to choose?     

772
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,994
    - I'm iffy of one of them.  

773
00:33:27,063 --> 00:33:29,297
        - Who? Which one?       

774
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,799
    - I'll say it out loud.     
        I mean, no, no--        

775
00:33:32,868 --> 00:33:34,133
    - No, I know we're both     
    thinking the same person.   

776
00:33:34,202 --> 00:33:35,768
    - Because she's been vocal  
        about it.               

777
00:33:35,836 --> 00:33:37,803
    Like, it's not a secret.    
        Alyssa.                 

778
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:39,437
        - Yeah, Alyssa.         

779
00:33:39,506 --> 00:33:41,238
    - The one that I feel       

780
00:33:41,307 --> 00:33:43,807
    would play it the way that  
    we said we would is Detox.  

781
00:33:43,876 --> 00:33:45,109
            - Yeah.             

782
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:51,113
    - If I were to win this     
    lip sync tonight, why you?  

783
00:33:51,182 --> 00:33:53,482
- Well, on the personal side,   
    that's my best friend.      

784
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:54,883
            - Mm-hmm.           

785
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:57,352
- I don't want to be responsible
      for her going home.       

786
00:33:57,421 --> 00:33:58,786
    But if we're going to judge 

787
00:33:58,855 --> 00:34:02,122
    by the criteria             
that we had all talked about,   

788
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:06,025
      she got critiqued         
on performance and on runway.   

789
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:07,759
    I only got critiqued        
        on runway.              

790
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:11,463
    I also want to say that     
 no matter which way it falls,  

791
00:34:11,531 --> 00:34:13,164
    I'll be all right with it.  

792
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:14,798
   But I wish it was lip sync   
         for your life,         

793
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:17,099
    because, baby, I've got     
    this fire in me right now.  

794
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:18,501
     - That's what I wanted     
        to hear, bitch.         

795
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:20,335
    - Alyssa looks in my eyes   

796
00:34:20,404 --> 00:34:22,103
    and says, that's            
    what I wanted to see.       

797
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:23,905
    The fire and the passion.   

798
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:27,175
   And from the moment Katya    
got called into the bottom two, 

799
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:29,643
she resigned herself to the fact
    that she's going home.      

800
00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:31,778
            She's not           
      putting forth a fight.    

801
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:33,046
      - Do you know what?       

802
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,281
      I think Ginger Minj       
      has a lot more fight      

803
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:37,049
    to be in the competition,   

804
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,218
    but Katya was just          
    in the top last week.       

805
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,153
          She just won          
        the Snatch Game.        

806
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:43,454
   And in the end, they both    
      have pros and cons.       

807
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:45,223
    Oh, this is a tough decision
        to make.                

808
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,526
      - So I'm gonna tell you   
            what I said.        

809
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:51,593
            - Okay.             

810
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:53,695
        - Number one,           
    you're my best friend.      

811
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:55,129
            - Mm-hmm.           

812
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:56,297
- But if you asked me my opinion
    on what we all agreed on--  

813
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:57,631
        - Yeah, yeah.           

814
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:59,298
    I got the lowest points     
        tonight.                

815
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:03,535
I can't really delude myself in 
the face of objective criteria. 

816
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,638
   - Well, if this had worked   
 in my favor with the lighting, 

817
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:07,805
    it'd be a different story,  
        but...                  

818
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:08,805
    - No, it's still ugly.      

819
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:12,175
        (all laugh)             

820
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:16,178
        - All right.            
        (blowing)               

821
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:17,713
            Silence.            

822
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:22,418
    Bring back my girls.        
        (blowing)               

823
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:29,089
        - Although              
    it's a difficult feeling,   

824
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:31,324
      it's not a difficult      
       decision to make.        

825
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:33,092
        I feel confident        
        in my choice,           

826
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:36,562
      and I'm gonna stick       
       by that decision.        

827
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:39,765
  It's just a shitty decision   
        to have to make.        

828
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,104
          - It's like           
      a never-ending walk       

829
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:49,407
    because there's no win      
    in this situation.          

830
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,375
    I'm gonna follow my heart   
        on this one.            

831
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,446
        (RuPaul laughs)         

832
00:35:58,715 --> 00:36:01,215
        (RuPaul laughs)         

833
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:07,554
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

834
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:11,690
        Two top AllStars        
        stand before me.        

835
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:15,193
    Ladies, this is your chance 
        to impress me,          

836
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:20,331
        win $10,000,            
    and earn the power          

837
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,635
        to give one of          
    the bottom queens the chop. 

838
00:36:25,638 --> 00:36:29,940
    The time has come           
    for you to lip sync         

839
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:33,978
   (echoing) for your legacy.   

840
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:36,346
- I'm very confident that I can 
win the lip sync against Alyssa 

841
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:37,614
    because I look amazing.     

842
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:40,717
    I didn't have to change     
    to put on a fuckin show.    

843
00:36:40,785 --> 00:36:44,353
     - I am looking RuPaul      
       dead in the eyes.        

844
00:36:44,422 --> 00:36:45,888
      I'm in it to win it.      

845
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:50,058
            - Good luck,        
      and don't fuck it up.     

846
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,395

          ¶ Every time          
       you call my name ¶       

857
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:44,339
        ¶ The passion's         
        so complete ¶           

858
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:48,176
    ¶ It's never ending ¶       

859
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:52,513
    ¶ As long as I receive ¶    

860
00:37:52,581 --> 00:37:55,782
        ¶ The message           
        you're sending ¶        

861
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:59,018
    ¶ Love, love on the run ¶   

862
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:01,553
      ¶ Breaking us down ¶      

863
00:38:01,622 --> 00:38:08,793
    ¶ No, I can't let you go ¶  

864
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:11,295
    ¶ Tell it to my heart ¶     

865
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:13,698
  ¶ Tell me I'm the only one ¶  

866
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:17,234
     ¶ Is this really love      
       or just a game? ¶        

867
00:38:17,302 --> 00:38:18,901
    ¶ Tell it to my heart ¶     

868
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,204
    ¶ I can feel my body rock ¶ 

869
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:24,573
          ¶ Every time          
       you call my name ¶       

870
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:26,741
        - (laughs)              

871
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,810
            - Word!             

872
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:32,347
    - Ladies, I have made       
        my decision.            

873
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,089
        Alyssa Edwards,         
    you're a winner, baby.      

874
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:46,760
      You've earned a cash tip  
            of $10,000.         

875
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,194
        - Whoo-hoo-hoo.         

876
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,863
        Oh, my gosh.            
        You did it.             

877
00:38:50,932 --> 00:38:52,464
      Girl, you're leaving      
          your legacy.          

878
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:53,598
      Thank you very much.      

879
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,600
    - Detox, you're safe.       

880
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:57,901
        - Thank you.            

881
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,402
    Congratulations, girl.      

882
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,706
    - Will the bottom two       
    please step forward.        

883
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,712
        - Alyssa Edwards,       
        with great power        

884
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,647
    comes great responsibility. 

885
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:19,153
  Which queen have you chosen   
        to get the chop?        

886
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:20,620
    - I often tell my students  

887
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:23,723
that winning isn't everything,  
      but wanting to is.        

888
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,424
    I chose the queen to stay   

889
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:27,392
     based on when I looked     
         into her eyes,         

890
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:29,494
    the conviction that I felt. 

891
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:31,162
        Sometimes               
    being in the bottom         

892
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:35,032
        could just be           
    a one-night kind of gig.    

893
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:37,835
            So the queen        
      that I'm sending home...  

894
00:39:40,705 --> 00:39:42,005
        That's Ginger.          

895
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:49,344
      - As it is written,       
      so it shall be done.      

896
00:39:49,412 --> 00:39:52,446
        Ginger Minj,            
    you are an AllStar.         

897
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,283
        Now, sashay away.       

898
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,522
        - I truly respect you   
    from the bottom of my heart.

899
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:07,226
        (applause)              

900
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:10,728
      - They got me, gal.       
            (laughs)            

901
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:14,598
        (all laugh)             

902
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:16,700
      - Katya, I love you.      

903
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,302
    You have a lot more to show.

904
00:40:21,106 --> 00:40:24,206
        - I'm not surprised     
    that Alyssa sent me home.   

905
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:27,709
From day one, she's been gunning
to get rid of the competition,  

906
00:40:27,778 --> 00:40:29,678
        and I feel like         
    I was competition for her.  

907
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:31,546
            She and I do        
      kind of the same thing.   

908
00:40:31,615 --> 00:40:34,382
    But I have no hard feelings 
        towards her.            

909
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:36,183
       It's a gift that--       
            (alarm)             

910
00:40:36,252 --> 00:40:38,585
        - Ooh, girl.            

911
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:40,253
        - What the hell?        

912
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:43,089
           - RuPaul:            
     Ginger, not to worry.      

913
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,024
        All is not lost.        

914
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:48,727
    You still have a chance     
        to return               

915
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:52,130
        for your revenge.       

916
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,265
            - What?             

917
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:54,766
        - (laughs)              

918
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,135
            Revenge?            

919
00:40:58,203 --> 00:41:01,337
    I'm ready to knock Alyssa   
    out of this competition now.

920
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:03,439
        Let's do it.
