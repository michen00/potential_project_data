1
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,869
          - Previously          
        on "AllStars..."        

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,904
       You need to create       
          merchandise           

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,907
     worthy of your unique      
         AllStar brand.         

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,009
            Alaska.             

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,845
   - Anus-thing is possible.    

6
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:16,346
          - You really          
        sort of captured        

7
00:00:16,348 --> 00:00:18,848
    that sort of pretentious    
       1990s perfume ad.        

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,215
            - Katya.            

9
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:21,750
       - Your commercial,       
  your product, and your look   

10
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,585
         are on brand.          
          - Thank you.          

11
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:24,819
          - Tatianna.           

12
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:26,320
      - What you didn't do      

13
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:27,754
       is really feature        
          the product.          

14
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,222
           - Choices.           

15
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:31,223
       - Roxxxy Andrews.        

16
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:32,790
 - Losing the hair, it's almost 
   like when you see it once    

17
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:33,891
     and it's really funny,     

18
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:35,293
    the next time it's like,    
           oh, okay,            

19
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:37,261
          and made it           
    a little bit forgetful.     

20
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:38,829
           - Alaska.            

21
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:41,198
    You are a winner, baby.     

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,900
          - Thank you.          
           (applause)           

23
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:46,135
         - Which queen          
        have you chosen         

24
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:48,236
        to get the chop?        

25
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,105
     - One of these queens      
        week after week         

26
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:54,041
          has brought           
      a level of prestige       

27
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:57,811
   and beauty and excellence    
        to this runway.         

28
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:59,312
      One of these queens       
       is the very person       

29
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:02,248
  who leant me this very shirt  
   that I'm wearing tonight.    

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,916
       So based on that,        

31
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:06,585
         I've chosen...         

32
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:08,020
           Tatianna.            

33
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:14,492
    - Tatianna, sashay away.    

34
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:15,760
          - Thank you.          

35
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:26,603
           - (sighs)            

36
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:29,005
           (exhales)            

37
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,074
         "Had a blast.          
         Love you all.          

38
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:33,942
         Thanks, Tati."         

39
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:35,210
     We love you, Tatianna.     

40
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,379
           (applause)           

41
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:39,480
          - Thank you           
      for saving me again.      

42
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:41,181
   - I love your pussy, girl.   

43
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:44,451
     I know that it appears     

44
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:49,589
   that there's some sort of    
  Rolaskatox blood oath pact.   

45
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,458
     It's really not that.      

46
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,027
       I mean, is it fair       
     to let someone advance     

47
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,462
      who hasn't been here      
        the whole time?         

48
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:59,198
            Tatianna            
    went away for two weeks,    

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,601
       and Roxxxy lent me       
  the shirt that I'm wearing.   

50
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,436
   How could I send her home?   

51
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:07,672
          So Adorde--           
         I mean Katya--         

52
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,207
       - Oh, my God, bye.       

53
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,442
    - Do you have a lipstick    
  in your titty or something?   

54
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:13,377
       - I chose Roxxxy.        

55
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:17,746
       Here's the thing.        

56
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:19,347
       When I was talking       
          to Tatianna,          

57
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:21,882
          like, she--           
     there was like a fire.     

58
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:24,284
      I was, like, I want       
      to see more of that.      

59
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,985
        I know you know         
     it's nothing personal.     

60
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,853
         - Not at all.          
   But I do want you to know    

61
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,155
       that I have drive,       
           I do care,           

62
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:31,723
       I want to be here.       

63
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:32,790
       So I want you all        
         to know that.          

64
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:34,659
       I can't blame her.       

65
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:36,894
    I've been in the bottom     
          four times.           

66
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:39,763
   But all I can do is prove    
why the girls have kept me here 

67
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:42,799
   and try to pull off a win.   

68
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,767
         - So two wins.         

69
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:46,202
           - Two-two.           

70
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:48,337
     - How many for you, D?     
             - Two.             

71
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:50,739
          I have been           
   grandslamming everything,    

72
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:53,775
    and killing every runway    
     runway that I step on,     

73
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:56,677
And to continue to be just safe 
     is kind of irritating.     

74
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:59,446
 It's like you think of fucking 
   store bought roll-up tape    

75
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:01,882
         is more genius         
    than a talking trash can    

76
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:04,084
       or a spray bottle        
    that has nothing in it?     

77
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:06,552
     You know what I mean?      
    It's frustrating to me.     

78
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,286
    Four, though. I mean...     

79
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,155
          - Girl, yes.          
        I'll be honest.         

80
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,458
 I feel good about my position  
      in the competition.       

81
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,359
   - Two for me, and Roxxxy?    
             - One.             

82
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,962
          I wish I won          
     that lipsync, though.      

83
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,497
          - I'm sorry.          

84
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:24,099
            I'm sure            
     that there's some hos      

85
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,735
         who would love         
   to get me out of the way.    

86
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:29,904
          I feel like           
      Jessica Rabbit. Uh!       

87
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:32,139
          I would want          
    to get me out of the way    

88
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,041
    if I was up against me.     

89
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:36,009
        Luckily I am me.        

90
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,446
       Sorry about that.        

91
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:45,850
   - The winner of "RuPaul's    
      Drag Race AllStars"       

92
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,552
   receives a one year supply   

93
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:49,920
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills   
           cosmetics,           

94
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,722
         a coveted spot         
 in the Drag Race Hall of Fame, 

95
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:56,192
        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000.          

96
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,695
       With extra special       
   guest judge Aubrey Plaza.    

97
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,796
    -  RuPaul's Drag Race     

98
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:02,163
      May the best woman      

99
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,532
        Best woman win        

100
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:09,870
          - Top five.           

101
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:11,104
             - Oh.              

102
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,771
         - We made it.          

103
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:14,473
     - Hello, hello, hello.     

104
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,775
             - Hi.              
             - Hi.              

105
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:18,243
           - Ladies.            

106
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:20,745
  Now, queens, as gay people,   

107
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,212
        we get to choose        
         our families.          

108
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:26,082
       Because sometimes        
  the families we grew up with  

109
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:27,750
      don't understand us.      

110
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:30,219
       So when I recently       
          reached out           

111
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:34,390
       with an invitation       
   to your moms and sisters,    

112
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:37,893
        I'm sorry to say        
      that not one of them      

113
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,528
    accepted my invitation.     

114
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,934
         They all did.          

115
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,935
        - Aah! (laughs)         

116
00:04:48,937 --> 00:04:54,006
     - So let's give a big      
   "Drag Race" family welcome   

117
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:57,976
  to Alyssa's sister Tabatha.   

118
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:01,746
      - Oh, my God! Yeah!       

119
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:03,981
           - (laughs)           

120
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:07,684
      - Alaska's mom Pam.       

121
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,319
    (laughter and applause)     

122
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:12,055
         - Oh, my God!          

123
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,056
         - How are you?         

124
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:16,592
        There's RuPaul.         

125
00:05:16,594 --> 00:05:19,295
   - Detox's sister Heather.    

126
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,597
             - Yes!             

127
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,598
       - Seeing my sister       
     walk into the workroom     

128
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,566
         is stirring up         
       all these emotions       

129
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,735
     because just last week     

130
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:30,903
     it was the anniversary     
    of my father's passing.     

131
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:33,839
   So that's been on my mind    
         a lot lately,          

132
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:36,608
      and to have my heart      
  and my soul, my best friend,  

133
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,076
      it's like a godsend.      

134
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:40,778
    My heart is like fucking    
    beating out of my chest.    

135
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,982
         - And we have          
      Katya's mother Pat.       

136
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:48,151
           - (laughs)           

137
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,919
            My mom!             

138
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:52,655
   I hate that fucking cunt.    

139
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,023
       No. Just kidding.        

140
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:58,492
   - And Roxxxy's grandmother   
             Sonia.             

141
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:00,394
             - Oh!              

142
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:02,128
           - Roxxxy!            

143
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,332
    (laughter and applause)     

144
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:09,435
   - Welcome, you beautiful,    
        beautiful women.        

145
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,970
    You guys are the reason     
          we are here,          

146
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,439
          and I thank           
   each and every one of you.   

147
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,808
           Thank you.           
          Now, queens.          

148
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,043
     You need to transform      
         your loved one         

149
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:24,347
         into a member          
   of your royal drag family.   

150
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,282
          (all laugh)           

151
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:31,854
   All while using Anastasia    
  of Beverly Hills cosmetics.   

152
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:33,087
             - Ooh.             

153
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,323
       #DragFamilyValues        

154
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,924
          (all laugh)           

155
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:40,160
           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines,       

156
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:42,328
  and may the best woman win.   

157
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,998
           (applause)           

158
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:50,302
       - Oh, we got shoes       
          and fabric.           

159
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:52,070
       - How does it feel       
      to be in Hollywood?       

160
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:53,939
         - Oh, my God,          
      I feel like a star.       

161
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,608
         - This is it.          
          This is it.           

162
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,712
  It's so different this time   
   like from Season 7 though,   

163
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:02,313
       because it's like        
       a lot more joyful        

164
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,881
        and less riddled        
         with anxiety,          

165
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,049
     which is a new thing.      

166
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,384
       - That's awesome.        
            - Yeah.             

167
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:11,020
      It's so cool to have      
     my mom in the room now     

168
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:12,788
          when I'm not          
        a nervous wreck.        

169
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,625
       What I'm thinking        
  is sexy Russian trophy bride  

170
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,194
     with her peasant mom.      

171
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:19,595
        - And who am I?         

172
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:23,131
          (both laugh)          

173
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:25,066
      - This is definitely      
 going to be a transformation.  

174
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:28,202
    I don't think my mother     
has ever worn heels in her life.

175
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:30,904
     She's used to spending     
           under $10            

176
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:32,638
    for a blouse at Savers.     

177
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,273
           I probably           
      shouldn't say that.       

178
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:36,174
          Oh, my God.           

179
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:38,109
          It fits you           
     like a fucking glove.      

180
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,343
       That's incredible.       

181
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:42,145
        - I'm very close        
       to my sister Tabi.       

182
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,448
          I'm so happy          
        to see her here.        

183
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,715
      When's the last time      
     we've seen each other?     

184
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,017
       Oh, mom's funeral.       
      - Yeah, a year ago.       

185
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,351
       You know, tomorrow       
         makes a year.          

186
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:51,452
  Yeah. But at the same time,   

187
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:54,589
           there are            
    so many mixed emotions.     

188
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,490
      Mom would have loved      
          to do this.           

189
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:59,425
        She would have.         
            - Yeah.             

190
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:02,628
           - (cries)            

191
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,699
   - I'm glad we're together,   

192
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:11,935
  'cause it's a sensitive time  
            for us.             

193
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,269
          - (sobbing)           
     Thank you for coming.      

194
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:16,372
    The day that they closed    
      my mother's casket,       

195
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:18,507
       I just shut down.        

196
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,376
      I just threw myself       
          in my work.           

197
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,644
          I felt that           
   if I didn't see my family    

198
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:26,045
      or I shut them out,       

199
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,613
     I didn't have to face      
   the passing of my mother.    

200
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:30,248
     So now seeing Tabatha,     

201
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,116
       Oh, I'm facing it.       

202
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:34,652
   - It's just a piece of me    

203
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:37,754
        will never be...        
    I'll never be complete.     

204
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,589
         - I felt like          
    there was so much on me.    

205
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,924
           That's why           
    I just said I have to...    

206
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:44,859
    I have to focus on work,    
      keep myself moving.       

207
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,193
     - Keep yourself busy.      

208
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:47,427
     - That's why I've been     
       traveling so much.       

209
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,428
            - Yeah.             

210
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,996
        - I needed time.        

211
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,664
    It was too much for me.     

212
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,265
        It was too much.        

213
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,701
   I'm feeling guilty because   

214
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,969
    I just don't think that     
  I've been a good big brother  

215
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,539
because I should have been there
      more for my family.       

216
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,039
  It's just kind of something   

217
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,940
     that I'm holding heavy     
          on my heart.          

218
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:09,178
    As much as I want to be     
   in this challenge to win,    

219
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,313
         it's just hard         
  to get my head in the game.   

220
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:15,149
   It's like I'm at capacity.   

221
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:19,819
         - Coming up...         
   You're the only queen left   

222
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,887
   who is not from Season 5.    

223
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,423
       - I noticed that.        
   If I end up in the bottom,   

224
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,224
          it could be           
  "RuPaul's Best Friend Race,"  

225
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:27,559
     which means I go home.     

226
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:31,261
            (laughs)            

227
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,129
        (RuPaul laughs)         

228
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:37,798
        (RuPaul laughs)         

229
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,701
   - I'm going to wear that?    
   - No. No, no, no, no, me.    

230
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:42,036
   For this week's challenge,   

231
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,137
 we are going to be making over 
        our loved ones,         

232
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:47,007
   getting them in full drag.   

233
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:48,174
        - Hi. I'm Katya.        

234
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:49,942
       Nice to meet you.        

235
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,443
          So how come           
       you call her mom?        

236
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:53,679
        - She's legally         
        my grandmother,         

237
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:56,247
   but she's taken care of me   
  since I was three years old.  

238
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:57,448
           - No way.            

239
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,582
      - She's the only mom      
        I've ever known.        

240
00:09:58,584 --> 00:09:59,816
      So that's my mommy.       

241
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:01,985
   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.    
          Raised him.           

242
00:10:01,987 --> 00:10:03,586
         He turned out          
        to be wonderful.        

243
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,421
    He finished high school.    

244
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:06,621
          (all laugh)           

245
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:09,690
      - High expectations.      

246
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,861
       Having my mom here       
     is just beyond words.      

247
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,130
    She made her own T-shirt    
       for the occasion.        

248
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:18,264
     Like it's good times.      

249
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:20,733
        So I'll make us         
       matching outfits.        

250
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:22,100
         I'm gonna make         
      some quick dresses.       

251
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:23,501
   Good thing I'm good at it.   

252
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,002
           - I know.            

253
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,003
   - This challenge couldn't    
  have come at a better time.   

254
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:29,338
  I won the makeover challenge  
           Season 5,            

255
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,306
      so this is something      
      I'm very strong at.       

256
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:34,009
     I think this is gonna      
       pull me off a win.       

257
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:35,810
       - This is amazing        
       that you're here.        

258
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,778
     - Hell or high water,      
      I was gonna be here.      

259
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,979
         - When I first         
      started doing drag,       

260
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:42,148
       my mom was afraid        
        that I was like         

261
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,316
  a cross-dressing prostitute   
          doing drugs           

262
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,518
   and getting into trouble.    

263
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,288
      Which I was, but...       
            (laughs)            

264
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,157
  - You're probably a lot more  
     clearheaded this time      

265
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,426
   than you were on Season 5.   

266
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:58,061
     Now that you're clean,     
  you're probably clearheaded.  

267
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:59,830
      - I am. I really am.      
      - And doing so well.      

268
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,733
      That makes me happy       
      more than anything.       

269
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,735
        It really does.         

270
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:09,504
    - Right after Season 5,     

271
00:11:09,506 --> 00:11:12,339
       it was really easy       
           to say yes           

272
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,775
      when I was offered,       
           you know,            

273
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,876
         all the things         
        you get offered         

274
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:20,246
   when you're being treated    
 like a rock star on the road.  

275
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:22,414
            I've won            
     four challenges, mom.      

276
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,250
     - (gasps) Oh, Justin.      

277
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:26,784
  Oh, my God, that's so great.  

278
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,553
     I'm so happy for you.      

279
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,455
     Not that that matters.     

280
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,823
          (both laugh)          

281
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,559
        - I'm glad that         
       I was able to stop       

282
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:40,063
     and reassess in time.      

283
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:45,068
    Now I focus on the work     
  rather than the after party.  

284
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,005
     - Hello, hello, hello.     

285
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,873
             - Hi.              
             - Hi.              

286
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,609
     - Hey, Katya. Hi, Pat.     
             - Hi.              

287
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,910
  - That lace front looks like  
 it's coming out of your head.  

288
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,212
      - (laughs) It isn't?      

289
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:00,913
          (all laugh)           

290
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:04,049
      - Now, did you watch      
   your child on "Drag Race?"   

291
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,416
         - Yes, I did.          

292
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,085
  - What was the most shocking  
       thing you learned?       

293
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:09,120
         - When he got          
        really personal         

294
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:11,388
       about his struggle       
         with anxiety,          

295
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,090
    hearing that heartache,     
       I mean, I knew it,       

296
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,960
      but to see it so raw      

297
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:18,928
  that was shocking my heart.   

298
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,563
         And thank you          
      for counseling him.       

299
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:21,663
       You did wonderful.       

300
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:22,864
    - Oh, that's very kind.     

301
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,499
           Thank you.           

302
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,535
          Now, Katya,           
   you're the only queen left   

303
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:29,537
   who is not from Season 5.    

304
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,438
    - I noticed that. Yeah.     

305
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,674
      - Do you think that       
      the Rolaskatox girls      

306
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:36,210
        are, you know--         
    - Conspiring against me?    

307
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:38,778
 Picking off the other seasons  
          one by one?           

308
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,547
 I'm the only one in the group  
    who's not from Season 5,    

309
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:44,449
 which means that they all have 
 stronger bonds with each other 

310
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:46,317
     than they do with me,      
     especially Rolaskatox.     

311
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:49,086
         So if I end up         
         in the bottom,         

312
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:52,122
          it could be           
  "RuPaul's Best Friend Race,"  

313
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:54,024
     which means I go home.     

314
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:56,760
            (laughs)            

315
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,628
         - Hi, Heather.         
           - Hi, Ru.            

316
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,195
          - Hi, Detox.          
            - Hi, Ru.           

317
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,562
       - You're a lawyer.       
            - I am.             

318
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:04,097
   - Are you the reason Detox   
    is out of prison today?     

319
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:07,967
- I can't take credit for that, 
       but I'm the reason       

320
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:11,637
   that if you steal his name   
 and likeness, you'll get sued. 

321
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,004
          (all laugh)           

322
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:15,273
    - Now, Detox, you lived     
   with Heather at one point.   

323
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,141
 - Mm-hmm. I was in a bad place 
       when I was a kid.        

324
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,776
      I was misunderstood,      
 and she kind of encouraged me  

325
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:23,312
  to come out and live my life  
          as who I am,          

326
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:25,080
        help me blossom         
       as a young artist        

327
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:26,882
   and a freak and a weirdo.    

328
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:29,517
        - Were you just         
 a naturally nurturing person,  

329
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,684
      or did you just see       

330
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,919
         my kid brother         
    is in a lot of trouble.     

331
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,087
      I've got to step up?      

332
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,621
          - Basically.          
           - (laughs)           

333
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:38,323
  - Now, is there going to be   
  a strong family resemblance?  

334
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:40,125
 - People tell us all the time  
     we have the same nose.     

335
00:13:40,127 --> 00:13:41,860
       Obviously, sadly.        

336
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,394
          (all laugh)           

337
00:13:43,396 --> 00:13:44,661
    - It's a gorgeous nose.     

338
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:46,496
       - I love our nose,       
        especially now.         

339
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:47,730
   But before, we were like,    

340
00:13:47,732 --> 00:13:49,164
          we gotta get          
   brother/sister nose jobs.    

341
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,532
       - Yeah. I'm still        
      not opposed to that.      

342
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,000
          (all laugh)           

343
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:53,601
           - The key            
   to winning this challenge    

344
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:55,935
         is by creating         
     a family resemblance,      

345
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:58,537
      and it's like we're       
    the same fucking person.    

346
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,738
         She's just got         
         a real vagina.         

347
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,372
      But I need to focus       

348
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,539
     because I haven't had      
       a win in a while.        

349
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,974
        And even though         
     I've been on the top,      

350
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,108
         I want to win.         

351
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,809
         - Hey, Roxxxy.         
           - Hi, Ru.            

352
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,710
          - Hi, Sonia.          
            - Hi, Ru.           

353
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:11,510
       - I can't believe        
     I'm meeting the woman      

354
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:14,546
       who singlehandedly       
  raised this gorgeous child.   

355
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:15,813
    - Can you believe that?     

356
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,281
      - It's just amazing.      

357
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:20,484
    Did you watch your child    
        on "Drag Race?"         

358
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,618
          - Oh, yeah.           

359
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,985
      - Because the world       
          got to hear           

360
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,987
     this incredible story      

361
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,089
     of how you really came     
     to this kid's rescue.      

362
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,792
   - My mother left my sister   
    and myself at a bus stop    

363
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,059
       when I was three,        

364
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,628
       and I remember it        
     like it was yesterday.     

365
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,531
      And like I come off       
   as this strong character,    

366
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:39,232
    I try to stay so strong,    

367
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:42,902
        but I'm so weak         
   at the same time. (cries)    

368
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:46,138
  - We were all heartbroken...  

369
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,138
       - I know, I know.        

370
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,238
   - When we heard the story.   

371
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,372
       - Maybe he needed        
          to do that.           

372
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:50,873
    Sometimes you need to...    

373
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,240
    - You have to get it out    
   of your system, you know.    

374
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:54,709
           - Mm-hmm.            
    - And we took that story    

375
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:56,844
  and we put it in our hearts.  

376
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:57,944
            And now             
     you're on "Drag Race."     

377
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:00,613
    - This is unbelievable.     

378
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:03,048
       - Are you planning       
      to just tear it up?       

379
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,816
         - Whoa, am I.          

380
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,650
          (both laugh)          

381
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,185
     - Roxxxy needs to win      
        this challenge.         

382
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,020
      - Whatever it takes.      
           Oh, yeah.            

383
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,354
      Stand up on my head.      

384
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,656
         - Oh, my God.          

385
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:16,257
          - All right,          
      see you in a minute.      

386
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:18,092
          - Thank you.          
             - Bye.             

387
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:21,695
       - Alyssa Edwards,        
  you've brought Tabatha here.  

388
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,530
           - I have.            
    This is my baby sister.     

389
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:25,264
        - Now, you don't        
       seem like someone        

390
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,400
       who's that flashy.       
            - Right.            

391
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:30,402
      - Where do you think      
      this one has gotten       

392
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,137
       the Alyssa flair?        

393
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,504
           - Our mom.           
   That's where it came from.   

394
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,139
           - Really?            
            - Yeah.             

395
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:37,508
    - She had a personality     
        that was just--         

396
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,509
       it lit up a room.        

397
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:39,676
       - Yeah, energetic.       

398
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:41,343
        - My mom danced.        
      I got that from her.      

399
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:43,244
    She felt like everything    
      I touched was gold.       

400
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,112
        - She was always        
        encouraging me.         

401
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,446
       - I had one person       
      that believed in me.      

402
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:49,081
        She protected me        
 from the cruelty of the world. 

403
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,784
     - You are what you are     
        because of her.         

404
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,687
       - Yeah. (sniffles)       

405
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,021
  - What was your mom's name?   

406
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,622
         - Sherryanne.          

407
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,156
    - What does it say here?    

408
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,758
      - "Love never dies,       
   but someday we all will."    

409
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,794
           Tomorrow's           
    the one year anniversary    

410
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,029
     of our mom's passing.      

411
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,298
          - So is this          
      a dedication to her?      

412
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,432
             - Yes.             

413
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,568
    - And have you processed    
        all of this yet?        

414
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,236
   - I feel like I haven't--    
             - No.              

415
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,538
  - Today was taking the time   
      to sit down and like      

416
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,073
       face it a little.        

417
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,375
   And it was the right time.   

418
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:23,844
           - (sighs)            

419
00:16:23,846 --> 00:16:25,779
      - I'm glad you guys       
      get to be together,       

420
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:28,014
        because I think         
     this needed to happen.     

421
00:16:28,016 --> 00:16:28,915
    This is for Sherryanne.     

422
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,416
            - Yeah.             
             - Yes.             

423
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:33,419
  - The world gets to see her   
   fabulousness through you.    

424
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:35,087
         She's with us.         
     - She is, definitely.      

425
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,288
      - Thank you so much.      
          - Thank you.          

426
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,326
    - Gather round, family.     

427
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:44,327
        Now, as an extra        
         little treat,          

428
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,663
          in a moment,          
    you and your loved ones     

429
00:16:47,665 --> 00:16:50,032
    will get a brow tutorial    

430
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:52,600
         from Anastasia         
       of Beverly Hills.        

431
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,935
             - Ooh.             
             - Yes.             

432
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:57,904
     - Oh, one more thing.      

433
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:02,476
     Tomorrow, in addition      
 to your drag transformations,  

434
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:07,514
     each family unit needs     
    to vogue the house down     

435
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:12,719
    in a special performance    
       on the main stage.       

436
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:16,388
         So good luck,          
     and don't fuck it up.      

437
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,422
         - Oh, my God.          

438
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,423
    - Oh, pardon my French.     

439
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:21,491
          (all laugh)           
             Okay.              

440
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,093
             - Bye.             
             - Bye.             

441
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,294
         - Coming up...         

442
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,894
    - Girl, you are beating     
      the hell out of me.       

443
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:29,298
         - I still cry          
    when I don't get my way.    

444
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,365
      - I feel like Katya.      

445
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,967
    I laughed in the mirror     
        and I went, oh.         

446
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,402
          (all laugh)           

447
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,170
        (RuPaul laughs)         

448
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,706
        (RuPaul laughs)         

449
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:46,043
- It's so nice having real women
        in the workroom.        

450
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:49,679
- This week's maxi challenge is 
the family affair drag makeover.

451
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,715
We're all happy to have a family
  member here in the workroom,  

452
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:54,984
  but it's still a competition  
 and it's the best of the best, 

453
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:58,520
     so any little mistake      
  could put you in the bottom.  

454
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,788
   - I don't want you to just   
   be cute, girl, drop dead--   

455
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,056
     - Drop dead gorgeous.      

456
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:05,058
    - Ah, you remember that,    
             girl?              

457
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,194
      - Hello, everybody.       

458
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,495
      I'm Anastasia Soare       

459
00:18:09,497 --> 00:18:12,530
         and I am here          
     to fix your eyebrows.      

460
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:16,000
            - Nice.             

461
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,668
  - Oh, I love Ms. Anastasia.   

462
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,569
         Mama is done.          

463
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,771
  - I would love to invite you  
          on my chair.          

464
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:24,107
     So I will do freehand      
        Pat's eyebrows.         

465
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:27,843
           Obviously,           
      she tweezed so much       

466
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,811
   her eyebrow for long time.   

467
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,146
       - Way to go, mom.        
           - I know.            

468
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:34,414
      But she's beautiful       
       and just learning        

469
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,316
         how to fill in         
         her eyebrows.          

470
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:39,285
         It's gonna add         
        so much beauty.         

471
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:41,587
       I am going to use        
          the pomade.           

472
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,521
           It dries,            
      and it doesn't move.      

473
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,590
        This highlighter        
      define the eyebrows       

474
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,524
         and highlights         
         the brow bone.         

475
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:50,393
     I mean, look at that.      

476
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,160
           - Lovely.            
             - Huh?             

477
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:53,628
           (applause)           
         - That's nice.         

478
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,896
    - You're a brow genius.     

479
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,531
      - Thank you, ladies,      
            so much,            

480
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,098
  and keep your eyes gorgeous.  

481
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,666
          - Thank you.          
          - Thank you.          

482
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:02,534
      - Thank you so much.      
             - Bye.             

483
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:04,169
             - Bye.             

484
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,607
         - We're here.          

485
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,743
       - That's my mama.        

486
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:16,012
      Now it's time to get      
   our loved ones dragged up.   

487
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:17,280
     It's really exciting.      

488
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,316
    My mom's really pretty,     
      so this will be fun.      

489
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:23,052
       - I'm putting you        
      in full drag today.       

490
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:25,020
         - I can't wait         
    to see us side by side.     

491
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:26,621
           - I think            
      when I get in drag,       

492
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,357
         I see--in me,          
   I see so much of you guys.   

493
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,425
            - Yeah,             
  and we all have mom's eyes.   

494
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:34,161
     - Yeah, the big eyes.      
       - Yeah, beautiful.       

495
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,628
       - Today's the day.       

496
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,666
 It's the one-year anniversary  
     of our mom's passing.      

497
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,101
       What do you think?       

498
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:49,175
  And I'm like, okay, just be   
 strong, be strong, be strong.  

499
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:50,943
             Tabi,              
    we're going to do this.     

500
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:52,678
          I don't want          
      to be so sad today.       

501
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,013
   - No. We need to be happy    
     and show out for her.      

502
00:19:55,015 --> 00:19:56,514
      - Yeah, we're gonna       
       show out for her.        

503
00:19:56,516 --> 00:20:00,050
I didn't come here to half step 
   and be nobody's runner-up.   

504
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:02,819
   - Please prepare yourself.   

505
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,955
   You're going to get really   
     stunning really fast.      

506
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:09,024
  - Alaska, what were you like  
           as a kid?            

507
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:12,227
  - He was a really good kid,   
        as a baby even.         

508
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,595
       Hardly ever cried.       

509
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,530
           - Really?            
           - Mm-hmm.            

510
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:19,033
  You made up for it later on.  
            (laughs)            

511
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,769
   - I was a fuckin monster.    

512
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:24,338
          I still cry           
    when I don't get my way.    

513
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:32,178
- Last week, on the anniversary 
 of dad's passing, I was here.  

514
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,279
        - I was thinking        
        about you a lot,        

515
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:35,547
           wondering            
    how it was going and...     

516
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:41,351
       - It's been tough.       

517
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:43,319
    Not everyone knows this,    

518
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:45,321
   but my head wasn't really    
      in the game Season 5      

519
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:47,322
     because before I came      
     into the competition,      

520
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:49,357
   my father got really sick,   

521
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,093
   and at the time, we didn't   
  have the best relationship.   

522
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:55,996
  I had a tough time with dad   
        being accepting.        

523
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:57,463
  So right before he passed...  

524
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,098
   - I think he accepted you    
          before that.          

525
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,870
  I mean, he was not very easy  
     to share his feelings.     

526
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:10,340
   - Watching me on the show    
and him being so close to death,

527
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:11,974
       it opened the door       
   for a lot of conversations   

528
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:13,976
   that we never really had,    

529
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:15,811
  and I'll be forever grateful  
           for that.            

530
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,379
  Well, I mean, I could tell,   

531
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:19,814
    like he was like making     
     amends before he left.     

532
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:24,584
    I was in Orlando working    
   at Pulse and he showed up.   

533
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:25,851
        And I remember,         
         like, bawling          

534
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:28,754
    'cause my fucking daddy     
      was at my drag show.      

535
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:31,156
        You were there.         
           - Mm-hmm.            

536
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,726
- Well, at least he'll see that 
 we're together and having fun. 

537
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,360
            I think             
    that's all that matters.    

538
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:41,196
      The fact that I can       
   share this with my sister    

539
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:44,533
    and feel him here today     
           is like--            

540
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:46,233
  it's like come full circle.   

541
00:21:46,235 --> 00:21:47,635
     It feels right to me.      

542
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:51,805
    - Girl, you are beating     
      the hell out of me.       

543
00:21:51,807 --> 00:21:52,872
       - This is a beat.        

544
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,006
     - We're all showgirls      
            tonight.            

545
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,206
             - Oh.              

546
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,340
      - I feel like Katya.      

547
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:57,875
    I laughed in the mirror,    
        and I went, oh.         

548
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:01,544
          (all laugh)           

549
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,479
      - Oh, those glasses,      
           mom goes.            

550
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,614
      - Mom, you are good.      
       That was so good.        

551
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,518
         - Coming up...         

552
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,018
- Really, one of the highlights 
        of the evening.         

553
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,353
       - I was like, yes.       

554
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:16,489
         - I felt like          
      it was like a weird,      

555
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:18,657
      like, birds of death      
           nightmare.           

556
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,293
        (RuPaul laughs)         

557
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:25,663
        (RuPaul laughs)         

558
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:29,267
  -  Covergirl, put the bass   
         in your walk          

559
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:36,440
           Covergirl,          
  put the bass in your walk    

560
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:40,443
          Head to toe,         
   let your whole body talk

563
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,619
 - Welcome to the main stage of 
 "RuPaul's Drag Race AllStars."

     - And my play cousin,      
  the incredible Todrick Hall.  

569
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,867
     - But let it be known      
   I was always the favorite.   

570
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,568
         - That's true.         

571
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,704
       And the shilarious

     to our twisted family.     

573
00:23:14,974 --> 00:23:16,907
       - Thanks. This is        
    the best day of my life.    

574
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:19,009
  I'm killing myself tomorrow.  

575
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:21,277

576

578
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:31,853
And to kick things off, they're 
 ready to vogue the house down.

           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines.

588

589
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:29,201
            - Whoo!             

590
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:30,535
          - I like it.

596
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,352
  So much hair on the runway.

  Ms. Tabatha, AKA Ava Edwards  
     is all up in the gig.

   who've just robbed a bank,   

603
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,807
      but then we went out      
           shopping.            

604
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:17,274
             - Oh!

            for who?

            Up next,            
 Katya and Svetlana Borisivna.  

615
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,740
              Ah.               

616
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:54,541
       - Yodi-lay-hee-ho.       

617
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:56,476
     - Emphasis on the ho.      

618
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:57,611
            - Mama!             

619
00:25:57,613 --> 00:25:59,345
          (all laugh)           

620
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:01,547
      I'm giving seventies      
      Soviet Anna Karenina      

621
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:03,949
    and she's giving fused,     
       bumbling babushka.       

622
00:26:05,719 --> 00:26:07,819
 - What they're wearing, would  
you call that Russian dressing? 

623
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:09,686
  - I think that was it, yeah.  

624
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:13,356
       - Up next, Roxxxy        
      and Raquel Andrews.       

625
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:16,659
             - Wow.             
     Cougars doing leopard.     

626
00:26:16,661 --> 00:26:19,762
            - Uh-oh!            
       - What a cheetah.        

627
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:22,297
        - My mom and I,         
    we look sexy as can be.     

628
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:23,631
          We look like          
     the house of Andrews,      

629
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:27,434
       and we are getting       
   our complete lags, honey.    

630
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,168
   - Panthers on the runway.    

631
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,937
     Give 'em hell, Raquel.     

632
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:35,640
         - Coming up...         
     - This is "Allstars."      

633
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:37,241
        I think this was        
      a big lazy tonight,       

634
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:38,810
       and I expect more.       

635
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:43,513
        (RuPaul laughs)         

636
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:47,482
        (RuPaul laughs)         

637
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,450
       - Welcome, ladies.       

638
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:52,185
         Now it's time          
   for the judges' critiques.   

639
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:56,890
           First up,            
    Alyssa and Ava Edwards.     

640
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:58,925
  - I loved the vogue so much.  

641
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,792
          I felt like           
      it was like a weird,      

642
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:03,261
      like, birds of death      
           nightmare            

643
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:05,863
  that I never wanted to end.   

644
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:08,331
 - I did think you had too much 
   going on in that ensemble,   

645
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,066
     Alyssa, even for you.      

646
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:11,901
    But this runway tonight     

647
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:14,469
   is everything that I love    
     about Alyssa Edwards.      

648
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:17,572
       - I have to agree,       
   and you look so fantastic.   

649
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:18,839
          - Thank you.          

650
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:20,140
      - I think you nailed      
    the challenge perfectly     

651
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:21,674
            because             
     you look like sisters.     

652
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:23,208
      - Thank you so much.      

653
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,445
           - Up next,           
       Alaska and Hawaii.       

654
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:30,414
             Aloha.             
            - Aloha.            

655
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,216
- I thought that the performance
        was really fun.         

656
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:34,451
      - But what's having       
  a disconnect for me, Alaska,  

657
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,985
   was that you let your mom    

658
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,053
   come out on the main stage   
         in flip flops,         

659
00:27:38,055 --> 00:27:40,155
   and you're done in a gown.   

660
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:42,824
      And mom has a piece       
    of sheer sequined fabric    

661
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:45,060
         wrapped around         
   what looks to be a corset.   

662
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:46,994
  Because this is "Allstars,"   

663
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:50,164
  I think this was a bit lazy   
  tonight, and I expect more.   

664
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,632
     - It could be because      
   you've been doing so well,   

665
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:53,799
    expectation is so high.     

666
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:55,200
   But this is the top five,    

667
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:58,636
  so this wouldn't be the week  
    to not go 100% full out.    

668
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:05,742
  - Up next, Detox and D-rama.  

669
00:28:05,744 --> 00:28:07,143
    - I thought that you two    

670
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,344
     had the most cohesive      
   performance of the night.    

671
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:10,745
    If this was a lip sync,     

672
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:12,880
  I'm not quite sure which one  
    of you would be winning.    

673
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:14,247
      You were that good.       

674
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:16,249
     - I loved all of this.     

675
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,718
            I loved             
    the origami fascinators.    

676
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,955
  It's like Donatella Versace   
     for the Hunger Games.      

677
00:28:22,957 --> 00:28:25,957
   - And the strongest family   
          resemblance.          

678
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,892
   I mean, it's unbelievable.   

679
00:28:27,894 --> 00:28:29,293
      I'm just super proud      

680
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:30,594
  of the thought and the work   
      you put in tonight.       

681
00:28:30,596 --> 00:28:36,232
        - Up next, Katya        
    and Svetlana Borisvitna.    

682
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:37,300
   How'd I do with the name?    

683
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:38,468
          - Terribly.           
            - Yeah.             

684
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,103
         Say it for me.         
          - Borisivna.          

685
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:43,272
     - And this is Svetlana     
         Borisvis--ahh.         

686
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:44,539
          (all laugh)           

687
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,041
           - I think            
      the vogue-ing thing       

688
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:47,875
  was not high up on the scale  

689
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:50,410
     of things I love to do     
       in life for Katya.       

690
00:28:50,412 --> 00:28:51,811
            - Yeah.             

691
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,445
  - But then you came out here  
      with this storyline,      

692
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:56,748
      and I was like, yes.      

693
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,651
      - It just completely      
   flipped the switch for me.   

694
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,219
       It felt so Katya.        

695
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:04,688
 - You're giving us this, like, 
  vintage Misoni kind of look.  

696
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,856
         It's something         
      that they would wear      

697
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:07,523
  in Real Housewives of Minsk.  

698
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:09,024
         - Yes, it's--          

699
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:10,958
 - Really one of the highlights 
        of the evening.         

700
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,193
     - I will say, sidebar,     

701
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:14,529
          your mother           
   completely stole the show.   

702
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:15,696
             - Yes!             

703
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:17,464
         - Your acting,         
      I mean, you deserve       

704
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:18,399
     a Tony Award for that.     

705
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:19,666
          - Thank you.          

706
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:23,636
      - Up next is Roxxxy       
      and Raquel Andrews.       

707
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:27,407
    - You don't have to show    
   a lot of skin to be sexy,    

708
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:30,476
  and those suits were so hot.  

709
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:32,411
     - But I might've liked     
      some crazy accessory      

710
00:29:32,413 --> 00:29:36,214
   or something else to just    
make this look more drag runway.

711
00:29:36,216 --> 00:29:37,915
      - But you look sexy.      

712
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,049
     I hope you don't mind      
        me saying that.         

713
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,883
    - No. Oh, no, go ahead.     

714
00:29:40,885 --> 00:29:42,552
          (all laugh)           
       - Calm down, mom.        

715
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,188
      - Thank you, ladies.      
  I think we've heard enough.   

716
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,259
Based on the judges' critiques, 
   I've made some decisions.    

717
00:29:52,463 --> 00:29:55,030
             Detox,             

718
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:57,165
             Katya,             

719
00:29:57,167 --> 00:30:01,035
 con-drag-ulations. You are the 
 two top Allstars of the week.  

720
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:03,805
    You and your loved ones     

721
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:09,009
  have each won a $2,000 gift   
 certificate from Marc Jacobs.  

722
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,945
             - Wow.             
           - (laughs)           

723
00:30:11,947 --> 00:30:16,316
    - That means this week,     
  if you're not in the top...   

724
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:22,321
  You are up for elimination.   

725
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:23,388
            - Fuck.             

726
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,023
   - You may leave the stage.   

727
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,397
       - This feels like        
  the most difficult decision   

728
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,931
  thus far in the competition   

729
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,000
   because we are determining   
 who gets to go into the final  

730
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,636
    and who has to go home.     

731
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:47,908
     Okay, so I'm detecting     
      a very solemn tone.       

732
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,510
     - It is super solemn.      

733
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:51,845
 Everyone did so fucking great  
 and then to put us in, like--  

734
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:54,547
      - I didn't do great       
        this challenge.         

735
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:57,684
          I got really          
       terrible critiques       

736
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:01,287
        and I fucked up         
 and I feel terrible about it.  

737
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:05,324
And I'm sorry that I won so much
   because it fucking sucks.    

738
00:31:07,761 --> 00:31:09,059
 - You're beating yourself up.  

739
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:10,828
        - Yeah, you need        
        to just stop it.        

740
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,062
        Just chill out.         

741
00:31:12,064 --> 00:31:13,997
    - No, I'm uncomfortable.    
       Drag fuckin hurts.       

742
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:20,235
   I've tried to stay really    
   focused and really strong    

743
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:24,005
     and not show any signs     
          of weakness,          

744
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:28,510
            and now             
    I'm not able to hide it.    

745
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,380
      I'm just feeling it       
  all crashing down around me.  

746
00:31:32,382 --> 00:31:34,148
  - I want to talk to people.   
            - Sure.             

747
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,849
         - I don't know         
     if you need to or not.     

748
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:37,183
      So if you would like      
          to join me.           

749
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:38,784
            - Okay.             
          - Let's go.           

750
00:31:38,786 --> 00:31:40,285
           - Let's do           
      a little one-on-one.      

751
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:42,454
       Alaska, you're up.       
            - Okay.             

752
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:43,922
         - I don't want         
       to see anybody go.       

753
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:46,790
   Everyone did a great job,    
         minus Alaska,          

754
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:49,226
     but she's been killing     
        the competition.        

755
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:52,695
     And I've known Roxxxy      
         for 13 years.          

756
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:54,397
          She's one of          
        my best friends.        

757
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,199
     How am I going to send     
      my best friend home?      

758
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:59,135
        What am I gonna         
          fucking do?           

759
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:04,338
   - You can come over here,    
            Roxxxy.             

760
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,473
        Come over here.         
        - Get over here.        

761
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:08,742
  - We're sisters, all of us.   

762
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,077
            - Right.            
        - You know that.        

763
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,979
     I personally feel like     
        it would be you,        

764
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:17,250
 but you've been in the bottom  
 five out of seven challenges.  

765
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,885
          Consistency.          
            - Right.            

766
00:32:19,887 --> 00:32:22,254
   - It's Alaska's first time   
 in the bottom, my second time. 

767
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:24,389
   Going into the final four,   

768
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,825
  me and Alaska should be safe  
   just based off statistics.   

769
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:29,661
   Do you think that's fair,    
            though?             

770
00:32:29,663 --> 00:32:31,495
  - On the last couple weeks,   

771
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:33,129
       I got my critiques       
      to be in the bottom.      

772
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,131
       I don't get today.       
  - But he didn't save nobody.  

773
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,999
    He said if you're not in    
 the top, you're in the bottom. 

774
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:38,701
           - I guess.           

775
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,835
        - I think Roxxxy        
      is feeling nervous.       

776
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:44,005
   She's been saved the last    
   three times consecutively.   

777
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,040
       But I think Roxxxy       
    has the upper hand on me    

778
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:49,310
         because she is         
         her good Judy.         

779
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:55,015
 - So what happened this week?  
        - I don't know.         

780
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:58,384
    I guess all I can say is    
     I really want to stay      

781
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,986
          and I think           
       I deserve to stay.       

782
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:03,289
    - Alaska doesn't know me    
           very well,           

783
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,357
         and, you know,         
     if I win the lip sync,     

784
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,793
    I don't know that she's     
100% sure I won't send her home 

785
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:10,928
         because she's          
    my biggest competition.     

786
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,964
   - I need to go to the end    
      of this competition.      

787
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,633
           I need to.           

788
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,670
            - Party.            

789
00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:25,007
            - Okay.             

790
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:27,476
      My heart is sinking.      

791
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:31,146
       I think my spleen        
      is going to explode.      

792
00:33:31,148 --> 00:33:33,348
       Queens in the past       

793
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,685
  have completely disregarded   
   someone's past performance   

794
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,453
      and sent people home      

795
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:42,355
 because of a terrible critique 
         on the runway.         

796
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:44,657
      Even I, in the past.      

797
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:45,958
      So it's terrifying.       

798
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,393
  I fucked up this week, man.   

799
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:51,429
          I fucked up,          
      and it really sucks.      

800
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:54,798
       It fucking really        
      fucking sucks a lot.      

801
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,367
        And I need to be        
       in the final four,       

802
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,636
       and now I--now I'm       
    potentially looking at--    

803
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,671
        I'm not going--         
      I'm not going to be,      

804
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:03,806
  and it really fucking sucks.  

805
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,475
         - I'm shocked          
    with Alaska's behavior.     

806
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,176
      She's really acting       
          like a brat,          

807
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:10,210
        and it's not...         

808
00:34:10,212 --> 00:34:11,912
      it's not attractive.      

809
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:14,981
   It might throw my thinking   
process off of the elimination. 

810
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:18,084
  If you're going to act like   
    a brat, like, right now,    

811
00:34:18,086 --> 00:34:20,919
    how are you going to act    
  the rest of this time here?   

812
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:23,788
 - Well, I'll give you $10,000  
      if you let me stay.       

813
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,756
         Before taxes.          

814
00:34:25,758 --> 00:34:27,324
    I'll transfer it to you     
          via PayPal,           

815
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:30,292
     because I need to stay     
      in this competition.      

816
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:32,395
          I need to be          
       in the final four.       

817
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:39,635
        Acting this way         
 only exacerbates the problem.  

818
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:42,270
          I know that.          
         I'm an adult.          

819
00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:44,939
         But it's like          
      the end of the road       

820
00:34:44,941 --> 00:34:48,141
  is flashing before my eyes.   

821
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:49,543
   It's really hard to take.    

822
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:59,184
       - This is such an        
 incredibly difficult decision  

823
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:03,422
because on the one hand, Alaska 
absolutely performed the worst. 

824
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:05,457
       But then Roxxxy's        
       been in the bottom       

825
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:07,525
    consistently throughout     
        the competition         

826
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:10,161
    and Alyssa is somewhere     
         in the middle.         

827
00:35:10,163 --> 00:35:13,731
    So I could make the case    
     for anyone to go home.     

828
00:35:16,669 --> 00:35:19,102
       - I feel nauseous,       

829
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:22,138
and, you know, I just feel like 
 a dick no matter what happens. 

830
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,007
      I'm just going with       
  what my heart is telling me.  

831
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:27,410
    That's what I gotta do.     

832
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:32,614
        (RuPaul laughs)         

833
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,250
        (RuPaul laughs)         

834
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,220
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

835
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:45,891
        Two top Allstars        
        stand before me.        

836
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:50,261
  Ladies, this is your chance   
         to impress me,         

837
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:53,765
          win $10,000           
       and earn the power       

838
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:58,369
to give one of the bottom queens
           the chop.            

839
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:03,739
       The time has come        
          to lip sync           

840
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:06,475
   (echoing) for your legacy.   

841
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:13,681
           Good luck            
     and don't fuck it up.      

842
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:14,881
     -  Step to the beat,      
         to the beat           

843
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,082
          Go freaky           

844
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:17,616
       Boom-shang-a-lang,      
       work that thang         

845
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:18,816
         All right now!         

846
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:20,851
   All you biological females   

847
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:23,286
        who used to have        
        the upper hand,         

848
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:24,821
       it ain't like that       
        no more, honey.         

849
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:26,756
     It's a-got real tough      
          up in here.           

850
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:29,291
    You got your trisexual.     
     You got your bisexual.     

851
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:30,792
   You got your inner sexual.   

852
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:32,894
         You gonna have         
     to step your pussy up.     

853
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,494
             Handy.             

854
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:36,897
             Handy.             

855
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:37,897
             Handy.             

856
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:39,231
            - Yeah!             

857
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,500
           - (laughs)           

858
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:42,767
             Whoo!              

859
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:44,703
           - (laughs)           

860
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:48,238
      -  If you're trying      
        to be somebody         

861
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,706
        Girl, you better       
          step it up           

862
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,941
        If you're trying       
        to be somebody         

863
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,543
  Girl, you better step it up  
        and step it up         

864
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,878
          (all laugh)           

865
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:06,653
       If you ain't gonna      
       step inside this        

866
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:09,288
        Then you better        
       drop a sign then        

867
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,156
        - Girl, you have        
     to step your pussy up      

868
00:37:11,158 --> 00:37:12,957
             - Oh!              
          (all laugh)           

869
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:15,560
     You better drop a sign    
             then              

870
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,764
        If you're trying       
        to be somebody         

871
00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:22,165
             Girl,             
    you better step it up      

872
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,533
        If you're trying       
        to be somebody         

873
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,034
             Girl,             
    you better step it up      

874
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,802
      Better step it up       

875
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:30,737
       Girl, you have to       
      step your pussy up       

876
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:33,906
            - Yeah!             
            - Whoo!             

877
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:35,074
           (applause)           

878
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:37,643
             - Yes.             

879
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:41,313
            Ladies,             
     I've made my decision.     

880
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:48,452
             Detox,             
     you're a winner, baby.     

881
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:50,821
           (applause)           
             - Yay.             

882
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:54,524
    - You've won a cash tip     
          of $10,000.           

883
00:37:54,526 --> 00:37:56,292
     - Thank you very much.     

884
00:37:56,294 --> 00:37:58,161
     - Katya, you're safe.      

885
00:37:58,163 --> 00:37:59,895
          - Thank you.          

886
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:02,431
    - Will the bottom three     
      please step forward?      

887
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:11,371
    Detox, with great power     
  comes great responsibility.   

888
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:16,343
  Which queen have you chosen   
        to get the chop?        

889
00:38:16,345 --> 00:38:18,411
         - On one hand,         
        you have Alaska,        

890
00:38:18,413 --> 00:38:21,146
    who has been slaying it     
    this entire competition.    

891
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:25,183
   And then you have Alyssa,    
   who has also been slaying.   

892
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,052
       And then you have        
        my best friend,         

893
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,854
        who I feel like         
 there have been several times  

894
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:32,457
  where she didn't necessarily  
  deserve to be in the bottom,  

895
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:34,392
    and tonight, especially,    
        was one of them.        

896
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:37,528
       And unfortunately,       
 I do have to make a decision.  

897
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,066
        I chose Alyssa.         
           I'm sorry.           

898
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,101
     I can't send her home.     
          - It's okay.          

899
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:46,501
        - I'm so sorry,         

900
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:50,071
      but I just couldn't       
    send Roxxxy home tonight    

901
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:52,039
 because she's been so amazing, 
   and I just couldn't do it.   

902
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:53,040
         I'm so sorry.          

903
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:54,440
       - Don't be sorry.        

904
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:55,875
            - (sobs)            

905
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:59,444
      I love you so much,       
     and I just hate this.      

906
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:03,448
      - As it is written,       
      so it shall be done.      

907
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:08,152
        Alyssa Edwards,         
      you are an Allstar.       

908
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:09,153
        (clucks tongue)         

909
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:11,321
          (all laugh)           

910
00:39:11,323 --> 00:39:13,989
        Now sashay away.        

911
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:15,457
          - Thank you.          
        Thank you, guys.        

912
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:17,859
      Good luck, you all.       

913
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:22,697
  Well, now I was a lovely...   
       fourth runner-up.        

914
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,365
          (all laugh)           

915
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:29,134
         I'm not angry.         
         I'm not upset.         

916
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,436
     Today was so magical.      

917
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:32,303
     I had the opportunity      
    to work with my sister,     

918
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:33,771
      and I did everything      
      that I wanted to do.      

919
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,939
         I can't leave          
        this competition        

920
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,108
    with nothing other than     
        a sense of joy.         

921
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,242
       So I'm very proud.       

922
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,409
             Aw...              

923
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:46,547
           Don't cry.           

924
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,548
       Why are you upset?       

925
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,317
    - Because you're always     
        a winner to me.         

926
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:52,718
   - That's all that matters.   

927
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,286
      - And they did what       
  anybody else would've done.   

928
00:39:54,288 --> 00:39:56,821
        They eliminated         
   their biggest competition.   

929
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:59,089
  - Oh, was I the biggest one?  
          - Yes, yes.           

930
00:39:59,091 --> 00:40:02,492
  - (laughs) That's my sister   
          right there!          

931
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:06,129
        I'm leaving this        
a better Alyssa than I came in. 

932
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:07,830
        That's the win.         

933
00:40:07,832 --> 00:40:11,267
      I am Alyssa Edwards       
      always and forever.       

934
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:12,868
        (clucks tongue)         

935
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:18,638
       - The final four,        
       con-drag-ulations.       

936
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,173
   You've survived the chop,    

937
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:24,710
 but do you have what it takes  
     to make it to the top?     

938
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:27,746
  And I want to hear from you,  
           the fans.            

939
00:40:27,748 --> 00:40:29,414
    Which queen do you think    

940
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,717
       deserves to enter        
  the Drag Race Hall of Fame?   

941
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:37,054
      Are you #TeamAlaska,      

942
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:38,722
          #TeamDetox,           

943
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:40,523
           #TeamKatya           

944
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,892
        or #TeamRoxxxy?         

945
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:44,994
    Let your voice be heard.    

946
00:40:44,996 --> 00:40:47,763
         And remember,          
  if you can't love yourself,   

947
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:49,997
        how in the hell         
 you gonna love somebody else?  

948
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,232
       Can I get an amen        
          up in here?           

949
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:53,533
            - Amen!             
            - Amen!             

950
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:55,401
          - All right.          
    Now let the music play.     

951
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:57,235
   -  Throw your hands up     

952
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:59,104
       Time to get down       

953
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:03,007
       Time to get down,       
    down, down, down, down     

954
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:05,176
     Throw your hands up
