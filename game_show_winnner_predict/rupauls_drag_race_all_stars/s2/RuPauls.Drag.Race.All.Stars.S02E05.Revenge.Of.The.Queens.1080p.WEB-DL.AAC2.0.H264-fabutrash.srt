1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,501
        - Previously            
        on "AllStars..."        

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,670
        - Whoo, girl.           

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,404
        All is not lost.        

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,672
            - No way.           

5
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:11,407
    - You still have a chance   
        to return.              

6
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:13,042
    - Wait, does this mean      
    I get to come back?         

7
00:00:13,077 --> 00:00:16,378
      - For your revenge.       

8
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:17,678
            - What?             

9
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:20,415
        - Alyssa Edwards,       
        sashay away.            

10
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:24,785
        - I am sick             
    of hearing them say,        

11
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,319
    you can wear shit           
        on stage,               

12
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:27,620
         but it's okay          
     'cause you're Alyssa.      

13
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:28,621
        It was sloppy.          

14
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:30,889
        To me,                  
    she was more concerned      

15
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,792
  about throwing you two under  
 the bus during deliberations.  

16
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:36,561
        - Oh, my God!           

17
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:38,462
      - Trust the Duchess.      

18
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,531
        It ain't over           
        just yet, baby.         

19
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,569
        - Oh, my God!           

20
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:48,137
            - Bitch!            

21
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:49,604
    - What's going on here?     

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,774
- Do you remember when you were 
  in high school on the phone   

23
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,141
    and you were like, girl,    

24
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:56,242
    I can't stand her,          
    she is so fake.             

25
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:57,310
        And then                
    your friend was like,       

26
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,779
    well, Melissa, what         
    do you think about that?    

27
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:00,979
    And they were on three-way. 

28
00:01:01,015 --> 00:01:03,515
    Phi Phi's crack was         
    that three-way phone call   

29
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,849
    in high school cracked.     

30
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:07,985
            (laughs)            

31
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,255
        - (cheering)            
        - Oh, no, no, no!       

32
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:14,190
        - Come on.              

33
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:21,295
        (cheering)              

34
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,097
    - Oh, the two-in-one look.  

35
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:24,465
    - What's up, hookers?       

36
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,535
             - Oh!              
        - Come on, Minj.        

37
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,504
            - Aw!               
            - Whoo!             

38
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,074
            - Oh!               
            - Oh!               

39
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:40,344
    - I'm back, back, back,     
       back, back again.        

40
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,212
        - Oh, my God.           

41
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,781
- So Phi Phi was just running   
off at the mouth about Alyssa,  

42
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,649
      and then all of a sudden, 
            there's Alyssa      

43
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:49,451
    staring dead in her eyes,   
        and it's like...        

44
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:56,057
    - Before we go on, Phi Phi  
    obviously has a lot to say. 

45
00:01:58,461 --> 00:01:59,559
    - I mean, if you want to act
        all foolish             

46
00:01:59,595 --> 00:02:01,060
    in front of the cameras,    
        we could,               

47
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:03,796
     but you said yourself      
 it's not personal, it's drag.  

48
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:04,963
    These are my opinions.      

49
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,098
    - So why couldn't you       
    say that to me, though?     

50
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,299
    - I didn't need to.         
    I was sitting there--       

51
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:08,333
    - You're that girl.         
    I knew you were.            

52
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:09,333
    - You know what?            
    You're looking foolish      

53
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,235
        by sitting there        
    and acting like a child.    

54
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,569
      - So you know what?       

55
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,639
    - So you can do that        
and that'll be cute. I'm done.  

56
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,574
    - Let me just respond       
    to this real quick.         

57
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,577
    I ain't never been nobody   
    to not be 100 to the face.  

58
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:24,078
      I didn't throw you or you 
            under the bus.      

59
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:26,547
     Did I say everything I said
            to you to y'all?    

60
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:27,948
    Did I not over there?       

61
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:29,082
      - You did, you did.       
          - Thank you.          

62
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,416
    - All right. You can play   
    the victim, go ahead.       

63
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,951
    - Being the victim          
    of what, girl?              

64
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,852
I just sat right there and heard
    everything you had to say,  

65
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:37,020
    and you didn't say          
    none of that to me.         

66
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,154
      I was just in the room    
            with you.           

67
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,524
        We grown folk, but okay.

68
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,191
        - I think it's funny    
    that you do want to come in 

69
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:44,960
        and play the victim,    
    because you had no problem  

70
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:46,027
        sending me home         
        last week, girl.        

71
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:47,028
    - Oh, I'm nobody's victim.  

72
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:48,562
        I had no problem        
        sending you home.       

73
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:50,263
    I gave a reasoning          
    why I did, too.             

74
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:53,299
- But I felt like your reasoning
    was bullshit.               

75
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,534
      - I say consistency.      
      It was not personal.      

76
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,336
        - I didn't say          
        it was personal.        

77
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:58,504
            - That was          
      a really tough night,     

78
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,372
      because I was expecting   
            to go home.         

79
00:03:00,407 --> 00:03:02,273
  - Yeah, well, and I wouldn't  
     have let you go home.      

80
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,041
            - What?             

81
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:06,010
         - I feel like          
     you deserved to stay.      

82
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,813
    - Last week, the bottom two 
    were Ginger and Katya.      

83
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:11,248
           So are you           
        basically saying        

84
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:14,751
    you wanted me to choose     
        Katya to go home,       

85
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,951
    and then you would          
    nominate yourself           

86
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,020
    to go home instead of her?  

87
00:03:18,055 --> 00:03:21,790
        I smell a stunt.        

88
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:23,691
    Ginger, she just came off   
        of winning.             

89
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:25,759
    If it was a strategic way,  

90
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:27,394
        I probably              
    would've sent her home.     

91
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,095
            - Okay.             

92
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,697
    - I just think my issue     
    has been standing there     

93
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:34,632
    hearing that I throw        
    people under the bus.       

94
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,232
    That's not me.              
    That's not my gig.          

95
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:37,667
        Never has been.         
        Never will be.          

96
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:38,901
        - I said I felt.        

97
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,335
    Now, if you want            
to sit there and talk shit      

98
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:43,238
about how I'm feeling, then that
just speaks on your character.  

99
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:45,173
    I said I felt, coming       
    from sitting there--        

100
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,475
    - Relax, Phi Phi, relax.    
    Take a deep breath, sweetie.

101
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,842
    - Don't try to play         
    the victim, boo.            

102
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:50,709
    Alyssa's trying to play     
    this little victim card     

103
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,944
    in front of everybody,      
    and I'm not buying that.    

104
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,712
     Girl, you threw people     
         under the bus.         

105
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:56,180
    You're just upset           
    that I called it out        

106
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:59,549
     and you had to hear        
     that I called it out.      

107
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,150
      - Everything I heard      
      and knew about her,       

108
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:02,985
    I'm glad she validated it.  

109
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,286
         - You can say          
       whatever you want,       

110
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:06,220
       but you know what,       
         I played fair.         

111
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,188
    I played who I thought Ru   
        was gonna go home,      

112
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:09,855
        so do not get mad       
        because I said          

113
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:11,423
    that I was gonna play it    
        that way.               

114
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,959
 You choose to do what you want 
   with someone else's words    

115
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,660
    and let them affect you,    

116
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:19,329
        and that's exactly      
    what she's doing right now. 

117
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:21,230
        You can't get upset     
    because you were eliminated 

118
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:26,035
 and someone had their opinions 
   on why you should be gone.   

119
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,337
        - Miss Phi Phi          
    is getting defensive.       

120
00:04:28,372 --> 00:04:29,704
        Here's my thing.        

121
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,438
          I don't mind          
       all the theatrics,       

122
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:34,875
    but if you gonna be loud    
        and rowdy-rowdy         

123
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,710
    and think you're            
    a bawdy-bawdy bitch,        

124
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:39,011
      stand up and be one.      

125
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,847
        But, girl,              
    don't be weak sauce.        

126
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,684
    - It's about to get         
    real interesting.           

127
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:50,188
    - The winner of "RuPaul's   
    Drag Race AllStars"         

128
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,690
    receives a one-year supply  

129
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,258
    of Anastasia Beverly Hills  
        cosmetics,              

130
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,061
        a coveted spot in       
    the Drag Race Hall of Fame, 

131
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,298
        and a cash prize        
        of $100,000.            

132
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,700
         -  Drag Race,         
      may the best woman       

133
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,969
        Best woman win        

134
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:12,107
   - Back to the back, back,    
 back, back, back, back, back.  

135
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:13,408
            I'm here!           

136
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,376
    - Welcome back.             
    - Well, hello to you!       

137
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:18,079
    - So we were the top five,  

138
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:21,582
         and now we are         
      the top nine again.       

139
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:23,182
            We don't know       
      how this is gonna go down.

140
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:24,483
          I don't know          
        what's going on.        

141
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:26,118
     I'm just here to look      
       pretty, that's it.       

142
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,454
    - Hello, hello, hello.      

143
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:33,256
        Oh, my God.             

144
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,490
        Welcome back, strangers.

145
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,224
            - Hey.              

146
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:38,860
            - It's time         
      for the returning queens  

147
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:41,662
    to get their revenge,       

148
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:45,365
    and I can't wait to see     
    who gets the last laugh.    

149
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,599
        - Oh, God.              

150
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:50,502
    - Because for this week's   
    AllStar maxi challenge,     

151
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:53,905
        you'll be doing         
    a stand-up comedy show,     

152
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,874
   and you'll be doing it...    

153
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,041
           in pairs.            

154
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,942
        - Oh, ho, ho, ho.       

155
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:01,710
        - The top two           
        returning queens        

156
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:04,312
    will lip sync for $10,000   

157
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:09,417
    and the power to give       
    one of the bottom queens    

158
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,653
            the chop.           

159
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:14,188
    But most importantly,       

160
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:17,291
    get the right to return     
    to the competition.         

161
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,093
      #RevengeOfTheQueens       

162
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,195
      - I'm good with this.     
            I'm good.           

163
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,531
        - And one other         
      small little detail.      

164
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,801
        Tomorrow,               
    you'll be performing        

165
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:32,435
    in front of a live audience 

166
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,004
        packed with             
    Drag Race Aluminati.        

167
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,672
            - Oh, ho!           

168
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,840
            - You know,         
      the queens you beat out   

169
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,808
        to make it here         
        on "AllStars."          

170
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:43,976
        - Oh, God.              

171
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:46,078
    If we don't get pelted      
    with rotten vegetables,     

172
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:48,080
    they're just gonna be       
    sitting there stone-faced   

173
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,949
    with their eyes crossed,    
    giving us the middle finger.

174
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:53,551
    - Now, the returning queens 

175
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:56,120
        get to pick             
    their comedy partner        

176
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:58,855
        from those              
    still in the competition,   

177
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,326
         starting with          
   the last queen eliminated.   

178
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,693
        Alyssa Edwards.         

179
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:08,063
        - I need a redo,        
        so I pick Alaska.       

180
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:09,063
            - Ooh.              

181
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:10,431
    - Girl, I choose Alaska     

182
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:13,467
    because I have something to 
    prove to her as a partner.  

183
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:14,834
        I'm gonna make it count.

184
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,034
        - Ginger Minj.          

185
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,503
    - I'm gonna pick my BFF,    
        Katya.                  

186
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,406
        - Oh, thank God.        
            (laughs)            

187
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,240
        - Tatianna.             

188
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,310
    - I think I'm gonna go      
        with Detox.             

189
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:29,313
        I picked Detox          
        to be my partner        

190
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,949
      because she's funny,      
          she's dirty,          

191
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,018
      and she's not Phi Phi     
            or Roxxxy.          

192
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,452
            Choices.            

193
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,989
    - And Coco Montrese,        
    who do you choose?          

194
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:42,156
    - I'm gonna go with Phi Phi.

195
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,291
        - Phi Phi.              

196
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,828
        Roxxxy Andrews,         
    since no one picked you,    

197
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:53,267
    you'll be working solo      
    as the emcee of the show.   

198
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:54,700
        And if you win,         

199
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:59,571
    you will have the power     
    to chop a bottom queen      

200
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:04,242
    and decide which one        
    of the eliminated queens    

201
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,643
        gets to return.         

202
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:07,043
        - What shit!            

203
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,945
      - Can we start over?      
            (laughs)            

204
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,814
          - Gentlemen,          
       start your engines       

205
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,651
        and may                 
    the best AllStar win.       

206
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:19,222
        - So we know            
    what my character is.       

207
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:20,956
        I'm Ru's cousin         
       from the projects.       

208
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:23,626
     - I think I'm just gonna do
            my ghetto chola.    

209
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,394
    - Okay, that'll work.       

210
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:27,428
    - I'm not good at writing   
        standup comedy.         

211
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:30,364
But I was thinking, like, maybe 
we could pick apart our flaws.  

212
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,598
    - I'm fine with that.       

213
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,666
    - And we can talk about     
    how I'm no longer orange.   

214
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:35,734
    - Girl, and I went          
    from orange to fudge.       

215
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,303
      - You went from orange    
            to fudge.           

216
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:39,738
            (laughs)            

217
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,274
        - And they think        
      you have many faces,      

218
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,842
      that type of thing.       

219
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:47,243
      - I'm gonna be honest     
            with you.           

220
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,510
    I think it's only one person
        in this room            

221
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:49,677
    that feels that way         
        about me.               

222
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:51,012
          and I think           
        that's bullshit.        

223
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,847
    Like this beef with Alyssa. 

224
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,548
    I didn't come here for that.

225
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:57,917
    I mean, I've worked so hard 

226
00:08:57,952 --> 00:08:59,918
    with how to control things, 

227
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:03,355
and I almost let someone bring  
me back to that unhappy place.  

228
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,522
    - Yeah, but this the thing. 

229
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,591
    Focus on you, 'cause mama   
        got to go to work.      

230
00:09:08,394 --> 00:09:11,560
      I really don't want       
   to get into this conflict    

231
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:13,161
    between Alyssa and Phi Phi  

232
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:15,063
       'cause I'm trying        
    to get back in the game.    

233
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:17,164
        Oh, these girls.        

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,766
            Oh.                 

235
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,468
        - Coming up...          

236
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:22,735
    - I'm so glad that I got    
    to you in time, though.     

237
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,436
    - Girl, in time for what?   

238
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,471
        - Oh.                   
    Mama, did you forget?       

239
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:27,872
    I have the audition today.  

240
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:30,374
        - Time out.             
    You got to make it funny.   

241
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:33,042
        - Bea and I met         
    at our friend Patty's       

242
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,444
     Pooches with Prolapse      
         garden party.          

243
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,578
        (bleep) were out.       

244
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,848
        (RuPaul laughs)         

245
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:44,851
        (RuPaul laughs)         

246
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,553
    - So Ru tells us in our     
    maxi challenge this week,   

247
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,755
    the girl that has been      
    eliminated who wins         

248
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,126
    is going to be sending home 
    somebody who's already here.

249
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,228
       So it's their turn       
     to get their Ru-venge.     

250
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:03,132
    - So the last time          
    we were paired together,    

251
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,935
     you ended up being in      
   the bottom and going home.   

252
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,303
        - You got me.           

253
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:10,104
         - I don't know         
       who sent you home.       

254
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,272
      Whoever did, I will never 
            forgive them.       

255
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,606
        - No, girl.             

256
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:16,175
    Even though Alaska chose me 
    to leave the competition... 

257
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,443
        - Alyssa Edwards.       

258
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:21,313
    - I still have so much      
    mad respect for her,        

259
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,848
  and I feel like the respect   
     is mutual between us.      

260
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:27,185
    - Okay, I think we need     
    to play to your strengths.  

261
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,252
            - Yes.              

262
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:32,022
            - Your strengths    
    are off-the-cuff buffoonery,

263
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:33,023
   responsive, like you're--    
           - (laughs)           

264
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:36,091
        - Yes, exactly.         

265
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,460
         - Let's do it.         
     - For this challenge,      

266
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:41,963
      I really want Alyssa      
      to have the freedom       

267
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:47,836
      to go off on Alyssa       
      Edwardian tangents,       

268
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:49,069
    'cause that's when          
    she's really funny          

269
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:50,904
        and that's when         
        she succeeds.           

270
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:53,740
     - You make an outline,     
  I can go with it on the fly.  

271
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:55,641
    Now, I'm gonna have         
    my cleft notes.             

272
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:57,275
        - Cliff's notes.        

273
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:59,043
      Like the person's name    
            is Cliff.           

274
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:00,110
           - Cliff's?           
       Who told you that?       

275
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:02,946
        - I read them.          
        They're books.          

276
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:06,048
        - Yes, exactly.         

277
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,383
        - (laughs)              

278
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,318
            - Hi.               
            - Hi.               

279
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,451
    - How are you feeling?      

280
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,453
    - Hosting is what I do      
    and I can do my best...     

281
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:14,620
                        - Right.

282
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:15,721
        - On my own.            
        I don't want            

283
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:17,856
    what happened last week,    
    as far as the teams,        

284
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:19,157
        you know,               
    somebody outshining me.     

285
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:20,825
      And I would really love   
            to win this         

286
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,426
  just to prove it to myself.   
            - Yeah.             

287
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:25,262
    - Winning at being pretty   
    in challenge, I get it.     

288
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,462
        That's what I do.       

289
00:11:26,498 --> 00:11:29,799
        Being funny             
    and showing that I've grown 

290
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:30,899
    would mean even more to me. 

291
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,300
    - You know how to           
    fuckin do this shit.        

292
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,301
        - Oh, girl.             

293
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,837
        - Katya and Ginger Minj.

294
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:37,971
             - Hi.              
    - Don't walk that fast.     

295
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,372
        I have asthma.          

296
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,442
 - So today, we have a coaching 
   session with Ross Matthews   

297
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:45,778
    and special guest Chelsea   
    Peretti, who is hilarious.  

298
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:46,812
        I love her.             

299
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:47,812
    - (Russian accent)          
    Good evening, everybody.    

300
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,247
    My name is Ekatarina        
    Petrovisamochkiva.          

301
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:52,482
      I flew here all the way   
            from Russia,        

302
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,818
    and, boy, are my arms       
    covered in track marks.     

303
00:11:55,854 --> 00:11:57,519
        - (laughs)              

304
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:59,454
        - And I flew here       
        in first class,         

305
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:00,654
      because unlike some,      

306
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,457
      I actually made it        
to the top three of season 7.   

307
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,591
    - All right, stop.          
    What is the idea?           

308
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,326
        - So it's like          
        we're friends,          

309
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,061
but I'm like the Russian hooker 
    and she's the--             

310
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,062
    - Southern country belle.   

311
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,330
    We kind of based it         
    on the fact that            

312
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,932
    a lot of fans               
    were saying to her,         

313
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:15,999
      "Why are you friends      
          with Ginger"          

314
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:16,999
        She's a bitch."         

315
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,200
    - You should explain that.  

316
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:19,901
    - Yeah, like people think   
    we wouldn't be friends      

317
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:21,603
        'cause I'm a this       
        and I'm a that.         

318
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:23,604
     So that'll really set      
   the stage of who you are.    

319
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,605
        - As different          
    as those two things can be. 

320
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:27,740
    - As different as           
    those things can be--       

321
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:28,808
        - No, no,               
    I'm just saying like...     

322
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,676
        (all laugh)             

323
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:31,877
    - I am so grateful          

324
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:34,112
        to be going into        
    this challenge with Katya.  

325
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:37,681
      This is just the pairing  
            that I need         

326
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:40,317
    for a successful week       
        for me.                 

327
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:42,653
        - My name               
    is Lydia Ladybits.          

328
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:44,154
    - And I'm Beatrice Backdoor.

329
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:46,088
    - Bea and I met             
    at our friend Patty's       

330
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:49,358
    Pooches with Prolapse       
    garden party last year.     

331
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,992
    - Everyone was wearing      
        pink socks.             

332
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,361
         - Mm-hmm, yes.         
     The assholes were out.     

333
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:56,263
        (laughs) I took         
 the whole family to Key West.  

334
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:58,164
        - Isn't that            
    the gayest place on Earth?  

335
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,099
    - I got to learn a lot      
    about the Key West culture. 

336
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:02,134
          - Like what?          
       - They love AIDS.        

337
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:03,868
        - Wha--wha--what?       

338
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:06,971
    - Lemonades, limeades,      
        orangeades.             

339
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:08,840
        - Hearing aids?         
        - Of course.            

340
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,008
        - Oh, okay.             
        - Maybe.                

341
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,010
         - It's a risk.         
            - It is.            

342
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,544
    There was a lot of crassness
        going on here.          

343
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,245
        - Yeah, I think         
      you should lean into      

344
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,412
    the socialite thing         
    a little bit more.          

345
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,215
        - Because if it's       
    the same note over and over 

346
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,717
        of how can I            
        gross you out...        

347
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,519
        - Okay. Choices.        

348
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,454
        I've got a lot          
        on the line here.       

349
00:13:27,489 --> 00:13:29,622
    I don't want my failure     
        on Snatch Game          

350
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:33,258
    to be my defining moment    
    in this competition.        

351
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:34,827
    So we really have           
    to work this one out.       

352
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:39,164
    - Girl, it's nothin' on,    
    goin' on out here, honey.   

353
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,798
    - I'm so glad that I got    
    to you in time, though.     

354
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,100
    - Girl, in time for what?   

355
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,867
    - Oh, mama, did you forget? 

356
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,068
    I have the audition today.  

357
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,270
    I'm planning on leaving     
    this life behind me.        

358
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:49,738
    - You should let me do      
        your makeup.            

359
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,072
    - You'd do that for me?     

360
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,940
        - Time out.             
        So that's great.        

361
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:54,375
            - Okay.             
 - But you gotta make it funny. 

362
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,843
            - Okay.             

363
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,845
    - Let's just go with it.    
      - I can't go with it      

364
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,380
if I don't know where I'm going.
           Um, okay.            

365
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,215
 - Let's go with the original.  

366
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:05,917
      - Whatever you say.       
            - Okay.             

367
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:07,585
    How's that singing career   
        going?                  

368
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,721
      - (off-key) Mi, mi.       

369
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:15,459
     Jumping from car to car  

370
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:16,560
        - Whoa, whoa.           
    I think I got something.    

371
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:17,827
    - Oh, what's this?          

372
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:21,097
        - It's a key since      
    you can't seem to find one. 

373
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:22,298
             - Oh.              
          - All right.          

374
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,998
        That's good.            
        That's a joke.          

375
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:25,166
          Oh, my God,           
        you need jokes.         

376
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:28,501
    - I'm not Bianca del Rio,   
        you know.               

377
00:14:28,537 --> 00:14:30,570
    This stuff just doesn't     
    come out of my mouth.       

378
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:31,771
    Somebody's gonna be leaving 

379
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:33,572
         and somebody's         
      gonna be returning.       

380
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,774
        There's a lot           
        of pressure now.        

381
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:39,511
            Okay.               

382
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,079
    - I could tell Phi Phi      
    ain't all there right now.  

383
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,547
    And I think that fight      
        with Alyssa             

384
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,882
    is still on Phi Phi's mind. 

385
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,083
        Let it go.              

386
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,686
        - Can we talk?          
        - Mm-hmm.               

387
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:51,820
    - Like, what I said         
        last week,              

388
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,789
    it was just how I was       
    feeling in that moment.     

389
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:55,323
        - The only thing        
    that bothered me is, like,  

390
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:59,994
    I've never been one to like 
    throw people under the bus. 

391
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,096
         When, in fact,         
     people in your season,     

392
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:04,198
 that's exactly what they said  
   you did the whole season.    

393
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:08,001
    - No, actually, if you ask  
    everybody and they admit it,

394
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,102
    even Alaska, that Sharon    
    threw me under the bus.     

395
00:15:10,138 --> 00:15:11,804
     I didn't throw anybody     
         under the bus.         

396
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,271
    - Here's my thing.          

397
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,406
    If someone's gonna own up   
    to being the bitch role,    

398
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,940
    just be unapologetic.       

399
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,207
    - But that's not what       
    my intentions were.         

400
00:15:18,243 --> 00:15:19,208
        - But you were          
        the name-caller.        

401
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:20,375
    You called me a victim.     

402
00:15:20,411 --> 00:15:21,510
            - Okay.             
      Well, from my side,       

403
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,778
    that's what it looked like. 

404
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,846
And you know what, the costume  
    thing, let's be real.       

405
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,714
    Have they not said          
    already before,             

406
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:28,082
        like, it's okay         
        'cause it's you.        

407
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,683
    You can fart on stage and   
    they're just gonna be like, 

408
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:30,884
    oh, it's okay, it's you.    

409
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:33,252
      - But let's be real.      

410
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,453
    We all got different drags. 

411
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:35,653
            Alaska's drag       
      wouldn't look good on me. 

412
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:37,354
    - I'm not saying that,      
        but--                   

413
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,388
        - Your drag             
    wouldn't look good on me.   

414
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:39,989
    - I feel like my words      
    are getting twisted.        

415
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,022
    - No, I didn't--            
    - That's not what I mean.   

416
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:44,359
        - I think Phi Phi       
        is so talented,         

417
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:46,928
      but she is spending       
          so much time          

418
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,762
    second-guessing             
    everything she does.        

419
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,964
     Is it gonna be liked?      
 Is the fans gonna receive it?  

420
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,432
    Is she getting              
    a redemption story?         

421
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,767
    Girl, breathe and let it go,

422
00:15:54,802 --> 00:15:56,868
        because all that matters

423
00:15:56,904 --> 00:16:00,170
        is you just being you   
    and showing your creativity.

424
00:16:00,206 --> 00:16:02,006
        Look,                   
    we can squash it, girl.     

425
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,806
      I love what you do,       
          so I'm like,          

426
00:16:03,842 --> 00:16:06,609
    I don't want to sit there   
        and fight with you.     

427
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:09,311
        - Done.                 
    Now give me a hug.          

428
00:16:09,346 --> 00:16:11,045
            This is stupid      
      and I'm glad it's squashed

429
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,780
        and I'm glad            
    that we were able to find,  

430
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,581
        like, this happy medium.

431
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:17,083
    Like, we can agree          
    to disagree.                

432
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:19,485
        Now get away            
        from my station.        

433
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,619
            (laughs)            

434
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:24,355
    - That was just like Obama  
    hugging Donald Trump.       

435
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:26,991
    Uh-uh. I ain't buying it.   

436
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,225
        - Coming up...          

437
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:30,693
     - This one right here      
         has more fish          

438
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,762
    than an all-you-can-eat     
        seafood buffet.         

439
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:34,529
    - I'm sure you know         
    all about the buffet,       

440
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:38,100
        you know,               
    because you're fat.         

441
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:40,068
        (RuPaul laughs)         

442
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,870
        (RuPaul laughs)         

443
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:50,609
    -  Cover girl, put the bass
        in your walk           

444
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,182
         Cover girl,           
    put the bass in your walk  

445
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,785
          Head to toe,         
   let your whole body talk    

446
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,452
         Cover girl           

447
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,587
            - Whoo!             

448
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:07,256
        (applause)              

449
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,624
    - Welcome to the main stage 

450
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,593
          of "RuPaul's          
      Drag Race AllStars."      

451
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:15,364
And tonight, the whole family   
      is back together.         

452
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,633
        This week,              
    we challenged our AllStars  

453
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:22,770
    to perform standup comedy   
    in front of an audience     

454
00:17:22,805 --> 00:17:27,207
            overflowing         
      with Drag Race royalty.   

455
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:29,576
        And, tonight,           
    the returning queens        

456
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:34,313
have a chance to earn their way 
   back into the competition.   

457
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:37,049
        Gentlemen,              
    start your engines,         

458
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,651
    and may the best woman win. 

459
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:43,154
    (cheers and applause)       

460
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,894
        - Hi, everybody!        

461
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:53,696
       Well, I'm gonna be       
    your hostess and emcee.     

462
00:17:53,732 --> 00:17:55,731
    I'm just gonna start off    
    with saying I'm sorry.      

463
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:59,234
    So how many of y'all        
        saw season 5?           

464
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,469
        Season 5                
    "RuPaul's Drag Race?"       

465
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,272
    (cheer and applause)        
    You saw the roast?          

466
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:04,439
        Yeah, I sucked.         

467
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:05,774
    I sucked more than Michelle 
    Visage at a truck stop      

468
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,876
    with a roll--with a--       
    with a glory hole, right?   

469
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,212
    So listen, I'm here to,     
    you know, just struggling.  

470
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:13,846
Another thing I struggle with   
    is my weight.               

471
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,514
        Anybody struggle        
        with weight?            

472
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:16,748
            - Whoo!             

473
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,416
    - Yeah, girl, I mean,       
    I just don't know           

474
00:18:18,452 --> 00:18:20,218
         how to get rid         
     of those extra pounds.     

475
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:21,485
    And these damn airports.    

476
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,754
    You know, the bags          
    can only be 50 pounds,      

477
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,457
and it costs a lot of money     
to looks this cheap, you know.  

478
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,291
      But I'm so excited.       

479
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,392
    Are y'all ready             
    for some real comedy?       

480
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,260
        - Yeah!                 
    (cheers and applause)       

481
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:35,895
    - 'Cause I'm dying up here, 
    ladies and gentlemen.       

482
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:37,930
    Now, I'm not the funniest.  

483
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:40,232
        (all laugh)             

484
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,099
    - You killed that one, sis. 

485
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:45,136
     - First up out of the gate,
            besides myself,     

486
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:46,537
      is these two girls.       

487
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:49,272
  One thing that they do love   
      is the color orange.      

488
00:18:49,307 --> 00:18:53,576
         Coco Montrese          
      and Phi Phi O'Hara!       

489
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,244
    (cheers and applause)       

490
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,479
      - Whoo. Hey, daddy.       

491
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:02,516
     - Oh, my God, coquita!     
         There you are!         

492
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:05,318
    How's everything out here   
    on the strip tonight?       

493
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,619
    - Oh, girl, it ain't goin'  
        too good, honey.        

494
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,822
    The last John I sat on,     
    whoo, I had Mexican food.   

495
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,924
      It wasn't that good.      

496
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,124
        - Oh, man,              
    I'm so sorry to hear that.  

497
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,992
   But I have a little favor    
         to ask of you.         

498
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,058
    - What you want, girl?      

499
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:18,293
    - Think you could do        
        my makeup?              

500
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:19,593
        - Sit down.             
    I got my good stuff.        

501
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:21,095
        - Oh, my God,           
        I'm so excited.         

502
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,396
You know, every time I'm on like
your social medias and stuff... 

503
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:24,464
            - Mm-hmm.           

504
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,232
      - I'm always looking      
        at your pictures        

505
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,600
    and I'm like, oh, my God,   
        no filters.             

506
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:29,968
            - Mm-hmm.           

507
00:19:30,004 --> 00:19:32,304
    - Okay, well, first tell me,
    what is the first step      

508
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,373
    in this, you know,          
    coquita makeup tutorial?    

509
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,941
- First, you gotta take that bag
    of cheesy chips, girl.      

510
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,342
        - Okay, okay.           

511
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,110
    - Crush it up real good.    

512
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,778
        - Okay, okay.           

513
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:47,081
- Then you gotta--you--you gotta
just take it and beat that face.

514
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,882
    I mean, girl,               
    you got to beat it.         

515
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:51,184
        Beat it                 
    like you stole something.   

516
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,486
    Girl, what's this audition  
        for anyway?             

517
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:55,354
      - Oh, well, I'm gonna be  
            an actress.         

518
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,522
    - Girl, I hope it's not     
        a musical.              

519
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:00,625
    You know, any instrument    
    you play, you gotta blow.   

520
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,226
    - Oh, that's not true, mama.

521
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,994
        I've been writing       
        a lot of stuff.         

522
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,663
           (off-key)            
        Jump in a car         

523
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:08,164
         And jump out         

524
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,867
     The cops will come and put
    their hands on the hood    

525
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:13,202
    - Oh, oh, oh, girl,         
    hold on, hold on.           

526
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:14,269
        Hold on, girl.          
    I got something for you.    

527
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:15,903
    - What's this?              
    - I got you a key.          

528
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,137
            - A key?            

529
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:20,707
    - 'Cause you can't seem     
       to find one, girl.       

530
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:24,743
   - Coco and Phi Phi are not   
so much doing a comedy routine, 

531
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,514
        but a live-action       
    off, off, off, off Broadway 

532
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,849
    theater production          
    of Hookers at the Point.    

533
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:32,383
        - Coming up...          

534
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:35,285
       - Alyssa, describe       
  Michelle Visage in one word.  

535
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:36,619
            Go.                 

536
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:38,820
            - Beast!            

537
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:42,190
            (silence)           

538
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:44,158
         (RuPaul laughs)        

539
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,061
        (RuPaul laughs)         

540
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,528
        - Hey there.            

541
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:53,631
    What seems to be going on?  

542
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:54,932
        - (laughs)              

543
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,766
        - So Roxxxy             
    was bombing up here,        

544
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:57,767
    so yeah, she asked me       
        to come                 

545
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,067
    and finish the show for her.

546
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,802
    You don't want to see       
    any more of her, right?     

547
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:02,704
    My name is Tosha Salad.     

548
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,972
        I was on Season 5       
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."    

549
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:08,042
            Do you remember?    
     I am so excited to be here.

550
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,944
            I just got off      
      the best Italian vacation.

551
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,780
     I was over in the beautiful
            Thousand Island     

552
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,849
     on a beautiful ranch.      

553
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,583
      And let me tell you,      

554
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:19,685
    I flew in just to try       
    and save her ass.           

555
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:21,287
         Are you ready          
     for some more comedy?      

556
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,189
 Are you ready? Are you ready?  
         Are you ready?         

557
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:24,590
    Ladies and gentleman,       

558
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,927
     she is the blue cheese     
  to the other one's crumbles.  

559
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:28,960
        Make some noise.        

560
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:33,097
     This is Alyssa Edwards     
          and Alaska!           

561
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:37,868
    (cheers and applause)       

562
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:40,604
      - My name is Alaska,      
      just like the state.      

563
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:42,272
    - My name is Alyssa Edwards,

564
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:48,111
    and this definitely         
    ain't nobody's secret       

565
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:51,580
    that this gigarama          
    is completely full          

566
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:58,653
     of buffoonery, wiggery     
  and straight-up tomfoolery.   

567
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,755
        (laughter)              

568
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,057
        - Totally.              

569
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:04,692
        (laughter)              

570
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:09,596
Alyssa, we're in the company    
of some amazing queens tonight. 

571
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:10,964
                        - Where?

572
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:13,933
           (laughter)           

573
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:17,036
            - Ouch.             

574
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:19,638
    Detox and Tatianna are here.

575
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,574
     - The Hills Have Eyes,     
       part 2, the remix.       

576
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,511
            - Bam.              

577
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:34,451
Alyssa, describe Michelle Visage
    in one word. Go.            

578
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,953
            - Beast.            

579
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,622
           (laughter)           

580
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,259
            - Burn.             

581
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:48,596
        (laughter)              

582
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:50,630
    Alyssa, I want to thank you 
        so much                 

583
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:51,998
        for being               
    my partner tonight.         

584
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:54,834
        Don't worry.            
    If drag doesn't work out,   

585
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:58,004
       you'll always have       
   something to fall back on.   

586
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,238
        Your back rolls.        

587
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:01,974
    (cheers and applause)       

588
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:08,112
- These next two girls, let me  
tell you, they are so nutty.    

589
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,913
      Besides Wal-marts--       
      walnuts and almonds,      

590
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,848
    these are my favorite nuts, 
    ladies and gentlemen.       

591
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:16,953
    Make some noise. This is    
    Ginger Minj and Katya.      

592
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:19,588
    (cheers and applause )      

593
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:22,257
            - Hello.            

594
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,624
    It's not the first time     
        she's gotten clap       

595
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:26,292
    from a room full of people. 

596
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:28,561
        Well, hey, y'all,       
        how are you?            

597
00:23:28,596 --> 00:23:30,596
    You know, I'm so excited    
       to be here tonight       

598
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:34,700
    sharing this stage          
    with my BFF Katya.          

599
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:35,867
    (cheers and applause )      

600
00:23:35,903 --> 00:23:37,802
    Now, I know most of you     
    might be sitting out there  

601
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:41,038
    asking yourself, self--     
    that's what you say.        

602
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:45,074
    You say, self, now how does 
        a delicate, petite,     

603
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,509
    little cross-dresser        
        for Christ              

604
00:23:46,544 --> 00:23:48,010
      become best friends       

605
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:52,013
    with a disease-riddled,     
    low-rent Russian whore?     

606
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:55,316
    - You see, I spend most     
    of my time on my back,      

607
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:58,052
    while she tries to find     
    someone to shave hers.      

608
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,288
        - It's funny            
        'cause it's true.       

609
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:03,856
        Seriously,              
    this one right here         

610
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,426
    has more fish than an       
all-you-can-eat seafood buffet. 

611
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,660
    - That's funny, Ginger.     

612
00:24:08,696 --> 00:24:10,662
    I'm sure you know all about 
    the buffet, you know,       

613
00:24:10,697 --> 00:24:13,130
      because you're fat.       

614
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,331
        - Shut up!              

615
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:17,534
    I will turn you into        
immigration, Balki, all right?  

616
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:20,536
    - But through it all,       
    we have plunged head first  

617
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:22,370
      into the most beautiful   
            friendship,         

618
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:24,706
        and we have never       
        looked back.            

619
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,340
        Mostly because          
    she doesn't have a neck     

620
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,041
    and she can't really        
    turn her head.              

621
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:29,743
    Thank you all so much.      
        Good night.             

622
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:30,843
    - No, bitch, get back here. 

623
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:32,712
         I got asthma,          
     but I will catch you!      

624
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:37,615
- Ladies and gentlemen, do I    
look a little slimmer to you,   

625
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,382
    like I lost some weight?    

626
00:24:39,418 --> 00:24:40,850
    Do you want to know         
        my secret?              

627
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:43,752
        I started using         
        light dressing.         

628
00:24:43,787 --> 00:24:44,920
            Get it?             

629
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:46,954
    - We got it, girl.          

630
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,422
        We got it.              

631
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:51,224
    - Okay. Next up, well,      
    one of these girls,         

632
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,528
    she is so fishy, she is     
the sardines in Caesar dressing.

633
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:59,431
     The other girl prefers     
  uncut carrots in her salad.   

634
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:03,035
        Make some noise.        
  This is Detox and Tatianna!   

635
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,469
    (cheers and applause)       

636
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,271
        - Well, hey, hey.       

637
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:07,871
        - Hello, hello.         

638
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,440
    My name is Lady Ladybits.   

639
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,907
    - And I'm Beatrice Backdoor.

640
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:15,344
Thank y'all so much for coming  
    to tonight's event.         

641
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:18,079
   It's a benefit for babies    
       battling bulimia.        

642
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:21,048
      - And I already see       
         there's a bevy         

643
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,649
    of beautiful bitter bitches 

644
00:25:22,684 --> 00:25:24,517
        already here            
    hitting the buffet.         

645
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:26,285
    Bea and I met last year     

646
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:29,388
        at Patty's Pooches      
    with Prolapse Garden Party. 

647
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:30,656
            We did.             

648
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:32,590
         - The rosebuds         
      were in full bloom.       

649
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:35,893
    - We were out, literally.   

650
00:25:35,928 --> 00:25:38,495
    Especially this one's date. 

651
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,830
    - Date? I came alone.       

652
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:43,832
        - You came with         
      Carlos the gardener.      

653
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:46,134
            - When?             
         - Well, what?          

654
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,236
        You were blowing        
     saliva water balloons.     

655
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:51,704
    I know you guys are here    

656
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,473
        giving your time        
        and your money          

657
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:56,041
    to this lovely benefit for  
    teeny tiny, teeny tiny tots.

658
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:57,876
    But I just want to know     
    when you're gonna have      

659
00:25:57,912 --> 00:25:59,844
    some teeny, tiny tots       
    of your own there, Bea.     

660
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,246
    - I've always wanted some.  

661
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:03,314
    My doctor keeps telling me  
        that my testi--         

662
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,751
        that my ovaries         
  are just getting in the way.  

663
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:09,821
    You know, I've always wanted
    to tell you something.      

664
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:12,389
There's a secret behind the     
woman that you see here today.  

665
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:14,591
    - Oh, no, is there really?  

666
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:15,925
    - Oh, this is hard for me.  

667
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:17,126
       - It's okay, dear,       
          spit it out.          

668
00:26:17,162 --> 00:26:18,394
         No matter what         
    you're about to tell me,    

669
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,964
you will always be in my eyes   
    by best girlfriend.         

670
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:25,433
    - You see... (lower voice)  
    I used to have braces.      

671
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:27,635
        - Oh! Bea!              

672
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,437
    You are incorrigible, Bea.  

673
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:32,673
      We'll see you next year.  
            Oh, ho, no!         

674
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:35,309
That Sally Field, that cunt     
lied to me about the Boniva.    

675
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,643
    - Come on, Boniva.          

676
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,244
    (cheers and applause)       

677
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,944
    - Ladies and gentleman,     
    did you all enjoy the show? 

678
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,146
            Say yeah.           
            - Yeah!             

679
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:44,180
    - We want to thank you guys 
    for coming out tonight.     

680
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:45,814
    And if you can't laugh      
        at yourself,            

681
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,749
    how in the hell are you     
 gonna laugh at somebody else?  

682
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:49,016
    Can I get an amen?          

683
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:50,016
            - Amen!             
            - Amen!             

684
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:51,617
        - Thank you. Good night.

685
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,619
        - Coming up...          

686
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,386
    - Your punchlines were there
    and you delivered them.     

687
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:56,887
    - I didn't want it to end.  

688
00:26:56,923 --> 00:26:59,390
        - It was work.          

689
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,358
        (RuPaul laughs)         

690
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:05,128
        (RuPaul laughs)         

691
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,995
      - Welcome, AllStars.      

692
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:09,730
         It's time for          
     the judges' critiques      

693
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:13,534
        starting with           
        Roxxxy Andrews.         

694
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:16,436
    - During the show, I thought
    your entrance was strong    

695
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,304
and then it was like someone    
took the needle off the record. 

696
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,339
    - With a roll--with a--     
    with a glory hole, right?   

697
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:22,741
    - And some of the jokes     
       just didn't land.        

698
00:27:22,777 --> 00:27:25,210
  - Then you enlisted the help  
        of Tosha Salad,         

699
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:26,378
        which you get kudos for,

700
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:28,246
      but you were the only one 
            who was solo.       

701
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:31,115
    You really could've stolen  
    the show from everybody.    

702
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:35,185
    - Up next, Coco Montrese    
      and Phi Phi O'Hara.       

703
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,487
     - Coco, I think your makeup
            looks fantastic.    

704
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,623
- And Phi Phi, I'd turn up for  
anybody with a Shanaynay nail.  

705
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,290
        (all laugh)             

706
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:45,660
        - I will say you had    
    some funny jokes in there,  

707
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:48,128
    but for me, it turned into, 
        like, a scene study     

708
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:50,530
            instead of          
        a comedy routine.       

709
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:52,198
    - Yeah, we wanted to go     
    a different route,          

710
00:27:52,233 --> 00:27:54,999
like that "SNL" skit type of    
thing instead of just standup.  

711
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:57,001
        - I get it,             
    but it turned into          

712
00:27:57,036 --> 00:27:59,036
            more of like        
      an Afterschool Special.   

713
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:00,670
        - Hmm, okay.            

714
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:04,573
    - Up next, Alyssa Edwards   
        and Alaska.             

715
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:06,074
    - I thought the two of you  

716
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:08,143
    probably worked together    
    the best as a team.         

717
00:28:08,178 --> 00:28:10,445
    Alyssa, you are comedy gold.

718
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,781
    All you have to do is go... 
        and purse your lips     

719
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:14,782
      and I'm entertained.      

720
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:16,550
    - And Alaska, smartly,      

721
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:19,119
    I think you didn't let      
    Alyssa steal the show.      

722
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:20,253
    You know, you had me trained

723
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:22,688
      to look back to you       
        for that zinger.        

724
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,790
    I mean, this is a show      
    I would've paid to see.     

725
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:27,559
      - Up next, Ginger Minj    
            and Katya.          

726
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:30,995
    - I liked your relationship 
        as partners.            

727
00:28:31,031 --> 00:28:32,296
    You had some good zingers.  

728
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:33,296
        - But I think           
    you were so focused         

729
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:34,464
    on the competition          
        part of it,             

730
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,566
    I wish I would've seen      
    a little more joy.          

731
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:38,667
      Just...it was work.       

732
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:42,004
    - Katya, this jacket        
    is giving me everything     

733
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:44,005
    that I could possibly need  
        from 1983.              

734
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,207
    - It's giving me shingles.  
        (all laugh)             

735
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:48,508
 - But there's no relationship  
    between the two of you.     

736
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:51,143
    Even if there would've been 
    one piece of teal on Katya  

737
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,111
      or one piece of black     
            on Ginger,          

738
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:55,112
    something to sort of say,   
    like, hey, we're a team.    

739
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:58,148
        - Up next,              
    Tatianna and Detox.         

740
00:28:58,184 --> 00:28:59,416
    - I would like to start     
        by saying               

741
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,185
     you made my face hurt      
   from laughing and smiling,   

742
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,453
    and that is a feat          

743
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:05,855
    because I haven't felt      
anything on my face in years.   

744
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,292
Tatianna, you gave us that ditzy
    Stepford Wife fundraiser,   

745
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:11,526
        which I loved.          

746
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:14,261
    - And De, the character     
    of Lydia is so funny        

747
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:15,930
    and you had so many jokes,  

748
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,230
         but you almost         
       couldn't hear them       

749
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:18,931
     because of the accent      
      you were putting on.      

750
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,566
    - But your punchlines       
        were there.             

751
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:22,500
       You believed them        
    and you delivered them.     

752
00:29:22,536 --> 00:29:24,936
        - The material,         
  the delivery, the wardrobe,   

753
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,737
    I didn't want it to end.    

754
00:29:26,773 --> 00:29:28,272
        - Thank you.            
        - Thank you.            

755
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:30,440
      - Thank you, ladies.      
  I think we've heard enough.   

756
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:34,878
 Based on the judges critiques, 
   I've made some decisions.    

757
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:39,782
   Alyssa Edwards and Alaska,   

758
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:42,417
      Tatianna and Detox,       

759
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:46,220
    you are the top AllStars    
          of the week.          

760
00:29:46,256 --> 00:29:47,688
        (applause)              

761
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:52,393
You've each won a couture gown  
      from S&L Designs,         

762
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:56,764
    designed by Sasha Lauren    
        valued at $2,000.       

763
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:02,101
      Katya, you are safe.      

764
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:08,906
   That means Roxxxy Andrews    
      and Phi Phi O'Hara,       

765
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:12,610
    you are the bottom two      
        of the week.            

766
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,948
  Ginger Minj, Coco Montrese,   

767
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,084
       I'm afraid we must       
    say goodbye once again.     

768
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,985
        - When it hits me       

769
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,523
that I do not get to come back  
to the competition, it hurts.   

770
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,925
      It's not an easy pill     
            to swallow          

771
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,294
    to be told thanks,          
    you did a great job.        

772
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:34,829
    Now go home again.          

773
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:40,001
    - Alyssa and Tatianna,      
    as the returning queens,    

774
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:42,370
    you'll lip sync for $10,000,

775
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:46,073
    the power to eliminate      
    one of the bottom queens,   

776
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:49,176
    and the right to return     
    to the competition.         

777
00:30:50,545 --> 00:30:55,181
        So while you queens     
    deliberate in the workroom, 

778
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:58,817
        the judges and I        
    will do some scrapbooking.  

779
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:00,351
    Thank you, ladies.          

780
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:02,553
    You may leave the stage.    

781
00:31:04,856 --> 00:31:07,556
    - So, girl, why don't you   
    go ahead and sell yourself. 

782
00:31:07,592 --> 00:31:09,124
        - I don't want          
        to sell myself.         

783
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,325
        I really respect        
        the both of you,        

784
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,094
    and if you win the lip sync,
    choose how you feel fit.    

785
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:15,462
And if you win the lip sync,    
choose how you feel fit.        

786
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,297
    - Yeah. You'd rather have   
    your work speak for you.    

787
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,966
    - I respect that.           
I'm just saying, I'm gonna beg. 

788
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:22,969
   I am not too proud to beg    
         for $100,000.          

789
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:23,969
    I'm not that girl.          

790
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:25,170
            - Okay.             
      Well, you know what?      

791
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:26,972
       The girl that I am       
   is not gonna beg somebody.   

792
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:31,708
    - I don't really get        
    why explaining to someone   

793
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:33,476
      why you should stay       
      in this competition       

794
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:35,578
    would be considered begging.

795
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:37,812
    You gotta let a bitch       
    know why you should stay.   

796
00:31:37,848 --> 00:31:39,981
    That's completely ego       
        talking.                

797
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:41,648
       - Everybody knows,       
           obviously,           

798
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:43,784
I'll say whatever the fuck      
    I want to say.              

799
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:44,851
        - You do, yeah.         

800
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:46,486
    - And my real feelings      
        is I don't--            

801
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:47,620
    I don't feel I need to beg. 

802
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:49,887
      - I'm gonna be honest     
            with you.           

803
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:51,554
    To me, if I was a fan,      
    you know what I would say?  

804
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,323
        Is she fuckin           
        in it to win it?        

805
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:54,724
        - If that's what        
    you're questioning, bitch,  

806
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,958
    I want to be here.          

807
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,959
    I don't feel I need         
    to kiss anybody's butt      

808
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:00,193
        to stay here because    
    if you look me in the eyes, 

809
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:01,227
    you would see that I have   

810
00:32:01,263 --> 00:32:04,696
        fire and passion        
     for this competition.      

811
00:32:04,732 --> 00:32:05,831
    - I want to tell you,       
        though,                 

812
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:08,000
    I know last week we were    
    heated with each other.     

813
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:09,301
            - Yeah.             
   - I celebrate what you do.   

814
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:10,502
        - Thank you.            

815
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,369
    - And I wish you luck, girl.
    May the best woman win.     

816
00:32:12,405 --> 00:32:14,437
            - True.             
- Like Ru said, you know, no T. 

817
00:32:14,472 --> 00:32:16,039
            - Okay.             

818
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:17,607
    - I'm not holding a grudge  
        against Phi Phi         

819
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:18,741
    when I'm deliberating.      

820
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:21,009
    I'm definitely gonna take   
        into consideration      

821
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:23,011
     the consistency level,     
         the critiques,         

822
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:24,679
        and how well            
    they sell theirself to me.  

823
00:32:24,714 --> 00:32:26,614
    Girl, I'm gonna keep it real
        with you.               

824
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:30,150
Last night, when I walked from  
that door to get that trophy,   

825
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:31,451
    I didn't come here          
    for that trophy.            

826
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:32,919
    You didn't either.          

827
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:39,291
        Roxxxy, girl,           
    you can set over there      

828
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,525
    and own that to this group. 

829
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:44,296
    Just let's all stand up     
        and fight for it        

830
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,630
    and say, I want to be here. 

831
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:46,931
            - I do.             

832
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,899
    - Do you want to be here,   
    Roxxxy, in the top three?   

833
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,568
- More than anything I can ever 
   explain to you right now.    

834
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:53,103
        - Then I'm gonna        
     keep it real with you.     

835
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,137
    You had the hardest job.    

836
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,438
    You didn't even have        
    a second opinion            

837
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,306
   to ask is this a good act.   

838
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:00,575
        Here's the thing.       

839
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,842
        They've both            
    been in the bottom.         

840
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:03,076
        They've both won.       

841
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,811
       Roxxxy's also won        
     one of the lip syncs.      

842
00:33:05,847 --> 00:33:07,812
    It's hard making            
    this deliberation.          

843
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:09,814
    I have a connection         
    with both these two gals,   

844
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:11,849
        and we've shared        
        this experience.        

845
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:13,917
    We've traveled together,    
    we've performed together.   

846
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:16,586
    But I understand            
    the responsibility          

847
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:17,954
      of this competition.      

848
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,323
      - So how's it going?      

849
00:33:21,358 --> 00:33:23,091
    How are you feeling?        
    - You know what?            

850
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,793
    Alyssa and I had a talk,    

851
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:26,293
        and she was like,       
    do you want to be here?     

852
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:27,461
    And I was like, yes,        
        of course.              

853
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:28,862
    Obviously I fuckin          
    want to be here.            

854
00:33:28,897 --> 00:33:30,329
    At the same time, like,     
    I don't want to beg.        

855
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:32,497
I was only in the bottom once,  
    and every week,             

856
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:34,066
    I've been getting better    
    and better and better       

857
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,166
      and I won last week.      

858
00:33:35,202 --> 00:33:37,402
        I think, honestly,      
    I fuckin killed it tonight. 

859
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:38,903
    So I was like, all right,   
        we did it.              

860
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,537
            - Yeah.             

861
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:41,637
        - Well, I'm glad        
    you're in the top again.    

862
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:42,638
            You guys            
      were funny up there.      

863
00:33:42,673 --> 00:33:44,106
    I was worried about         
    the Detox thing.            

864
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,173
    I'm gonna be honest         
        with you.               

865
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,174
    It was really hard to hear  

866
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:49,008
    what Detox was saying       
    with the accent.            

867
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,244
    - Well, what are you        
    trying to do there, girl?   

868
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,845
      It was really good,       

869
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,981
but, like, you couldn't hear    
anything that Detox was saying. 

870
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,650
    But she told Detox          
    you were funny,             

871
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,752
          but Tatianna          
       wasn't very funny.       

872
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:02,286
        Ooh, bitch.             

873
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:05,455
       Phi Phi is playing       
  a little motherfucking game.  

874
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:06,522
    - You better be changing.   

875
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:07,522
         - Oh, I will.          
            - Yeah.             

876
00:34:07,558 --> 00:34:09,190
      - Trust and believe.      
            - Do it.            

877
00:34:09,226 --> 00:34:11,692
    - Hey, I totally enjoy      
        Phi Phi.                

878
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:14,228
        She's become            
    a really good friend.       

879
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:17,531
But if you're gonna play a game,
      girl, play it right.      

880
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:20,999
    - These pinking shears      
        are amazing.            

881
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:22,434
        - Oh, my God,           
        that's gorgeous.        

882
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,004
      - Does anybody have       
      another furry ball?       

883
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,538
    - Not one that I can detach.

884
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:28,972
            - Eew.              

885
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:30,274
        - Silence!              

886
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:32,543
      Bring back my girls.      

887
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:38,715
        - I'm real close        
        to just pulling         

888
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,917
    an eeny, meeny, miney, moe, 
    to be honest with you.      

889
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:48,424
    It really ended up being    
a neck and neck decision for me.

890
00:34:52,162 --> 00:34:54,095
    - I done weighed it all out 

891
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,363
    and I know the decision     
        I'm gonna make          

892
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,231
    and I'm gonna say bye.      

893
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:03,536
        (RuPaul laughs)         

894
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,206
        (RuPaul laughs)         

895
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,043
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

896
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,712
        Two top AllStars        
        stand before me.        

897
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:22,984
    Ladies, this is your chance 
    to impress me, win $10,000, 

898
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:29,190
    and the power to give one of
    the bottom queens the chop. 

899
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:34,527
    But most importantly,       
the winner will earn the right  

900
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:37,697
        to return               
    to the competition.         

901
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,999
    The time has come           

902
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:45,036
      for you to not only       
   lip sync for your legacy,    

903
00:35:45,072 --> 00:35:52,310
    but to lip sync for your    
        (echoing) life.         

904
00:35:52,345 --> 00:35:54,579
        God, I love saying that.

905
00:35:55,814 --> 00:36:00,683
        Good luck               
    and don't fuck it up.       

906
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:05,187
    -  I've been looking for   
    a driver who's qualified   

907
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:07,022
     So if you think           
    that you're the one        

908
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:09,191
     Step into my ride        

909
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:12,627
        I'm a fine-tuned       
   supersonic speed machine    

910
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:16,464
     With a sunroof top        
    and a gangster lean        

911
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:20,501
     My engine's ready         
to explode, explode, explode   

912
00:36:20,536 --> 00:36:23,804
     So start me up            
and watch me go, go, go, go    

913
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,638
         Get you where         
        you wanna go           

914
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,106
     If you know what I mean  

915
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:30,576
     Got a ride that's smoother
        than a limousine       

916
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:32,778
         Can you handle        
        the curves?            

917
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,413
          Can you run          
         all the lights?       

918
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:37,782
     If you can, baby boy,     
    then we can go all night   

919
00:36:37,818 --> 00:36:41,552
     'Cause I'm zero to 60     
        in 3.5                 

920
00:36:41,587 --> 00:36:44,221
     Baby, you got the keys   

921
00:36:44,256 --> 00:36:48,358
     Now shut up and drive,    
    drive, drive, drive        

922
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:50,426
             'Cause            
      you play that game       

923
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:52,027
     Got what I got           

924
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:55,697
     Baby, don't stop,         
    it's a sure shot           

925
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:59,300
             So step inside    
    and ride, ride, ride, ride 

926
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:00,834
     Ride, ride, ride, ride   

927
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:02,869
      Ride, ride, ride, ride  

928
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:05,138
     Ride, ride, ride, ride,   
        ride, ride             

929
00:37:05,174 --> 00:37:08,842
         So start me up        
 and watch me go, go, go, go   

930
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:10,510
         Get you where         
        you wanna go           

931
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:11,844
     If you know what I mean  

932
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,581
     Got a ride that's smoother
        than a limousine       

933
00:37:15,617 --> 00:37:19,485
     'Cause I'm zero to 60     
        in 3.5                 

934
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,521
     Baby, you got the keys   

935
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,924
     Now shut up and drive,    
    drive, drive, drive        

936
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:29,994
      Shut up and drive,       
     drive, drive, drive       

937
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,297
     Shut up and drive,        
    drive, drive, drive        

938
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:38,968
        (applause)              

939
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:45,607
            - Ladies,           
      I've made my decision.    

940
00:37:47,576 --> 00:37:50,077
        Tatianna...             

941
00:37:50,112 --> 00:37:51,845
    you're a winner, baby.      

942
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,815
    - All those good feelings.  
    I'm feeling all of those.   

943
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:10,427
        - And Alyssa Edwards,   
    you are also a winner, baby.

944
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:14,830
            - What?             

945
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:18,132
      - Con-drag-ulations.      

946
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,866
    You are both back           
    in the competition.         

947
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:21,701
        - Oh, my God.           

948
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:22,801
            - What?             
            - Yes.              

949
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:27,039
     - I'm giving you each      
        a tip of $5,000.        

950
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,573
        - Thank you.            

951
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:31,209
        - And you both          
        earned the power        

952
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:36,348
        to eliminate            
    one of the bottom two.      

953
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:39,951
    - So you mean to tell me    

954
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:42,019
        if one of them's        
        got my lipstick         

955
00:38:42,054 --> 00:38:44,388
        and one of them's       
        got Phi Phi's,          

956
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,756
    we're both going home?      

957
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:48,958
            Ooh.                

958
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:53,229
        - With great power      
    comes great responsibility. 

959
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:59,202
    Alyssa, which queen have    
    you chosen to get the chop? 

960
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:04,774
- I think you're both great     
entertainers and competitors.   

961
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,309
      However, tonight...       

962
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,445
        I chose                 
    Phi Phi O'Hara to go home.  

963
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:14,514
        - Tatianna.             

964
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,184
- This was a really difficult   
      decision to make,         

965
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,988
    but with that said,         
    I went with...              

966
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:25,991
        Phi Phi O'Hara.         

967
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:29,961
      - As it is written,       
      so it shall be done.      

968
00:39:29,996 --> 00:39:33,397
        Phi Phi O'Hara,         
      you are an AllStar.       

969
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:36,968
       Now...sashay away.       

970
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,069
        - I love you.           

971
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:42,604
    - Fuck them bitches up.     
        (laughs)                

972
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,207
        Thank you.              

973
00:39:45,242 --> 00:39:46,508
    - That's okay. No.          

974
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:49,244
        Bye. Love you.          

975
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:52,213
        Mwah, mwah.             

976
00:39:52,248 --> 00:39:53,781
            Mwah.               

977
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,350
    Yes. Yeah, of course, yeah. 

978
00:39:58,385 --> 00:40:00,084
        - Phi Phi,              
    I tried to hug you, though. 

979
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,553
     - You know what, it's      
 always okay to make mistakes,  

980
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:04,387
    and just know that you      
    can always grow from them.  

981
00:40:04,423 --> 00:40:06,889
      It's never the end.       
   You can always start over.   

982
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:08,157
        Love you all.           

983
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,258
        Phi Phi O'Hara,         
         jump in a car        

984
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:13,294
        (all laugh)             

985
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:18,732
     Honestly, I don't feel     
  I deserve to be eliminated.   

986
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,400
    Tatianna's decision, eh.    

987
00:40:20,436 --> 00:40:22,969
    She hasn't been here, so it 
    doesn't really surprise me. 

988
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,470
    But, Alyssa, yeah.          

989
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,705
        I mean,                 
    it's kind of hypocritical.  

990
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,407
    She always tells people     
    it's about consistency,     

991
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:29,841
    and then you're             
    gonna get rid of me         

992
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:30,842
      when I've only been       
      in the bottom once,       

993
00:40:30,877 --> 00:40:31,842
      Roxxxy, three times.      

994
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:32,943
    But you know what,          
    let's be real.              

995
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:34,243
      I fucking killed it.      

996
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:35,244
        Do I get this?          

997
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,244
        Like, could I           
    at least sell this thing    

998
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,780
      for, like, $10,000?       
            (scoffs)            

999
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:45,252
    - Con-drag-ulations,        
        AllStars.               

1000
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:47,720
        Now, remember,          
    if you can't love yourself, 

1001
00:40:47,756 --> 00:40:50,289
    how in the hell             
you gonna love somebody else?   

1002
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:51,690
    Can I get an amen in here?  

1003
00:40:51,725 --> 00:40:52,690
            - Amen!             
            - Amen!             

1004
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:53,724
                         - Amen!

1005
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,860
    - Now let the music play.   

1006
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:57,961
    -  Throw your hands up    

1007
00:40:57,996 --> 00:40:59,595
       Time to get down       

1008
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,397
      Time to get down        

1009
00:41:01,432 --> 00:41:03,798
     Down, down, down, down   

1010
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:05,433
     Throw your hands up
