1
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,768
          - Previously          
        on "AllStars..."        

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,204
    Transform your loved one    

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:10,540
         into a member          
   of your royal drag family.   

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,008
          (all laugh)           

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,843
             Katya.             
  - You're giving us something  

6
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:16,344
    like they would wear in     
   Real Housewives of Minsk.    

7
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:18,079
            - Detox.            

8
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:19,880
        - The strongest         
      family resemblance.       

9
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:21,881
   I mean, it's unbelievable.   

10
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:23,048
           - Alaska.            

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,816
         - I think this         
    was a bit lazy tonight.     

12
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:26,618
         I expect more.         

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,887
 - I fucked up this week, man.  
          I fucked up.          

14
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:33,023
       It fucking really        
      fucking sucks a lot.      

15
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,292
            - Detox,            
     you're a winner, baby.     

16
00:00:37,294 --> 00:00:38,794
           (applause)           

17
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:40,128
             - Yay.             

18
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,865
     - Which queen have you     
    chosen to get the chop?     

19
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,200
       - I chose Alyssa.        
           I'm sorry.           

20
00:00:47,202 --> 00:00:48,901
     I can't send him home.     

21
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:52,739
       - Alyssa Edwards,        
          sashay away.          

22
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,082
           - (sighs)            

23
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,950
            - Girl.             

24
00:01:05,952 --> 00:01:08,653
        "I love you all         
      always and forever."      

25
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,755
    - I can't believe Alyssa    
           went home.           

26
00:01:11,757 --> 00:01:14,890
    - She to me is the most     
       memorable creature       

27
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,425
      to ever walk through      
           that door.           

28
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:17,826
            - It was            
     a very tough decision,     

29
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:18,959
       because I was like       
 how my supposed to say goodbye 

30
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,093
   to one of my best friends?   

31
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:21,193
      And it would be like      
          I'm the one           

32
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:22,128
           who sends            
      my best friend home.      

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,496
  - Ru was legitimately gagged  

34
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:27,298
   when you sent Alyssa home.   

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,099
       - I chose Alyssa.        
           I'm sorry.           

36
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:30,834
     I can't send him home.     

37
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:33,736
     - It's a controversial     
           decision.            

38
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:35,437
      Based on the overall      
          performance,          

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,774
  Alyssa should have advanced   
 to the final four, not Roxxxy. 

40
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:42,710
      - So, Katya, I know       
        that we both had        

41
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:44,812
      a difficult decision      
            to make.            

42
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:45,812
         - Yes, we did.         

43
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,348
      Roxxxy, I chose you.      

44
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,316
   And I'm going to look you    
    in the eye and say this     

45
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,550
  so you know that I mean it.   

46
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:55,153
    I do not have a personal    
     vendetta against you.      

47
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:57,589
       Here's the thing.        
     I can't send you home.     

48
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:58,890
      You've been slaying       
        the competition.        

49
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:01,792
  Roxxxy's been in the bottom   
         so many times.         

50
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,760
    I'm going by who I think    
is the strongest for the finals,

51
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,161
   and that to me is Alyssa.    

52
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:06,496
        - I'm still here        
        to prove myself.        

53
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:07,730
       Thank you, Detox.        

54
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:10,398
    Like I'm going to fight     
       to the bitter end.       

55
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,834
       - And you, crazy,        
  your little temper tantrum,   

56
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:14,902
      I was so surprised.       

57
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:17,004
    - Season 5, I was never     
       in the bottom two,       

58
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,806
 so I was never standing there  
having my heart race like that. 

59
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:23,109
   It was really scary seeing   
    almost this whole thing     

60
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:25,477
         be taken away          
        in one instant.         

61
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,980
   I really wanted and needed   

62
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,082
   to be in this final four.    

63
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,051
           I need it!           

64
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,518
     - Somebody who's going     
    to win this competition     

65
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,119
          is somebody           
   who can handle themselves    

66
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,354
       and still be able        
        to go out there         

67
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,421
   and do their fucking job.    

68
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,022
         And right now,         
       you're crumbling.        

69
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:42,024
  Obviously I want my sisters   
       to do really well,       

70
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:44,092
      but obviously I want      
    to do better than them.     

71
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:45,327
     I'm here for the kill.     

72
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,965
   - The winner of "RuPaul's    
      Drag Race AllStars"       

73
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,634
   receives a one year supply   

74
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:56,169

           cosmetics,           

75
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:58,771
         a coveted spot

76
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,940
        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000.          

77
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,408
    -  RuPaul's Drag Race     

78
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,609
    -  May the best woman     

79
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,911
        Best woman win        

80
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,314
          -  Everyone          
        can be someone         

81
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,948
           - (sighs)            

82
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,384
   All: Go outside and hook.    

83
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:19,220
   - I'm in the motherfucking   
           top four.            

84
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:20,587
       H-E-A-R, bitches.        

85
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,456
           I am here!           

86
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:24,924
    - Hello, hello, helleer.    

87
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:26,726
           (cheering)           

88
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,027
        - Come on, shoe.        

89
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:30,796
          Final four.           
       Con-drag-ualtions.       

90
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:32,197
          This is it.           

91
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,297
          - Thank you.          

92
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,132
    - For your grand finale     
           challenge,           

93
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:38,468
       you'll be forming        
    and AllStar supergroup.     

94
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,836
             - Ooh.             
          - Seduction.          

95
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,471
           - God, no.           

96
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,472
       First, each of you       

97
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,874
         needs to write         
      your own rap lyrics       

98
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:50,678
  for RuPaul's new bitch track  
       "Read U, Wrote U."       

99
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,045
             - Ooh.             

100
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:54,380
    - Then you'll head over     
         to the studio          

101
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:57,883
    to lay down your vocals     
         with AB Soto.          

102
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:01,920
   You'll each make an extra    
    special guest appearance    

103
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:04,755
      on RuPaul's podcast       
       "What's the Tee?"        

104
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:06,457
     (cheers and applause)      

105
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,694
    After that, you'll work     
 with choreographer Travis Wall 

106
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:14,597
 to come up with a showstopping 
       production number.       

107
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,900
          And tomorrow          
       on the main stage        

108
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:21,836
        your supergroup         
   will make its world debut.   

109
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:24,905
        #DragRaceFinale         

110
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,206
          Gentlemen...          

111
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,908
    All: Start your engines,    

112
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,345
  and may the best woman win!   

113
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:38,148
        - I'm working on        
  my award winning rap track.   

114
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,084
        - I love to rap.        
     I feel like Lil' Kim.      

115
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:44,353
 - It's really important to do  
 well in this final challenge.  

116
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:46,188
   I need to show the judges    

117
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,691
   that I can pick myself up    
         after defeat.          

118
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:52,126
       - All right, guys.       
      I'm gonna go record.      

119
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:55,430
        I am so excited         
       to record my rap,        

120
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:56,664
        and I'm excited         
       to show the judges       

121
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,365
  why I am still here, honey.   

122
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,534
             Yeah!              
          - Good luck.          

123
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:02,202
        - Slay them hos.        

124
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,804
             - Hi.              
         - Hi, Roxxxy.          

125
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,839
            I'm AB.             
      For this challenge,       

126
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,407
        I'm looking for         
      lots of personality.      

127
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,809
  I want the queens to show me  

128
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,745
        their own unique        
 individual style. Here we go.  

129
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,180
    -  I'm Roxxxy Andrews,     
and I'm here to make it clear  

130
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,081
   I know you love me, baby,   
that's why you brought me here 

131
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,183
       I'm really feeling       
   this flow right now, girl.   

132
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,451
       You can't tell me        
      I'm not Nicki Minaj.      

133
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:25,253
      You're going crazy      

134
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,654
        And seeing two        

135
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:28,022
     - And stop the track.      

136
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:30,324
  Your energy's a little low.   

137
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:33,260
      A little more energy      
  and a little more sexiness.   

138
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,030
       - Oh, my goodness,       
        look who's here,        

139
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:40,666
        our first guest,        
    Alaska, the 49th state.     

140
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:43,768
         - I'm excited          
       to do this podcast       

141
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,436
   with RuPaul and Michelle.    

142
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:49,540
   - So what are your wishes    
    for your career and life    

143
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,841
        post "AllStars?"        

144
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,275
      - To create a space       

145
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:57,178
     where the rules aren't     
     so rigid about gender.     

146
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,980
      And if we can laugh       
    about it a little more,     

147
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:01,147
    the world will be better    

148
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,816
         and we can get         
    to a "Star Trek" future.    

149
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:07,118
 - Hmm, that sounds delicious.  
            - Yeah.             

150
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,486
     - I want to talk about     

151
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:10,121
   how you were in the bottom   
      the last challenge,       

152
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:14,158
     and I seemed to detect     
   a little bit of a tantrum.   

153
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,461
  - I'm sorry if I was a brat.  

154
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:22,464
      - Now, it looks like      
           Rolaskatox           

155
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,565
    is back together again.     

156
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:29,270
   - Well, we're not actively   
   practicing Rolaskatox-ism.   

157
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:32,306
      It's very unnerving       
         to hear RuPaul         

158
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:36,110
    saying the dreaded word     
          Rolaskatox.           

159
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:41,247
   - We're going to take our    
   selfieonastick.com selfie.   

160
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:42,247
         There you go.          

161
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,383
       - It's upsetting.        

162
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,119
    -  You a basic asshole,    
   and it's your time to go    

163
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:51,021
           So, bitch,          
   let me show you the door    

164
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:53,222
     Lenin in the streets,     
  Dostoyevsky in the streets   

165
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:55,591
      Oh, fuck I fucked up      
           that part.           

166
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:59,828
    I'm like the sugar free     
  French Vanilla Ice of drag.   

167
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,763
   This is gonna sound great.   

168
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,631
        Rapping's hard.         
      - It is hard. Yeah.       

169
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,465
        - AB's giving me        
     really good feedback.      

170
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,367
           He's like            
    blinking his eyes a lot.    

171
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:10,035
     Lenin in the streets,     
  Dostoyevsky in the sheets    

172
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:12,571
      Lenin in the streets,    
   Dostoyevsky in the sheets   

173
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:15,974
   Which I think in Dominican   
        means, good job.        

174
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:18,809
           - Whoops.            
       Okay, here we are.       

175
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,443
          The finale.           
     - Can you believe it?      

176
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:23,146
        - I pinch myself        
       every fucking day.       

177
00:07:23,148 --> 00:07:24,747
 - And when you pinch yourself, 
        can you feel it?        

178
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:29,551
          (all laugh)           

179
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:30,718
     You know, it's funny.      
          Here we are           

180
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,220
         at this point          
      in the competition,       

181
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:35,722
     and here's Rolaskatox      
      back together again.      

182
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,425
          - Ish. Ish.           
          I love them.          

183
00:07:38,427 --> 00:07:40,560
I mean, there are certain times 
    when I'm like, oh, okay.    

184
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:42,161
    I don't want to hang out    
     with you for too long.     

185
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:45,096
 - Now, you've always had your  
 own look, your own aesthetic,  

186
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,099
        but this season         
       it is so refined.        

187
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,034
        Where'd you get         
      your sense of style?      

188
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,235
      - Growing up loving       
          Teri McGlone          

189
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,037
            and like            
   the Vogue Fashion Awards.    

190
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,204
  I just always loved fashion.  

191
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:55,605
      - Yeah, I can tell.       

192
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:57,006
         - I don't like         
      to toot my own horn,      

193
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,108
    but easily I have killed    
  everyone in this competition  

194
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,108
  when it comes to the runway.  

195
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,409
            I pissed            
      all over that thing.      

196
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:02,810
            - Ready?            

197
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:04,477
    Look. My tits look huge.    

198
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,445
          - Stunning.           

199
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:08,380
           (humming)            

200
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:09,681
       It was really fun.       

201
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,052
   - My podcast was consumed    
         by Rolaskatox          

202
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:19,489
    and my brattish behavior    
           last week.           

203
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:20,790
      - We're at the end.       

204
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,824
    LIke the finishing line     
     is right ahead of us,      

205
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:24,159
     and here we are again.     

206
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:26,827
  - And it's the same people.   
            - Yeah.             

207
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,162
     - I'm so glad Katya's      
       here with us, too.       

208
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:29,996
     - She's such a weirdo      
         and I love it.         

209
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:34,967
            - Um...             
    It hits me all at once,     

210
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:38,304
       this is Rolaskatox       
     and one other person.      

211
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:40,205
       This is not good.        

212
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:44,776
  It just all is seeming very,  
very oddly, strangely familiar. 

213
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:47,444
         The last time          
     it was the three of us     

214
00:08:47,446 --> 00:08:49,146
     and a lovable weirdo.      

215
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:51,381
         We all saw how         
    that fucking worked out.    

216
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:54,684
   So I don't want us to get    
    fucking all comfortable     

217
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:57,520
    because I'm really like     
 trying to stay fucking focused 

218
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:00,522
          so I can win          
      this fucking thing.       

219
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,590
- I think you're coming way out 
of left field for this, though, 

220
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,392
      because I don't feel      
    like anything's similar     

221
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,427
        to our last time        
    being in this position.     

222
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,828
    - It really means a lot     

223
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,363
       and I want to win        
    because I did the best.     

224
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,532
     - I feel the same way.     

225
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,533
      I'm definitely vying      
     for my spot on the top     

226
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:16,434
      because I feel like       
   I really deserve it, too.    

227
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,336
   And I've worked my ass off   
   and I want to fucking win    

228
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,072
    just as much as you do,     
             so...              

229
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,406
  Alaska is acting ridiculous.  

230
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,207
          - I'm lost.           

231
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:25,741
   - It's very self-centered.   

232
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:27,942
   I'm not gonna win because    
 I'm hanging out with you guys. 

233
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:29,911
        Well, fuck you.         
       I'm trying to win.       

234
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:32,013
    We're all trying to win.    
     You know what I mean?      

235
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,348
  - Yes, I know what you mean.  

236
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,617
   - It's not just about you,   
          girl. Sorry.          

237
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,085
         - Coming up...         

238
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,888
    The winner of "RuPaul's     
     Drag Race AllStars..."     

239
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:45,991
             Is...              

240
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:47,993
        (RuPaul laughs)         

241
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,596
        (RuPaul laughs)         

242
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,464
    - Alaska is flipping out    
           right now.           

243
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:57,066
  I need her to just let this   
     little shit go, girl.      

244
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,734
       You need to fight        
          to the end.           

245
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:01,070
   I don't want the bullshit    
   with the Rolaskatox thing    

246
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:04,172
 to deter you from what you've  
been doing in this competition. 

247
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:06,608
           - I know.            
 - Stick to what you're doing.  

248
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,642
         That's stress          
        you don't need.         

249
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:11,445
     - I know. It's just...     
            I know.             

250
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:13,312
             (sobs)             

251
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:17,182
    You guys are my friends,    
    and I love you so much.     

252
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,351
    And I don't want to feel    
           like that            

253
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:23,555
       is a disadvantage        
         to us winning.         

254
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,323
          - Everything          
   is so different this time.   

255
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,625
   - So just worry about you    
  getting to the finish line.   

256
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,394
          We love you.          

257
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,763
     - And I really am glad     
          you're here.          

258
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:38,333
       Rolaskatox creates       
        a reaction in me        

259
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:41,269
            because             
     it was a stupid thing.     

260
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,538
    I can't live in regret.     

261
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,574
        In life, really         
   the only thing you can do    

262
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:50,410
      is take experiences       
     that are embarrassing      

263
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:55,414
 and turn them into the things  
    that make you stronger.     

264
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,450
   Trash into treasure, girl.   

265
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,087
       - Oh, my goodness.       
    Look who just walked in.    

266
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,088
             - Hi.              
          - Hi, Katya.          

267
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,223
            - So now            
     your mother was here.      

268
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:08,258
           I thought            
     she was just a dream.      

269
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,326
      - Isn't she amazing?      
        - She really is.        

270
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:12,094
  Thank God dad's a sociopath,  
      so there's balance.       

271
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:13,628
    - Well, there's balance.    

272
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,697
And you know, that's the secret 
  of life is having a balance.  

273
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:16,964
         - Absolutely.          
       And you know what?       

274
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,500
  This season, it started out   
        so much better.         

275
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:22,435
      But still, there was      
     a little bit of like--     

276
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:23,802
         - The voices?          

277
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:25,336
   - One thing that I've been   
      coaching myself with      

278
00:11:25,338 --> 00:11:28,606
       is like I sort of        
        name that voice.        

279
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,340
       I call her Brenda.       

280
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:31,607
           - Uh-huh.            
       - And I just say,        

281
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:34,443
     you know what, Brenda?     
       Shut the fuck up.        

282
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,645
         - I love that.         
         - Yeah, so...          

283
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:38,480
          - I've found          
      that what you do is       

284
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:41,149
 you develop another voice that 
sort of counteracts that voice. 

285
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,017
         - Yeah, Carl.          
        - Wait a minute.        

286
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,619
   It's not Hot Carl, is it?    

287
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,619
          (all laugh)           

288
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,954
        - Being excited         
        to talk with Ru         

289
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,422
    is new sensation for me.    

290
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:51,723
   Our rapport is fantastic.    

291
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:53,658
     So this is the moment      

292
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,494
 that I know how far I've come  
      in the competition.       

293
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,762
          - Gorgeous.           
             - Yay.             

294
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:01,931
            - Hi-ee.            
         - Hey, Alaska.         

295
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,365
         Are you ready?         
        - I'm so ready.         

296
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,400
          I'm excited.          
             - Yes.             

297
00:12:05,402 --> 00:12:07,168
    All right, from the top.    

298
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,037
        -  Hey, girls,         
       my name's Alaska        

299
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,306
      I got a tiny little      
      question to ask ya       

300
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:14,074
        Who's that bitch       
      that's on the top?       

301
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:16,775
      Oh, wait, that's me,     
        hey, porkchop          

302
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,210
       - And cut. I love        
  your signature Alaska sound,  

303
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:21,345
    but make it a little bit    
         more animated.         

304
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:23,947
     - Today's been really      
       emotional for me,        

305
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:26,750
     but I have to get back     
          in the game.          

306
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:31,254
       I need to come in        
 absolutely nothing held back.  

307
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:32,655
          - Cue music.          

308
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:34,823
          -  Legacy,           
       remember my name        

309
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:41,696
   'Cause you're gonna see me  
 hanging in the hall of fame   

310
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:43,264
           - So good.           
          I love that.          

311
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,132
         - Hi, Roxxxy.          

312
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,666
           - So now,            
     how are you different      

313
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,535
     than you were whenever     
     you were here before?      

314
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:50,069
         I have no idea         
     how long ago that was      

315
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:51,937
         because I have         
      no concept of time.       

316
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,472
   - I realized that you have   
   to live with your mistakes   

317
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,241
      and you have to grow      
           from them.           

318
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:00,678
 - I know that you didn't like  
how you came off in that season 

319
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,112
    'cause all these bitches    
          want to say,          

320
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,548
        oh, I was edited        
          unfavorably.          

321
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,783
     It's like, no, bitch,      
    you said it, you did it,    

322
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,117
       that's how it was.       

323
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,585
    - I own up to everything    
      I said on the show.       

324
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,254
       I couldn't believe       
        how messy I got.        

325
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:15,722
   So coming onto "AllStars,"   
       it was like the--        

326
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,190
          oh, my God,           
     I got a second chance.     

327
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:18,858
    - When you have your eye    
         on the prize,          

328
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,260
    you do whatever it takes    
            to win.             

329
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,361
    And sometimes, it's not     
the nicest move, but you do it. 

330
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,363
         - What's funny         
   about this whole interview   

331
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:27,433
  is you've said nothing about  
  seeing my makeup this close.  

332
00:13:27,435 --> 00:13:30,502
  - It's hard to look at you,   
 you're so beautiful, stunning. 

333
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:32,537
    - Why, thank you. Jeez,     
    it's like pulling teeth     

334
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:34,372
      to get a compliment       
      out of these girls.       

335
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:36,942
          Ooh, child.           

336
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:40,277
  - This is my crowning look.   

337
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,312
           - (laughs)           
 - What are you thinking about? 

338
00:13:42,314 --> 00:13:46,216
           - What if            
      Roxxxy Andrews wins?      

339
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:48,885
   - Um, I would be confused.   

340
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:51,521
  - If she wins, it's gonna be  
       a fucking uproar.        

341
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:56,291
 - If we're racking up points,  
then no, she's not going to win.

342
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,259
           - Mm-hmm.            
         - I won three.         

343
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,061
      I was in the bottom       
           two times.           

344
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:01,161
     - I was in the bottom      
           one time.            

345
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:02,662
   I've won three challenges.   

346
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:05,898
   And your track record has    
  been bottom once, won four.   

347
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,132
            - Yeah.             

348
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:09,100
   - But it's not going to be   
        a math equation.        

349
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:11,335
    I mean, or maybe it is,     
         I don't know.          

350
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:14,571
 - I won the most, but winning  
   doesn't make you likeable.   

351
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,274
   And I've been very focused   
   and I've been very driven,   

352
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,309
        but those aren't        
      likeable qualities.       

353
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:23,646
Having passion and having drive 
    is a double-edged sword.    

354
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:26,781
  It's easy to look cutthroat   
         and ambitious,         

355
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,818
  but on the other hand, it's   
  the biggest strength I have.  

356
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,521
      - If you didn't win,      
    would you be devastated?    

357
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:35,756
        - Well, I mean,         
    I've been there before.     

358
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:37,824
       But I want to win.       

359
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,460
         How about you?         

360
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,628
        - I want to win.        

361
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:45,597
           - Me, too.           

362
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,633
        - From the top.         

363
00:14:49,635 --> 00:14:52,034
      Detox coming at you      
      with a slow verse        

364
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:54,302
       Imma speed it up,       
 I had to shut it down first   

365
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:56,938
    I feel really confident     
   about this rap challenge.    

366
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,206
   And the only thing that's    
holding me back would be myself,

367
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,041
        and I don't plan        
    on holding myself back.     

368
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:04,143
     D to the E to the T to    
   the O to the--hold it--     

369
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,577
              X               

370
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,180
   - Detox is definitely the    
strongest queen I've seen today.

371
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:10,848
      Oh, my God, so good.      

372
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,349
      - I feel so gangsta,      
           you guys.            

373
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,851
            - Yeah.             

374
00:15:14,953 --> 00:15:17,286
             - Yes.             
          (both laugh)          

375
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:18,621
            - Hi-ee.            
            - Yeah.             

376
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:21,557
       - It's time for us       
   to learn our choreography    

377
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,992
   for our stage performance    

378
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:26,862
       with choreographer       
   to the stars Travis Wall.    

379
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:28,830
  - Obviously, there's so much  
  riding on this performance,   

380
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:30,264
   so what I'd like to do now   

381
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,266
 is work with you individually  
      on your solo parts.       

382
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,101
      Today, we are doing       
     lots of choreography.      

383
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:35,502
     There's a couple props     
           involved.            

384
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:36,869
       We're pulling out        
         all the stops,         

385
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:39,204
       and this has to be       
  a showstopping performance.   

386
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:41,940
          Pick her up           
  and get her legs in the air.  

387
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,475
           - (laughs)           

388
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:47,044
 I love Alaska, but we all know 
   she can't dance for shit.    

389
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,813
      - We just look like       
    a chicken a little bit.     

390
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,949
       Are you flexible?        
          - A little.           

391
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,949
            - Maybe.            
  - What do you want me to do?  

392
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,217
      - I want you to see       

393
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,484
      if you can get into       
         a middle split         

394
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:57,152
      on top of him again.      

395
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:01,688
            - Okay.             
       That's ambitious.        

396
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,358
        - Flick, flick,         
        and then split.         

397
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,627
          (all laugh)           

398
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:12,831
    One, three, five, seven,    
             one--              

399
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,332
      - Oh, I'm so sorry.       

400
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:17,101
    As excited as I am to do    
   this whole chair routine,    

401
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:18,769
the minute I'm up on the chairs,
     I start freaking out.      

402
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,036
            Oh, God.            

403
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:22,772
      - I want you to fall      
      backwards this way.       

404
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,007
     - Okay. So just trust      
      these motherfuckers.      

405
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,508
             - Yes.             
            - Okay.             

406
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,876
         It looks easy,         
      but it's really not.      

407
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:30,845
     - Shenae over to him.      

408
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:33,881
      Shenae. Wrong foot.       

409
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:35,783
    Left leg. Your left leg.    

410
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,283
    What would you do to him    
     to get your attention?     

411
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:40,252
       - A lot of things.       
          (all laugh)           

412
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:41,286
        - Why don't you         
        get behind him.         

413
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:42,587
   - It's my favorite place.    

414
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:43,822
     - Maybe push him down.     

415
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:46,457
       - Down into this?        
      - Yeah, yeah, yeah.       

416
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:49,426
    - Choreography is hard.     

417
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:51,895
     I need some duct tape.     

418
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:53,363
      - I've never worked       
        with you, Katya.        

419
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,365
         - Yep. I'm not         
       an actual dancer,        

420
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:58,134
  but I am extremely flexible.  

421
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,068
       Oh, Jesus Christ.        

422
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,436
   - The idea is you're going   
 to slide into your right split 

423
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,537
     and then bring you up.     

424
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,571
     You want to try that?      
            - Yeah.             

425
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,974
     - Slide and up. Nice.      

426
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:08,974
     - We can even go lower     
      than that, you guys.      

427
00:17:08,976 --> 00:17:10,241
        - There you go.         

428
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:12,843
         Slide and up.          
      Amazing. Love that.       

429
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,344
      - Shit, oh, my God.       

430
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:17,280
      - Five, six, seven,       
          plie shoon.           

431
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,782
        - Oh, that feels        
         fucking sexy.          

432
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:21,483
          (all laugh)           
         - Oh, my God.          

433
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:23,184
         Katya is like          
     a fucking rubber band.     

434
00:17:23,186 --> 00:17:25,319
     It's very intimidating     
     because it's something     

435
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:27,721
       that's going to be       
 very memorable to the judges.  

436
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:30,656
          - Handstand.          

437
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,191
    Put your legs together.     
         There you go.          

438
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:33,959
      Now open and go down.     
          There you go.         

439
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,793
       - Oh, that's fun.        
       Let's do it again.       

440
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,162
          - Great job.          
         Yeah, so good.         

441
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,033
          - Shit, fuck          
       mother fuck shit.        

442
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:46,467
         - Coming up...         

443
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:48,268
           - What was           
     your favorite moment?      

444
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,203
       - When you were in       
    the bottom two, Roxxxy.     

445
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:52,004
             - Oh!              
            - Fuck!             

446
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,139
         (RuPaul laugh)         

447
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,808
        (RuPaul laughs)         

448
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,176
            - Yeah.             

449
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:04,947
       (speaking French)        

450
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:06,514
    - This is our final day.    

451
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:07,648
         At this point          
      of the competition,       

452
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,416
    there's no holding back.    

453
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:10,584
          I don't know          
       who I gotta move,        

454
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,619
    but I'm going full force    
          to that win.          

455
00:18:14,922 --> 00:18:15,954
    How do you feel, Katya?     

456
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:17,622
       - Um, I feel good.       

457
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:20,324
 I think one of the things that 
  I'm most proud of myself for  

458
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,325
     is making it this far      
         with you guys          

459
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:25,962
     because I haven't had      
       as much experience       

460
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:29,097
       as a professional        
      post Drag Race girl.      

461
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,898
    Do you know what I mean?    
           - Mm-hmm.            

462
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,332
- I feel like in the short time 
        since my season,        

463
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:34,534
  I've already grown so much.   

464
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:36,236
       And I want to win        
          "AllStars,"           

465
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:39,171
   and objective, scientific    
       research has shown       

466
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:42,174
  that it is totally possible   
       for me to do that.       

467
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:44,609
    What about you, Alaska?     
     What are you feeling?      

468
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:48,812
  - I feel good about how I've  
 performed in the competition.  

469
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:52,549
   I've had moments of going    
    a little fucking crazy,     

470
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,184
        and I apologize         
         to all of you          

471
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:57,820
       if that fucked up        
     the energy of the room     

472
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:00,723
    and of this experience.     

473
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:03,592
      I was trying to stay      
          so focused,           

474
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:07,495
   and I didn't want to show    
     any signs of weakness.     

475
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:08,697
       One of the things        

476
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:10,498
          that I wish           
  I would've done differently   

477
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,303
      is I wish I wouldn't      
  have been quite so serious.   

478
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:18,604
  I'm absurd and I'm obsessed,  

479
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:22,441
    but I think I'm the best    
 RuPaul's Drag Race queen ever. 

480
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:24,776
       So I want to win.        

481
00:19:24,778 --> 00:19:26,710
        It's my destiny.        

482
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:27,811
     - How do you feel, D?      

483
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,380
     - I feel really good.      

484
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:32,148
 Like, I feel very confident in 
everything that I've done here. 

485
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,983
      I feel like myself,       
    which is the first time     

486
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:37,820
    I've felt like truly me     
        in a long time.         

487
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,321
      I would love to say       
     that if I did not win,     

488
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:41,923
     that it would be fine.     

489
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:45,193
 But to get this far and to be  
   so proud of what I've done   

490
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:47,994
       and then to still        
       just miss the mark       

491
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:49,729
     would be devastating.      

492
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:52,998
It's been an amazing experience,
    and now I just feel bad     

493
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,367
     that I'm going to have     
   to crush you guys' dreams.   

494
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,902
          (all laugh)           

495
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,336
           - What was           
     your favorite moment?      

496
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:00,604
      - My favorite moment      

497
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,905
      was when you were in      
    the bottom two, Roxxxy.     

498
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:02,939
          (all laugh)           
             - Oh!              

499
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:04,873
          Which time?           

500
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,075
            - Damn!             
         - Oh, my God.          

501
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:08,009
            - Fuck.             

502
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:14,581
         -  Covergirl,         
  put the bass in your walk    

503
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:22,187
           Covergirl,          
  put the bass in your walk    

504
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:25,690
          Head to toe,         
   let your whole body talk    

505
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,291
          Covergirl           

506
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:31,128
           (applause)           

507
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,930
           - Welcome            
      to the grand finale       

508
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:35,499
          of "RuPaul's          
      Drag Race AllStars."      

509
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:37,933
  Tonight, it's just family.    

510
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:40,168
           Michelle,            
      can you handle this?      

511
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,636
          - Of courrr.          

512
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:43,837
           - Carson,            
      can you handle this?      

513
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:44,972
        - I think I can.        

514
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:46,640
           - Todrick,           
      can you handle this?      

515
00:20:46,642 --> 00:20:47,707
           - Well...            

516
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:49,675
      - And Ross Matthews.      

517
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:52,611
      - Ru, I don't think       
    I can handle this. Whoo!    

518
00:20:52,613 --> 00:20:54,178
          (all laugh)           

519
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,648
   - This week, we challenged   
         our final four         

520
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,883
   to write and record lyrics   

521
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:03,453
     to my new bitch track,     
       "Read U, Wrote U."       

522
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:08,358
     And now they're ready      
to dance their padded asses off.

523
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,696
 Gentlemen, start your engines, 
  and may the best woman win.   

524
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:17,400
         (music plays)          

525
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:19,801
       -  Lookie here         

526
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:24,771
          Listen up           

527
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,511
         I'm the one          

528
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:35,380
         (echoing) Ow!          

529
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:37,648
        -  Hey, girls,         
       my name's Alaska        

530
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,783
          I got a tiny         
  little question to ask ya    

531
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:41,818
        Who's that bitch       
      that's on the top?       

532
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,253
      Oh, wait, that's me,     
        hey, porkchop          

533
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,387
       You're butt-naked,      
       the rest is drag        

534
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,689
         But your face         
    just needs a paper bag     

535
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:51,224
      Give me a challenge      
   and I'll impress you all    

536
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,226
       Changing the game       
    like my name's RuPaul      

537
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,561
          Line them up         
        front to back          

538
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:57,963
    I'm sending bitches home   
     like a heart attack       

539
00:21:57,965 --> 00:22:00,365
    Mess with me and you'll    
     wind up in a casket       

540
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:02,800
   I'm Dorothy, you're Toto,   
      get in the basket        

541
00:22:02,802 --> 00:22:04,734
         I'll read you         
   down beneath the ground     

542
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:07,270
    Could you hold my purse    
  while I snatch the ground?   

543
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,171
   Legacy, remember my name   

544
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:13,574
   'Cause you're gonna see me  
 hanging in the hall of fame   

545
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,877
      -  Got to read it       

546
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:20,280
  -  I'm the one, one, one    

547
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,117
   I'm the one, o-one, one    

548
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:29,854
       I'm--I'm the one       

549
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:32,857
    -  Detox coming at you     
      with a slow verse        

550
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,959
       Imma speed it up,       
 I had to shut it down first   

551
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,960
    Killin' bitches so hard,   
      need a pink hearse       

552
00:22:36,962 --> 00:22:39,096
  I ain't saying I'm the best, 
    but I ain't the worst      

553
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:40,397
      You see me shining      

554
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:41,798
    I'm trying to take this    
          primetime            

555
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,732
 I see you whining and crying, 
    take that to Lifetime      

556
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:46,234
   So epic that it's poetic,   
    I spin it all the time     

557
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,470
  Oh, baby, you look pathetic  
   with that nursery rhyme     

558
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:50,505
      You can't stand me?      
      I don't blame you        

559
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:52,973
      If Ru is number one,     
        I'm number two         

560
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,309
         You disagree,         
     well, that's on you       

561
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:57,544
    Eyes on the chalkboard,    
  I'll spell it out for you    

562
00:22:57,546 --> 00:23:01,047
    D to E to the T to the O   
      to the--hold it--        

563
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,481
              X               

564
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:05,884
       Naomi Campbell-ing      
   these hoes to the ground    

565
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:07,552
             Next!              

566
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,588
        Now I'm, now I'm       
      with you, with you       

567
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,523
      Told you, told you      

568
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,926
        Now I'm, now I'm       
      with you, with you       

569
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,627
      Told you, told you      

570
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,695
       Now I'm with you       

571
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,730
        - You been read.        

572
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,467
  -  I'm the one, one, one    

573
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,467
              Ow!               

574
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:28,470
     I'm the one, o-o-one     

575
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:33,642
      -  Katarina Petrona      
       Zamalawchickova         

576
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:37,879
          But your dad         
     just calls me Katya       

577
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:40,748
           Katya with          
     the long blonde hair      

578
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,583
        Always keep them       
     coming back for more      

579
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:45,152
       You a basic ass ho      
   and it's your time to go    

580
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:47,455
           So bitch,           
   let me show you the door    

581
00:23:47,457 --> 00:23:48,755
         'Cause it's me        
      who's getting laid       

582
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:49,923
         And I'm always        
         getting paid          

583
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:51,691
      The only high class      
        Russian whore          

584
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:54,260
    I'm a scorching hot mess   
     in a skintight dress      

585
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:56,529
         That's a rash,        
      not a herpes sore        

586
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:59,131
     Lenin in the streets,     
  Dostoyevsky in the sheets    

587
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,133
      Baby, are you ready      
      for this Cold War?       

588
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:06,271
    Katya Zamalawchickova     

589
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:10,007
    -  Wrote you, told you,    
    now I--now I read you      

590
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:13,477
      Wrote you, told you,     
     now I--now I read you     

591
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:15,177
        - You been read.        

592
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,112
     -  I'm Roxxxy Andrews     
and I'm here to make it clear  

593
00:24:17,114 --> 00:24:18,313
   I know you love me, baby   

594
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:19,580
           That's why          
     you brought me here       

595
00:24:19,582 --> 00:24:20,948
   Was a bitch on Season 5    

596
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,082
   I'm gonna make it right    

597
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,216
            Give me            
      a sewing challenge       

598
00:24:23,218 --> 00:24:24,650
       And I'll give you       
        what you like          

599
00:24:24,652 --> 00:24:26,752
   I'm full of tricks, baby,   
    just like on Halloween     

600
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:29,054
    A room full of monsters    
and it makes me want to scream 

601
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,922
    I have to get this right   
 so you don't waste your time  

602
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:33,357
      Not like my comedy,      
  I'm killing on this rhyme    

603
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:38,028
       I'm gonna show you      
        what I can do          

604
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:42,332
       You're going crazy      
       and seeing, too         

605
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:46,969
        It's not fault,        
   you can't blame my game     

606
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:51,908
      All these other hos,     
   but they're all the same    

607
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,977
    -  Wrote you, told you,    
    now I--now I read you      

608
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:57,846
      Wrote you, told you,     
     now I--now I read you     

609
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:00,782
        - You been read.        

610
00:25:00,784 --> 00:25:04,551
    I'm the one, one, one     

611
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:06,653
   -  Wrote you, wrote you,    
      told you, now I--        

612
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:09,022
    -  Wrote you, wrote you,   
   told you, now I read you    

613
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:10,857
      Read you, read you      

614
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,225
         - Oh, my God.          

615
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:15,094
            - Whoa!             

616
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,497
             - Wow.             

617
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:19,664
         - Coming up...         

618
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:23,134
          I feel proud          
      to pass my legacy on      

619
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:26,538
       to the four of you       
    standing here right now.    

620
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:32,343
         But it's time          
   for your final critiques.    

621
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,311
        (RuPaul laughs)         

622
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:38,314
        (RuPaul laughs)         

623
00:25:42,252 --> 00:25:46,754
         - The category         
    is AllStar Glam-o-rama.     

624
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:48,622
       First up, Alaska.        

625
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:51,525
  - It's Glamorgan Fairchild.   
            - Yeah.             

626
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:52,759
  - I want to show the judges   

627
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:56,162
       that I can do more       
    than just convey humor,     

628
00:25:56,164 --> 00:25:58,397
    camp in my runway looks.    

629
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,735
   I'm wearing a gold dress,    
   and gold is like trophies.   

630
00:26:02,737 --> 00:26:03,902
          - So what's           
      her Glitter handle?       

631
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,204
           - (laughs)           

632
00:26:06,206 --> 00:26:08,906
      Detox. So glamorous.      

633
00:26:08,908 --> 00:26:11,141
     - It's Kylie Man-ogue.     

634
00:26:11,143 --> 00:26:13,343
        - Usually Detox         
   is very severe up in here,   

635
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:15,477
   but this is a softer side    
           of Detox,            

636
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,745
   the softer side of Sears.    

637
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:18,313
        This is the best        
      I've ever felt here.      

638
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:20,081
     - This is a slam dunk      
            for me.             

639
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,617
      Nothing but netting.      
             - Yes.             

640
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:24,684
            - Katya.            

641
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:26,118
             - Wow.             
             - Ooh.             

642
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,953
        - Do the bustle.        

643
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:29,187
          (all laugh)           

644
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:33,023
     - I am the confident,      
    complex regal matriarch     

645
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,259
   of a Russian mafia family    

646
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,994
            enjoying            
     her last days on earth     

647
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:40,630
    before she is set ablaze    
     by jealous relatives.      

648
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,766
   - I know where I'm hiding    
   if there's an earthquake.    

649
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,301
            - Yeah.             
          (all laugh)           

650
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,437
       - Roxxxy Andrews.        

651
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,938
      - Victor Victorious.      

652
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,706
   - I'm giving them the full   
    thick and juicy fantasy.    

653
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,742
          Showing off           
       the Andrews goods.       

654
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:56,711
          I am getting          
    my complete entire life.    

655
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:58,512
          - That's not          
        a sequins dress.        

656
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:02,583
            That is             
    a crystal extravaganza.     

657
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:07,320
      - These have always       
       brought her luck.        

658
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:09,022
      - Welcome, AllStars.      

659
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:11,958
           It's time            
   for your final critiques.    

660
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:15,293
       First up, Alaska.        

661
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:16,794
         - Let's start          
    with this look tonight.     

662
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:19,830
     The hair, the makeup,      
           flawless.            

663
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:21,264
          - Thank you.          

664
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:24,466
- You know I'm a big fan of rap 
     and hippity hop music.     

665
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,267
          Your lyrics           
       were my favorite.        

666
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,269
       They were so funny       
        and thought out.        

667
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,638
   I remember in Snatch Game    
    and I thought to myself,    

668
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,107
     everyone else in this      
 competition better watch out.  

669
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:36,509
        And you've kept         
   that level up for so long.   

670
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:37,943
  And I think you had a moment  

671
00:27:37,945 --> 00:27:40,445
     when it all caught up      
     with you a little bit,     

672
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:41,745
       and that's rough.        

673
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,079
      But way to come back      
            tonight.            

674
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,114
          - Thank you.          
     - I think you've done      

675
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:46,849
      a pretty amazing job      
         this journey.          

676
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:49,651
  You've come a long way since  
   auditioning for Season 1.    

677
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:53,254
       - Up next, Detox.        

678
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,923
      - You are the rapper      
       of the group here,       

679
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,625
   and I think your delivery    
        was outstanding.        

680
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:00,093
          - How about           
       the chair-ography?       

681
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,494
      It was really good.       

682
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:03,428
   - You looked like you were   
     just living your life.     

683
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,296
    - And then it culminated    
    with this look tonight.     

684
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:06,663
         So beautiful.          

685
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:09,433
  - You're living my ballerina  
       fantasy right now.       

686
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:11,768
       One of us had to.        

687
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,402
          (all laugh)           

688
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:15,670
       - Up next, Katya.        

689
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:18,172
   - Your performance tonight   
          was genius.           

690
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:21,909
   - I love when you do like    
     the athleticism stuff.     

691
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:23,343
            I'm like            
     so unfamiliar with it.     

692
00:28:23,345 --> 00:28:24,777
          (all laugh)           

693
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,145
     - I love that you did      
      like a Russian rap.       

694
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:28,980
         - It's a rash?         
 What did you say in your rap?  

695
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,415
         - It's a rash,         
       not a herpes sore.       

696
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,017
   - Oh, if I had a dollar...   
            - Right?            

697
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,117
          (all laugh)           

698
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,652
           - I think            
      your sense of humor       

699
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:37,820
      has been spectacular      
       the whole season.        

700
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:39,155
        And it's always         
       a little bit off.        

701
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:42,825
         - And insanity         
 is part of why we love Katya,  

702
00:28:42,827 --> 00:28:44,793
     but it doesn't justify     
          this skirt.           

703
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:47,062
           Um, so...            

704
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:50,031
  - You're nuts. Listen, yes,   
    it's not exactly the way    

705
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:52,066
   we've seen it done before,   
  but neither are you, honey,   

706
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:53,367
  and that's why we like you.   

707
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:54,801
          - Thank you.          

708
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:57,170
   - Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.   

709
00:28:57,172 --> 00:29:00,039
   - This look is everything.   

710
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:03,309
  It's like J-Lo and Liberace   
       had a baby, okay?        

711
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:04,443
            - Okay.             

712
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:07,178
           - Rapping            
     is not Roxxxy's forte,     

713
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,278
         but I thought          
      you had fun with it       

714
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,178
       and it looked like       
          you had a--           

715
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,313
           - So much.           
            - Yeah.             

716
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,047
    - When that fan came on,    
          I was sold.           

717
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,883
    - I'm such a sucker for     
   a this way and a that way    

718
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:16,785
   and just--I'm so jealous.    

719
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:19,688
Someone clip an extension on me 
     stat so I can try it.      

720
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:25,460
    - Ladies, I am overcome     
     with emotion right now     

721
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:26,828
  looking at the four of you.   

722
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,930
  And I couldn't be more proud  

723
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:32,899
        to know that you        
      are part my legacy,       

724
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:36,201
       seeing each of you       
         so beautiful.          

725
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:38,470
      And I'm telling you       
           right now,           

726
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:43,775
  I feel so confident to pass   
my torch on to the four of you. 

727
00:29:43,777 --> 00:29:47,645
     No matter what happens     
     on this stage tonight,     

728
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:50,848
    you are a star forever.     

729
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,319
          Coming up...          
      One final question.       

730
00:29:56,321 --> 00:30:01,090
         Why should you         
  and not your fellow AllStars  

731
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:04,093
        be inducted into        
  the Drag Race Hall of Fame?   

732
00:30:05,696 --> 00:30:07,395
        (RuPaul laughs)         

733
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:11,597
        (RuPaul laughs)         

734
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,600
           - Ladies,            
      one final question.       

735
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:19,070
         Why should you         
  and not your fellow AllStars  

736
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:22,907
        be inducted into        
  the Drag Race Hall of Fame?   

737
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:26,176
            Alaska.             

738
00:30:26,178 --> 00:30:28,277
    - Yes, I've thrown fits.    

739
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,113
     I've thrown tantrums.      

740
00:30:30,115 --> 00:30:35,017
  Perhaps I'm just a RuPaul's   
 Drag Race obsessed super fan.  

741
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:38,653
   Was I obsessed when Chanel   
  was Miss Absolute Mandarin?   

742
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:41,222
            (slurps)            

743
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:43,157
           Yes, God.            

744
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:46,026
   Was I obsessed when India,   
       Farrah and Phoenix       

745
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:48,361
walked into the workroom in the 
 same wig and the same outfit?  

746
00:30:48,363 --> 00:30:53,633
   In the words of Gia Gunn,    
          absolutely.           

747
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,134
           For it is            
     my fanatical devotion      

748
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,835
      and my undying love       
          and respect           

749
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:58,703
   for the world that RuPaul    
        has created here        

750
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:01,872
   that puts me wig, head and   
shoulders above any competitor. 

751
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:03,874
         - Oh, my God.          
    - Look into your hearts     

752
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:07,109
      where you will find       
     that the only inductee     

753
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:09,177
  into the RuPaul's Drag Race   
          Hall of Fame          

754
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,379
         is I, Alaska.          

755
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:15,282
          Hallelujah!           
      Yes, God! Oh, brrr!       

756
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:19,085
    (laughter and applause)     

757
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:22,488
          - All right.          
     Detox, same question.      

758
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,622
     - All I can say is how     
    magical of an experience    

759
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:25,989
      this has been to me.      

760
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:30,593
It's been full of joy and tears 
       and perseverance.        

761
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:32,662
   And I don't want to throw    
   these girls under the bus,   

762
00:31:32,664 --> 00:31:35,263
             but...             

763
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:38,799
  I will say that I feel like   
          I have shown          

764
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:43,403
    such an amount of growth    
   and maturity and humility    

765
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:45,705
      that I want to just       
    travel around the world     

766
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,740
  and share that with everyone  

767
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:49,007
          and say that          
      it will get better.       

768
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,910
  No matter how crazy or weird  
          you may be,           

769
00:31:51,912 --> 00:31:54,746
   that I could be some kind    
       of beacon of hope        

770
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,781
     for all those weirdoes     
           out there.           

771
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,216
         And thank you.         

772
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:03,086
          (all laugh)           

773
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,353
            - Katya.            

774
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,190
       - (Russian accent)       
     Charisma, uniqueness,      

775
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,192
         nerve, talent.         

776
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:12,228
    What do these qualities     
        have in common?         

777
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,664
         I don't know.          
      I'm not a scientist.      

778
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,665
          (all laugh)           

779
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,633
          I stand here          

780
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:21,737
      a charismatic woman       
      of grace and dignity      

781
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:25,841
  with a unique sense of humor  
       and point of view.       

782
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:31,446
    (no accent) In Season 7,    
   you let me show the world    

783
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:35,284
     that I'm good enough,      

784
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:40,055
          and here...           

785
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:44,993
           you let me           
       believe it myself,       

786
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:49,296
  and I can't thank you enough  
           for that.            

787
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:51,331
   Like they say in Russia...   

788
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:56,034
       (speaking Russian)       

789
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:57,902
     - What does that mean?     

790
00:32:57,904 --> 00:32:59,137
            - I have            
      a carburetor outside      

791
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:01,439
     that I just have to do     
         some work on.          

792
00:33:01,441 --> 00:33:05,008
          (all laugh)           

793
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,276
      - Thank you, Katya.       

794
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:08,444
          - Thank you.          

795
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,279
      - All right, Roxxxy,      
         same question.         

796
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:15,417
    - I came onto "AllStars"    
 to prove to America and myself 

797
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:18,886
       that I can compete       
    and do it the right way.    

798
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:20,754
       And if you decide        
          to crown me,          

799
00:33:20,756 --> 00:33:23,657
    I just want you to know     
   that I will never give up.   

800
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:26,093
   I'll always keep fighting    
         and, you know,         

801
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:29,296
        I can stand here        
      so proud of myself.       

802
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,297
             I won              
   when I walked in the door,   

803
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:33,967
   and every week after that,   
         I was winning.         

804
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:35,601
             (sobs)             

805
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:38,437
 I can't tell you not to crown  
    one of these three girls    

806
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:40,272
            because             
     they're so phenomenal.     

807
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:42,741
  But I want you to crown me.   

808
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:44,709
          (all laugh)           

809
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:46,845
      - Thank you, ladies.      

810
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,078
  I think we've heard enough.   

811
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,547
        While you untuck        
        in the workroom,        

812
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,348
       for the first time       
          this season,          

813
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,450
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

814
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,852
  Just between us girlfriends,  

815
00:33:57,854 --> 00:33:59,953
        let's just break        
      the shit down, okay?      

816
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,120
            Alaska.             

817
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,654
      - Every single week,      
           she's come           

818
00:34:02,656 --> 00:34:04,789
       and she has slayed       
        the competition.        

819
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,791
       - She understands        
     how Snatch Game works.     

820
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:08,592
       Either you know it       
         or you don't.          

821
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:10,593
             - Yep.             
       - And she got it.        

822
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:12,494
      - She's so prepared,      
           so smart.            

823
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,930
        Her Bette Davis         
       was off the chart.       

824
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:16,898
     - What I didn't expect     
          from Alaska           

825
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,435
was when she fell that she would
   be so bitter or childlike.   

826
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,036
   - Yes, she had a bad week    
     when her mom was here,     

827
00:34:23,038 --> 00:34:24,803
         but if you go          
        by the numbers,         

828
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:28,072
    she would probably still    
      get a 98 out of 100.      

829
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:30,507
      - She is a package.       
      She is ready for it.      

830
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:33,242
   - Let's talk about Detox.    

831
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,844
        - From a fashion        
       sensibility point,       

832
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:37,046
       she blew everybody       
       out of the water.        

833
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:42,083
  Every look, week after week,  
 told a story and told it well. 

834
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:43,450
      - I could see Detox       

835
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:45,686
  being the creative director   
       of a fashion house       

836
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:48,088
       because she's got        
      that kind of an eye.      

837
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,857
   - I like to watch somebody   
  who makes me feel something.  

838
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:53,326
     - She shows her heart      
          and her ass.          

839
00:34:53,328 --> 00:34:55,094
        - Yes, she does.        
             - Yes.             

840
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:58,096
          - All right.          
    Let's talk about Katya.     

841
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:02,433
   I mean, what a difference    
  from Season 7 to "AllStars."  

842
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,935
   - I love how zany she is.    

843
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,635
  I love that she takes risks.  

844
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,969
          - It's funny          
        and it's quirky,        

845
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,438
     but it's a very smart      
        sense of humor.         

846
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,507
       - And she does it        
      in a fun, fresh way       

847
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,042
     that invites everyone      
         to the party.          

848
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,410
      - And the potential       
      is endless, really.       

849
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:17,679
           - Endless.           
        Roxxxy Andrews.         

850
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:21,115
- I think she's kinder, softer, 
   sweeter and more polished.   

851
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:23,483
        And she was even        
  really polished in Season 5.  

852
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:24,751
           - She was.           
            - Yeah.             

853
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:25,918
   Not the greatest actress,    

854
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,354
    but I could look at her     
         all day long.          

855
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:30,189
          - She's been          
   in the bottom five times,    

856
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:34,225
  but she's one of those girls  
 that have such stage presence, 

857
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:35,527
     even if she's sucking,     

858
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:39,697
    you can't take your eyes    
          off of her.           

859
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:42,599
     - All right. Silence!      

860
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,935
     I've made my decision.     

861
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:47,638
      Bring back my girls.      

862
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,573
        (RuPaul laughs)         

863
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:52,942
        (RuPaul laughs)         

864
00:35:57,381 --> 00:35:59,081
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

865
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:02,350
    The winner of "AllStars"    
        will be inducted        

866
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:04,651
       into the Drag Race       
         Hall of Fame,          

867
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:10,023
  receive a crown and scepter   
designed by Fierce Drag Jewels, 

868
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:15,028
     and win a grand prize      
          of $100,000.          

869
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:21,933
       Ladies, each week        
I've named the top two AllStars,

870
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:25,069
           but after            
    this final deliberation,    

871
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:27,839
          three of you          
     have earned the right      

872
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,042
  to lip sync for your legacy.  

873
00:36:34,446 --> 00:36:37,347
            Alaska.             

874
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:40,049
             Detox.             

875
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:45,454
             Katya.             

876
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:48,990
     You are the top three      
    AllStars of the season.     

877
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:56,863
        Roxxxy, my dear,        
     this is not your time,     

878
00:36:56,865 --> 00:37:02,401
      but you are and will      
     always be an AllStar.      

879
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:06,204
        Now sashay away.        

880
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:14,144
  - I'm a little disappointed,  
 but I'm walking away so proud. 

881
00:37:14,146 --> 00:37:15,978
         I got to show          
        who I truly was.        

882
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,481
    I will forever be thick     
           and juicy.           

883
00:37:19,483 --> 00:37:20,915
            Bye-bye.            

884
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:23,885
    (laughter and applause)     

885
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:28,722
     - Ladies, this is your     
   last chance to impress me    

886
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:30,757
     and prove to the world     

887
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:35,963
       that you belong in       
  the Drag Race Hall of Fame.   

888
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:42,301
       The time has come        
      for you to lip sync       

889
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:47,740
   (echoing) for your legacy.   

890
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:54,113
           Good luck            
     and don't fuck it up.      

891
00:37:57,284 --> 00:38:00,351
   -  If I were your woman    

892
00:38:00,353 --> 00:38:03,187
     And you were my man      

893
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:06,723
           You'd have          
        no other woman         

894
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:10,259
   You'd be weak as a lamb    

895
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:13,996
   If you had the strength    

896
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:17,032
    To walk out that door     

897
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:20,234
            My love            
   would overrule my sense     

898
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:22,168
     And I'd call you back     
           for more            

899
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,538
     If I were your woman     

900
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,440
     If I were your woman     

901
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:31,910
     And you were my man      

902
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:35,280
           Mm, baby           

903
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,847
           -  Girl            

904
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,049
    - I should be America's     
      next drag superstar       

905
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:41,117
    because I'm the complex     
       female character.        

906
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,286
       I have the passion       
   do to something different    

907
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,488
         and disturbing         
        and challenging.        

908
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,657
  -  When she lets you fall   

909
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:52,192
   - I want to win "AllStars"   

910
00:38:52,194 --> 00:38:55,729
      because I'm obsessed      
   with "RuPaul's Drag Race."   

911
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:57,431
    I can't think of anyone     

912
00:38:57,433 --> 00:38:59,766
       who could possibly       
       have their picture       

913
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:02,769
      on that hall of fame      
          besides me.           

914
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:04,870
   -  You're a part of me     

915
00:39:04,872 --> 00:39:06,638
    - I should be America's     
      next drag superstar       

916
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,074
      because I want to be      
   the queen of the weirdoes.   

917
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:11,308
     I know I joke about it     
          all the time          

918
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,543
          where I say           
       the crown is mine,       

919
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:14,177
       but I really feel        
    like it's fucking mine.     

920
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:17,180
       And I deserve it.        

921
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:20,817
       I want it so bad.        

922
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,584
   -  If I were your woman    

923
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:23,885
     If you were my woman     

924
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:27,655
    -  Here's what I'd do     

925
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:32,026
      Never, never, never      
       stop loving you         

926
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:34,861
             - Wow.             

927
00:39:34,863 --> 00:39:39,265
           (applause)           

928
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:44,904
  - Ladies, the time has come   
      to crown our queen.       

929
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:51,742
    The winner of "RuPaul's     
      Drag Race AllStars,"      

930
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:54,912
         the next queen         
         to be inducted         

931
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:59,416
       into the Drag Race       
       Hall of Fame is...       

932
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:04,353
            Alaska.             

933
00:40:04,355 --> 00:40:08,090
     -  You're a champion,     
     greatest of them all      

934
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:10,826
       You're a champion,      
       never gonna fall        

935
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:12,427
          - (gasping)           

936
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:13,928
      - Con-drag-ulations.      

937
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,131
     You're a winner, baby.     

938
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:18,165
          - (sobbing)           

939
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,433
    - Here you are, darling.    

940
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:24,070
   On behalf of your millions   
   of fans around the world,    

941
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:27,907
    my queen, I bow to thee.    

942
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:31,043
     Now, is there anything     
       you'd like to say?       

943
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:33,678
   - Anus-thing is possible.    

944
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,682
        - Now, remember,        
  if you can't love yourself,   

945
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:40,617
        how in the hell         
 you gonna love somebody else?  

946
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,018
       Can I get an amen        
          up in here?           

947
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,186
            - Amen!             
            - Amen!             

948
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:45,321
          - All right.          
     Now, prance, my queen.     

949
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:46,723
            - Okay.             
           - Prance!            

950
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:50,559
     -  You're a champion,     
     greatest of them all      

951
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:53,763
     - I'm feeling so proud     

952
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:57,366
         and so honored         
        and so grateful.        

953
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:59,467
   I couldn't be more happy.    

954
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:02,671
     -  You're a champion      
 and you'll always be a hero
