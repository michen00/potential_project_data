1
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:06,838
    - Ladies and gentlemen,     
    for your consideration,     

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,176
     the best of the best,      
     my legendary children.     

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:16,547
    Category is "All-stars."    

4
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,019
  (speaking foreign language)   

5
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,557
    - My name is Yekaterina     
    Petrovna Zamolodchikova,    

6
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,091
   but you can call me Katya.   

7
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,093
            (snorts)            
      You may remember me       

8
00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:34,494
     as the lovable Russian     
      hooker from Season 7      

9
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:36,162
       with the crippling       
        anxiety problem.        

10
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:39,532
 But I'm back with a refillable 
    prescription for Xanax.     

11
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,367
  - Yowza, Babe-raham Lincoln.  

12
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,535
      Pass me the fucking       
        baby oil, bitch.        

13
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:46,503
           - You did            
     a beautiful obscenity.     

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,705
        - When do I get         
         to blow them?          

15
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,272
       I can't say that?        

16
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:51,773
  (speaking foreign language)   

17
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,408
      (laughs and snorts)       

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,709
       During my season,        

19
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,443
          I feel like           
    I held back out of fear.    

20
00:00:56,445 --> 00:00:57,944
            Whenever            
      anything went wrong,      

21
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:59,478
      I wanted to jump off      
       the hotel balcony.       

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,481
But this time around, I want to 
just spread my legs even wider. 

23
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:05,350
  (speaking foreign language)   

24
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:09,220
        - Well, this is         
      hauntingly familiar.      

25
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:11,288
       Here we go again.        

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,657
   Rehab is back in session.    

27
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,059
        My name is Detox        
    and I am from Season 5,     

28
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,728
    where I came in fourth.     

29
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,062
        - Oh, gorgeous.         
          - Gorgeous.           

30
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:21,597
           - Caw caw!           

31
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,798
      - She is a hot mess.      

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,566
            - Whoa!             
             - Oh!              

33
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:26,200
   - I didn't get my fucking    
           tag lunch,           

34
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:27,601
   and I want it, goddamn it.   

35
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:30,336
       - Hey, bitch. Hi.        

36
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:32,505
      - I'm really excited      
      to get to know Katya      

37
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:34,707
        because I think         
    she's bat fucking crazy.    

38
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:35,841
       My ass looks good.       

39
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,074
           - Your ass           
       always looks good.       

40
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:38,309
       - Did you get more       
        pumped into it?         

41
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,677
  - No, I've just gotten fat.   
            (laughs)            

42
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,579
    I'm here to put my face     
     in that hall of fame.      

43
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:44,781
   Give me the fucking crown.   

44
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:45,782
            (laughs)            

45
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:48,217
          - All right.          

46
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,252
         - Oh, my God.          

47
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,853
  - My name is Alyssa Edwards   

48
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:54,154
      and I need, I need,       
        I need, I need,         

49
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,523
        I need to get up        
     in this all-star gig.      

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,628
    Baby, I'm Alyssa Edwards    
     representing Season 5,     

51
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,532
       and I was a lovely       
        fifth alternate.        

52
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:09,634
     Thank the lords above.     

53
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:12,337
     I'm back, back, back,      
       back, back again.        

54
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,437
        (clicks tongue)         

55
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,238
   Alyssa Edwards, real miss.   

56
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,173
        'Cause I'm what?        
          Sick bitch.           

57
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:18,540
        (clicks tongue)         

58
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:20,508
         - Back rolls?          

59
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,377
       - Ooh, she has got       
      my Russia get-up on.      

60
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,078
      - I love that you're      
     wearing a cape again.      

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,345
   - You know, I didn't know    

62
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,179
  if I wanted to be Goldilocks  
        or Little Red--         

63
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,546
        - Red Riding Ho.        

64
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,547
        Alyssa Edwards,         
  she looks like just she did   

65
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,982
        when she walked         
          in Season 5,          

66
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:34,551
 just with a little better hair 
    and slightly less rolls.    

67
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:35,652
            (laughs)            

68
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:36,686
      - Girl, look at us.       

69
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:37,953
    - Get up in the mirror,     
             girl.              

70
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:40,589
    - This is a really good     
      picture. Okay, okay.      

71
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:42,957
       - You cannot have        
   a conversation with Alyssa   

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,992
     if you're in proximity     
          to a mirror.          

73
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:48,762
 And even if, like, Ed McMahon  
    had risen from the dead,    

74
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:51,197
      presenting her with       
       a $300,000 check,        

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,898
          she'd be...           
           (slurping)           

76
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,265
    One second, one second.     

77
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:57,635
    - It's nice to see that     
   they regrouted the brick.    

78
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:00,004
   And, no, I was not talking   
      about you that time.      

79
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:02,473
   - Oh, she already started,   
             girl.              

80
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:07,043
     The shade is knee deep     
    already, girl, day one.     

81
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,445
           - (laughs)           

82
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,782
             - Ooh.             

83
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:16,485
       - Riddle me this,        
        riddle me that,         

84
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,820
       watch out, girls,        
      this bitch is back.       

85
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:22,490
       I'm Phi Phi O'Hara       
   and I'm playing a villain.   

86
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:24,191
            Get it?             

87
00:03:24,193 --> 00:03:26,693
       I mean, I'll start       
       where I left off.        

88
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,661
        - You look good.        
    - Thank you, I showered.    

89
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:29,795
            - Bitch.            
             - Hey.             

90
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:31,629
        Last time, I had        
    a lot of built up anger     

91
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,131
  and stuff in me and I didn't  
  know how handle situations.   

92
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,298
      Tired ass show girl.      

93
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,799
  - At least I am a showgirl,   
             bitch.             

94
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,701
     Go back to Party City      
       where you belong.        

95
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:41,570
       - After my season,       

96
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:42,804
        a lot of people         
   had this perception of me,   

97
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,205
         so it was hard         
        to get bookings.        

98
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,906
    People genuinely thought    
          I would come          

99
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,407
           and, like,           
      blow their club up.       

100
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:48,742
    So it took a lot of work    

101
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,343
         to show people         
     that I'm professional.     

102
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:52,845
 I'm just really worried about  
 kicking your ass off the show. 

103
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:54,646
          (all laugh)           

104
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:55,646
            No, no,             
     I've changed my ways.      

105
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,381
    No sabotaging this time.    

106
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:58,648
      My drag has changed.      

107
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,349
     My makeup has changed.     
       I stopped tanning.       

108
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:03,486
    I want the world to see     
      that I have changed.      

109
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:05,854
        (clears throat)         

110
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:08,923
            - Whoo!             

111
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:13,694
     - Come on, all-stars,      
  let's get...this over with.   

112
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,095
          (all laugh)           

113
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:18,631
  Ribbit, ribbit, the glamour   
    toad is in the building.    

114
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,299
       - Where in England       
      are you from, Adele?      

115
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,567
          - My house.           

116
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,201
  I flood my basement, bitch.   

117
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:25,136
              Aah!              

118
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:27,004
      Ginger Minj is back       
    with a vengeance, baby.     

119
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,772
      It's a whole new me.      

120
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:30,874
             - Aah!             
             - Aah!             

121
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:33,643
       - You better pose,       
   bathing suit competition.    

122
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,211
    - Oh, my God, it's good     
     to see you, diarrhea.      

123
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:38,413
            Season 7            
       got a lot of hate        

124
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,482
     for being a lackluster     
        bunch of girls,         

125
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:43,117
      so I am here to say,      
        now, Miss Thang,        

126
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,253
    we are just as talented     
           and worthy           

127
00:04:45,255 --> 00:04:46,787
  as the rest of these girls.   

128
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,991
  You look so much better with  
   half of your face covered.   

129
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,526
     Oh, wait, I'm supposed     
     to be nice this time.      

130
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:56,296
  Everyone looks so beautiful.  

131
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:57,864
     I'm wearing a corset,      
            though.             

132
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:00,098
Apparently, all it takes to win 
 is a corset, so I bought one.  

133
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
             - Oh.              
        - Ooh, ooh, ooh.        

134
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,868
     - We'll edit that out.     
             - Ooh.             

135
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,036
      - Will they, though?      
           Will they?           

136
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,838
      - No, they will not.      

137
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:10,707
   - Thick and juicy's back,    
            bitches.            

138
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,075
             - Oh!              
             - Oh!              

139
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,076
  - My name is Roxxxy Andrews,  
        and I still rep         

140
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:16,177
         for the girls          
    who are thick and juicy     

141
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,211
       'cause even though       
         I lost weight,         

142
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,612
  I'm always thick and juicy.   

143
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:20,546
 I don't care if I'm 300 pounds 
         or 200 pounds,         

144
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:22,582
        thick and juicy         
       is Roxxxy Andrews.       

145
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:26,352
         I'm so excited         
       to be here today.        

146
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:30,154
      - All that ass. Bam!      

147
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:32,656
       - So what has been       
      your favorite moment      

148
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,557
  throughout this competition?  

149
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,226
          - Seeing you          
       in the bottom two.       

150
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:38,328
          On Season 5,          

151
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,895
     I let the competition      
      get the best of me,       

152
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:41,763
    and I was playing messy.    

153
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,632
   So I have a lot to prove.    

154
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,167
     I can compete and win      
      because I deserve it      

155
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,534
        and not because         
    I'm knocking people out     

156
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,336
     by playing mind games.     

157
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:50,871
       - Oh, yes, bitch!        

158
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:52,839
         - Oh, my God,          
     my baby Roxxxy's here.     

159
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,406
        - Not the Rotox.        

160
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:55,874
      - When I saw Detox,       

161
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:58,410
       I was like, bitch,       
    we get to do this again.    

162
00:05:58,412 --> 00:05:59,577
        That's my girl.         

163
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,345
     - There's a lot of you     
        Season 5s here.         

164
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:03,513
    - That's funny, because     
  I think 4 put it on the map.  

165
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:05,148
         - Oh. (laughs)         

166
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:08,784
            - Okay.             
          (all laugh)           

167
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,418
        - Oh, no, ma'am.        

168
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,055
       - Orange you girls       
        happy to see me?        

169
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:20,959
        - The face crack        
        of the century.         

170
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,231
      - Bitch, that was so      
        three years ago.        

171
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,899
            - Yeah!             
          (all laugh)           

172
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,768
         - Girl, we had         
       buried the hatch.        

173
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,603
    We put it in the ground     
         12 feet under.         

174
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:35,604
   She ain't coming back out,   
             okay?              

175
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:37,106
      - Come on, Season 5.      

176
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,907
             - Yes!             

177
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,175
     - I am Coco Montrese.      

178
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:43,445
    I was the lip-synch diva    
          of Season 5.          

179
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:46,614
     - Girl, you look like      
    the black PeeWee Herman.    

180
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:47,848
           (laughter)           

181
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,682
    - Girl, look how orange     
       you fucking look.        

182
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:52,051
    - I'm not joking, bitch.    

183
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:54,152
          (all laugh)           

184
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:55,787
        - Girl, you got         
      some Dorito fantasy?      

185
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,354
          - Yes, girl.          
         - Let me see.          

186
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:58,722
   - Look how orange I look.    

187
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:01,091
    - I'm not joking, bitch.    

188
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,125
    - Girl, you're covering     
     your face in that hat.     

189
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:05,760
  Show them that pretty skin.   
     It ain't that orange.      

190
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,162
         - Girl, that's         
      custom couture made.      

191
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:09,963
         - In a garage.         

192
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:12,231
          - Some girls          
   don't change their makeup.   

193
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,533
 It's the same black eye shadow 
     and the same lipstick.     

194
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:18,137
  I am not gonna say no names,  
        Roxxxy Andrews.         

195
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:22,607
          - Greetings.          

196
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:27,912
 My message for the human race  
    is really quite simple.     

197
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,714
         Hi-ee. Hi-ee.          

198
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,083
            - Whoo!             
             - Hi.              

199
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,184
     - I think I was chosen     
         as an all-star         

200
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:38,423
     because nobody can do      
     Alaska except Alaska.      

201
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,790
  But I encourage you to try.   

202
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,824
           It's fun.            

203
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:43,559
             - Aah!             
      - I just wrote anus.      

204
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,727
    Little poundcake enjoys     

205
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,663
      being a straight up       
      mother-fucking pig.       

206
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:49,964
          (all laugh)           

207
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:52,532
     I will stand out from      
    the rest of these queens    

208
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:57,670
    because I am more "all"     
   and I'm more "star" like.    

209
00:07:57,672 --> 00:08:01,241
     Star-ish. Star-esque.      

210
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:03,776
         - Mwah, mwah.          

211
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:06,244
         - I just came          
        from Party City.        

212
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,746
     I'm the groupon girl.      

213
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:10,915
    - Don't we look pretty?     
            - Yeah.             

214
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,883
         - Five from 5.         
          - Oh, girl.           

215
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,151
      - Yeah, five from 5.      
      - Season 5 all over.      

216
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:17,386
     Last time I was here,      

217
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:20,622
        I was concerned         
     about my relationship      

218
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:23,458
         and how people         
      were perceiving me.       

219
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,894
     And now, it's just me,     

220
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,264
        and I'm focused         
         and galvanized         

221
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:32,267
  and ready to take the crown.  

222
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,004
             - Aah!             
          - Thank you.          

223
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:39,272
      - Morgan McMichaels       
        walks into the--        

224
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:40,573
    Wait, that's not Morgan?    

225
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:44,108
     - My name's Tatianna.      

226
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,143
  I placed fourth on Season 2   

227
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:47,511
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."    

228
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:49,446
     Thank you. Thank you.      
           Thank you.           

229
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,547
          The suspense          
    is boring me to pieces.     

230
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,815
   Tyra is a complete bitch.    

231
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:56,718
      What's up, hookers?       

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,652
         - Hey, bitch.          
        - Kylie Jenner.         

233
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:00,854
         - She is beat.         

234
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,121
   - I think the other queens   

235
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:04,390
         are thinking,          
   all this is really right.    

236
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:07,293
  - Girl, how excited are you   
   to be back up in this gig?   

237
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:08,560
        - I'm so ready.         

238
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:09,827
   - You're the only 2 here.    

239
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:11,628
       Tatianna might be        
        the weakest link        

240
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,231
   only because she's kind of   
      like the old school.      

241
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:17,533
  She's from the old batch of,  
     you know, "Drag Race"      

242
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,735
     and "Drag" has changed     
   so much since her season.    

243
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:22,971
      - Come on, Season 2.      
        Let's get sexy!         

244
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,706
  - Come on through, Season 2.  

245
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,841
          (all laugh)           

246
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:28,241
 - If they'd watched Season 2,  
        they should know        

247
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,842
    not to underestimate me,    

248
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:32,444
    'cause it doesn't really    
      work out in the end.      

249
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,379
           Thank you.           

250
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:39,384
            - Meow.             

251
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:42,587
             - Yay!             
           - Oh shit!           

252
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,255
   - My name is Adore Delano,   
     and I'm a messy slut.      

253
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:46,556
            (laughs)            

254
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:48,692
           I'm known            
    for being really messy.     

255
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,727
    - Give me one that Logo     
   will actually sign off on.   

256
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:53,229
      - Oh, okay. Because       
     big dicks are French?      

257
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:55,564
            (laughs)            
      It was very subtle.       

258
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:56,899
      I'm a fuckin Libra.       

259
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,734
  (speaking foreign language)   

260
00:09:58,736 --> 00:09:59,834
       - Are you cinched?       

261
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:01,936
    - Um, I have a hog body     
           right now.           

262
00:10:01,938 --> 00:10:04,071
           (rapping)            

263
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,773
       I'm fucking hood.        
        I'm from Azusa.         

264
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,442
       I'll stab a bitch.       
            (laughs)            

265
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,243
          - All right.          

266
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:13,412
          - Bitch, hi!          

267
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:15,881
   - Adore Delano giving you    

268
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:18,350
        smell my punani         
    poetic justice realness.    

269
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:19,717
       - Adore Cilantro.        

270
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,019
      - Mwah, mwah, gals.       

271
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,320
             Yeah.              

272
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:27,822
      I want to look like       
      a Monster High doll.      

273
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:30,958
       My drag sell today       
    is a bit controversial.     

274
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,625
        I'm inspired by         
      the grunge movement,      

275
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,293
     the riot girl movement     
        of the nineties,        

276
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,927
      but a lot of people       
        don't get that.         

277
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:38,295
    They'd like to say that     
    I'm lazy about my drag,     

278
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:40,097
        but I love being        
        a nonconformist.        

279
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:43,500
   I mean, I can't crowd surf   
          in a corset.          

280
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:44,934
  - Who's ready to make teams?  

281
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,035
             - No.              
      - Please, no teams.       

282
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,670
    I fuck belong by myself.    

283
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:50,304
          (all laugh)           

284
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,072
            (alarm)             
             - Oh!              

285
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:54,207
          - Ooh, girl.          

286
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,809
        - She's already         
         done had hers.         

287
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:59,110
     - I've heard that shit     
         in my dreams.          

288
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:02,480
          - My queens,          
     the best of the best.      

289
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:04,181
    Welcome to "All Stars."     

290
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:06,183
         At this point          
      in the competition,       

291
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:09,519
  I have to ask the question.   

292
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:12,722
    Who deserves to go home     
        tonight and why?        

293
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,223
        What, too soon?         

294
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:18,659
            (laughs)            

295
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:21,861
     - Oh, my fucking God.      
             - Bye.             

296
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:24,930
     - Hello, hello, hello.     

297
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:27,131
            - Shit?             
     (cheers and applause)      

298
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:30,200
     - Crazy. My darlings.      

299
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:32,101
        I can't believe         
          you're back.          

300
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:33,536
          No, really,           
  I can't believe you're back.  

301
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:36,872
I thought the restraining order 
      was still in effect.      

302
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,173
       Hey, famous thang.       

303
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,674
      You know, there are       
     so many fierce queens      

304
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,809
   I could have invited back.   

305
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:45,611
     But you 10 were chosen     

306
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:47,747
       because I believe        
        that each of you        

307
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,216
      still has something       
        to prove to me,         

308
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:54,119
     to your fans, and most     
    importantly to yourself.    

309
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:56,755
    So from this moment on,     

310
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:01,492
   everything you do is about   
     building your legacy.      

311
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,528
            - Okay.             
            - Yeah!             

312
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,063
          - But wait.           

313
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:08,765
         There's more.          

314
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,033
   Because you are all-stars,   

315
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:15,871
   I will not be eliminating    
    any queens this season.     

316
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:17,472
            - What?             

317
00:12:17,474 --> 00:12:18,540
             - What?            

318
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,110
         - Bitch, what?         

319
00:12:23,112 --> 00:12:25,846
      - What's happening?       
    We're all freaking out.     

320
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:27,681
    - What was the question?    

321
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,084
   - The winner of "RuPaul's    
      Drag Race All Stars"      

322
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,652
   receives a one-year supply   

323
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,120
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills   
           cosmetics,           

324
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:39,822
     a coveted spot in the      
   "Drag Race" hall of fame,    

325
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:43,259
        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000,          

326
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,595
       with extra special       
   guest judge Raven-Symone.    

327
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:47,996
    -  RuPaul's drag race     

328
00:12:47,998 --> 00:12:51,533
    -  May the best woman,     
        best woman win         

329
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,570
        (RuPaul laughs)         

330
00:12:56,572 --> 00:13:01,707
  - I will not be eliminating   
    any queens this season.     

331
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:03,209
            - What?             
            - What?             

332
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,076
  - Because you are all-stars,  

333
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,214
    I will only be rewarding    
            success.            

334
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:12,016
           Each week,           
   instead of the bottom two    

335
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:14,651
          lip-synching          
        for their lives,        

336
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:18,488
   the top two will lip synch   
        for their legacy,       

337
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,558
         and the winner         
        will receive...         

338
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,326
            $10,000.            

339
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,127
             - Ooh!             
          - Holy shit!          

340
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,095
           - Bitch!             

341
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,864
           - Shut up!           

342
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:32,933
      - Bitch better have       
           my money.            

343
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:35,535
     - This totally changes     
          everything.           

344
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,003
     Nobody's gonna go home     
       the whole season,        

345
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:39,305
       and we get $10,000       

346
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:43,108
         in addition to         
  the grand prize of $100,000.  

347
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,309
           Oh, fuck.            

348
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,543
       I could walk away        
     from this competition      

349
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:49,813
    with at least $350,000.     

350
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:52,415
     I didn't go to fucking     
        school for math.        

351
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,850
   - Now let's take a moment    

352
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:56,686
      to get reacquainted       
       "Drag Race" style.       

353
00:13:56,688 --> 00:13:58,654
         Oh, pit crew.          

354
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,856
             - Ooh.             
             - Ooh.             

355
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,757
          - Darlings,           
     in the great tradition     

356
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,093
     of "Paris Is Burning,"     
        reading is what?        

357
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,794
         - Fundamental.         
         - Fundamental.         

358
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:09,929
           - Exactly.           

359
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:12,898
   - Day one of "All Stars,"    
read the hell out of each other.

360
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,634
      Get up out of here.       

361
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:18,336
       - Phi Phi O'Hara,        
      you're up, darling.       

362
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:20,938
       - This is so hard        
   when they're your friends,   

363
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,240
          which is why          
      this should be easy.      

364
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:25,008
          (all laugh)           

365
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,843
  You know what Adore and the   
   value menu have in common?   

366
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:29,512
       They're both cheap       
        and full of fat.        

367
00:14:29,514 --> 00:14:31,513
          (all laugh)           

368
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,747
       Adore, I'm sorry.        
   Can you move out the way?    

369
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:34,214
   Sweetie, if you don't have   
          a wristband,          

370
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,816
      you can't be in here      
    for the meet and greet.     

371
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:37,684
          (all laugh)           

372
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:43,221
     - Alyssa, you are like     
  the Abby Lee Miller of drag.  

373
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:45,123
  Except when Abby Lee Miller   
       dresses her body,        

374
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,758
         she can cover          
        her back rolls.         

375
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,692
          (all laugh)           

376
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:51,128
    - Hold my clutch, bitch,    
 and let me take this cape off. 

377
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,297
      - And Venus Delight.      
        - Bye. See you.         

378
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:56,699
            Goodbye.            

379
00:14:56,701 --> 00:15:00,001
        - Janet Hagson.         
 Oh, I'm sorry, Coco Montrese.  

380
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:02,704
   How exciting for you that    
   Janet has a new album out.   

381
00:15:02,706 --> 00:15:04,706
          You can both          
    come out of retirement.     

382
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,808
             - Oh!              
            - What?             

383
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,609
     - Tatianna, thank you      
    for letting the PAs know    

384
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:11,111
     who to pack up first.      

385
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:16,048
        - Coco Montrese,        
    I always wanted to know     

386
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,149
    what the female gremlin     
  would look like in 25 years.  

387
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,917
          (all laugh)           
            - Fuck!             

388
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,352
     - That was a good one,     
             bitch.             

389
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,356
   - Ginger Minj, in my eyes,   
        the true winner         

390
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,792
      of Season 7 of TLC's      
"I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant." 

391
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,793
          (all laugh)           

392
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,863
    Roxxxy Andrews, I think     
    about you all the time,     

393
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,165
   especially in the morning    
        at the bus stop.        

394
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,300
             - Ooh!             
             - Oh!              

395
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:40,903
     - Too soon? Too soon?      

396
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:46,073
       - Alyssa Edwards,        
        my darling dear,        

397
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,775
        I can't stand it        
       when you're near.        

398
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:50,543
     Come on, Mother Goose.     

399
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:55,515
    - Alaska, I'm sure Katya    
 can see you from her backyard. 

400
00:15:57,985 --> 00:16:00,818
       - Coco, thank you        
    for proving in Season 5     

401
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,787
          that orange           
       is the new black.        

402
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,122
          (all laugh)           

403
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:07,357
   Adore Delano, do you know    
         what makes you         

404
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,793
  the number one fan favorite   
          of all time?          

405
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:10,860
             - No.              

406
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:13,495
        - Neither do I.         

407
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:17,366
- Allow me to introduce to you, 
        "Monsters, Inc."        

408
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:19,034
          (all laugh)           

409
00:16:19,036 --> 00:16:22,436
        - Alaska gutted.        

410
00:16:22,438 --> 00:16:26,540
    Roxxxy Andrews, rotted.     

411
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:31,678
        Phi Phi O'Hara,         
         gila monster.          

412
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,082
       And that brings us       
    to Coco Montrese, bitch!    

413
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:38,717
          (all laugh)           

414
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:41,286
      - Alaska, I finally       
    got to listen to "Anus,"    

415
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,154
          and I get it          
     'cause it sounds like      

416
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:46,857
       what my anus does        
     after eating Mexican.      

417
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:48,525
         Mmm, choices.          

418
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,259
          (all laugh)           

419
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:53,128
        Alyssa Edwards,         
      you are so talented,      

420
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,762
   and you haven't let it go    
         to your head.          

421
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,098
     Nothing's changed you      
       or your overbite.        

422
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,333
          (all laugh)           

423
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,669
        - Coco Montrese,        
        doesn't it suck         

424
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,337
    that it took you longer     
       than my existence        

425
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,905
         to figure out          
  what shade of makeup to use?  

426
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:09,508
          - Peg Bundy           
       ate Kelly and Bud.       

427
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,008
          (all laugh)           

428
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,610
     Party! Roxxxy Andrews,     

429
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:15,445
        it's good to see        
  a filler bitch this season,   

430
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:18,680
      and I'm not talking       
        about that ass.         

431
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:20,816
           - Alaska,            
    like her outfit, trash.     

432
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,851
          (all laugh)           

433
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:25,619
       Coco, way too old.       

434
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:28,222
       And Adore Delano,        
          um, really?           

435
00:17:28,224 --> 00:17:30,657
          (all laugh)           

436
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:32,925
  - Y'all bitches are hateful.  

437
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,694
      - Detox. No, really,      
          I mean that.          

438
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:40,365
        This is actually        
       your intervention.       

439
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:43,834
  You should really stop this.  

440
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:47,070
         Adore Delano,          
       these other girls        

441
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:50,005
     are gonna say you have     
    terrible makeup skills,     

442
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:53,208
   you have no fashion sense,   
   and you're dumb as a rock.   

443
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,709
       But they're wrong.       

444
00:17:54,711 --> 00:17:57,178
         You don't have         
    terrible makeup skills.     

445
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,912
          (all laugh)           

446
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:03,016
        Roxxxy Andrews,         
        obviously a diet        

447
00:18:03,018 --> 00:18:05,952
     consisting of nothing      
  but hatred for Jinkx Monsoon  

448
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:07,086
       does a body good.        

449
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,755
          (all laugh)           

450
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,857
      Come on, All Stars,       
     let's get all started.     

451
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:15,092
       Oh, brrrrrr. Chh!        

452
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,895
          (all laugh)           

453
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,062
      - All right, ladies.      

454
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:23,866
          The library           
     is closed officially.      

455
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,734
        The winner is...        

456
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,004
            Alaska.             

457
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,274
      You've won a $2,000       
         shopping spree         

458
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:36,942
     for glamorous glasses      

459
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:40,712
     at the legendary house     
        of LA Eyeworks.         

460
00:18:40,714 --> 00:18:41,913
          - All right.          

461
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:43,914
            - I won             
     the reading challenge.     

462
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,250
     I'm not trying to win      
       Miss Congeniality.       

463
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,185
       I'm trying to win        
          "All Stars."          

464
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:54,090
   - And I'll be posting more   
  of your reads at LogoTV.com.  

465
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,291
             - Yes.             

466
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:58,126
       - Now, ever since        
       you sashayed away,       

467
00:18:58,128 --> 00:19:01,029
        I've had my eye         
     on each and every one      

468
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:03,030
  of your astonishing careers.  

469
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,832
        You've all come         
       a long way, baby.        

470
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:07,767
        And to prove it,        
 for your first maxi challenge, 

471
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:15,975
   I'm throwing an "All Star"   
   talent show extravaganza.    

472
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:18,610
       Tomorrow, in front       
      of a live audience,       

473
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:20,646
    you'll each get a chance    
           to show us           

474
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:25,150
 how your charisma, uniqueness, 
  nerve and talent has grown.   

475
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:29,287
      #dragracetalentshow.      
        (clicks tongue)         

476
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:30,621
           (applause)           

477
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:33,156
           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines,       

478
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:36,626
            and may             
     the best All Star win.     

479
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,260
   - It's like I never left.    

480
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,362
     - Oh, home sweet home.     

481
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:43,564
    - Roxxxy, don't unpack.     
   It's a talent show, okay?    

482
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,700
            - Whoo.             
           - (laughs)           

483
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:47,634
     - Our first challenge      
       is a talent show.        

484
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,835
       This is showing Ru       
      who is an all-star,       

485
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:51,570
     so you've got to make      
          a statement           

486
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:52,937
  coming right out the shoot.   

487
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:55,940
     - Twinning. Twinning!      

488
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:58,942
         - Oh! (laughs)         

489
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,644
 - Oh, girl, they left you out. 
   - I don't do that no more.   

490
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:03,045
   - I would've bought three,   
         but, you know,         

491
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,448
     Rolaskatox didn't work     
       for us last time.        

492
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,651
     Rolaskatox is Roxxxy,      
       Alaska and Detox.        

493
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:10,985
          Rolaskatox.           

494
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:12,720
    She's moved on from us.     

495
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:14,054
        The Rotox show.         

496
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:19,559
      - The original parts      
    of Rolaskatox are here,     

497
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:21,393
  however, that does not mean   

498
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,929
            the band            
   is getting back together.    

499
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,666
      - What are you doing      
     for your talent show?      

500
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:30,100
        Are you dancing?        

501
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:31,834
     - I'm gonna do, like,      
  a little gymnastics routine.  

502
00:20:31,836 --> 00:20:33,302
            - Work!             

503
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:35,603
     - What are you doing?      
   - I'm a singer/songwriter,   

504
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:37,572
    so I'm gonna sing a song    
         that I wrote.          

505
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:38,839
  - What song are you singing?  

506
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:40,307
  - Well, I'm actually singing  
          a cappella.           

507
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:45,177
         - A cappella.          

508
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,544
    Girl, I've been singing     
         my whole life,         

509
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,612
  and I don't sing a cappella.  

510
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,814
   If you go off your tempo,    

511
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,050
  your timing, your anything,   
         you are fuck.          

512
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,417
  - I know it's pretty ballsy,  

513
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:57,085
       but, like, I hope        
         that it shows          

514
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,053
     that I'm a real singer     
  tomorrow without any music.   

515
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:00,454
      - You do what you do      

516
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,022
        and your fucking        
   tells us if you work hard.   

517
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,558
   - Nothing like a sensible    
   tank top with rhinestones.   

518
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,727
     Very subtle, you know.     

519
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,229
   - I brought fan underwear.   

520
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:12,329
        - Fan underwear?        

521
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,063
        Like, underwear         
        a fan gave you?         

522
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,398
     - Yeah, on the stage.      

523
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,334
       - People give you        
   their underwear on stage?    

524
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:19,468
             - Yes.             

525
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,568
      - Those have always       
        brought me luck.        

526
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,904
    - You're like Tom Jones,    
           basically.           

527
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,105
   - I'm like David Cassidy.    
             Look.              

528
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:28,008
           - (laughs)           
    - America's sweetheart.     

529
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,244
     My biggest competition     
      in this talent show       

530
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,045
            I think             
     is going to be Adore.      

531
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,213
    She's got a great voice.    

532
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:39,518
     -  When you love me      

533
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,220
    - This is something that    
she's gonna do very, very well, 

534
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:45,089
 and it scares me a little bit  
       because right now,       

535
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,356
  you want to be on that top.   

536
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,292
     You want that $10,000      

537
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:50,727
and you want to show the judges 
    that you're an all-star.    

538
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:52,095
    You deserve to win this.    

539
00:21:52,097 --> 00:21:53,497
    So let's get this done.     

540
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,533
         - [Voiceover]          
          Coming up...          

541
00:21:56,535 --> 00:22:00,403
   - RuPaul's not eliminating   
      anyone this season.       

542
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:02,438
    Do you feel like people     
        are going home?         

543
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,038
         What's coming?         

544
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,207
          I'm scared.           

545
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,908
        (RuPaul laughs)         

546
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,511
        (RuPaul laughs)         

547
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,847
        - Hey, hey, hey.        

548
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:19,551
         - We are here.         
         H-E-R-E, here.         

549
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:22,554
- Time to get ready for the "All
Star" talent show extravaganza. 

550
00:22:22,556 --> 00:22:24,656
  I haven't done a talent show  
   since, like, third grade.    

551
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:25,656
         I sang Selena.         

552
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:27,591
            (laughs)            

553
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:29,526
   - I'm just really nervous.   

554
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,527
          I feel like           
   it's too good to be true,    

555
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:33,462
        and I feel like         
     people are going home.     

556
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:38,801
   RuPaul said that he's not    
eliminating anyone this season, 

557
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:43,672
but I think we're all just sort 
 of feeling an impending doom.  

558
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:46,208
       What's the twist?        
         What's coming?         

559
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,375
          I'm scared.           

560
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:54,280
  So why did you two decide to  
   come back for "All Stars?"   

561
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:57,316
  - I feel like I want to show  
   everyone where I'm at now.   

562
00:22:57,318 --> 00:22:59,284
      - It's been a while.      
     - It's been a minute.      

563
00:22:59,286 --> 00:23:01,219
         I have figured         
      a lot of things out.      

564
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:02,386
          - Like what?          

565
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:04,188
       - Like to not shop       
          at Wet Seal           

566
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,490
     when you're gonna come     
    to "RuPaul's Drag Race."    

567
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:09,192
           - (laughs)           
     But it was different.      

568
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:11,595
      Like, it was sort of      
    more like ready-to-wear     

569
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:14,330
         and over time,         
     the show has evolved.      

570
00:23:14,332 --> 00:23:15,364
            - Yeah.             
          - You know.           

571
00:23:15,366 --> 00:23:16,565
         - I came back          
        'cause I think--        

572
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:17,599
         I mean, I have         
     a whole lot to prove.      

573
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:19,533
             I have             
    a whole public audience     

574
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:20,901
          that thinks           
       I'm a certain way,       

575
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:22,635
     and I don't want them      
     to think I'm that way.     

576
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,970
    - Oh, you mean everyone     
    thinking you're a bitch?    

577
00:23:24,972 --> 00:23:26,504
           - Oh, ooh.           

578
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,039
   - I do have a bitchy side    
   and that's an honest side.   

579
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,540
    I just want them to know    
       there's more to me       

580
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,276
      than just some angry      
     little orange monster.     

581
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:33,343
             - Ha!              

582
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,645
   - I was super embarrassed    

583
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,681
    about how I was behaving    
    and acting on Season 4.     

584
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,416
   I do have a lot to prove,    
  especially to the audience.   

585
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,652
 And at the same time, my drag  
 style has completely changed.  

586
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:46,488
   Now I do a lot of cosplay,   
 and it's really cool and fun.  

587
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,423
          I'm not just          
    this tired ass showgirl.    

588
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:51,459
  There is a star in Phi Phi,   
   and she's ready to shine.    

589
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:53,160
          This is like          
    a family reunion to me.     

590
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:55,295
 This is fun. Like, how are we  
     gonna fight and stuff?     

591
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:56,429
           - I'm sure           
       you'll find a way.       

592
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:58,965
           - (laughs)           

593
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,000
          - You know,           
      Roxxxy's over there.      

594
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:02,134
          (all laugh)           

595
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:05,504
       - Don't be shady.        
           Be a lady.           

596
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:07,339
  - I was a bitch on Season 5.  

597
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:08,639
    This isn't a joke to me.    
     - I don't think it's--     

598
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:10,540
       - This competition       
     is extremely serious.      

599
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,209
      You're Jinkx Monsoon      
      playing a character.      

600
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:15,410
         A lot of girls         
     want to blame editing,     

601
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,978
     and I'm not that girl.     

602
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,480
    I said the things I did.    
   I played those mind games.   

603
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:22,583
    Anything on this TV show    
   that is said, you said it.   

604
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:24,351
     I let the competition      
           get to me.           

605
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:26,619
      I was playing dirty       
        and at the time,        

606
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:28,320
             Jinkx,             
   I'm so close to the crown    

607
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:29,921
            that how            
      am I gonna get her?       

608
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:31,389
         I'm obviously          
    not as funny as she is.     

609
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:34,291
          I'm obviously         
     not as smart as she is     

610
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:35,559
  and I have to do something.   

611
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:39,929
   And my stupid self said...   

612
00:24:42,866 --> 00:24:46,768
 I've learned from my mistakes  
   and I changed my attitude    

613
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,235
    and there's no way that     
     that can happen again.     

614
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,769
       I don't want to be       
           that girl.           

615
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:51,637
      I mean, I won't be.       

616
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,005
           I refuse.            

617
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:54,873
   This is our second chance.   
       Redemption, honey.       

618
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:56,175
    -  Can I get an amen?     

619
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:58,076
    -  Can I get an amen?     

620
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:00,978
      - Some of the girls       
     might be more focused      

621
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,979
       on rehabilitating        
        their reputation        

622
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:05,247
        rather than just        
    winning the competition.    

623
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:06,949
          But I'm here          
       to show the world        

624
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:10,451
     that I've turned into      
    a total fucking monster.    

625
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:13,454
            (laughs)            

626
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,758
        (RuPaul laughs)         

627
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,862
 -  Cover girls, put the bass  
         in your walk          

628
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,868
          Cover girls,         
  put the bass in your walk    

629
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,170
          Head to toe,         
   let your whole body talk    

630
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:36,305
          Cover Girl          

631
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:39,041
           (applause)           

632
00:25:40,244 --> 00:25:41,542
  - Welcome to the main stage   

633
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:44,211
     of "RuPaul's Drag Race     
          All Stars."           

634
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:47,347
        Michelle Visage,        
  what's a nice girl like you   

635
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:49,314
  doing in a place like this?   

636
00:25:49,316 --> 00:25:52,450
      - Well, in the words      
    of a famous older woman,    

637
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:54,351
       we are all stars.        

638
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:58,289
      - (laughs) And style      
   superstar Carson Kressley,   

639
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,390
  are you ready to be gagged?   

640
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,324
     - I don't gag easily,      
            but yes.            

641
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:03,691
           - (laughs)           

642
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:06,861
      The newest addition       
   to our "Drag Race" family,   

643
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:09,062
  the incredible Todrick Hall.  

644
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:10,763
      - Thank you so much       
       for having me, Ru.       

645
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,098
       You look amazing.        

646
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,068
   - And the super talented,    
       Ms. Raven-Symone.        

647
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:19,371
   No, Symone is how you say    
        her name, okay?         

648
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:21,240
          Yes, hello.           
   - It's true. It's Symone.    

649
00:26:21,242 --> 00:26:23,274
  - I'm so happy you're here.   

650
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,476
    - I'm so happy I'm here.    
      I missed your face.       

651
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:26,977
          - Thank you.          
          - (chuckles)          

652
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:28,878
          - This week,          
     I challenged my girls      

653
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,915
  to showcase their charisma,   
  uniqueness, nerve and talent  

654
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:35,950
        in an "All Star"        
         extravaganza.          

655
00:26:35,952 --> 00:26:38,820
           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines,       

656
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:41,122
  and may the best woman win.   

657
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,758
   Coming up, Roxxxy Andrews,   

658
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,293
         Detox, Katya,          

659
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:47,660
      and Alyssa Edwards.       

660
00:26:47,662 --> 00:26:52,030
    - We are one step closer    
  to finding Alyssa's secret.   

661
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,199
          - (inhales)           

662
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,101
        (RuPaul laughs)         

663
00:26:57,304 --> 00:27:00,204
        (RuPaul laughs)         

664
00:27:00,206 --> 00:27:05,041
  - Welcome to the "All Star"   
   talent show extravaganza.    

665
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:08,911
        First up, Adore.        
        Talent, singing.        

666
00:27:08,913 --> 00:27:11,981
     (cheers and applause)      

667
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,449
           -  Baby,            
     you're a work of art      

668
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:17,384
       A shooting star        

669
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:20,119
   Lighting up the darkness   

670
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:25,691
            So lucky           
   that we found this, yeah    

671
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:27,859
     You know you've got me    
         losing sleep          

672
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:32,297
        I can't believe        
  the beauty of this moment    

673
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:37,001
            It's all           
       I've ever wanted        

674
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:40,638
     But I can't love you     

675
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,472
    I can't love you today    

676
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:44,507
        I can't love you       
           tomorrow            

677
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:47,276
   I can't love you anyway    

678
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,513
    I can't love you anyhow   

679
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:53,248
       I can't love you,       
           love you            

680
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,182
    How are you guys feeling    
         tonight, cool?         

681
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:56,884
     (cheers and applause)      

682
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:58,652
    I can't love you today    

683
00:27:58,654 --> 00:28:00,887
        I can't love you       
           tomorrow            

684
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,823
   I can't love you anyway    

685
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:09,294
       I can't love you,       
           love you            

686
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,294
           Thank you.           

687
00:28:10,296 --> 00:28:13,230
     (cheers and applause)      

688
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:15,298
            - Party!            

689
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,801
   - Up next, Alyssa Edwards.   

690
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:20,436
        Talent, variety.        

691
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:23,271
       - Alyssa Edwards,        
         welcome back.          

692
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:25,273
    - That's right, Mama Ru,    
           I'm back,            

693
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:26,874
   just minus the back rolls.   

694
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:29,076
    - Now, I have a feeling     

695
00:28:29,078 --> 00:28:35,082
  that we are one step closer   
  to finding Alyssa's secret.   

696
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:36,784
      Let the music play.       

697
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:39,553
         - [Voiceover]          
        Long, long ago,         

698
00:28:39,555 --> 00:28:41,955
   there was a little gay boy   
          from Texas.           

699
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:43,856
  - Mesquite, Texas, darling.   

700
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:47,392
   Baby, hand me that script    
and let me tell the real story. 

701
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,028
        I packed a bag,         
       hopped on a plane        

702
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,230
  and moved all the way here.   

703
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:57,668
        Alyssa Edwards,         
        a star is born.         

704
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,970
         - [Voiceover]          
        Girls and boys,         

705
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:02,337
         live tonight,          

706
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:06,341
        our kind of gal,        
        Alyssa Edwards.         

707
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:10,511
     - Alyssa's performance     
   is quintessential Alyssa.    

708
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,512
  She has a puppet of RuPaul.   

709
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,414
      She has a tear-away.      
        It's everything.        

710
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,883
         -  Oh, she's          
       our kind of girl        

711
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:19,452
          - That's me.          
           All right.           

712
00:29:19,454 --> 00:29:21,720
      -  I'm back, back,       
    back, back, back again     

713
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:23,455
       Giving you a dose       
     of what's happening       

714
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,389
        All these crowns       
      I'm snatching them       

715
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:27,658
       Got more discards       
       than the Vatican        

716
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,293
     My name's Ms. Edwards,    
        I'm a champion         

717
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,771
        - Coco Montrese.        
        Talent, dancing.        

718
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:54,782
          - I decided           
     to step out of my box      

719
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:56,884
          just to show          
  a different side of myself.   

720
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,652
   I hope it pays off for me    
           this time.           

721
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:15,934
     - We all make choices,     

722
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:17,903
     but that was a choice.     

723
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:37,522
           (applause)           

724
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:40,791
  - Detox. Talent is singing.   

725
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:44,862
        -  Supersonic,         
       it's supersonic         

726
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:49,333
          We're on it,         
   yeah, don't you want it?    

727
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:53,036
      - Detox is spraying       
     glow paint everywhere.     

728
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:54,971
       Girl, don't get it       
         on the dress.          

729
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,375
     (cheers and applause)      

730
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:03,578
         -  Majestic,          
    the future is electric     

731
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,814
            Erratic,           
    accelerate the static      

732

       it's supersonic         

733
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:25,064
          We're on it,         
   yeah, don't you want it?    

734
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:28,133
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

        Talent, singing.        

736
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:35,773
    -  When I was a child     

737
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:38,976
    I asked the starry sky    

738
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:44,680
       What will I be?        

739
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:49,051
          A butterfly,         
         a better me?          

740
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:52,954
     'Cause it's hard to be    
   a different kind of boy     

741
00:31:52,956 --> 00:31:57,558
      Making lots of noise     
     inside a crazy world      

742
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,829
         When you take         
  all those feelings inside    

743
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:06,500
          And you want         
       to run and hide         

744
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:13,507
            So fly,            
     wings lit by a flame      

745
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:18,478
     Don't worry how high     

746
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,681
      Dream your own way      

747
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:26,985
      Dream your own way

         a little bit?          

764
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:11,946

          I'm gonna go         
         lose my mind          

767
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,382
      Oh, DJ, can you find     
      just another beat        

768
00:34:17,384 --> 00:34:19,484
       To give me life        

769
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:22,187
          - (inhales)           
 -  With the melody of music  

770
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:24,122
         Moving through        
        our veins, ah          

771
00:34:24,124 --> 00:34:27,791

787
00:35:50,764 --> 00:35:55,366
       - There are times        
         when it seems          

788
00:35:55,368 --> 00:36:02,072
     that the world doesn't     
    appreciate me being me.     

789
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:05,142
        I haven't always        
          been pretty.          

790
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:09,479
  I haven't always been nice.   

791
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:18,821
   But I've always been...    

792
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:23,760
     (cheers and applause)      

793
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:27,163
             Gay              

794
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:33,301
      I'm pretty and witty     
     and dapper and clean      

795
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:36,337
      I'm campy and classy     
      and cunty and mean       

796
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:41,242
    I'm the queeny-est queen   
   of the queeny-est queens    

797
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:53,020
          I'm as girly         
       as a girl can be        

798
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:56,389

       "The Same Parts."        

802
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,199
         - This piece.          
            (laughs)            

803
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,268
     - People at the party,     

804
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,270
   and I'm wanting to dance.    

805
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,406
     Other ugly-ass bitches     

806
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:20,009
   ain't standing no chance.    

807
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:24,747
    Dudes looking at me like    
 they want to get in my pants.  

808
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:29,150
        Come on, bitch,         
     see me with the pants.     

809
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:31,818
     See me with the pants.     

810
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,020
     His back on the wall.      

811
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:36,355
      My ass on his hump!       

812
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:39,725
     Grinding for a second.     

813
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:41,960
   His stuff's getting thick.   

814
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:43,661
      - (gasps) Ooh, girl.      

815
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:45,730
     - He doesn't know it,      

816
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,799
   but I'm getting firm, too.   

817
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:51,334
  His boys really need to know  

818
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:55,038
     before calling me boo.     

819
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,106
      Because what you see      

820
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,142
    isn't always the truth.     

821
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,476
        Say it with me.         

822
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:03,644
          What you see          

823
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:05,879
    isn't always the truth.     

824
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:08,881
           Thank you.           
       Because, baby boy,       

825
00:38:08,883 --> 00:38:11,784
  I've got all the same parts   
          that you do.          

826
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,220
        The same parts.         

827
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:17,888
          (lower voice)         
         The same parts.        

828
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,422
           (laughter)           

829
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:22,658
          (whispering)          
        The same parts.         

830
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,694
     (cheers and applause)      

831
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:26,861
           Thank you.           

832
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:28,496
     - The nineties beatnik     

833
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:33,701
   doing a spoken word piece    
      about her genitals.       

834
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:35,869
       Tatianna's number        
    is my absolute favorite.    

835
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:38,872
     (cheers and applause)      

836
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:41,541
       - Welcome, ladies.       

837
00:38:41,543 --> 00:38:44,710
     Now, week after week,      
      season after season,      

838
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:47,312
  I've had the thankless task   

839
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:52,550
of sending home some of my most 
 beautiful and talented girls.  

840
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,652
     Now, for "All Stars,"      

841
00:38:55,654 --> 00:38:58,188
          I've decided          
    to turn over a new leaf.    

842
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:01,456
     Yesterday, I promised      

843
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:05,260
   I wouldn't be eliminating    
          any of you,           

844
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:07,995
        and that's true.        

845
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:10,130
      Because this season,      

846
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:11,899
    you'll be eliminating...    

847
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:16,002
          Each other.           

848
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:21,273
            - Okay.             

849
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:24,109
    Welcome to "All Stars."     

850
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,313
        (RuPaul laughs)         

851
00:39:30,516 --> 00:39:33,116
        (RuPaul laughs)         

852
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:36,052
         - This season,         

853
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,821
    you'll be eliminating...    

854
00:39:40,225 --> 00:39:41,891
          Each other.           

855
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:45,826
         That's right.          

856
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:48,796
          In addition           
     to receiving $10,000,      

857
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:51,464
  the winner of the lip synch   

858
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:54,400
    will be given the power     

859
00:39:54,402 --> 00:40:00,406
          to eliminate          
   one of the bottom queens.    

860
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:03,908
     Now who's your sister      
            in drag?            

861
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,412
  - Now it's up to us to vote   
   each other off the island?   

862
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:11,447
        Bitch, what show        
       did I sign up for?       

863
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,350
   - I'm in a complete state    
           of shock.            

864
00:40:16,352 --> 00:40:17,617
            I forgot            
     what I was gonna say.      

865
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:21,021
        - Now, based on         
        your performance        

866
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:22,888
  in the talent extravaganza,   

867
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,990
   I've made some decisions.    

868
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,660
        Alyssa Edwards,         

869
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:30,028
             Detox,             

870
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,196
             Katya,             

871
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:36,200
       you are all safe.        

872
00:40:36,202 --> 00:40:37,467
          - (exhales)           

873
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,703
         - Please step          
   to the back of the stage.    

874
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,840
   The rest of you represent    

875
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,309
      the tops and bottoms      
          of the week.          

876
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,712
         Now it's time          
   for the judges' critiques.   

877
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:53,981
        First up, Adore.        

878
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:55,982
     - First and foremost,      
     this is "All Stars 2."     

879
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:57,484
        This is the best        
          of the best.          

880
00:40:57,486 --> 00:41:01,187
   I mean, we are looking at    
  such a powerhouse of talent.  

881
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:03,656
    I'm going to break down     
           all the T.           

882
00:41:03,658 --> 00:41:06,625
  If you get hurt, get over it  
       and up your game.        

883
00:41:06,627 --> 00:41:08,260
           Moving on.           

884
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:11,029
          I will say,           
      on a positive note,       

885
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:12,397
    I didn't hate your hair.    

886
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,997
         - Oh, thanks.          
  - Which, when you came out,   

887
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,032
           I thought            
      I was gonna hate it.      

888
00:41:15,034 --> 00:41:16,699
        It didn't suck.         
         - It's human.          

889
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,401
   - It really doesn't matter   
   whether it's human or not.   

890
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:19,534
       - I did it myself.       

891
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:21,169
    - That shows you've done    
           something.           

892
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:24,472
             - Oh.              
  - Because the outfit, girl.   

893
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:25,572
            - Okay.             

894
00:41:25,574 --> 00:41:27,341
           - This is            
      a 14th Street dress,      

895
00:41:27,343 --> 00:41:29,109
  like, that doesn't fit you.   

896
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,844
  I don't care if you're gonna  
   give me your hog body line   

897
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:33,546
       or whatever it is.       
         - Oh, my God.          

898
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:35,181
          - It's just,          
    I expected more for you.    

899
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:36,948
  We see your stuff out there.  
    You're doing your thing.    

900
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,183
     You've got your album.     

901
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:39,985
           - Mm-hmm.            
  - You're rocking the world.   

902
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:43,288
       - Why the gloves?        

903
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,056
   - I thought it looked cool   
     to just kind of, like,     

904
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:47,290
      have the focus point      
        be on the legs.         

905
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:48,491
           I thought            
      it was pretty neat.       

906
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:50,159
           - I think            
      your rock star-ness       

907
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:51,694
   needs to be more leather.    

908
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,128
    - I've got a lot of it,     
             girl.              

909
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,062
    - I know, and it needed     
  to happen, 'cause it didn't.  

910
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:57,164
     - Yeah, but, I mean--      
             yeah.              

911
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,364
       - But do you care?       

912
00:41:58,366 --> 00:41:59,631
         'Cause, like,          
    everything's like blas.    

913
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:02,000
   - Girl, I completely care.   

914
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:04,669
  I mean, I've expected, like,  
     you to kind of go ham,     

915
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,204
       but you went ham,        
           so I mean,           

916
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,105
    that's a human reaction     
     to kind of feel shit.      

917
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:10,107
   - But when I think of you,   
   I don't think of somebody    

918
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:11,442
          who's gonna           
        come out wearing        

919
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:13,444
     some type of glamorous     
     crazy cinched outfit,      

920
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:14,911
          and I think           
   that's part of your brand,   

921
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:16,279
         and I thought          
      you sounded amazing.      

922
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:17,880
      - Thank you so much.      

923
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:21,250
- All right. Let's move on down 
       to Coco Montrese.        

924
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:23,218
          - I thought           
    it was a very brave move    

925
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,752
        to do something         
      very old Hollywood,       

926
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:27,354
  but I lost your choreography  
        with the dress.         

927
00:42:27,356 --> 00:42:30,157
        And once it got         
  30 seconds into the number,   

928
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,291
          it was just           
      kind of predictable.      

929
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:34,460
        - I was waiting         
    for something to happen,    

930
00:42:34,462 --> 00:42:35,661
         but the train          
   didn't leave the station.    

931
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:38,963
     - Here's my main thing     
            tonight.            

932
00:42:38,965 --> 00:42:41,332
        In your season,         
        you were orange.        

933
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:44,402
       Tonight, you went        
     from Doritos to soot.      

934
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:46,971
       - I thought maybe        
   you were trying to give us   

935
00:42:46,973 --> 00:42:48,672
  that kind of silver screen,   
      old Hollywood look,       

936
00:42:48,674 --> 00:42:49,839
   but then I thought, wait,    

937
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:51,474
     the face and the hands     
        aren't matching.        

938
00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:52,774
   - Yeah, I ran out of time    
       and didn't do my--       

939
00:42:52,776 --> 00:42:54,309
   - Didn't get to the hands.   
            - Yeah.             

940
00:42:54,311 --> 00:42:55,543
      - I wish your hands       
       would've matched.        

941
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:57,244
           Then maybe           
  you could've sold it to us.   

942
00:42:57,246 --> 00:42:58,245
            - Okay.             

943
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,247
    - Up next, Ginger Minj.     

944
00:43:00,249 --> 00:43:01,615
    - Regarding your voice,     

945
00:43:01,617 --> 00:43:03,316
      I thought your pitch      
          was perfect.          

946
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:05,317
     - But I felt like this     
   was a song you would sing    

947
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,419
    after already performing    
        for 30 minutes.         

948
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:10,054
      This is "All Stars."      
     I was expecting more.      

949
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:11,756
      - You look beautiful      
            tonight,            

950
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,458
 but one thing you have to keep 
in mind being a plus-sized girl,

951
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,028
when you wear a Palazzo jumpsuit
in that kind of stretchy jersey,

952
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,697
    when you walk, it creeps    
  and it gives you a Va-gegy.   

953
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,833
   Literally, I couldn't take   
  my eyes off of your vagina.   

954
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,901
          - Thank you.          

955
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,070
          (all laugh)           

956
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,272
   - Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.   

957
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,540
      - Your Balma dress.       

958
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:34,608
      You're tiny, Phiph.       

959
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:37,577
     It totally encompasses     
     your teeny little body     

960
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:39,112
          and you just          
        look like a box.        

961
00:43:39,114 --> 00:43:42,415
      - I think the dress       
     is spectacular. Sorry.     

962
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,250
  - When you started to sing,   

963
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:47,286
 those first couple of bars of  
that a cappella was so powerful.

964
00:43:47,288 --> 00:43:49,921
     - But then I couldn't      
    even focus on your voice    

965
00:43:49,923 --> 00:43:51,889
      because it was going      
     in and out of the key      

966
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:53,690
 and the audience was clapping  
  completely different rhythm.  

967
00:43:53,692 --> 00:43:56,025
   - Right. I would've loved    
        for there to be         

968
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:57,392
  some support for your voice,  

969
00:43:57,394 --> 00:44:00,428
       because it did get       
        a little wonky.         

970
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,664
   - Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.   

971
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:05,099
     - I'm grateful to see      

972
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,600
    that even though through    
 your weight loss and fitness,  

973
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,101
       you're still thick       
           and juicy.           

974
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,769
   - This ass and these legs    
      ain't going nowhere.      

975
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:11,237
   - Thank you, Dr. Zizmore.    

976
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:13,138
          (all laugh)           

977
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,439
   - I haven't been turned on   
       by a man like that       

978
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:16,240
      in a very long time.      

979
00:44:16,242 --> 00:44:19,110
    - Maybe you don't sing,     
   maybe you don't tap dance,   

980
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:22,646
      but what you do have      
       is major charisma.       

981
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:24,814
    You're such a superstar.    

982
00:44:24,816 --> 00:44:26,215
   - And I loved the reveals.   

983
00:44:26,217 --> 00:44:27,682
          It was like           
    a Russian nesting doll.     

984
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:28,817
   There was wig under a wig.   

985
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:31,151
        Your performance        
         was an event.          

986
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:32,519
     - I happen to have on      

987
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:34,487
          an extra wig          
      underneath this one.      

988
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:35,488
          (all laugh)           

989
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,989
  Thank you very much, Roxxxy.  

990
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,989
          - Thank you.          

991
00:44:37,991 --> 00:44:40,191
      - Up next, Tatianna.      

992
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:41,525
    See me with them hands,     
             bitch.             

993
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:43,393
   - See me with them hands.    

994
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:45,895
      - Look at that body.      
        Are you cinched?        

995
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:47,162
          - A little.           

996
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:50,232
      - I'm gonna fucking       
         key your car.          

997
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:52,600
   - I was the most skeptical   
     about your performance     

998
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,801
  because it was so long since  
   the time you were on here.   

999
00:44:54,803 --> 00:44:56,803
     But you were so fresh      
        and so current,         

1000
00:44:56,805 --> 00:44:59,405
    and I think that you're     
  a force to be reckoned with   

1001
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:00,572
      in this competition.      

1002
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:02,106
     - You let your smarts      
        do the talking,         

1003
00:45:02,108 --> 00:45:03,774
         and I thought          
    that was really clever.     

1004
00:45:03,776 --> 00:45:05,675
   There was double entendre.   

1005
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:06,943
     - You had me at piece.     

1006
00:45:06,945 --> 00:45:09,012
           - (laughs)           

1007
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:12,281
     - That was so amazing,     
            so good.            

1008
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:15,150
 - And congratulations on your  
 face, because you're gorgeous. 

1009
00:45:15,152 --> 00:45:17,719
            - Okay?             
      Face is beat, bitch.      

1010
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:20,121
       The face is beat.        

1011
00:45:20,123 --> 00:45:21,021
          - Thank you.          

1012
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,022
          - Thank you.          

1013
00:45:22,024 --> 00:45:24,557
       - You're welcome.        

1014
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:27,959
           - Up next,           
  last but not least, Alaska.   

1015
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:29,227
     - Your song is genius.     

1016
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:30,527
  I felt like I took mushrooms  

1017
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:31,662
        and was watching        
       "Pick of Destiny,"       

1018
00:45:31,664 --> 00:45:35,299
      and then you flew in      
        on Valcore and--        

1019
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:37,467
          (all laugh)           

1020
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,368
       - And I love that        
     you out-gayed even me.     

1021
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:42,504
          (all laugh)           
  I mean, that was fantastic.   

1022
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,006
  My only negative, I would've  
     like a different nail.     

1023
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,375
 - Yeah. They just drew so much 
 attention away from the dress. 

1024
00:45:48,377 --> 00:45:49,743
      - I love the nails,       
           you guys,            

1025
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:53,413
    'cause they're so wrong     
         and so right.          

1026
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:55,849
      - Thank you, ladies.      
   I think I've heard enough.   

1027
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:58,684
            Based on            
     the judges' critiques,     

1028
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:00,886
   I've made some decisions.    

1029
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:06,191
   Roxxxy Andrews, Tatianna,    

1030
00:46:06,193 --> 00:46:09,494
you are the top two "All Stars" 
          of the week.          

1031
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:11,997
           (applause)           

1032
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:13,565
       Con-drag-ulations.       

1033
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:16,701
        You've each won         
   a custom jewel collection    

1034
00:46:16,703 --> 00:46:18,703
    from Fierce Drag Jewels.    

1035
00:46:18,705 --> 00:46:21,372
     - I am in the top two.     

1036
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:22,907
      I cannot believe it.      

1037
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:24,508
    I'm ready to lip synch,     
             child.             

1038
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,641
        What's my song?         

1039
00:46:25,643 --> 00:46:29,779
        - I am so happy.        

1040
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:35,884
       - Alaska, Ginger,        
         you are safe.          

1041
00:46:35,886 --> 00:46:42,924
     That means Adore, Coco     
          and Phi Phi,          

1042
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,493
  you are in the bottom three.  

1043
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:49,428
         - I'm crushed.         

1044
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,597
          I'm baffled.          

1045
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:54,665
        I just feel like        
        I'm gonna vomit.        

1046
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:56,032
   Like, I watch competitions   

1047
00:46:56,034 --> 00:46:57,967
  and I'm like, how do people   
       get to that point?       

1048
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:00,568
  And it's not a good feeling   
            at all.             

1049
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,971
     Uh, no, it's...uh-uh.      

1050
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:08,442
     - Tatianna and Roxxxy,     
  each of you needs to decide   

1051
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:11,111
   which of the bottom queens   
        you'll eliminate        

1052
00:47:11,113 --> 00:47:13,513
   if you win the lip synch.    

1053
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:17,382
    And I'll remind you that    
  the winner of the lip synch   

1054
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:20,786
     will win $10,000 cash.     

1055
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:26,724
      So while you ladies       
  deliberate in the work room,  

1056
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:30,427
  the judges and I will enjoy   
       a fruity cocktail.       

1057
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:31,795
           - (slurps)           

1058
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:33,563
   - You may leave the stage.   

1059
00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:35,298
          Coming up...          

1060
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,000
   - I'm gonna lose a friend.   

1061
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:39,934
     - She's gonna probably     
    send me home next week.     

1062
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:42,403
  I'm gonna send her home now.  

1063
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:44,371
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1064
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,973
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1065
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,542
            - Girl.             

1066
00:47:52,544 --> 00:47:55,044
  - As we walk into the room,   
   you could hear a pin drop.   

1067
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:56,312
          It's silent.          

1068
00:47:56,314 --> 00:47:58,012
       We're all nervous        
     because we don't know      

1069
00:47:58,014 --> 00:47:59,780
     how this deliberation      
       is going to work.        

1070
00:47:59,782 --> 00:48:02,349
     You don't really know.     

1071
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:04,051
    - I do not envy you guys    
            at all.             

1072
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,919
     I would not want to be     
     in your fuckin shoes.      

1073
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:07,587
      - We're eliminating       
          our sisters.          

1074
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,754
  - Exactly. That's the thing.  

1075
00:48:08,756 --> 00:48:10,455
        - And, you know,        
        what do you do?         

1076
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:13,257
     Eliminate competition      
  or do you eliminate somebody  

1077
00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:14,759
       because you think        
        they were weak?         

1078
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,193
       - Do you eliminate       
 who you think did the weakest  

1079
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,828
    or do you eliminate the     
 strongest to-- (clicks tongue) 

1080
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:23,099
     - And if you squeak by     
 just because of a friendship,  

1081
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,933
     don't you think, like,     
     the backlash from that     

1082
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,401
     is going to be worse?      

1083
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,735
      It needs to be fair.      

1084
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:31,505
       - This sucks, but        
   a decision has to be made.   

1085
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:34,241
         My perspective         
     is you have to base it     

1086
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:35,742
  off of the challenge itself.  

1087
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:37,543
  That seems like the only way  

1088
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:41,080
   we can find some fairness    
 out of this entire crazy thing 

1089
00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:43,549
   that Ru has thrown at us.    
             - Yes.             

1090
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:46,151
 - If there's a week where you  
  feel like I was like booger,  

1091
00:48:46,153 --> 00:48:48,452
         send me home.          

1092
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:50,221
            - Yeah.             
           - Exactly.           

1093
00:48:50,223 --> 00:48:53,624
 - But a lot of what they said  
 negative, I didn't agree with. 

1094
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:58,261
 And if I'm going to have to be 
the judge at the end of the day,

1095
00:48:58,263 --> 00:49:00,230
      like, I'm going off       
      of what I'm thinking      

1096
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:02,165
      and not necessarily       
  what the judges are saying.   

1097
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:05,534
  - But, you know, that's why   
   they're the professionals.   

1098
00:49:05,536 --> 00:49:07,736
  - Well, it's funny, because   
     I said, you know what?     

1099
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:08,937
    I don't need to be paid.    

1100
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:10,438
        I will pay you.         

1101
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,772
             - Oh!              
             - Yes!             

1102
00:49:11,774 --> 00:49:14,241
         - I like that.         
   - It's the truth, though.    

1103
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,609
           - (laughs)           

1104
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:17,710
      - This is delicious.      
             - Mmm.             

1105
00:49:17,712 --> 00:49:20,913
    - Let's say a few weeks     
         down the line,         

1106
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:24,549
 there's someone that you know  
  could totally kick you off.   

1107
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:25,850
       Things can change.       

1108
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:27,550
     Like, we could totally     
         be like, nope,         

1109
00:49:27,552 --> 00:49:28,885
      she's gonna probably      
    send me home next week.     

1110
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:30,752
  I'm gonna send her home now.  

1111
00:49:30,754 --> 00:49:31,886
   - That's what would suck.    

1112
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:33,454
             Bitch,             
   I could've sent you home,    

1113
00:49:33,456 --> 00:49:34,454
and now you just want to send me
 home because you're spiteful?  

1114
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:35,788
          Okay, well--          

1115
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:36,922
     - Well, it's not even      
     necessarily spiteful,      

1116
00:49:36,924 --> 00:49:39,323
            more so             
     than being strategic.      

1117
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:43,827
    - I don't think that the    
 decision to send someone home  

1118
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:47,664
  will always be based on the   
  challenge or the critiques.   

1119
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:51,167
    I think later on, people    
    will choose friendships.    

1120
00:49:51,169 --> 00:49:54,136
     I think alliances will     
 definitely start to factor in  

1121
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:56,772
      and girls will start      
    kicking off other girls     

1122
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:59,674
  who they feel are a threat.   

1123
00:49:59,676 --> 00:50:01,842
     Anything could happen      
       in this situation.       

1124
00:50:01,844 --> 00:50:02,776
      - This is the thing.      

1125
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:04,277
    If we stick to critiques    

1126
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:06,446
     and everybody say that     
 that's what we're going to do, 

1127
00:50:06,448 --> 00:50:08,948
     then you know already      
       who's going home.        

1128
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:10,416
         - Do you know          
    who you're sending home?    

1129
00:50:10,418 --> 00:50:12,518
      - No. I want to have      
        the conversation        

1130
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,853
     with all three girls,      
    just for a quick second.    

1131
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:16,388
    You want to come first?     

1132
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:21,458
        - I'm terrified.        

1133
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,693
   All I'm thinking right now   

1134
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:24,861
  is, like, you just got here   

1135
00:50:24,863 --> 00:50:26,129
      and then you get put      
         in the bottom          

1136
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:27,363
          on something          
      that you love doing.      

1137
00:50:27,365 --> 00:50:30,099
      And you haven't even      
        shown the world         

1138
00:50:30,101 --> 00:50:32,801
    this Phi Phi that you've    
  worked so hard to build up.   

1139
00:50:32,803 --> 00:50:34,468
     And I don't feel from      
   from the judges critiques    

1140
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,736
      I was in the bottom.      

1141
00:50:35,738 --> 00:50:37,003
       I honestly don't.        

1142
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:38,638
       I think they were        
      way harder on Coco,       

1143
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,240
     and I think they were      
    extremely hard on Adore.    

1144
00:50:41,242 --> 00:50:44,009
       - I'm going off of       
 who I thought was the weakest, 

1145
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:45,576
        and that's what         
    I'm making my decision.     

1146
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:47,010
- No, totally, no, and I get it,
        but it's scary.         

1147
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:51,315
       I worked too hard        
          to be here.           

1148
00:50:51,317 --> 00:50:53,950
      - Phi Phi is upset,       
     and I don't blame her.     

1149
00:50:53,952 --> 00:50:55,918
   I feel for her and I think   
     I'd feel the same way.     

1150
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,589
     But at the same time,      
       I know for myself,       

1151
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:00,856
  I came to play a fair game,   

1152
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:02,558
    and I'm going to choose     
      the girl that I feel      

1153
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,327
    was the girl that RuPaul    
        would send home.        

1154
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:10,365
 - I'm not pulling anyone over  
   to talk to them in private   

1155
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,300
        because based on        
       the performances,        

1156
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:13,568
   I have a pretty good idea    

1157
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,739
    of who I will eliminate     
         if I have to.          

1158
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:20,540
     - What's the D, bitch?     

1159
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:23,242
    - Girl, it's a struggle.    

1160
00:51:23,244 --> 00:51:25,777
         - I'm feeling          
       a bit embarrassed.       

1161
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:26,978
           You know,            
    working on my confidence    

1162
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,746
   and just growing so much,    

1163
00:51:28,748 --> 00:51:30,347
      I didn't think that       
    a lot of these feelings     

1164
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:31,515
     would be coming back.      

1165
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:33,217
     And it's not a feeling     
          that, like,           

1166
00:51:33,219 --> 00:51:35,785
    I'm completely obsessed     
        with right now.         

1167
00:51:35,787 --> 00:51:37,220
          My thing is,          
        I came into here        

1168
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:40,423
     with a different idea      
  of what it was going to be.   

1169
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:41,657
   I literally work at, like,   

1170
00:51:41,659 --> 00:51:43,992
        punk rock venues        
   for a living with a band.    

1171
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,894
     Like, I wear T-shirts      
     and, like--I'm like--      

1172
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,496
   I'm like a drag musician,    
   so to be told that, like,    

1173
00:51:49,498 --> 00:51:52,365
   I have to be put back into   
 a bubble of cinching my waist, 

1174
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:54,467
      it's just not the G       
            for me.             

1175
00:51:56,103 --> 00:51:58,670
   I, like, wrote this song,    

1176
00:51:58,672 --> 00:52:02,307
         and this shit          
       is personal to me.       

1177
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:08,579
     Like, music is, like,      
    my fuckin gateway, man.     

1178
00:52:08,581 --> 00:52:10,714
         So it's hard.          

1179
00:52:10,716 --> 00:52:12,416
       - I get it, girl.        

1180
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:17,387
        You belong here.        

1181
00:52:17,389 --> 00:52:20,123
          I think that          
    it was just a hard day.     

1182
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:22,491
       I feel like Adore        
       came back on here,       

1183
00:52:22,493 --> 00:52:26,261
   but she didn't think over    
            the part            

1184
00:52:26,263 --> 00:52:30,132
about going back on that runway 
     and exposing yourself      

1185
00:52:30,134 --> 00:52:32,233
 and putting yourself up there  
        to be critiqued.        

1186
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:33,934
       And I don't think        
    she was ready for that.     

1187
00:52:33,936 --> 00:52:36,437
   - Cocs, she wants to talk.   

1188
00:52:36,439 --> 00:52:39,072
   - My heart's in my stomach   
           right now.           

1189
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:40,506
          I'm praying           
       that Roxxxy wins.        

1190
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:42,941
  We're from the same season.   
     We're closer sisters.      

1191
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:44,109
     - What's the T, girl?      

1192
00:52:44,111 --> 00:52:45,777
        - I stepped out         
     of what I normally do.     

1193
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:47,578
  I do it seven nights a week.  

1194
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,446
      And then, it's like,      
        yeah, we get it,        

1195
00:52:49,448 --> 00:52:51,347
      but you needed to be      
       a little bit more.       

1196
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:53,782
         I'm like, I...         

1197
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:56,485
   - Now, if you were in this   
   position, what do you do?    

1198
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:59,121
     If I sent Adore home,      
          we just met.          

1199
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:00,688
      She's gonna be like,      
 oh, well, she's still a bitch. 

1200
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,524
      If I sent you home,       
   you're my lifelong friend.   

1201
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:05,059
       We go back before        
       all this bullshit.       

1202
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:08,361
    I'm gonna lose a friend.    
             - No.              

1203
00:53:08,363 --> 00:53:10,463
         - You tell me          
    if I send Phi Phi home,     

1204
00:53:10,465 --> 00:53:11,831
        is she not gonna        
      stop talking to me?       

1205
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:13,365
     - I feel like Roxxxy's     
            leaning             

1206
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:15,401
       a little bit more        
        towards Phi Phi.        

1207
00:53:15,403 --> 00:53:17,202
  I'm hoping that's the case.   

1208
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:18,736
        - You know what?        

1209
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,337
        This is a fuckin        
         hard decision.         

1210
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:22,272
         Is this money          
    really going to be worth    

1211
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:24,573
           me losing            
   these girls' friendships?    

1212
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:26,908
   There's too much at stake.   

1213
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,077
  - I know this was your whole  
     hang-up coming into it     

1214
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:32,046
        was them coming         
      for your aesthetic.       

1215
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:33,280
         - Completely.          

1216
00:53:33,282 --> 00:53:35,548
   - Adore's very opinionated   
        about her look,         

1217
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:38,784
and I knew particularly Michelle
     was gonna go in on it      

1218
00:53:38,786 --> 00:53:41,387
    because she and Michelle    
    had this dynamic on tour    

1219
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:43,955
  where she would go every day  
    that we would do a show,    

1220
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:45,423
    she would go, Michelle,     
 what do you think about this?  

1221
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:46,924
          And Michelle          
      would just go, ugh.       

1222
00:53:46,926 --> 00:53:48,325
      - But when it comes       
         to aesthetic,          

1223
00:53:48,327 --> 00:53:51,861
    I've taken all of their     
   fuckin amazing knowledge,    

1224
00:53:51,863 --> 00:53:54,263
    shit that Michelle and I    
    argue with on the road,     

1225
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:55,397
          I've taken--          
         - Constantly.          

1226
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,497
        And I've taken.         

1227
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:57,865
        - And I've taken        
       and I've used it.        

1228
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,067
    And I brought all this T    
          to come here          

1229
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:02,436
     and fit the challenges     
     in my own definition.      

1230
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:03,870
        - And get where         
      they're coming from.      

1231
00:54:03,872 --> 00:54:04,804
     They're feeling 'cause     
     you're in "All Stars,"     

1232
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:06,338
  they want you to step it up.  

1233
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,174
  But it's like, this, to me,   
  for you, is stepping it up.   

1234
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,775
   - If they're ruining this,   

1235
00:54:10,777 --> 00:54:13,477
      what Bianca Del Rio       
       picked out for me,       

1236
00:54:13,479 --> 00:54:15,413
     girl, like, good luck.     

1237
00:54:15,415 --> 00:54:17,014
             Uh...              

1238
00:54:20,018 --> 00:54:22,085
           (sniffles)           

1239
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:26,555
       I've worked a lot        
       on my confidence,        

1240
00:54:26,557 --> 00:54:29,624
        and I feel like         
         the critiques          

1241
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:32,292
 were picking at the confidence 
        that I built up.        

1242
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:35,095
       And at this point,       
     it's bringing me back      

1243
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:38,531
       to baby Adore days       
       of being defeated,       

1244
00:54:38,533 --> 00:54:42,435
    and I can't relive that.    

1245
00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:47,172
      - You're all wrong,       
    because it's pork chop.     

1246
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:48,907
             - Oh!              
          (all laugh)           

1247
00:54:48,909 --> 00:54:51,743
      - Wait, wait, wait.       
       Silence, silence!        

1248
00:54:51,745 --> 00:54:54,212
        Bring back my...        

1249
00:54:54,214 --> 00:54:56,948
        (inhales deeply)        

1250
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,549
             Girls.             

1251
00:55:02,888 --> 00:55:04,454
         - This is it.          

1252
00:55:04,456 --> 00:55:07,557
 We have to pick out a lipstick 
of who we think should go home. 

1253
00:55:08,993 --> 00:55:11,826
   - (sighs) It's definitely    
        a heavy feeling.        

1254
00:55:11,828 --> 00:55:14,162
        These are girls         
       that we're friends       

1255
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:16,897
      and we work together      
     out in the real world.     

1256
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:21,134
   And you know that you have   
the power to dash their dreams. 

1257
00:55:26,507 --> 00:55:28,507
        - I think I know        
     who I'm sending home.      

1258
00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:32,810
  And if I win this lip sync,   

1259
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:34,878
    I don't feel like she's     
   going to talk to me again.   

1260
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,882
     But I just--I can't--      

1261
00:55:38,884 --> 00:55:40,183
   I can't eliminate somebody   

1262
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:41,784
          that I feel           
     should still be here.      

1263
00:55:41,786 --> 00:55:42,752
      I just can't do it.       

1264
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:47,422
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1265
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,892
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1266
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:56,897
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

1267
00:55:56,899 --> 00:56:01,001
      Two top "All Stars"       
        stand before me.        

1268
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:05,304
  Ladies, this is your chance   
         to impress me,         

1269
00:56:05,306 --> 00:56:09,175
          win $10,000,          
       and earn the power       

1270
00:56:09,177 --> 00:56:13,613
to give one of the bottom queens
           the chop.            

1271
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:20,018
       The time has come        
         to lip sync...         

1272
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,520
           (echoing)            
        for your legacy.        

1273
00:56:24,557 --> 00:56:26,457
       - I'm making sure        

1274
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:29,526
       that I am going to       
     work it the fuck out.      

1275
00:56:29,528 --> 00:56:30,726
        I've got my eye         
         on the prize.          

1276
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:32,128
     I want this first win,     

1277
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,530
       and I really want        
         that $10,000.          

1278
00:56:34,532 --> 00:56:38,066
   - I haven't seen Tatianna    
    perform since Season 2.     

1279
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:39,166
         Does she kick?         
        Does she split?         

1280
00:56:39,168 --> 00:56:40,867
         Does she buck?         
         I don't know,          

1281
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:42,635
     but I got a whole lot      
          of shake it,          

1282
00:56:42,637 --> 00:56:45,003
           shake it,            
  shake, shake, shake it off.   

1283
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:49,875
          - Good luck,          
       and don't fuck up.       

1284
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:54,945
    -  I stay up too late     

1285
00:56:54,947 --> 00:56:58,148
   Got nothing in my brain    

1286
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,850
    That's what people say,    
            mm-hmm             

1287
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:03,852
     That's what people say,   
            mm-hmm             

1288
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:06,321
     But I keep cruising      

1289
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:09,057
          Can't stop,          
      won't stop moving        

1290
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:13,695
   It's like I got this music  
          in my body           

1291
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:16,563
      Saying it's gonna be     
          all right            

1292
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:19,566
 'Cause the players gonna play,
    play, play, play, play     

1293
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:22,469
   And the haters gonna hate,  
    hate, hate, hate, hate     

1294
00:57:22,471 --> 00:57:25,572
  Baby, I'm just gonna shake,  
  shake, shake, shake, shake   

1295
00:57:25,574 --> 00:57:29,008
         Shake it off,         
        I shake it off         

1296
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,443
       My ex-man brought        
      his new girlfriend.       

1297
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:34,346
    She's like, oh, my God,     
   but I'm just gonna shake.    

1298
00:57:34,348 --> 00:57:37,649
  And to the fella over there   
   with the hella good hair,    

1299
00:57:37,651 --> 00:57:41,119
 won't you come on over, baby,  
  we can shake, shake, shake.   

1300
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:43,353
           - (laughs)           
         -  Yeah, oh          

1301
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:46,589
 'Cause the players gonna play,
    play, play, play, play     

1302
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:49,692
   And the haters gonna hate,  
    hate, hate, hate, hate     

1303
00:57:49,694 --> 00:57:52,795
  Baby, I'm just gonna shake,  
  shake, shake, shake, shake   

1304
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:55,631
         Shake it off,         
        I shake it off         

1305
00:57:55,633 --> 00:57:57,799
          Shake it off,        
        I shake it off         

1306
00:57:57,801 --> 00:58:01,736
   You've got to shake it off, 
        I shake it off         

1307
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,806
     ( cheers and applause)     

1308
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:07,708
        - Yeah, shakers.        

1309
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:12,645
           - Ladies,            
     I've made my decision.     

1310
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,985
       Roxxxy Andrews...        

1311
00:58:20,987 --> 00:58:22,953
     you're a winner, baby.     

1312
00:58:22,955 --> 00:58:26,089
           (applause)           

1313
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:28,858
      - Thank you so much.      

1314
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,492
      Who do you think won      
         the lip sync?          

1315
00:58:30,494 --> 00:58:32,894
             I did.             
  Oh, my God, I'm so excited.   

1316
00:58:32,896 --> 00:58:34,528
      I came on this show       
      to prove something,       

1317
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:37,030
        and I'm already         
  starting it off good, girl.   

1318
00:58:37,032 --> 00:58:41,533
   - You've earned a cash tip   
          of $10,000.           

1319
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,935
     - My biggest tip yet.      

1320
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,140
   - Tatianna, you are safe.    

1321
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:50,408
          - Thank you.          

1322
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:59,750
    - Will the bottom three     
      please step forward?      

1323
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:11,094
    Roxxxy, with great power    
  comes great responsibility.   

1324
00:59:12,363 --> 00:59:16,565
  Which queen have you chosen   
        to get the chop?        

1325
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:18,700
      - When I was making       
          my decision,          

1326
00:59:18,702 --> 00:59:21,101
  I put myself in your shoes.   

1327
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:23,904
Listening to your critiques, and
we got to watch the talent show,

1328
00:59:23,906 --> 00:59:26,973
  my decision was based off of  

1329
00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:31,076
   who I agreed with you all    
        was the bottom.         

1330
00:59:31,078 --> 00:59:34,279
         So I won money         
   and I might lose a friend,   

1331
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:36,548
  but the girl that I chose...  

1332
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:40,151
           Was Coco.            

1333
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:46,389
         I'm so sorry.          

1334
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:48,057
      I'm so sorry, honey.      

1335
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,425
           I'm sorry.           

1336
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:57,131
      - As it is written,       
      so it shall be done.      

1337
00:59:57,133 --> 01:00:02,135
         Coco Montrese,         
     you are an "All Star."     

1338
01:00:02,137 --> 01:00:06,372
        Now sashay away.        

1339
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:12,177
           (applause)           

1340
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:19,617
      - Wow. I'm the first      
        to be sent away         

1341
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,585
    by a friend and not Ru.     

1342
01:00:21,587 --> 01:00:23,520
    It's very disappointing,    

1343
01:00:23,522 --> 01:00:25,522
        but "All Stars"         
         don't give up.         

1344
01:00:29,394 --> 01:00:31,961
   - Well, con-drag-ulations,   
          "All Stars."          

1345
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:35,831
          You survived          
      to live another day.      

1346
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,165
         Now, remember,         
  if you can't love yourself,   

1347
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,067
    how in the hell are you     
   gonna love somebody else?    

1348
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,302
       Can I get an amen        
          up in here?           

1349
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,003
         - (all) Amen.          
          - All right.          

1350
01:00:43,005 --> 01:00:44,872
    Now let the music play.     

1351
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:46,939
   -  Throw your hands up     

1352
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:49,142
       Time to get down       

1353
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:52,911
       Time to get down,       
    down, down, down, down     

1354
01:00:52,913 --> 01:00:56,581
  - I don't know what's next,   
  but it's not the end of me.   

1355
01:00:56,583 --> 01:00:58,616
      So it's not the last      
         you've seen--          

1356
01:00:58,618 --> 01:01:00,985
            (alarm)             
         - Whoo, girl.          

1357
01:01:00,987 --> 01:01:04,654
  Coco, girl, all is not lost.  

1358
01:01:04,656 --> 01:01:09,859
     So stay thirsty, girl,     
     'cause it ain't over.      

1359
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:11,894
             - Oh.              
   - You still have a chance    

1360
01:01:11,896 --> 01:01:17,165
  to return for your revenge.   

1361
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:21,302
          (evil laugh)          

1362
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:25,572
           - No way.            

1363
01:01:25,574 --> 01:01:27,507
      I got a lot to give,      

1364
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:32,112
     and trust me, I'm not      
       holding shit back.       

1365
01:01:32,114 --> 01:01:34,614
          Oh, at all.
