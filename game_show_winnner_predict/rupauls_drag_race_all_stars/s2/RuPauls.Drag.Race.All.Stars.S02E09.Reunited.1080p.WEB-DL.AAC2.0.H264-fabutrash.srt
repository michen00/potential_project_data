1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,835
    - Hello, hello, hello.      
            - Whoo!             

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,538
      - Critics have called     
"Drag Race" the best show on TV.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,440
            - Yay!              
  - When I'm good, I'm good,    

4
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:13,309
    but when I'm bad, I get     
  a serous venereal disease.    

5
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:16,879
      - And this season,        
the All Stars kept us gagging.  

6
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:19,881
    You'll be eliminating...    

7
00:00:19,883 --> 00:00:22,317
         each other.            

8
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:24,819
- I fucked up this week, man.   
        I fucked up.            

9
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:27,554
          - Party.              
- I'm not holding shit back.    

10
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:28,789
         Oh, at all.            

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,089
         - And gagging.         

12
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:31,957
   - If you thought it was      
  personal, absolutely not.     

13
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:33,725
- Can I be completely honest?   

14
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:37,562
I am sick of hearing them say   
you can wear shit on stage,     

15
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:39,162
        but it's okay           
    'cause you're Alyssa.       

16
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,730
           - What?              

17
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:41,998
         Oh, my God!            

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,232
    - Oh, my fucking God.       

19
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:45,834
    - What is going on here?    

20
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:47,168
            - Oh.               

21
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,304
   - And gagging for more.      

22
00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:51,372
             - Aah!             

23
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:52,939
        - What the hell?        

24
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:56,242
    - Tonight, the queens       
  have reunited to pop off.     

25
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:59,778
  - If you want to say that     
I'm fake, I have this to say.   

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,346
       - And spill the T.       

27
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:04,315
  - You think you're clever,    
       don't you, bitch?        

28
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,383
       - Adore Delano.          

29
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:07,450
  - I believe in free love.     

30
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:08,917
          - You do?             
           - I do.              

31
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,385
      - Alyssa Edwards.         

32
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,887
- Don't say I get a free pass   
     because I'm funny.         

33
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,555
      - Coco Montresse.         

34
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,390
   - It didn't sound like       
there was any humility there.   

35
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,658
        It was like,            
      I got that bitch.         

36
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,293
            - Detox.            

37
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:21,394
     - It's a pass, though.     

38
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:22,828
         It's judged            
    a little differently.       

39
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,062
        - Ginger Minj.          

40
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:26,230
 - You do play a dirty game.    

41
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,597
            - Katya.            

42
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,898
    - No, the second part       
        was amazing.            

43
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,266
     The first part             
   was utter bullshit.          

44
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:33,068
      - Roxxxy Andrews.         

45
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,036
- You're going to regret this.  
        Don't do this.          

46
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,838
         - Tatianna.            

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,706
       - Oh, she pretty.        
  We've seen what she's got.    

48
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:40,540
 - And she's a winner, baby.    

49
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,242
           Alaska.              

50
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:44,310
          - I did it.           
     I would do it again.       

51
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:48,246
    - ¶ RuPaul's Drag Race ¶

56
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:00,388
      - Welcome to a good       
    old fashioned reunion,      

57
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,555
     celebrating the queens     

58
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:05,159
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race      
         All Stars 2."          

59
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:06,326
        Welcome, ladies.        

60
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:08,160
           - Hello.             
             - Yo.              

61
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,330
    - And congratulations,      
            Alaska.             

62
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:17,368
           (applause)           

63
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,372
Oh, and in case any of you are  
 questioning my qualifications  

64
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:25,108
  towards tonight's reunion,    
   I have one thing to say.     

65
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,377
          Talk to her.          

66
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:31,314
    (cheers and applause)       

67
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,982
        Now, it's fun           
     to snatch trophies,        

68
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:36,484
 but the proudest achievement   
         of my career           

69
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:38,185
     has been to provide        
         a platform             

70
00:02:38,187 --> 00:02:39,687
      that has launched         
         the careers            

71
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:43,724
        of 100 queens           
  to international stardom.     

72
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:46,626
  Now, what you decide to do    
      with that platform        

73
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:48,494
        is up to you.           

74
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:51,730
   And tonight, one queen       
   decided not to join us.      

75
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:55,200
  Or as Tatianna would say,     
          choices.              

76
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:56,968
           - (laughs)           

77
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,235
  - One thing before we start.  

78
00:02:58,237 --> 00:02:59,703
   If at any point tonight      

79
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,873
 you think one of your fellow   
 queens is not telling the T,   

80
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:06,175
     feel free to raise         
     the paddle provided        

81
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:08,677
       and call bullshit.       

82
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,478
           - (laughs)           

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,880
        - For example,          
  if one of you were to say,    

84
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:18,152
    "I blame the edit,"         
    I'd say, bullshit.          

85
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:19,820
           - (laughs)           

86
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:22,122
     - See how it works?        
            Good.               

87
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:26,192
    So first, let's start       
   with the All Star twist      

88
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:28,560
    that changed everything.    

89
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:32,498
         This season,           
   you'll be eliminating...     

90
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:36,501
         Each other.            

91
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:43,006
           - Okay.              

92
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:44,608
   Welcome to "All Stars."      

93
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:50,713
   - Now, when I revealed that  
you'd be eliminating each other,

94
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:52,113
     what did you think?        

95
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,481
            - Fuck              
          - (laughs)            

96
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,849
   That's my first thought      
       was like, fuck.          

97
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:58,385
  But you know, I think that    
  because it was "All Stars"    

98
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:00,753
         and because            
 we're the best of the best,    

99
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,421
   we should have expected      
there was some kind of twist.   

100
00:04:02,423 --> 00:04:06,259
         - It was like          
 a mustard gas bomb went off.   

101
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,126
   - I've heard of those.       
  - When it happened, yeah.     

102
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:10,027
  I've had mustard gas before.  

103
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:11,828
        - Oh, really?           
        On a hot dog?           

104
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,563
       - Yeah, totally.         
          - (laughs)            

105
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:16,232
     Now how did you guys       
    come up with this idea      

106
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:20,569
  to base your eliminations     
  on what the judges said?      

107
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:22,837
       - That was my way        
    of making sense of it.      

108
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,473
  We were sitting there and we  
were all like, this is terrible.

109
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,641
     I don't want to do it.     

110
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:28,408
    And I was like, well,       
      we have to do it.         

111
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,709
  We have to do something.      

112
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:31,610
           - Right.             
    - So I wanted to do it      

113
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:35,180
   as though I was sitting      
      in your position          

114
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,347
      when you have to          
      send people home.         

115
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:37,848
          - Right.              
  - Did we all agree to it?     

116
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,949
            - No.               
            - No.               

117
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:40,250
  - I would not have agreed     
          to that.              

118
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:41,617
       That is setting          
        yourselves up           

119
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,652
  for a fucking bitch fight,    
           low key.             

120
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:45,754
     Like just watching.        
       - Which we did.          

121
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,589
    Because we're stupid.       
          (laughs)              

122
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,790
    - Watching the show,        
    it felt like you guys       

123
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,658
          were trying           
     to defer the blame--       

124
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,393
    - Back to the judges.       

125
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,594
    - Back to the judges,       
 and not take responsibility    

126
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:56,796
 for the decisions you made.    

127
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,163
  Is that a fair statement?     

128
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,298
      - Of course. Yes.         

129
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,499
   - You throw me the potato,   

130
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,667
 I'm throwing it back at you,   
            bitch.              

131
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,536
       - And I think,           
     in retrospect, yes,        

132
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,770
           it does              
    come across that way.       

133
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:08,104
     But in that moment,        

134
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:11,741
  it seemed that first day,     
  like, well, this is fair.     

135
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:13,876
         - Right, as            
 the competition progresses,    

136
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,211
   friendships and all that     
     shit comes into play,      

137
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:17,712
       and it's tough.          

138
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:19,547
      - Well, exactly.          
   - It's a mother fucker.      

139
00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:21,548
 - Because Alyssa was accused   
     of breaking the pact.      

140
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,915
 Did you ever make the pact?    

141
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,851
            - Baby,             
    nothing was notarized,      

142
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,952
  no contracts were signed,     

143
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:29,354
  my attorney was not present.  

144
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:31,590
       That was hog wash.       

145
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,857
     Let me get this gig.       
           Hold on.             

146
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,059
         (all laugh)            

147
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:41,998
- Now, the first queen to get   
the chop from a fellow All Star 

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,700
      was the legendary         
     Ms. Coco Montresse.        

149
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:47,936
    So, Coco, what was your     
 proudest moment on the show?   

150
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:51,572
     - My proudest moment       
       was being there.         

151
00:05:51,574 --> 00:05:53,841
   I didn't want to come--      

152
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,581
Before I got the call from you  
to come back to the "All Stars,"

153
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,082
    I had just gotten out       
      of the hospital.          

154
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:06,151
            I was--             
    my lungs were failing,      

155
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:10,221
   and I fought my way back     
    to being able to live.      

156
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:11,656
       - Oh, my goodness.       

157
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:14,391
 - And I didn't want anybody    
        to know that.           

158
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:17,861
     I didn't want to get       
  any sympathy from anybody.    

159
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,498
    I wanted to come back       
    and prove who I was.        

160
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,568
             And...             

161
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,705
             (sobs)             

162
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,515
       I just don't want        
    to let the people down      

163
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:43,917
       who believe in me.       

164
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,151
     - Well, you haven't        
     let your fans down.        

165
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:46,752
         You haven't            
     let yourself down.         

166
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,720
     How are you doing now?     

167
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,288
 - Much better, much better.    

168
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,423
   I'm probably about 98%.      

169
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,525
   I was traveling so much,     
       I wasn't eating,         

170
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,259
      and I'm thinking,         
     oh, I'm invincible.        

171
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,694
    I've never gotten sick      
    or anything like that.      

172
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,962
 You've just got to take care   
         of yourself.           

173
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,697
    - Yeah, you need to all     
   take care of yourselves.     

174
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,565
      - Yeah, you have to.      

175
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:09,701
    - Now, this is a question   
from our "Drag Race" super fans.

176
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:12,571
    Do you think that your      
     elimination was fair?      

177
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:15,407
   - The girl that I chose      
          was Coco.             

178
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:19,376
    - And who do you think      
    should have gone home?      

179
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:20,810
         - No, I don't.         

180
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:22,878
 I don't think my elimination   
           was fair.            

181
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,449
     This is "All Stars,"       
  and, no, I wasn't my best.    

182
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:28,649
       I can be honest          
        and say that.           

183
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:29,783
       It wasn't my best.       

184
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:33,353
   But there was one person     
     in that bottom three       

185
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:35,120
        that's not here,        

186
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,656
       that didn't sing         
     that great that day,       

187
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,558
    but that wasn't taken       
     into consideration.        

188
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,825
          - Mm-hmm.             

189
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,494
   - And that hurt me more      
 than anything in the world.    

190
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,464
         - I know that          
     if I was in the top,       

191
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,633
I would not have sent you home  
     that first challenge.      

192
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,235
     And if you roll back       
          the tapes,            

193
00:07:52,237 --> 00:07:55,037
         you can see            
 who I would have sent home.    

194
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,339
           - Yeah.              

195
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,873
    - 'Cause I don't think      
      she did the worst.        

196
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:01,676
     And I would say that       
     if Phi Phi was here,       

197
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:06,281
and she's not here, but, yeah,  
I don't think she did the worst.

198
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:07,549
       - I remember you         
         saying that.           

199
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:10,151
    - Now, after you left,      
          you tweeted           

200
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:13,087
  that some people sell out     
  their family and friends      

201
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,722
          for fame              
    and a little fortune.       

202
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:17,557
  Do you still feel that way    
         about Roxxxy?          

203
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:22,095
            - Yes,              
  to a certain extent, I do.    

204
00:08:22,097 --> 00:08:24,530
 - Everybody has their right    
 to their own opinion to me,    

205
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:25,832
   and whatever they feel.      

206
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,734
   As far as the tweets go,     
        we all get mad,         

207
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:30,536
       and we say things        
  that we don't want to say.    

208
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:32,470
        There is a line,        

209
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:34,806
      and I've crossed          
      that line before.         

210
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:36,673
 I think a lot of people have   
   crossed that line before,    

211
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:38,342
  and when you put something    
          out there,            

212
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:39,743
  sometimes you want to say,    
             shit,              

213
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:41,277
 I should have thought about    
 this twice before I did it.    

214
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,746
   - And sometimes, maybe we    
  shouldn't say those things    

215
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:45,614
        on social media.        

216
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,116
 Maybe we should pick up the    
phone and talk to each other.   

217
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:51,919
        - So Roxxxy,            
   are you cool with Coco?      

218
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,153
   - I will always be cool      
         with Coco.             

219
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,389
     Girl, she could say        
  the nastiest thing to me,     

220
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:56,956
and the next day I'll be like,  
  girl, you still my sister,    

221
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,858
  I love you, ain't nothing     
    ever going to change.       

222
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,261
   - I still love you more      
 than anything in the world.    

223
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:04,429
        You will never          
     lose a friend in me.       

224
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:06,631
        - All right,            
   so we'll be right back.      

225
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:09,899
        Coming up....           

226
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,734
    - What are you feeling      
          right now?            

227
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:13,235
         - Embarrassed.         

228
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:15,169
   - You said that I played     
         a dirty game.          

229
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,703
 - You do play a dirty game.    

230
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:17,771
             - Yep.             

231
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,343
       (RuPaul laughs)          

232
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,179
    - Now, the Snatch Game      
            episode             

233
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:32,482
   featured one of the most     
       shocking moments         

234
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,116
  in "Drag Race" her-story.     

235
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:37,685
   Why are your eyes all red?   

236
00:09:37,687 --> 00:09:39,954
           - Um...              

237
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:43,991
I didn't--I just didn't expect  
 it to be like this, I think.   

238
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:48,595
 I'm thinking of going home.    

239
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,964
      - Of tapping out?         
        - I think so.           

240
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,773
           I'm sorry.           

241
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:09,247
    - What are you feeling      
          right now?            

242
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:14,517
         - Embarrassed.         

243
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:19,054
I just shouldn't--I just felt   
like I shouldn't have done that.

244
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,457
         I didn't want          
     to let anybody down.       

245
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,860
 Nobody goes on "All Stars 2"   
  and is, like, peacing out.    

246
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:28,629
  Like, that's like, whack.     
   It's not even my style.      

247
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,998
  Like, I walk and I see how    
   beautiful and statuesque,    

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,266
    like, Detox and Roxxxy      
            looked,             

249
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:34,567
    and I was just like fuck.   

250
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:35,901
         My outfits             
   that I got made for me,      

251
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,235
       like, don't even         
    stand up to this, man.      

252
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,103
 And I didn't prepare myself    

253
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,672
    to bring myself back to     
the whole elimination process,  

254
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,974
   the critiquing process,      
     the goddamn runway.        

255
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,342
     And, like, I wasn't        
      mentally prepared         

256
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,776
         to hear that           
    from Michelle, either.      

257
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,778
        - Girl, this is         
     a 14th Street dress,       

258
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,513
 like, that doesn't fit you.    

259
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:53,247
I don't care if you're going    
to give me your hot body line   

260
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:54,982
       or whatever it is.       

261
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:57,984
           It's just            
   I expected more for you.     

262
00:10:57,986 --> 00:10:59,185
          Do you care?          

263
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:01,454
         'Cause, like,          
   everything's like blasé.     

264
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:03,355
 - We just got off tour together
        around the world,       

265
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:05,090
     so the aerodynamics        
   are completely changed,      

266
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:07,758
 and you have to be brought back
  to like, not Kiki home girl,  

267
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,593
       like, you know,          
       roadie, homey,           

268
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:11,961
   back to like, you know,      
   you're Michelle Visage,      

269
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,363
 so you're going to tell me     
  what the fuck you think.      

270
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:15,931
  You know, before, I could     
  just be like, girl, bye.      

271
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,232
        I'm going to my         
  dressing room or whatever.    

272
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:19,567
But here, I have to sit there   
    and fucking take it,        

273
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:20,935
    and I wasn't prepared       
          for that.             

274
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:22,603
      I don't even think        
 I'm still prepared for that.   

275
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:24,905
     - I just got to say,       
        as an All Star,         

276
00:11:24,907 --> 00:11:27,908
 you can't really wear something
          off the rack.         

277
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,275
  You have to wear something    
        that's special          

278
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:30,642
  that other people can't get.  

279
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:31,976
         That's really          
       what the meaning         

280
00:11:31,978 --> 00:11:33,577
   of being a superstar is,     
           you know?            

281
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,679
            - Yeah.             
 - And if it is off the rack,   

282
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:38,381
it has to be altered in a way   
 that no one else can do it.    

283
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,116
          - Got it.             

284
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:42,751
 - And you know, having seen    
  your, sort of, melt down,     

285
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:44,086
   I could totally relate.      

286
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:47,389
      In January, I'll be       
   doing this for 35 years.     

287
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:48,489
       - Jesus Christ.          

288
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:51,125
     - And what happens         
   is you have to build up      

289
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,694
 that dialogue with yourself    
    to sit yourself down,       

290
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:55,328
        center yourself.        

291
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,829
     Everything is cool.        

292
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,064
          You're here           
    because you earned it.      

293
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,531
    Don't get it twisted.       

294
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:04,001
            You are             
    the cream of the crop.      

295
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:07,204
     You are all All Stars.     

296
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:08,972
    So one last question.       

297
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:13,109
    Adore, "All Stars 3,"       
         are you in?            

298
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:14,843
           - (laughs)           

299
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:18,380
          (evil laugh)          

300
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,248
       I have no idea.          

301
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,583
         (all laugh)            

302
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:26,019
      I'm probably down.        
      I'm probably down.        

303
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,588
           - (laughs)           

304
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,156
        Now, the next           
       shocking moment          

305
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:34,727
  was after the Snatch Game     
 when Tatianna got the chop.    

306
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,595
         - The queen            
    that I have chosen...       

307
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,366
          Is Tatianna.          

308
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:43,668
        - So, Tatianna,         
      do you feel Alaska        

309
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,904
      based her decision to     
 send you home on the critiques?

310
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,173
        - Which time?           

311
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,575
         (all laugh)            
         - Oh, damn!            

312
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:54,977
      - The first time,         
      I think so, yeah.         

313
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:57,980
        I did poorly            
     in the Snatch Game,        

314
00:12:57,982 --> 00:12:59,515
    and I wasn't the best       
       on the runway.           

315
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,183
      The second time, no.      

316
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:04,219
      I didn't really get       
 that negative of a critique,   

317
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:06,087
     I didn't feel like.        
          Choices.              

318
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,388
   And I think that my runway   

319
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,956
     was one of the most        
entertaining, and like, best.   

320
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,558
 - Now, Alaska, tell me what    
 was going through your mind    

321
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,860
  when you had to eliminate     
           a girl.              

322
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,295
 - Well, it was really hard.    

323
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,530
  - Were you thinking about     
 the audience looking at you    

324
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,598
  or were you thinking about    
your friendship with the girl?  

325
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,334
  - If I was thinking about     
   the audience's reaction      

326
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,369
  and if I knew what that was,  

327
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:29,305
  then I would have probably    
    made different choices.     

328
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:31,473
     - #Choices (laughs)        

329
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,474
     - But I had no idea.       
       How could I know?        

330
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:34,842
        I had no idea           

331
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:38,578
 the way people would be so     
 galvanized behind Tatianna,    

332
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,615
       and I'm so happy         
        that they have.         

333
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:44,050
    And if you want to say      
        that I'm fake,          

334
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:47,586
  if you want to say that I'm   
 a snake, I have this to say.   

335
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:50,956
 The only thing fake about me   
           is this.             

336
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,091
            - Yes!              
          - (laughs)            

337
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,859
     - Oh, little Debbie        
       Scooter snack.           

338
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:58,128
      - Scooter, bitch.         
          - Medic!              

339
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,566
         (all laugh)            

340
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:05,034
     - She is the queen.        

341
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:08,271
         - All right.           
           (laughs)             

342
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:11,741
         So, Ginger,            
  in coming to "All Stars,"     

343
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:13,943
      did you accomplish        
         your mission?          

344
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:16,411
         - Well, no,            
    because I didn't win.       

345
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:19,780
      But I didn't feel         
        like myself.            

346
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,750
     I didn't feel like         
   I could find my groove.      

347
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:26,253
  I didn't feel like I knew     
   where to jump back in,       

348
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:30,724
  because I felt like I was     
still doing it from Season 7.   

349
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:33,827
     And I also felt like       
we were at maybe an advantage,  

350
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,227
 but mostly a disadvantage--    
    - Disadvantage, girl.       

351
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:37,962
     - Because we literally     

352
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,429
       came right back          
     into that workroom.        

353
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:42,166
       I had just lost.         
           - Uh-huh.            

354
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:44,467
- And so your mind just starts  
    playing tricks on you.      

355
00:14:44,469 --> 00:14:47,637
 - Do you feel that Alyssa broke
the pact when she sent you home?

356
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,971
        - Wait, hold on.        

357
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,072
 Can we break the pact down?    
     What was the pact?         

358
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:53,274
   - It was a blood oath...     
          (all laugh)           

359
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,677
 Administered by the members    
       of Rolaskatox.           

360
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,213
   - Rolaskatox formation.      

361
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,115
    - Well, the pact was        
    that the eliminations       

362
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,816
       would be based on        
    the judges' critiques.      

363
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:07,820
     And do you feel that       
     she broke that pact?       

364
00:15:07,822 --> 00:15:09,788
   - If she had been a part     
         of that pact,          

365
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,857
         then, yes,             
  she would have broken it.     

366
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,557
     But she wasn't part        
        of that pact.           

367
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,425
      - You said in your        
      sign off interview        

368
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:16,926
 that I played a dirty game.    

369
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,060
             - Yes.             

370
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:20,095
 - You do play a dirty game.    

371
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,195
        - She just won          
       the Snatch Game.         

372
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:22,296
       She got one point.       

373
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:26,233
        You were safe,          
   episode one, two points.     

374
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:29,136
   You were in the middle       
   of the road both times.      

375
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:31,804
  If I was being strategic,     
I would have packed your ass.   

376
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,939
         (all laugh)            

377
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:35,907
      - All right, kids,        
     we'll be right back.       

378
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:38,475
       - Coming up....          

379
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:40,210
 - You have to also sit back    
          and say,              

380
00:15:40,212 --> 00:15:42,079
          well, yes,            
     because it's Alyssa,       

381
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,479
         it's judged            
    a little differently.       

382
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:45,547
- Don't say I get a free pass   
     because I'm funny.         

383
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,515
    - Utter bullshit.           

384
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:48,783
           - Errr.              

385
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:54,354
       (RuPaul laughs)          

386
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:57,524
       - ¶ And beyond,          
  you'll always be a hero ¶     

387
00:15:57,526 --> 00:16:00,193
         - Let's talk           
       movie she-quels.         

388
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:03,395
     Alaska kicked Alyssa       
       in the challenge.        

389
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:07,265
     - ¶ Camp town ladies       
       sing this song ¶         

390
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,800
     - ¶ Doo-dah, doo-dah ¶     

391
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,535
           - Dead!              
           - Aah!               

392
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,271
 - And then kicked her again    
right out of the competition.   

393
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,410
  - The queen I've selected     
     is Alyssa Edwards.         

394
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,146
             (sobs)             

395
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,516
 - Alyssa, what do you think    

396
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,984
       was behind Alaska        
     giving you the chop?       

397
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:32,486
      - (clicks tongue)         

398
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:35,122
         (all laugh)            

399
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,256
    Well, let me ask you.       

400
00:16:36,258 --> 00:16:39,593
  Do you feel that any of it    
         was strategy?          

401
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,527
            - No.               

402
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:43,862
 - Do you think you based it    
    on judges critiques?        

403
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:46,764
    - Yes, and I was there      
    in the scene with you.      

404
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,799
         (all laugh)            

405
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,001
   Girl, I'll send you home     
       again right now.         

406
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:53,336
 Does anyone have a lipstick    
     with Alyssa on it?         

407
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:55,605
           I did it.            
     I would do it again.       

408
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:58,407
  - You sent her home solely    
    based on the challenge.     

409
00:16:58,409 --> 00:16:59,808
 Is that what you're saying?    

410
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,609
         - I felt like          
      she did the worst.        

411
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:05,212
           I mean,              
  we barely got through it.     

412
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:06,880
          We barely             
     got it all on tape,        

413
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:10,450
 all the words from the pages   
         on the scene.          

414
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:13,520
  So it was like, I was afraid  

415
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,822
   are we even going to get     
    through this one time?      

416
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:18,892
      Of course, watching       
     the episode at home,       

417
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:22,261
 everyone in the bar is like,   
    yeah, she's hilarious.      

418
00:17:22,263 --> 00:17:24,363
   But it was not hilarious     
            there.              

419
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:26,865
       It was serious.          

420
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:29,600
  And then the camera dress, I  
 thought, that's not two in one.

421
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:32,503
   It was like, I'm holding     
       the camera dress,        

422
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:34,471
       and now here's           
      the camera dress!         

423
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,472
  - Well, wait, you didn't      
  have a two in one at all.     

424
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,706
           - Um...              

425
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,342
      - A funeral shroud,       
  cloud of black trash bags?    

426
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:41,743
   - I thought it was lovely.   

427
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:43,177
        - No, it was--          
 the second part was amazing.   

428
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:45,612
     The first part             
   was utter bullshit.          

429
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:48,414
     Bitch, utter bullshit.     

430
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,517
           - Errr.              

431
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,652
          - Alyssa,             
    some queens have said       

432
00:17:53,654 --> 00:17:56,488
 that the judges were easier    
   on you in the critiques      

433
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,756
       than they were           
     on the other girls.        

434
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:59,790
     - I totally disagree.      
  - There were several times    

435
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:01,625
that all the judges were like,  
 it works because it's Alyssa.  

436
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,159
    It's the Alyssa-isms.       

437
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:04,827
        And Alyssa-isms         
      is a pass, though.        

438
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:07,028
 - You have to also sit back    
     and say, well, yes,        

439
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,932
   because of my Alyssa-isms,   
because of how infectious it is,

440
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,000
         it's judged            
    a little differently.       

441
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:16,537
  - Girl, no T, you had one     
  suitcase it looked like.      

442
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,672
   You had a bra and a panty    
and a paint for the first one.  

443
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:21,207
 You had a little strappy outfit
    and paint for the second.   

444
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,575
   And I couldn't do that.      
   Your body is flawless.       

445
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:23,976
            - Right.            

446
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,811
 - She's wearing combat boots   
        on the runway,          

447
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,212
      and she's wearing         
         flip-flops.            

448
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,613
       - Don't you come         
      for my flip-flops.        

449
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:29,881
       - And jellies.           
  We all have our own drag.     

450
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:30,848
         - Everybody            
     has their own drag.        

451
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,982
  - Don't say--yeah, don't say  

452
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:33,617
       I get a free pass        
      because I'm funny.        

453
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,718
    - Well, Jeremy Scott        
    said you are fashion.       

454
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,187
 - You know what? Coco Chanel   
      says take off two.        

455
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:40,589
 Alyssa Edwards says add 22.    

456
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,491
   - I love playing dress up.   

457
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,158
      This is a drag show.      

458
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,360
           This is              
 the ultimate All Star show.    

459
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:49,830
Girl, reach in that caboodle,   
      that's your shit.         

460
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,865
         (all laugh)            

461
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,600
 - On that point, Alyssa, I have
     a fan question for you.    

462
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:58,604
  On a scale of Gila monster    
           to beast,            

463
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:01,773
how well do you think you slayed
     the runway this season?    

464
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:05,142
          - I think             
    I was...a wildebeest.       

465
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,343
           - Okay.              

466
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,812
    - Because it was wild,      
    bitch, it was all out!      

467
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,749
     - Right after Alyssa       
       was sent packing,        

468
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,784
     the mirror cracked.        

469
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,621
- I am sick of hearing them say,
you can wear shit on stage,     

470
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,289
       but it's okay,           
    'cause you're Alyssa.       

471
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,056
         It was sloppy.         

472
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:24,725
  It was like she kept saying,  
like, you shouldn't send me home

473
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,826
    because I've only been      
      in the bottom once,       

474
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:27,893
  and she was too concerned     
        about saying            

475
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:29,061
   this is your second time     
        in the bottom.          

476
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:30,095
     You should go home.        

477
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:32,431
        It seemed to me         
    she was more concerned      

478
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:35,400
about throwing you two under    
the bus during deliberations.   

479
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:39,403
           - What?              

480
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:40,704
        - Oh, my God!           

481
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:42,071
    - Oh, fuck my God!          

482
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:44,540
    - What is going on here?    

483
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,443
    - Trust the duchess.        
It ain't over just yet, baby.   

484
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:54,082
  - Oh, my goodness, child,     
 that mirror had four faces.    

485
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:58,185
  - Oh, God, it was the best    
     feeling in the world.      

486
00:19:58,187 --> 00:20:00,087
      - None of us knew         
     what was happening.        

487
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:02,622
 We were just told get into drag
         and stand here,        

488
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:07,093
    and I felt a lot of pain,   
 because this one was pissed off

489
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:10,563
and had her claws digging into  
  my arm for about 30 minutes   

490
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:11,830
   while y'all were talking     
           in there.            

491
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,865
 - Well, I was trying to fix    
      my hair and shit,         

492
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:16,067
    and I was like, girl,       
         she's mad.             

493
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:17,434
   - We were there...well,      
  we were behind the mirror     

494
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:18,502
      for like an hour.         

495
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:19,803
       - Jesus Christ.          

496
00:20:19,805 --> 00:20:21,104
  - But we heard everything.    
         - Everything.          

497
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:24,773
 But when it literally turned   
    into that fresh wound,      

498
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,274
     just salt all over it.     

499
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:28,676
 That good organic sea salt.    

500
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:29,844
   - Honestly, I was happy      

501
00:20:29,846 --> 00:20:31,845
  that I might have a chance    
         to come back.          

502
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,613
      But then it was like      
 hearing everything in the room,

503
00:20:33,615 --> 00:20:35,582
   it just sounded so dark,     
       and it was like--        

504
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:36,749
  - Do I want to want this?     

505
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:38,217
      - I want to be here       
    and I want to compete,      

506
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,252
 but, girl, I don't--why you    
 got to be dark-sided, girl?    

507
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:41,852
  I was already eliminated.     

508
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:43,554
       - There was a lot        
   of aggression, for sure.     

509
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,956
   - It didn't sound like       
there was any humility there.   

510
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,458
It was more so, it was, like,   
      I got that bitch.         

511
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,459
          - Right.              
         - You know?            

512
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:50,727
         - So what was          
      your first thought        

513
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:53,328
  when you saw these bitches    
     appear in the mirror?      

514
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,796
   - I thought they looked      
     fucking sickening.         

515
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:57,632
   They looked so correct,      
    but then I was, like,       

516
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,233
       now what the fuck        
  are you going to do to me?    

517
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:01,035
    - That was epic, though.    

518
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:04,103
      That mirror scene,        
        y'all did that.         

519
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:06,472
   You think you're clever,     
       don't you, bitch?        

520
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,907
         (all laugh)            

521
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:11,943
  - The fashion this season     
       had everybody,           

522
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:14,978
 including the "New York Times,"
            gagging.            

523
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,581
       Now I want some          
  queen on queen critiques.     

524
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,150
   When we love an outfit,      
         we toot it.            

525
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:23,819
      And when we don't,        
          we boot it.           

526
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:25,420
       Katya, top two.          

527
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,621
- Roxxxy Andrews final outfit,  
  stunning from head to toe.    

528
00:21:27,623 --> 00:21:28,622
      - Oh! Oh, my God.         

529
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,258
       - Smashing wigs,         
        colostomy bags          

530
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,560
     and toenails out of        
every living room in America.   

531
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:37,696
- Every single thing that Roxxxy
Andrews wore down the runway.   

532
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,998
            - Yes.              
     - It was incredible.       

533
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,232
 - I couldn't pick just one.    

534
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:42,866
       - I want to say          
        it's Phi Phi.           

535
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,901
      - I was obsessed          
  with her futuristic look.     

536
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,969
    - Honestly, Phi Phi's       
     future of drag look        

537
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,271
        was probably            
  one of my favorite looks.     

538
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,505
 I thought it was brilliant.    

539
00:21:50,507 --> 00:21:52,073
         - Top boot.            

540
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:53,274
     - Ginger's space look.     

541
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,541
           - Oh, yes.           

542
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:57,878
- Space ho and robot chicken.   

543
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,580
  - My top two of the season    
       was the top four.        

544
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:02,415
           Visually,            
 they're just super stunning.   

545
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,483
   They looked like a bunch     
     of fairies up there.       

546
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:07,519
 And then boot me, I look like  
a fucking shiny sack up there.  

547
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:08,887
            (laughs)            

548
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:12,457
           - Alaska?            
 - Top two, definitely Detox.   

549
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:17,428
   The latex red bellbottom     
        pantsuit thing.         

550
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,762
      It was beautiful.         

551
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:20,964
        it looked like          
 it was painted on your body.   

552
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,966
    It haunts me forever.       

553
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,869
          Top boot,             
  the fucking camera dress.     

554
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:29,038
           So stupid.           

555
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,708
- Hey, you got--girl, you got   
 cockroaches on your dress.     

556
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,109
         (all laugh)            

557
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,544
       - They're my pets.       

558
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:39,280
- All right, stay right there,  
     we'll be right back.       

559
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:42,782
        Coming up....           

560
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:44,617
   - Tell me about the hug      
    that never happened.        

561
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:46,018
       - It was, like,          
     oh, just chill out.        

562
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,987
  - I just don't think that     
  she wanted to hug Alyssa.     

563
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:52,123
       (RuPaul laughs)          

564
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:56,059
       (RuPaul laughs)          

565
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:00,595
    - Now, Alyssa Edwards       
        and Tatianna            

566
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,630
   made All Star her-story      

567
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:07,001
 when they both lip synced their
 way back into the competition. 

568
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:09,536
      When you strutted         
      onto the runway,          

569
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,637
           we knew              
  we were in for something.     

570
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:13,438
- You can look into our eyes.   

571
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,906
       We were fighting         
        to get back in.         

572
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:15,907
        - Yeah, we were.        

573
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:28,852
 - I was like, damn, I really   
      wanted this so bad.       

574
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:31,387
 - Now, tell me about the hug   
     that never happened.       

575
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:36,058
        - Bye, love you.        

576
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,563
 Phi Phi, I tried to hug you,   
            though.             

577
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:45,099
    - What was going through    
 your mind at that time, Alyssa?

578
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:46,434
   - I didn't vote Phi Phi      

579
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:49,303
      because of anything       
   other than her behavior.     

580
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,071
 It was starting to feed off    
        on everyone,            

581
00:23:51,073 --> 00:23:52,805
    and it was like, girl,      
        just chill out          

582
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,640
    and take a deep breath      
          and laugh.            

583
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,041
  So when I tried to hug him    
          at the end,           

584
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,509
    I wanted to say, look,      
        you know what?          

585
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:01,345
       We came, we saw,         
         we conquered.          

586
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,581
 It's okay to be a little bitter
   and a little disappointed.   

587
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,682
          That's life           
     when you fall short.       

588
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:08,384
But always tell someone else,   
   good job and congrats.       

589
00:24:08,386 --> 00:24:10,485
       It's harder to be        
  the bigger person in life.    

590
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:13,054
  - I just don't think that     
  she wanted to hug Alyssa.     

591
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,389
            (laughs)            

592
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:16,991
    Because she walked up,      
          dissed her,           

593
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:18,892
 but then gave everyone else    
      a hug after her.          

594
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:21,528
        So that's why           
 I don't necessarily believe    

595
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,795
     that it was 'cause         
    she was going to cry.       

596
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:28,133
  Um, also, she did not cry     
  after hugging everybody.      

597
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:32,704
- When I saw it, I was like, no!
         Bitch, hug her!        

598
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:34,739
 Like, you're going to regret   
     this is what I felt.       

599
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:35,773
           - It was             
     an authentic moment.       

600
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,074
  She was angry and pissed.     

601
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,608
     Don't pretend to be        
    something you're not.       

602
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,877
  If you want to recoil from    
   the hug, that's a moment.    

603
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,446
  - But you already pretended   
in the dress--in the workroom.  

604
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,914
  - Right, but what you see     
   isn't always the truth.      

605
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,117
      - Right. (laughs)         

606
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,118
 - Now, the family makeovers    
          challenge             

607
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,986
  may have been my all-time     
     favorite challenge.        

608
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:53,321
          - Mine, too.          

609
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:56,357
    - Now, Detox, how did       
putting your sister into drag   

610
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,125
   bring you closer together?   

611
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:01,694
    - I mean, we're pretty      
  inseparable to begin with.    

612
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,430
 Having her share that moment   
        and being here,         

613
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:06,398
     and as being my rock       
        to begin with,          

614
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,633
    and to be such a rock       
    during that challenge       

615
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:11,168
     was one of the most        
  amazing experiences ever.     

616
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,502
           - Yeah.              

617
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:14,571
  - I will never forget it.     
  - What about you, Roxxxy?     

618
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:18,442
Now, that was your grandmother  
 who raised you as her child.   

619
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:20,209
     - She's always wanted      
  to be in front of cameras,    

620
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:23,478
        so this like            
  her shining glory, like--     

621
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,413
       - Couldn't tell.         
     - You couldn't tell?       

622
00:25:25,415 --> 00:25:28,115
      - She's gorgeous.         
        - Thank you.            

623
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:31,284
  - How, Alaska, did putting    
      your mom into drag        

624
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:33,419
   affect your relationship     
           with her?            

625
00:25:33,421 --> 00:25:36,755
- Well, I've always considered  
  my mom a drag queen anyway.   

626
00:25:36,757 --> 00:25:38,322
 And I have so many memories    
         of my mom,             

627
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:40,558
 like, being in the bathroom    
      and getting ready         

628
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,860
     and doing her, like,       
      face and her hair.        

629
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:46,195
 So she knows what it's like    
     to be a drag queen.        

630
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:48,297
  - And Katya, your mother      
 seemed like a real natural.    

631
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,266
     When you put that--        
       - Upstaged me.           

632
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:51,734
        - When she put          
     that lace front on--       

633
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:53,335
    - Put that Marilyn on       
         and hit it.            

634
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:55,970
   - Yeah. Has she changed      
    since that challenge?       

635
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:57,205
   - I told her, you know,      

636
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,340
   you could be recognized      
     on the street, mom,        

637
00:25:59,342 --> 00:26:02,309
and she was like, oh, my God,   
   I didn't think of that.      

638
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,410
       So I pray for her.       

639
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:04,544
         - Yes, yes.            

640
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,979
     Well, I got to say,        
       Alyssa Edwards,          

641
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:10,482
    we've seen the crazy nut,   
you know, tongue popping Alyssa,

642
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:15,086
   but to see you so human      
     and so vulnerable,         

643
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:18,389
 it felt like Alyssa Edwards    
      came full circle.         

644
00:26:18,391 --> 00:26:20,123
    - Mom would have loved      
          to do this.           

645
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,558
       She would have.          
           - Yeah.              

646
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,925
    I'm glad we're together,    

647
00:26:23,927 --> 00:26:27,195
         because it's           
   a sensitive time for us.     

648
00:26:27,197 --> 00:26:28,529
       - (sobs) Well,           
    thank you for coming.       

649
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:31,664
   The day that they closed     
      my mother's casket,       

650
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,833
      I just shut down.         

651
00:26:37,571 --> 00:26:39,437
   - What was your takeaway     
        in being there?         

652
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,739
     - When my mom died,        
      it was just like,         

653
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:43,874
     I packed my suitcase       
          and I left.           

654
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:47,644
   I did a show that night      
   of my mother's funeral,      

655
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:50,813
    and I could tell that       
I was running from something.   

656
00:26:50,815 --> 00:26:53,148
When she came into the room, I  
just, I didn't know what to say.

657
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,549
         I didn't know          
  if I should say I'm sorry.    

658
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,317
      When I looked at          
    the hurt in her eyes,       

659
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,286
    I knew that they lean       
       so much on me.           

660
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:02,656
 You make time for a booking,   
  you make time for a family.   

661
00:27:02,658 --> 00:27:05,759
        Because they're         
     going to be the ones       

662
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:07,126
  that are going to be there    
           for you.             

663
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,428
           - Yeah.              

664
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:11,263
         All right,             
  we've got a fan question.     

665
00:27:11,265 --> 00:27:14,933
    What is your freakiest      
       fan interaction?         

666
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,868
            Adore,              
    I bet you've got some.      

667
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,636
        - I sleep with          
    a lot of my fans, so--      

668
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:19,937
          - You do?             
           - I do.              

669
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:21,405
          - Uh-huh.             
  - I believe in free love.     

670
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,906
        - Sure, why not?        

671
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,073
       - Like, cuddle?          

672
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,875
 - No, I sleep with my fans,    
        like full on.           

673
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,810
 Like, if they're attractive,   
  yeah, like, I make babies.    

674
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,945
  - Girl, if you can't fuck     
your fans, who can you fuck?    

675
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,646
         - Exactly.             
        No, I believe           

676
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:35,114
  if you have an attraction,    
        like, why not?          

677
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:38,317
      Nothing shocks me         
         with a fan.            

678
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,684
        - What about            
    you girls back there?       

679
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,385
Have you had carnal knowledge   
       with the fans?           

680
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:44,588
        - Um, no, I--           

681
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,090
   - Oh, shut up, Tatianna.     
        You're a whore.         

682
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:49,024
 - You know what? They might    
 be a fan of me after our--     

683
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:50,325
           - Okay.              

684
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:53,629
 - No, I had a dude lick my foot
       in Chicago, though.      

685
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:54,963
         - That counts.         

686
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,197
   Now, Detox, have you had--   

687
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:58,766
     - Oh, you know we've       
    had this conversation.      

688
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,400
    - You've had relations      
        with the fans.          

689
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:02,869
- I've had very carnal relations
      with very many a fan.     

690
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:04,137
          - Uh-huh.             

691
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,904
 - And I feel like some of us   
     have, like, shared--       

692
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:07,906
     - We've shared fans.       
     - We've shared fans.       

693
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:09,374
   - We've had--I've shared     
       Courtney's fans.         

694
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:10,541
     - And I usually get        
     the pictures after.        

695
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:12,743
     - There was one time       
    I was in my hotel room      

696
00:28:12,745 --> 00:28:14,177
      and there were like       
   these two boys in there,     

697
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,446
       and I was like,          
      uh, go see Adore.         

698
00:28:16,448 --> 00:28:17,947
  She's just down the hall.     

699
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:19,514
 - Oh, my God, I was scared.    
       I was like, no!          

700
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:20,582
        I don't want--          
      - You did, though.        

701
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:21,782
      - Yeah, I did, yeah.      

702
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:25,519
   - We had fun, us girls.      

703
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,221
     - We'll be right back.     

704
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,989
         - Coming up...         

705
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:31,757
  - It was heart wrenching,     
      sending you home,         

706
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,159
        because I knew          
    that it was not right.      

707
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,294
   - Do you hold a grudge?      

708
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,901
       (RuPaul laughs)          

709
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,004
     - Now, in the family       
      makeover challenge,       

710
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:50,907
       we learned that          
   global warming is real.      

711
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,710
      Let's take a look         
    at Alaska's meltdown.       

712
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:57,846
         (all laugh)            

713
00:28:57,848 --> 00:29:01,549
- I fucked up this week, man,   
    and it really sucks.        

714
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:03,918
         It fucking             
    really fucking sucks,       

715
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,320
       and I need to be         
      in the final four,        

716
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:10,824
     and now I'm potentially    
 looking at I'm not going to be.

717
00:29:10,826 --> 00:29:13,292
    I'll give you $10,000       
     if you let me stay.        

718
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,060
   I'll transfer it to you      
         via PayPal,            

719
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:18,530
    because I need to stay      
     in this competition.       

720
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:22,499
   - What was going through     
           your mind            

721
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,033
  when you saw Alaska do this?  

722
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,334
          - I thought           
      it was ridiculous.        

723
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:28,837
     For someone who to me      
 is so talented and brilliant   

724
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,705
       at what they do          
     and is so together,        

725
00:29:30,707 --> 00:29:34,709
     to have one, to me,        
     small minor misstep        

726
00:29:34,711 --> 00:29:36,978
  affect them and shake them    
           so much,             

727
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,713
    it was very alarming.       

728
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:41,214
         - I thought            
      it was strategic.         

729
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:42,247
            - Oh.               

730
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:43,414
      - But it was fun          
    to watch her crumble.       

731
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:45,550
         (all laugh)            
      - That's so rude.         

732
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:48,119
       - I think for me,        
    I seen it differently.      

733
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,487
   I seen someone that it       
 really meant a lot to them.    

734
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,122
   And it was like, bitch,      
       I have hustled,          

735
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,690
        I have worked,          
        I have fought,          

736
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,424
        I have cried,           
     I've stood back up.        

737
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:57,624
    And if you were judging,    

738
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,159
      you probably would        
   have sent yourself home.     

739
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:01,094
            - Yep.              
    - That's a good point.      

740
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:02,929
   That's a very good--what     
 was going through your mind?   

741
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:06,299
  - Going in to "All Stars 2,"  

742
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:09,869
         I was, like,           
 I didn't want to do anything   

743
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:11,771
   that could be perceived      
        as weakness,            

744
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:14,773
   because I watched Season 5   

745
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:18,010
      and I saw someone         
   who was really insecure      

746
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:20,178
         and who let            
       that insecurity          

747
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,148
   affect their performance     
      in the competition.       

748
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,385
And I didn't want there to be   
  a single frame of camera      

749
00:30:28,387 --> 00:30:30,020
 of me stumbling over a line    

750
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:31,488
      or doing anything         
       they could play          

751
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,589
          that bumbly           
     stupid music behind,       

752
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:35,156
   the ¶ doo-doo-doo-doo ¶      

753
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:37,358
         (all laugh)            

754
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,326
   And, Detox, if you want      
        the $10,000,            

755
00:30:39,328 --> 00:30:42,295
         I'll send you          
       my PayPal later.         

756
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:45,565
           Thank you            
   for not sending me home.     

757
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:48,534
 - Now, Detox, in the family    
     makeover challenge,        

758
00:30:48,536 --> 00:30:53,104
explain why you sent Alyssa home
     over Alaska and Roxxxy.    

759
00:30:53,106 --> 00:30:55,740
   - There was no way that      
 I could have sent her home,    

760
00:30:55,742 --> 00:30:58,175
            because             
   she had been killing it,     

761
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:01,311
  and when it came down to      
 choosing between these two,    

762
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:03,814
      I knew that Roxxxy        
       should have gone.        

763
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,115
     And I went to go get       
        that lipstick,          

764
00:31:05,117 --> 00:31:07,317
and there was just something--  
    my stomach was turning.     

765
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,585
      I know I'm making         
     the wrong decision,        

766
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:12,888
     but it's a decision        
     I had to stand by.         

767
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,490
    It was heart wrenching      
       sending you home,        

768
00:31:15,492 --> 00:31:19,594
        because I knew          
    that it was not right.      

769
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:22,395
   - Do you hold a grudge?      

770
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:26,065
          - No. Mm-mm.          

771
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:29,569
   No, because I've learned     
     if you hold a grudge,      

772
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:32,237
  it only eats away at your     
 success and your happiness.    

773
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,906
         - Sure, yeah.          
  - I had to let go of that.    

774
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:37,908
     - Now, one gorgeous        
       All Star queen           

775
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,977
   taught us all some new       
   wig tricks this season.      

776
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,845
       Let's take a look.       

777
00:31:42,847 --> 00:31:45,514
  - Thick and juicy is back,    
           bitches.             

778
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:49,985
       Dear, what seems         
        to be going on?         

779
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:51,719
      - Roxxxy, my dear...      

780
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:54,922
           - (sighs)            
    - You are an All Star.      

781
00:31:54,924 --> 00:31:57,591
  - I'm walking away so proud.  

782
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:59,993
         I got to show          
       who I truly was.         

783
00:31:59,995 --> 00:32:02,862
      - I will forever          
     be thick and juicy.        

784
00:32:02,864 --> 00:32:04,463
            Bye-bye.            

785
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:07,399
         (all laugh)            

786
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:09,167
        - So, Roxxxy,           
   you made it all the way      

787
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:11,769
      to the final four         
       of "All Stars."          

788
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:12,903
     How does that feel?        

789
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:15,372
     - It felt bittersweet.     

790
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:17,274
     I was in the bottom        
       so many times,           

791
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:21,244
 I felt like, I shouldn't have--
   I didn't earn my way there.  

792
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:24,113
        And that's--            
      It's bittersweet.         

793
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:27,350
   I was happy to be there      
 and to continue to compete,    

794
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:30,186
     but I felt like...         
     like, I don't know,        

795
00:32:30,188 --> 00:32:31,586
        like I wasn't           
    supposed to be there.       

796
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:32,954
           - I think            
     you should have won.       

797
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:36,223
 Girl, you were in the bottom   
  six out of seven episodes,    

798
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,557
       and you made it          
       to the finals.           

799
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,526
   That's how "Big Brother      
      Survivor's" won.          

800
00:32:39,528 --> 00:32:43,029
 I think you should have been   
      in the final three.       

801
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:47,233
- Now, a lot of you girls were  
 in Roxxxy's original season.   

802
00:32:47,235 --> 00:32:50,969
     How well do you think      
 she did in this competition?   

803
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,370
          - Burned it.          

804
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:56,975
   You have such a respect for  
the fucking art of what drag is,

805
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:59,444
      and every detail          
      is thought about.         

806
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:03,881
    - I could just tell how     
  happy she was to be there,    

807
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,883
 which was a nice departure     
 from the first time around.    

808
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:10,953
- Well, also this was a chance  
  for you to redeem yourself,   

809
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,456
  and you absolutely did that.  

810
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,656
      And let me say this.      

811
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:17,358
  You know, you're not given    
         a redemption.          

812
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,560
        It's something          
        that you earn.          

813
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:21,429
         I just wanted          
       to clear that up         

814
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:24,264
 for people who don't understand
         how that works,        

815
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,198
   and you earned it, Roxxxy.   

816
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,199
       Con-drag-ulations.       

817
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:28,200
         - Thank you.           
          - Right on.           

818
00:33:28,202 --> 00:33:29,368
           (applause)           

819
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,970
     We'll be right back        
         after this.            

820
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:33,537
  Did you pop a nail, girl?     

821
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,772
            (laughs)            

822
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:37,106
          Coming up...          

823
00:33:37,108 --> 00:33:39,341
- Is there anything you'd change
        about the season?       

824
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:41,410
          - Oh, God,            
     that sounds ominous.       

825
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,945
           - (laughs)           

826
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:48,150
       (RuPaul laughs)          

827
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,421
  - Now, when the time came     
     to crown our queen,        

828
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:57,257
     these next two queens      
   came so close, it hurts.     

829
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:59,192
   First, there was Detox.      

830
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:01,127
   - ¶ D to the E to the T      
         to the O ¶             

831
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:03,129
     ¶ To the--hold it ¶        
            - Oh!               

832
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:04,463
           - ¶ X ¶              

833
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:05,931
  Everyone's favorite trash     
    talking transvestite.       

834
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,866
      My tuck is right.         

835
00:34:07,868 --> 00:34:10,335
        I'm brilliant.          
        I'm beautiful.          

836
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:13,838
  I've never felt more...dead?  

837
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,672
    - It left us gagging.       

838
00:34:15,674 --> 00:34:17,340
     - Thank you very much.     

839
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:21,211
  - Now, Detox, maybe more      
than anyone else this season,   

840
00:34:21,213 --> 00:34:25,414
  your runway looks slayed,     
         officially.            

841
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,981
       - Yes! (laughs)          

842
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,182
         - What was             
    your proudest moment?       

843
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:29,482
     - The entire thing.        

844
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,885
      Like, I feel such,        
       like, validation.        

845
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,453
           Season 5,            
    I was not in the game.      

846
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:36,521
  I was, like, so not present,  

847
00:34:36,523 --> 00:34:39,657
  but still had that, like,     
     grandioso attitude,        

848
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:43,460
and coming back and still having
my signature grandioso attitude,

849
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:44,527
       but slaying it.          

850
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:47,062
   - Why were you out of it     
        in your season?         

851
00:34:47,064 --> 00:34:48,463
   - My dad just found out      
        he had cancer           

852
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,764
  right before I came to film,  

853
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:51,899
 and he kind of encouraged me   
    to go ahead and do it,      

854
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,000
      but the whole time        
  I was just thinking, like,    

855
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:54,367
      I shouldn't be here.      

856
00:34:54,369 --> 00:34:57,103
    Even though, like, it was   
 something I wanted for so long.

857
00:34:57,105 --> 00:35:00,138
And it sucked, because it was   
 like, I was finally there,     

858
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,874
 and like, not really being able
to perform to my best abilities.

859
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:06,877
    And to get back here        
   and to be able to share      

860
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:09,479
   with people who I admire     
     and respect so much,       

861
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,480
   I was like, yes, this is     
   what it should have been     

862
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:12,982
     the first time around.     

863
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:15,617
   - Give me your favorite      
   Detox moments. Anybody?      

864
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:18,052
  - I think that last episode,  

865
00:35:18,054 --> 00:35:20,087
  there was just something      
so angelic about all of them,   

866
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:21,722
  but because I've known you    
      for so many years,        

867
00:35:21,724 --> 00:35:24,057
     it was just really         
     a big proud moment.        

868
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:26,358
Like, as a friend, just to see  
   how beautiful you looked.    

869
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,693
         Oh, I'm like           
      getting emotional.        

870
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:29,461
 I'm all super proud of you.    
        - Thank you.            

871
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:32,564
  - Every moment of Detox's     
   is a wonderful moment.       

872
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,632
       She's wonderful          
       inside and out.          

873
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,267
     - And she's seen me        
        inside, too.            

874
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,635
         - Oh, okay.            

875
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,770
     Right on, right on,        
   - Shh, don't tell that.      

876
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:41,938
    - All right, and now,       

877
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,209
     the only high class        
    Russian whore, Katya.       

878
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,810
     - My name's Katarina       
   Petrona Zamalawchickova,     

879
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,410
   but you can call me Katya,   

880
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:51,112
           (snorts)             
        I am bombarded          

881
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:53,748
        by a cacophony          
 of demonic voices in my head   

882
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,083
  telling me... (deep voice)    
    You're not good enough.     

883
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:57,084
              Wow.              

884
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:58,551
      I'm giving you 1980s      

885
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:01,420
  disinterested Ellen Barkin    
           fantasy,             

886
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:03,521
        and I feel...           
    (deep voice) amazing.       

887
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:07,458
     I'm not going to panic     
because I don't do that anymore.

888
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,560
           - (laughs)           

889
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:12,762
  Katya, I'm so happy you were  
 able to embrace your confidence

890
00:36:12,764 --> 00:36:16,566
  and spotlight your talents    
        in "All Stars."         

891
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:17,799
         - Oh, me, too.         

892
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,534
          You put me            
     through drag school.       

893
00:36:19,536 --> 00:36:21,201
      I was going to go         
       to grad school.          

894
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:23,003
   Switch the D and the G.      

895
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:26,173
  You have no idea how lucky    
   I am to be a part of it.     

896
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:27,774
 I don't care about winning.    
        I never did.            

897
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,842
        I want to be            
    a part of the family.       

898
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:29,909
        - And you are.          
            - Yep.              

899
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,243
         - And you are.         

900
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,212
Is there anything you'd change  
       about the season?        

901
00:36:33,214 --> 00:36:35,047
   - I would probably bring     
     some better clothes,       

902
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:37,749
 but I'm on a style journey     
 that is still evolving, Ru.    

903
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,584
             - Yeah.            
 - We were just plucked out of--

904
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:40,918
 I don't want to harp on it,    

905
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,086
         but plucked            
      out of the season         

906
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,021
       and thrown back          
      into the skillet.         

907
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:45,589
           - Yeah.              
       - Still scabby.          

908
00:36:45,591 --> 00:36:46,990
            (laughs)            

909
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:48,758
    - Now, I want to talk       
  about the power of Katya.     

910
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,027
          - Oh, God,            
     that sounds ominous.       

911
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:53,662
   - Ginger, tell me about      
     the power of Katya.        

912
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:56,799
- There's not a mean spirited   
      bone in her body.         

913
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:58,901
 I'm convinced there's barely   
    any bones in her body,      

914
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:00,335
       wit the things           
      she does with it.         

915
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:02,870
   - Somebody put their bone    
  in my body. I'm so lonely.    

916
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:04,105
        - Oh, my God.           
          - Sorry.              

917
00:37:04,107 --> 00:37:06,540
       - But she's just,        
     she's just wonderful       

918
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,442
      and she is a star         

919
00:37:08,444 --> 00:37:10,511
     and she's just this        
     big ball of energy.        

920
00:37:10,513 --> 00:37:13,880
- Alaska, you also have a left  
  from center point of view,    

921
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:15,715
    Were there any things       
        that she did            

922
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:18,584
     that you thought, mm,      
I wish I would have done that.  

923
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:21,219
- Oh, no, I wouldn't have wanted
       to do any of that.       

924
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:22,687
           - (laughs)           

925
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:25,623
    - She's really smart,       

926
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,024
     possibly dangerous--       
        I'm not sure--          

927
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:28,926
        and she can do          
       a fucking split.         

928
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:30,394
          - Yeah.               
      - So fuck you.            

929
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:31,995
  - You're a pig from hell.     

930
00:37:31,997 --> 00:37:33,296
           - Fuck you!          

931
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:34,697
  They're going to edit that    
      in the commercial,        

932
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,965
    and it will look like       
         I meant it.            

933
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:38,700
         (all laugh)            

934
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:42,102
 - Now, "Drag Race" is truly    
    the Olympics of drag,       

935
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:45,671
      and this next queen       
    brought home the gold.      

936
00:37:45,673 --> 00:37:47,573
     - ¶ Who's that bitch       
      that on the top? ¶        

937
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:50,343
    ¶ Oh, wait, that's me,      
        hey, porkchop ¶         

938
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:51,376
              Bam.              

939
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:53,011
         (all laugh)            

940
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:56,013
     Nobody can do Alaska       
        except Alaska.          

941
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:58,515
    ¶ I'm campy and classy      
     and cunty and mean ¶       

942
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:02,386
Why don't you come on up and    
fuck me in the ass sometime?    

943
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:03,553
              Aah!              

944
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:04,654
            Totally.            

945
00:38:04,656 --> 00:38:05,688
    - I think you've done       

946
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,790
     a pretty amazing job       
         this journey.          

947
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:10,359
 You've come a long way since   
   auditioning for Season 1.    

948
00:38:13,797 --> 00:38:15,630
  - Con-drag-ulations, Alaska.  

949
00:38:15,632 --> 00:38:16,998
          - Thank you.          

950
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,834
 - What does the future hold    
 for Alaska, hall of famer?     

951
00:38:20,836 --> 00:38:24,337
 - Well, I'm going to have a    
 giant picture in a hallway.    

952
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:26,105
           - Uh-huh.            
      - I got a new hat.        

953
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:27,772
            - Yes.              
         - I like it.           

954
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:29,340
           - Yeah.              

955
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:31,808
   - I just put out a new CD.   

956
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,810
           - Yes.               
        - A new tape.           

957
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,279
     - It's a new tape.         
  It's called "Pound Cake."     

958
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,313
           - Exactly.           

959
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,448
     - Now, as your first       
        official duty,          

960
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,817
    I'd like your opinion       
     on an audition tape        

961
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:44,852
       made by a young          
     up and coming queen        

962
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:46,753
     just getting started       
           in drag.             

963
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:49,022
      Let's take a look.        
         - Certainly.           

964
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:52,058
  - Three words to describe     
     Alaska Thunderfuck         

965
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,226
      Drug addicted whore,      

966
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:58,096
      batshit crazy,            
      hot mess city.            

967
00:38:58,098 --> 00:39:00,030
    Because I have class,       

968
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:04,334
         I have grace,          
  and I have sophistication.    

969
00:39:04,336 --> 00:39:06,069
            - Yes.              
          (applause)            

970
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:10,906
- I'd say put her on "Drag Race"
         in five years.         

971
00:39:10,908 --> 00:39:12,240
         (all laugh)            

972
00:39:12,242 --> 00:39:14,775
        - Now, that was         
     the second audition.       

973
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:17,143
             - Yeah.            
 - And then you sent in a third.

974
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:18,845
          - Uh-huh.             
       - And a fourth.          

975
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:21,280
          - Uh-huh.             
   - (laughs) And a fifth.      

976
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,647
          - Uh-huh.             

977
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:24,281
         (all laugh)            

978
00:39:24,283 --> 00:39:26,183
    I'm going to send one       
       next year, too.          

979
00:39:26,185 --> 00:39:28,619
         (all laugh)            

980
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:30,621
 - Now, all you other ladies,   
       you got to admit         

981
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:33,423
          that Alaska           
  was stiff competition. Oh.    

982
00:39:33,425 --> 00:39:34,924
   - (imitating Mae West) Oh.   

983
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:37,292
   - What are your favorite     
        Alaska moments?         

984
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,292
   - Snatch Game, for sure.     
            - Yes.              

985
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,427
  - I farted laughing so hard.  

986
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:42,762
    - "Executive opulence,      
   anus-thing is possible."     

987
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:47,400
 - It was always good, but it   
became perfect in "All Stars."  

988
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:48,700
     - Charismic beauty,        
     disturbing talent,         

989
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:50,034
    I think you define that.    

990
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:51,802
           - Alaska,            
   from the very beginning,     

991
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:54,571
  I saw in you perseverance,    
        a sense of fun,         

992
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,372
    a sense of intellect,       

993
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:59,308
      a sense of being          
     a marketing genius,        

994
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:03,012
       which is really          
     the future of drag.        

995
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:06,715
      And I'm so happy          
      for your success.         

996
00:40:06,717 --> 00:40:08,417
          Very happy.           
         - Thank you.           

997
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:09,851
        This is amazing.        

998
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,919
   Everybody turned it up,      
       turned it out,           

999
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:14,855
 and like, made this the best   
  season of "Drag Race" ever.   

1000
00:40:14,857 --> 00:40:16,322
   - Yes, this was absolutely   

1001
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:18,390
        the best season         
     of "Drag Race" ever.       

1002
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:21,894
   And you all have been so     
gracious to share your stories  

1003
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:25,864
     and your heartbreak        
      and your dignity.         

1004
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:28,700
      And I am so proud         
       of each of you.          

1005
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:31,235
           (applause)           

1006
00:40:31,237 --> 00:40:33,604
       Now, remember,           
 if you can't love yourself,    

1007
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:36,073
  how in the hell you gonna     
     love somebody else?        

1008
00:40:36,075 --> 00:40:37,575
      Can I get an amen         
         up in here?            

1009
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:38,575
           - Amen.              
           - Amen.              

1010
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:40,543
        - All right,            
   now let the music play.      

1011
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:41,844
  - ¶ Throw your hands up ¶     

1012
00:40:41,846 --> 00:40:44,546
      ¶ Time to get down ¶      

1013
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:45,947
     ¶ Throw your hand up ¶     

1014
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:48,483
           - Come on.           

1015
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:51,752
     - ¶ Time to get down,      
   down, down, down, down ¶     

1016
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:57,122
         - Oh, my gosh.         

1017
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,657
            (laughs)            

1018
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:00,358
            Mwah.               

1019
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,427
     - Chad, do you ever        
     get lonely in here?        

1020
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:04,762
      - Snap out of it.
