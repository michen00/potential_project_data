1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,968
          - Previously          
        on "All Stars,"         

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:08,072
   I will not be eliminating    
    any queens this season.     

3
00:00:08,107 --> 00:00:10,707
            - What?             
            - What?             

4
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:14,510
         - This season,         
     you'll be eliminating      

5
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:15,678
          each other.           

6
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:18,813
   The winner of the lip sync   

7
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:22,283
         will eliminate         
   one of the bottom queens.    

8
00:00:27,388 --> 00:00:29,288
      - That was a choice.      

9
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:33,191
   -  We're gonna make love    
     to the clap tonight       

10
00:00:33,226 --> 00:00:36,027
     - Girl, find the note.     

11
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:37,895
   - I didn't hate your hair.   

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,996
       - I did it myself.       

13
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,564
          - That shows          
     you've done something.     

14
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,099
  I don't care if you're gonna  
   give me your hog body line   

15
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,801
       or whatever it is.       
         - Oh, my God.          

16
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:48,236
         - It's just--          
    I expected more for you.    

17
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,905
       - Roxxxy Andrews.        

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,840
     You're a winner, baby.     

19
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,408
           (applause)           

20
00:00:54,443 --> 00:00:59,312
    You've earned a cash tip    
          of $10,000.           

21
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:03,616
  Which queen have you chosen   
        to get the chop?        

22
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:05,784
         - I won money          
   and I might lose a friend,   

23
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,919
          but the girl          
        that I chose...         

24
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,288
            Is Coco.            

25
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:16,059
        - Coco Montrese,        
          sashay away.          

26
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:28,203
            - Bitch.            

27
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,705
            - Coco.             
            - Oh...             

28
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:35,175
     - I'm very torn about      
    winning these lip syncs.    

29
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,610
   Having to pick these girls   
          week by week          

30
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:39,078
    is going to be so hard,     

31
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:41,346
      but I also came here      
    to play the game, so...     

32
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:44,048
        - Bye, Coquita.         

33
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,682
   - Well, this is definitely   
          "All Stars."          

34
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:48,785
           Tatianna,            
      who was your choice?      

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,388
         - It was, um,          
       it was Coco also.        

36
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,624
         I didn't think         
    she represented herself     

37
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:56,925
          to the best           
       of her abilities.        

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,028
       Giving the winner        
        of the lip sync         

39
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:03,197
     the power to send one      
   of the bottom people home    

40
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:04,731
            changes             
     the whole competition.     

41
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:08,500
   I feel like now I have to    
      not only impress Ru,      

42
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,503
        but also impress        
        my competitors.         

43
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:13,771
         It's not fun.          

44
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:16,240
   - This is a fucking doozy    
    and it's just starting.     

45
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:17,774
        - Just starting.        
        - Just starting.        

46
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:20,176
     - When she said safe,      
    I was like, okay, bitch.    

47
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:21,944
     So then they gave her      
         her critiques.         

48
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,279
      I said, well, damn.       
            - Yeah.             

49
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,481
  - I'm glad I got my one-way   
    ticket to the back room.    

50
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,149
           - Exactly.           
  - Like, we were back there,   

51
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:30,417
      like, Jesus, they're      
       going the fuck in.       

52
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:31,551
    - And they were poking,     
             bitch,             

53
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,386
     just like every little     
          wrong thing,          

54
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,454
    they got everybody for.     

55
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,356
   - It's become immediately    
          very clear,           

56
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,658
      this is "All Stars."      
     This is gonna be hard.     

57
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,060
     There's so much talent     
       in this one room,        

58
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,829
        this is gonna be        
       something to see.        

59
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:47,964
         - Every time.          
          - Whoo-whee!          

60
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,632
       - You know, coming       
      in this competition,      

61
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,066
   you think you can prepare.   

62
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,934
      It's like everything      
      you thought you knew      

63
00:02:52,969 --> 00:02:54,568
      flies out the window      

64
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,603
          while you're          
    going 90 on the highway.    

65
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:59,839
 - We're still here and we get  
 to send people home next week. 

66
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:01,373
        - Who would you         
        have sent home?         

67
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:03,475
          - I thought           
   I would've chosen Phi Phi.   

68
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,810
      - I don't know, man.      

69
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:06,877
       - I don't, either.       

70
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,245
          I don't know          
       if I could do it.        

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,013
          - Ru gave us          
       a responsibility.        

72
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:12,315
       As the competition       
          progresses,           

73
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,449
       it's going to get        
        more difficult.         

74
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,184
        And could it be         
    one of those situations     

75
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:17,452
   where you scratch my back,   
      I'll scratch yours?       

76
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:19,987
  It's going to be interesting  
   to see how this turns out.   

77
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,122
   Baby, this is "All Stars."   

78
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:23,790
            Game on.            

79
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:31,897
   - The winner of "RuPaul's    
      Drag Race All Stars"      

80
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:33,465
   receives a one-year supply   

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,834
   of Anastasia Beverly Hills   
           cosmetics,           

82
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:38,403
     a coveted spot in the      
   "Drag Race" hall of fame,    

83
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,140
        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000.          

84
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,375
         -  Drag race,         
      May the best woman       

85
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,977
        Best woman win        

86
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:53,282
       - The category is        
          Bundt cake.           

87
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,716
          (all laugh)           

88
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,651
        - It's a new day        
       and I've been able       

89
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,719
        to kind of sleep        
         on everything.         

90
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:01,154
   This new power that we're    
 given, it changes everything.  

91
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:05,991
     It's like fucking drag     
  survivor, so nobody's safe.   

92
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:07,392
            No one.             

93
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,527
   - Tatianna said like this.   

94
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:11,462
           Tatianna,            
        here's Tatianna.        

95
00:04:11,497 --> 00:04:14,498
    - And choices. Choices.     

96
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:18,401
- I'm still feeling a bit burned
   from the judges' feedback.   

97
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:21,303
     I'm feeling sideswiped     

98
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:24,306
       and I'm not liking       
        how I'm feeling.        

99
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:27,542
            (alarm)             
             - Ooh!             

100
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:30,578
        - She's already         
         done had hers.         

101
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,613
         - Hey, queens.         
             - Hey.             

102
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:36,116
   - Now, I brought you here    
   because you are all stars.   

103
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,052
            But now,            
     I want all new stars.      

104
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:41,354
          Don't worry,          
       it's not personal.       

105
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,222
           It's drag.           

106
00:04:43,257 --> 00:04:46,291
   So who else you got, huh?    

107
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:49,794
      Hello, hello, hello.      

108
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:51,829
             - Hi.              
             - Hi.              

109
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,931
      - I'm giving you all      
          Mini Mouse.           

110
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:57,467
  - Ladies, here in Hollywood,  
     all the biggest celebs     

111
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:00,970
      know that the key to      
   longevity is reinvention.    

112
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,272
       So for this week's       
        maxi challenge,         

113
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:06,675
      you get to reinvent       
   yourselves all over again    

114
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,912
       because it's time        
   for an "All Star" edition    

115
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:14,714
        of Snatch Game.         

116
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:18,117
      #SnatchGameAllStars.      

117
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,620
         - Oh, my God.          
      Snatch Game already.      

118
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,555
     - It's like Christmas      
          came early.           

119
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,756
            Oh, God,            
      I can't even say it.      

120
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,790
  I'm not even gonna say that.  

121
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,858
        I was gonna make        
         a joke about--         

122
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:31,394
          - Gentlemen,          
      start your engines,       

123
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:34,830
  and may the best woman win.   

124
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:37,766
          (all laugh)           
         Come on, okay.         

125
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,239
 - This is the snatchety snatch 
snatch, snatch, snatch, snatch. 

126
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,740
      - Who are you doing?      
        - Teresa Caputo.        

127
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,641
          - I was also          
      going to do Teresa--      

128
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,010
     I'm going to do, um...     
        - She's like...         

129
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,244
   - I'm doing Teresa Caputo.   

130
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,013
          - All right,          
     battle of the Teresas.     

131
00:05:55,048 --> 00:05:56,581
           - And you?           
          - Mae West.           

132
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:58,649
       Who are you doing?       
    - I'm going to do Bjork.    

133
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:00,350
          - Oh, right.          

134
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,785
    - "All Star" Snatch Game    
        gives the chance        

135
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,522
 for those who bombed in their  
  season to really stand out.   

136
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:10,325
  So Alyssa, Detox and Phi Phi  
   have a lot of work to do.    

137
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,527
    - Girl, the last minute     
  Snatch Game fucking sucked.   

138
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:15,463
     In Season 4, I sucked      
      on the Snatch Game.       

139
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,764
        Work it, girl         

140
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:20,367
  Give a twirl, give a twirl,  
         give a twirl          

141
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:21,968
       So this challenge        
         is important.          

142
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:23,736
     - I think I'm gonna do     
          Nancy Grace.          

143
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:24,903
    I think that'll be fun.     

144
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:27,238
       It'll be something       
       different for me.        

145
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:30,007
      It's super important      
     for me to do very well     

146
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:33,577
   because I shit on myself,    
          pretty much,          

147
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:34,811
     the last time around.      

148
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:36,813
  - You're at the Snatch Game,  
             honey.             

149
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:37,847
         - What's that?         

150
00:06:39,383 --> 00:06:41,216
       - So the pressure        
         is very high.          

151
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:42,817
         - You're doing         
         Joan Crawford.         

152
00:06:42,852 --> 00:06:43,818
            - Yeah.             
        - Joan Crawfish.        

153
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:45,986
      - Ms. Mommy Dearest.      
          - Yes, God.           

154
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:47,988
   - Now, can talk like Joan    
      without your accent?      

155
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,390
   - I think you should leave   
          the accent.           

156
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:53,793
  - I've fought worst monsters  
    for years in Hollywood.     

157
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:56,796
          (all laugh)           

158
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:59,632
- Alyssa's got to redeem herself
      from the Katy Perry.      

159
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:00,733
        - Have you ever         
         kissed a girl?         

160
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,001
       - Oh! Rue, never.        

161
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,936
        - But, uh, yeah.        

162
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,737
      - 'Cause it's either      
   going to be a train wreck    

163
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:10,240
    or it's gonna be a fun,     
        hilarious train.        

164
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:11,674
  It's gonna be a train wreck   
          regardless.           

165
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:15,444
   - Who did you--oh, you won   
the Snatch Game in your season. 

166
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,512
     - I won the first ever     
          Snatch Game.          

167
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:19,280
       - Oh, so you think       
        you're somebody.        

168
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,382
        - A little bit.         
         A little bit.          

169
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,751
       My Britney Spears        
          got me far.           

170
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,319
           - Britney,           
    Dumb Dee Dee's so dumb,     

171
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,387
  last night she got arrested   
    for driving without a...    

172
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:29,122
      - A baby in her lap.      

173
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,389
           - (laughs)           

174
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:31,923
       - Do you feel like       
   you have more pressure now   

175
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,324
     that you already won?      

176
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,692
      - Um, a little bit,       

177
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:36,894
   but I'm trying not to even   
      get in that mindset.      

178
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:38,896
            - Yeah.             

179
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:41,965
  - Should have let her know,   
             bitch,             

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,333
    that was unintentional,     
            darling.            

181
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:46,202
      The one joke she had      
  was an--Adore, are you okay?  

182
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:48,037
           - Uh-huh.            

183
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:52,540
Even though I'm trying to put on
   a smiley face for the day,   

184
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,875
          everything's          
        just processing.        

185
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,279
  And at this point, I'm just   
   trying to figure shit out.   

186
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,014
           (sniffles)           

187
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,750
     - Hello, hello, hello,     
          kitty girls.          

188
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,085
             - Hi.              
             - Hi.              

189
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,953
        - Adore Delano.         

190
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,254
           - Hi, Ru.            

191
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,725
     - Now, last time, your     
Anna Nicole Smith was on point. 

192
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,993
    It was iconic, actually.    

193
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:18,928
          - Thank you.          
      - Who are you doing?      

194
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:21,897
       - Um, Jan Crouch.        

195
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:24,299
       - I live for her.        
            - Yeah.             

196
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:27,768
  - Why are your eyes all red?  

197
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,169
            - Um...             

198
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:32,205
       I didn't expect--        
    I just didn't expect it     

199
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,073
   to be like this, I think.    

200
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:38,643
  I'm thinking of going home.   

201
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:42,079
       - Of tapping out?        
         - I think so.          

202
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:48,151
        (RuPaul laughs)         

203
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:50,219
        (RuPaul laughs)         

204
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:54,188
         - I'm thinking         
         of going home.         

205
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:56,256
       - Of tapping out?        

206
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,890
         - I think so.          

207
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,158
             - Why?             

208
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,561
     - I think that, like,      
    the critiques last night    

209
00:09:03,596 --> 00:09:05,896
   and just, like, the vibes.   

210
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:07,998
           - You felt           
     they were extra harsh?     

211
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,567
         - Yeah, I did.         

212
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,535
        The Adore thing         
         is the flannel         

213
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,303
   and the fucking Riot girl    

214
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:17,606
  and grunge-inspired nineties  
    movement kind of thing,     

215
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,410
         and it's such          
   a sensitive subject for me   

216
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:26,146
to work with hundreds of queens 
       that don't get it.       

217
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:27,614
  And then to come back here,   

218
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,250
    and I feel like Michelle    
  does not take me seriously.   

219
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,255
      I believe in beauty       
in a denim jacket and barefoot. 

220
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,856
  - I love all forms of drag.   

221
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:38,957
          - Of course.          

222
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,224
     - But if you're saying     

223
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:43,060
 that because of the critiques  
       on the main stage        

224
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,829
         are the reason         
      you're tapping out,       

225
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:48,531
         is that enough         
        to tap out for?         

226
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:54,136
          I feel like           
    you are being sabotaged     

227
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:55,871
    by your inner saboteur.     

228
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:01,508
    - I look really dramatic    
           right now,           

229
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:04,844
    but it means a lot to me    
   to just stick to my guns.    

230
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,746
    I know how hard it took     

231
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,013
         for me to gain         
        that confidence         

232
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:12,383
       and own my stardom       
   like you taught me how to.   

233
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,252
- What you're doing sounds like 
  the opposite of confidence.   

234
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:19,288
Confidence means you'll weather 
   the storm no matter what.    

235
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:20,989
        I just know that        
   you're stronger than this,   

236
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:25,460
 and I feel that you're making  
  this decision based on fear.  

237
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:29,230
    The idea of tapping out     
  and not sticking it through,  

238
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:31,899
  what do you think that says   
      to your young fans?       

239
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,700
       - I've taken what        
        you've given me         

240
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:36,769
    and I've built a career     
      off of my aesthetic,      

241
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:39,404
  and that speaks to them all.  

242
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:43,608
     On social media, there     
    was some critiques made     

243
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,076
    about my drag aesthetic,    

244
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:50,347
  and I tried to kind of like,  
     you know, zhuz it up.      

245
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:51,614
     At the meet and greet,     

246
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,216
 one of the fans came up to me  
       and she was upset.       

247
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,850
      She was just, like,       
   you look so uncomfortable    

248
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,284
    and I know you did this     
        because of this.        

249
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,754
         And just know          
       that what you do,        

250
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:04,457
    this is why we dress up     
           like you.            

251
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:07,326
       And there's no one       
      like you right now.       

252
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:10,362
      And to hear them say      
       how much it means,       

253
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,429
           that's all           
    running through my head.    

254
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:14,231
          - You know,           
      you are loved here,       

255
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,199
    and I want you to stay.     

256
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,368
   I feel that you will live    
        to regret this,         

257
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:20,736
           and that's           
       your prerogative.        

258
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:23,071
  - I am so forever grateful,   

259
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:26,240
      and I love you like       
    a fucking family member.    

260
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,208
    You've changed my world.    

261
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,677
         I have to go.          

262
00:11:30,712 --> 00:11:33,079
      - Is there anything       
       I could say to you       

263
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:35,047
      that would make you       
       change your mind?        

264
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,948
       Is there anything        
         in the world?          

265
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:38,216
      Because I'll say it.      

266
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:44,654
   - I feel really confused.    

267
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:56,230
       - I'd like for you       
      to talk to Michelle,      

268
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:59,433
  because I know what she said  
       on the main stage        

269
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,068
     is a big part of this.     

270
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:04,403
           I respect            
  whatever decision you make.   

271
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:05,771
        - I'm so sorry.         

272
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:07,873
    - Well, let me give you     
           some love.           

273
00:12:11,477 --> 00:12:13,243
        I want you to go        
      and talk to Michelle      

274
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:14,577
    so you can resolve that,    
             okay?              

275
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,045
           All right.           
       I love you, kiddo.       

276
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
     - Thank you very much.     
          - All right.          

277
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:25,086
    - I cannot believe Adore    

278
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,655
          is actually           
     seriously considering      

279
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,357
    leaving the competition     
          voluntarily.          

280
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:33,326
    I'm hoping that Michelle    
   can say something to Adore   

281
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,927
    that will make her stay.    

282
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:37,995
        - Hello, Alaska.        

283
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,329
            - Hi-ee.            

284
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:42,832
   - Things are just changing   
   around here by the second.   

285
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:48,837
     - I'm so disappointed      
in what is happening with Adore,

286
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:51,606
    and I can't even believe    
   that it's even happening.    

287
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:54,508
  This is a huge opportunity,   
   so it's really upsetting,    

288
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:57,043
           and I hope           
     she changes her mind.      

289
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:58,511
         - Yeah. I hope         
      she changes her mind.     

290
00:12:58,546 --> 00:12:59,979
         But, you know,         
     when you're up against     

291
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:02,581
      that kind of energy       
      that's in your head,      

292
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,115
   it's hard to overcome it.    

293
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,250
        All right, well,        
    let's talk Snatch Game.     

294
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,719
 You did Lady Bunny last time,  
   and you did it very well.    

295
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,587
      You were very funny.      
          - Thank you.          

296
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:14,290
        - And this time         
        I see a big hat.        

297
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:18,193
       Is that Mae West?        
         - Oh, yes-uh.          

298
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:21,329
    - (laughs) Have you ever    
     done Mae West before?      

299
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:22,863
             - No.              

300
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:25,165
 - You know, a lot of her catch 
phrases--she had a ton of them. 

301
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,601
     - Mm, yeah, a hard man     
    is good to find, mm, mm.    

302
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,235
           - (laughs)           

303
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,071
 Mae West is a funny character, 
       but the thing is,        

304
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,406
       there are a lot of       
      fierce bitches here.      

305
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,941
      Don't underestimate       
       what they can do.        

306
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:39,208
         - Absolutely.          

307
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,876
    - Well, I cannot wait to    
  see you in the Snatch Game.   

308
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:42,878
         Make me laugh.         
            Bye-ee.             

309
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:44,713
           - Bye-ee.            

310
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:50,350
             - Hi.              

311
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:52,318
   As I see Michelle outside,   

312
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,219
      a bunch of emotions       
          are coming.           

313
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:56,187
    I'm upset, I'm confused.    

314
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:57,488
   - Honey, what's going on?    

315
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:59,389
         - I'm leaving.         

316
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:00,556
         - Tell me why.         

317
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,858
   - I just didn't feel like    
        this is for me.         

318
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,192
           - Because?           

319
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,560
   - You're a bit harsh, bro.   

320
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,661
           - Listen.            

321
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:09,096
      - But it didn't seem      
         constructive.          

322
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,732
  It felt like let's kind of--  

323
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:13,666
      - Like take her down      
            a notch?            

324
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:14,900
            - Yeah.             

325
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,167
    - If you thought it was     
   personal, absolutely not.    

326
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,269
  - I thought it was personal.  
      It sounded personal.      

327
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,070
     - No. Absolutely not.      

328
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:21,471
    - I wanted to throw out     
            my soul.            

329
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:23,840
 - What did you think you were  
      going to come into?       

330
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,409
 You know that everything I say 
  is not for me to be a bitch.  

331
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:29,478
    It's for me to push you     
   and push you and push you.   

332
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:31,813
       I want to see you,       
    in 20 years like RuPaul.    

333
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:33,014
      I want to see that.       

334
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,682
       We've talked about       
      your drag aesthetic.      

335
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,884
    We've had many arguments    
           about it.            

336
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm pushing you to do something,
  yeah, okay, off-brand maybe   

337
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:43,289
          or something          
   you wouldn't do normally.    

338
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,592
           - Outside            
      of this competition,      

339
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:50,261
   Michelle and I have worked   
        a lot together.         

340
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:51,895
   She definitely tries to do   

341
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,297
      the mother hen thing      
       with my aesthetic.       

342
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:57,333
- While we are here to celebrate
 all that makes you different,  

343
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:59,001
   it's still a competition.    

344
00:14:59,036 --> 00:15:00,302
    - I also don't want you     
            to think            

345
00:15:00,337 --> 00:15:04,605
     that I am being a brat     
       or unappreciative.       

346
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,239
         The reason why         
       I get so emotional       

347
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:08,441
           is because           
      I do care about you.      

348
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:13,979
         And going back         
   to getting judged by you,    

349
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,914
          the dynamic           
    is completely different.    

350
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,683
            - It is!            
  - And it's fucking with me!   

351
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,885
      - Again, I can only       
           apologize            

352
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,320
     if it came out harsher     
     than it was intended.      

353
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,590
     I'm apologizing to you     
  in front of fucking cameras.  

354
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,358
     I don't even apologize     
        to my children.         

355
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,492
       That makes me sad.       

356
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:30,893
           - I know.            
        It makes me sad.        

357
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,628
  I'm not even, like, myself.   

358
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:34,463
        I'm not Eeyore.         
     Like, I'm sick of it.      

359
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,631
Like, I'm, like, walking around 
  with puffy-ass fucking eyes.  

360
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,865
      I'm trying to smile       
            and shit            

361
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,466
          looking like          
     a fuckin swollen baby.     

362
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,501
         - Tomorrow's--         
       You're so stupid.        

363
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:43,469
    Tomorrow is another day.    

364
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:46,205
  I don't want you to wake up   
        tomorrow morning        

365
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,207
     and go, what did I do?     

366
00:15:48,242 --> 00:15:49,741
   And that's a possibility.    

367
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:56,179
 - I don't want to put Michelle 
    or myself in a position     

368
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:58,548
   to where either one of us    
      have to compromise.       

369
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,317
        This is her job.        
         She's a judge.         

370
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:02,985
         I'd be damned          
    if I go down that runway    

371
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,820
       and her look at me       
       and be like, fuck,       

372
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:07,589
       I got to take easy       
   because she's the chiona.    

373
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:08,590
      There's a part of me      
      that's saying, like,      

374
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,459
      can I stick it out?       

375
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:18,530
         - Coming up...         

376
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:19,964
       - Can I be honest?       

377
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:22,299
   I think your Joan Crawford   
        is more like...         

378
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:23,733
         It's too you.          

379
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:27,269
   - I'm definitely noticing,   
     working with Phi Phi,      

380
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:29,237
     she's very strategic.      

381
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:30,939
       - I'm just saying,       
    you sounded like Alyssa.    

382
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:34,075
        (RuPaul laughs)         

383
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,744
        (RuPaul laughs)         

384
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,079
        - Hi, Tatianna.         
          - Hello, Ru.          

385
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:41,847
        - The last time         
    you played Snatch Game,     

386
00:16:41,882 --> 00:16:43,348
  your Britney was exquisite.   

387
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:44,782
     You won the challenge.     

388
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,651
    How are you gonna repeat    
         your success?          

389
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:49,452
   - I'm doing Ariana Grande.   

390
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:50,820
         - Oh, my God,          
       of course you are.       

391
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:51,821
            - Yeah.             

392
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:53,589
         - What are her         
         catch phrases?         

393
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:56,058
       - She doesn't have       
    too many catch phrases,     

394
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:58,393
        but she's given         
    a lot of funny moments.     

395
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:02,363
  - I have a feeling that for   
 the decades since you were on, 

396
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,765
   that you have been waiting   
        for this moment         

397
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,567
    to see all these bitches    
        with your hands.        

398
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:08,568
          Am I right?           

399
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,803
            - Yeah,             
      to a certain extent.      

400
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:15,540
I realized never try to win over
 the naysayers and the haters.  

401
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,642
     Put all of your energy     
   into impressing the people   

402
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:21,145
   who were supporters of you   
      from the beginning.       

403
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,514
      - That is very wise,      
     because you know what?     

404
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:25,449
        I ain't got time        
  for the people who hate me.   

405
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:26,950
      I'm too busy loving       
    the people who love me.     

406
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:28,384
           - Exactly.           

407
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:31,120
  - Are we gonna see you with   
 them hands on the Snatch Game? 

408
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,521
           - Oh, yes.           
        - Make it funny.        

409
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:33,688
         - Definitely.          
            - Okay.             

410
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:35,890
          - Thank you.          
           - (laughs)           

411
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,057
          Hey, Roxxxy.          

412
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:39,292
        -<i> Hola, mi amor.</i>        
          <i> Como estas?</i>          

413
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,661
  - You won $10,000 last week.  

414
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:42,728
         - Oh, my God.          

415
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:44,996
       - You had to also        
       eliminate a queen.       

416
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,697
    - A girl that I've known    
     since I started drag.      

417
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,065
             - Wow.             

418
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,666
  - And I might not have that   
   friendship because of it.    

419
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,868
        - But, honestly,        
    she's a seasoned queen.     

420
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,669
           She knows            
  how this competition works.   

421
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,638
    Do you really think that    
 she will hold it against you?  

422
00:17:56,673 --> 00:17:58,673
        - I know if she         
     was thinking like me,      

423
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,608
         I would think          
    that's my girl, Roxxxy.     

424
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:02,876
         Since she won,         
     maybe she'll keep me.      

425
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:05,912
        Like, you know,         
       she's on my side.        

426
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:08,347
  - Now, last time you played   
Snatch Game, you did very well. 

427
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:09,348
          - Boom! Yes!          

428
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:11,216
         - Yes, you did         
        Tamara Braxton.         

429
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,283
     - Tamara Braxton, yes.     

430
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:14,652
       - I have no idea.        

431
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:15,820
          - A Latina.           

432
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:18,622
         I love Ellen.          

433
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,657
        - I don't know.         

434
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:22,291
        - Sofia Vergara.        

435
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:23,759
          - Of course.          
         - Oh, my God.          

436
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:26,795
   - I cannot wait to see you   
 out there in the Snatch Game.  

437
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,862
      Just make me laugh.       

438
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,230
           - I will.            
          - All right.          

439
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:30,364
          - I promise.          
       - Thanks, Roxxxy.        

440
00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:31,598
          - Thank you.          

441
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,099
          - All right,          
       listen up, ladies.       

442
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:35,000
       In a few moments,        

443
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:37,502
         I'll meet you          
   on the set of Snatch Game,   

444
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:41,805
    where we will be joined     
    by two legendary queens.    

445
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,241
     "Drag Race All Stars"      
         Raven and Juju         

446
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:49,344
   will be your celebrities.    

447
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,945
         - Oh, my God.          

448
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
        - Juju and Raven        
     are going to be here?      

449
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,047
             Fuck.              

450
00:18:54,082 --> 00:18:55,948
         It's gonna be          
       a son of a bitch.        

451
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:59,284
         - So good luck         
     and don't fuck it up.      

452
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,919
            - Whoo.             

453
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,223
   - Adore finally comes back   
      into the work room.       

454
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:09,092
  She looks like she had just   
   been crying or something.    

455
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,728
    - Um, I just don't feel     
        like I'm in it.         

456
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:15,964
It was something different than 
 I thought it was going to be.  

457
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,999
     I think I need to go.      

458
00:19:21,804 --> 00:19:24,571
     I'm leaving "RuPaul's      
    Drag Race All Stars 2."     

459
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,739
       I feel like shit.        

460
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:29,307
         - I love you,          

461
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:32,410
      but I don't want you      
    to give in to giving up.    

462
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:34,445
      - I just don't think      
      that this is for me.      

463
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,114
  It's so hard to say goodbye   
         to everybody.          

464
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,216
           Good luck.           
             - Oh.              

465
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:43,720
 - I know that not everybody is 
 going to agree with me, but... 

466
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:57,365
     - It's disappointing.      

467
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,333
   This is a huge opportunity   
     that we've been given,     

468
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:03,669
    and so many people wish     
    they could've been here.    

469
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,404
     It does suck because,      
           you know,            

470
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,172
  he's a good friend of mine.   

471
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,275
     But at the same time,      
      just one bitch down       

472
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,644
          who also was          
      a strong competitor.      

473
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,814
        So I'm just that        
   much closer to the crown.    

474
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,615
       - How do you feel?       

475
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,849
   Can I be honest with you?    
           - Mm-hmm.            

476
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,284
  - I'm just gonna be honest.   

477
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,587
   I think your Joan Crawford   
        is more like...         

478
00:20:25,622 --> 00:20:26,754
         It's too you.          

479
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:28,489
           - (scoffs)           

480
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:30,657
   - I don't want you, like,    
    offended by what I said.    

481
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:31,991
    - Oh, I'm not offended.     
            - Okay.             

482
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:35,127
     I'm just saying, like,     
   you sounded like a Alyssa.   

483
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:39,296
            - So...             

484
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:42,165
   - I'm definitely noticing,   
     working with Phi Phi,      

485
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,034
      she's very strategic      
      in this competition.      

486
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:47,802
         She's dropping         
        little comments,        

487
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:51,572
    I think in an effort to     
   make us a little insecure.   

488
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,885
        - Are you sure?         

489
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,487
      I'm second guessing       
          this accent.          

490
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:13,089
      I am totally getting      
      in my head about it.      

491
00:21:13,124 --> 00:21:15,758
    I'm thinking I am going     

492
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:17,393
     to change my character     
          completely.           

493
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,228
         - Coming up...         

494
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:22,263
          - You know,           
    I'm black by injection.     

495
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:23,998
          (all laugh)           

496
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,399
           - (laughs)           
      - Where's the body?       

497
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:28,201
       - Barbara, please.       
           - (laughs)           

498
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,236
        (RuPaul laughs)         

499
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,605
        (RuPaul laughs)         

500
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:39,509
  - Welcome to the "All Star"   
    edition of Snatch Game.     

501
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:41,844
  Let's meet our contestants.   

502
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:43,312
       A stay-at-home mom       

503
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:47,316
        from Riverside,         
       California, Raven.       

504
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:50,719
     And a flight attendant     

505
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:52,987
      who likes long walks      
         on the beach,          

506
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:56,090
           big dicks            
  and fried chicken, Jujubee.   

507
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,257
             - Hi.              

508
00:21:57,292 --> 00:22:00,326
    - Ladies, are you ready     
       to meet our stars?       

509
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,494
             - Yes!             
             - Yes!             

510
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,963
       - Praise the Lord,       
     it's Tammy Faye Baker.     

511
00:22:05,998 --> 00:22:08,065
          - Forget it.          

512
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,199
   - Are you wearing makeup?    

513
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,533
   - Just a little Chapstick.   

514
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:12,935
         - My goodness,         
  you are one of my favorites.  

515
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,504
        - I know. (sobs)        

516
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:21,209
   - Moving on, the original    
       blonde bombshell,        

517
00:22:21,244 --> 00:22:22,743
       Mae West is here.        

518
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:24,344
     - Well, howdy-doo, Ru?     

519
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:26,012
  - How's my little chickadee?  

520
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,346
   - When I'm good, I'm good,   

521
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:31,349
    but when I'm bad, I get     
  a serious venereal disease.   

522
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:34,251
           - (laughs)           

523
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:39,522
    Next, the totally whacky    
  and original Bjork is here.   

524
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,091
      - I love your suit.       
          - Thank you.          

525
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,993
 - It reminds me of the lining  
     of my small intestine.     

526
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:48,329
           - (laughs)           

527
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:53,466
     Next, the Long Island      
     medium, Teresa Caputo.     

528
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:56,502
    - Ru, does December 25th    
     mean anything to you?      

529
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:57,636
    - Yes, actually it does.    

530
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:59,671
    - Did you receive a gift    
          on that day?          

531
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,839
    - I absolutely received     
      a gift on that day.       

532
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:03,707
        - I got a gift.         
             - Wow.             

533
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:05,075
    - Don't mess up my hair,    
            please.             

534
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,142
            - Sorry.            

535
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,811
  - Now, ladies and gentleman,  

536
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,146
  the legendary Joan Crawford.  

537
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,413
    How are the kids, Joan?     

538
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:15,416
         - Deliberately         
     trying to embarrass me     

539
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:16,683
  in front of these reporters.  

540
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:17,917
          - Oh-ho-ho!           

541
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:20,986
   - I fought worst monsters    
    for years in Hollywood.     

542
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:22,053
         - Yes, I know.         

543
00:23:22,088 --> 00:23:24,021
       - Barbara, please.       

544
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:27,457
           - (laughs)           

545
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:30,426
     - Don't fuck with me,      
            fellas.             

546
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:32,428
           - (laughs)           

547
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:36,498
      All right, now TV's       
     toughest legal eagle,      

548
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:38,366
      Nancy Grace is here,      
     ladies and gentlemen.      

549
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,935
    - Breaking news, we need    
   to get down to the basics    

550
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,536
  of the alleged child abuse.   

551
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:44,905
        - Joan Crawford?        
      - Where's the body?       

552
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,540
          - Christina,          
        bring me the ax.        

553
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:49,975
              No!               

554
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,912
       - Moving on down,        
     Ariana Grande is here.     

555
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,079
           - Hi, Ru.            

556
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,447
        - Are you ready         
         to break free?         

557
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:59,115
            - Yeah.             

558
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,753
    - Next, the one and only    
          Alaska 5000.          

559
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:07,489
            - Hi-ee.            

560
00:24:07,524 --> 00:24:10,558
     - Roxxxy Andrews total     
      last minute decision      

561
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:11,893
      to switch to Alaska.      

562
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:17,430
     - I just have to ask,      
  is that a wig on your head?   

563
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:20,232
      - Uh, if you're not       
         wearing wigs,          

564
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:22,266
  then you're not doing drag.   

565
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:27,470
      - Girl, even I know       
       that Alaska's song       

566
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:30,005
     is "this is not a wig,     
       this is my hair."        

567
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,339
     - What's the big idea?     

568
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:33,107
        - Yeah. (laughs)        

569
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:36,176
           All right,           
    let's play Snatch Game.     

570
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:37,610
     Juju, this is for you.     

571
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:38,611
            - Okay.             

572
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:41,146
          - Those sexy          
       Kardashian sisters       

573
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:45,483
  are starring in a new sci-fi  
   epic called "Star blank."    

574
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,917
    Pens down, celebrities.     

575
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,485
         Okay, Jujubee.         

576
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,421
       - I'm gonna do it.       
         "Star Booty."          

577
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,389
        - "Star Booty."         
        - Uh-huh, girl.         

578
00:24:53,424 --> 00:24:54,523
           - Let's go           
       to the celebrities       

579
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,191
      and see if you have       
      any matches on that.      

580
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:59,894
            - Zero.             
        - Joan Crawford.        

581
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,563
         "Star Booty."          
        That's a match.         

582
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:03,830
       You got it, lady.        

583
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:05,765
   - You think you're clever,   
           don't you?           

584
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,000
           - (laughs)           

585
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,302
      - Well, think again.      

586
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:13,772
    - Let's go on down to--     
          Oh, Alaska,           

587
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:15,940
    what have you done with     
    your lipstick, darling?     

588
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,642
  - Oh, my makeup is terrible.  

589
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:21,511
  Now, Ru, I didn't put booty,  

590
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:24,947
      but I did put anus,       
      available on iTunes.      

591
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,449
       - You know, close,       
        but not a match.        

592
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,884
             - Aw.              
   - Missed it by this much.    

593
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,186
            - Hi-ee.            
      - Okay, here we go.       

594
00:25:32,221 --> 00:25:33,854
         Ariana Grande,         
   oh, she's got a doughnut.    

595
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:35,822
  You're licking the doughnut.  

596
00:25:35,857 --> 00:25:37,590
      - I love doughnuts.       
     - You love doughnuts.      

597
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,857
     - And I love America.      

598
00:25:38,892 --> 00:25:40,325
  - What's your favorite thing  
         about America?         

599
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,294
    - Oh, gosh, the people,     
    the places, the things.     

600
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,461
             - Yes.             
            - Nouns.            

601
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:45,795
        - Yeah. (laughs)        

602
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,997
      So I just, you know,      
       I drew a doughnut.       

603
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,532
       - "Star Doughnuts"       
        is not a match.         

604
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,333
     All right, let's move      
    on down to Nancy Grace.     

605
00:25:52,368 --> 00:25:56,870
        - This just in.         
   I wrote "Star Injections."   

606
00:25:56,905 --> 00:25:58,104
      - "Star Injections."      

607
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,307
      - Illegal injections      
   of silicone into the body.   

608
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:02,841
          - You know,           
    I'm black by injection.     

609
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:06,644
         - Oh! (laughs)         

610
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:08,746
      This is going to be       
           for Raven.           

611
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:12,149
The pit crew have spent way too 
 much time around drag queens.  

612
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:16,953
 Now, before they slip on their 
  Andrew Christian underwear,   

613
00:26:16,988 --> 00:26:20,456
       they blank. Raven.       

614
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:24,292
  - They take a very tasteful   
 photo of their nether regions  

615
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:26,494
    so that they can post it    
            online.             

616
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,429
      They take a selfie.       

617
00:26:28,464 --> 00:26:29,730
     - They take a selfie.      

618
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:31,732
    Let's see if you've got     
     any matches over here.     

619
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:32,933
          - All right,          
       Tammy Faye Baker.        

620
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,367
   - As it says in the book,    

621
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:39,070
    before thou puteth oneth    
         a thongeth...          

622
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:40,071
      - Yes, uh-huh, yes.       

623
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:41,439
       - Thou must pray.        

624
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,007
            - Pray.             
            - Pray.             

625
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:44,975
      Yeah, I got to pray       
 before I put on my underwear.  

626
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,010
        Most of the time        
  they don't even fit anymore   

627
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:48,511
       they're so filled        
        with God's love.        

628
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:52,982
  - Yes, that is not a match,   
 but a very, very good answer.  

629
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:54,616
    It's a very good answer.    

630
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,818
           - I just--           
- You tried your best, darling. 

631
00:26:56,853 --> 00:26:58,052
           - I tried.           

632
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:00,720
   - Moving on down to Bjork.   

633
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:02,588
      - Actually, I think       
    I have the right answer.    

634
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:03,622
        - Okay, you have        
       the right answer?        

635
00:27:03,657 --> 00:27:06,091
      - I said they remove      
        their testicles.        

636
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,560
   - Oh, the judges say, no,    
             Bjork.             

637
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:10,528
  - Oh, I just put mine here.   

638
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,896
     - You have testicles?      

639
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:16,032
 - Sometimes I don't understand 
    anything about science.     

640
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:19,402
      - I'm sorry, Bjork,       
   but not a match, darling.    

641
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,404
       - Oh, that's fine.       

642
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,305
           - (laughs)           

643
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,408
    Hey, let's move on down     
   to the Long Island medium.   

644
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:28,609
     - Now, we've never met     
            before,             

645
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:29,876
      so I want everybody       
         to know this.          

646
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:30,977
             - Yes.             

647
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,211
  - I just know exactly what,   
           you know,            

648
00:27:32,246 --> 00:27:36,214
the producers and the background
       checkers told me.        

649
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:37,481
          - Uh, okay.           

650
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:41,684
     - I mean, the spirits      
    are telling me a selfie.    

651
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,419
        - A selfie, wow.        

652
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,120
     - Yes, the spirits are     
    telling me a--thank you.    

653
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:47,222
       - That's uncanny.        
    That's spooky, isn't it?    

654
00:27:47,257 --> 00:27:48,489
       - I'm telling you,       
         I have a gift.         

655
00:27:48,524 --> 00:27:49,756
             - Yay.             

656
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:52,558
        - Let's move on         
       to Joan Crawford.        

657
00:27:52,593 --> 00:27:53,792
        What do you say?        

658
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:57,829
  - Clean all the wire hangers  
       out of the closet.       

659
00:27:57,864 --> 00:28:00,097
     - Wire hangers, Joan?      

660
00:28:00,132 --> 00:28:04,934
    - No wire hangers ever!     

661
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:06,101
              Why?              

662
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:07,102
    - Well, that don't make     
       no kind of sense,        

663
00:28:07,137 --> 00:28:09,370
         but it sure is         
         entertaining.          

664
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:10,771
          It's just--           

665
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,339
  - This ain't my first time.   

666
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:14,407
   - Yes, yes, at the where?    

667
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,275
     - At the Snatch Game.      

668
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,244
           - (laughs)           

669
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:25,548
    All right. Jujubee, are     
  you ready for your question?  

670
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,815
           - Mm-hmm.            

671
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,518
   - My play cousin Tornesia    
    is such a party animal.     

672
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:35,555
   When mosquitoes bite her,    
   they have to go to blank.    

673
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,924
         Okay, Jujubee.         
         - The clinic.          

674
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:41,393
      - Yes! Good answer.       

675
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,394
            - Right.            

676
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,562
    - Let's go to Mae West.     

677
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,631
 - Well, I'm very happy to say  
 they have to go to the clinic. 

678
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:49,599
     - Oh, we got a match.      

679
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:52,134
 - You know, I go to the one on 
 San Vicente and Santa Monica,  

680
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:53,468
     you know what I mean,      
            Jujubee?            

681
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:55,603
       You've been there.       
 I seen you there a few times.  

682
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:57,004
     - Why do you go there,     
           Mae West?            

683
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,673
- 'Cause after your tenth visit,
     you get one free, oh.      

684
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:03,142
           - (laughs)           

685
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:05,277
      Fabulous. All right.      

686
00:29:05,312 --> 00:29:06,678
  Let's move on down to Bjork.  

687
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:09,347
      - I'm pretty excited      
   'cause I also said clinic.   

688
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:11,015
       - You said clinic!       
            - Yeah.             

689
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,750
    How many bones do I win?    

690
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:15,919
        - How many bones        
        do you want? Oh.        

691
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,856
    See you after the show,     
          bubbles, oh.          

692
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,657
              Ooh.              

693
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:22,958
  - Did you hear that, Bjork?   

694
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:24,025
    - I'm down for anything,    

695
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,793
      especially I'd like       
        to eat her hair.        

696
00:29:25,828 --> 00:29:28,662
    It looks like pastrami.     

697
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:30,096
        - Something else        
   looks like pastrami, too.    

698
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:32,798
          - (trilling)          

699
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:38,335
     - Ow. (gargles) Brrr.      

700
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,370
           - (laughs)           

701
00:29:40,405 --> 00:29:43,773
       Let's move on down       
        to Nancy Grace.         

702
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,275
        - This just in.         
             - Oh.              

703
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:49,745
    - She had to go to Casey    
  Anthony's defense attorney.   

704
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,547
  She partied so hard, RuPaul,  

705
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,849
         two days after         
     the child is missing,      

706
00:29:54,884 --> 00:29:56,784
  she is drinking at the bar.   

707
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,685
        - Unfortunately,        
      that is not a match.      

708
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,119
  - But we do have DNA match,   

709
00:30:00,154 --> 00:30:01,954
   and that's coming up next    
  after the commercial break.   

710
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:03,388
           Thank you.           
          - Oh, okay.           

711
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:09,493
 Now, Raven, the next question  
is a video from Bianca Del Rio. 

712
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:11,728
  - Tammy Brown is so unusual,  

713
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:15,798
     when she was abducted      
  by aliens, she blanked them.  

714
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:18,667
      - All right, stars.       
    Write down your answers.    

715
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:21,169
       All right, Raven.        

716
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:23,237
    - She shaka-buku'd them.    

717
00:30:23,272 --> 00:30:27,373
           - (laughs)           

718
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,709
     Let's go on over here      
   to the Long Island medium.   

719
00:30:30,744 --> 00:30:31,776
        Are you writing         
        something down?         

720
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:33,144
           - No, no.            
             - Oh.              

721
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,311
       Well, yeah, 'cause       
   you're supposed to match--   

722
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:36,846
   - The spirits are telling    
        shaka-buku them.        

723
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,814
          - I thought           
       I saw you writing.       

724
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:40,448
  - You didn't seen anything,   
       Ru, I'm so sorry.        

725
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:42,583
      - I didn't anything.      
    - See, it's the spirits.    

726
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:47,520
     - (laughs) All right.      
         Ariana Grande.         

727
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,421
   - I put she sang to them?    

728
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:51,456
   - Nice try, but no match.    
         Sorry, Raven.          

729
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:53,257
      - Well, that's what       
        I would've done.        

730
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,291
          - Let's hear          
       you sing to them.        

731
00:30:54,326 --> 00:30:57,193
          - (no sound)          

732
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:58,260
             - Oh.              

733
00:30:58,295 --> 00:30:59,894
     - The last time I went     
           that high,           

734
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,595
      one of my dogs died.      

735
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,829
       - What did you do        
          to the body?          

736
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:04,630
     - Yes, what did you do     
         with the body?         

737
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:07,232
           - (snorts)           
        I'm sorry. What?        

738
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,766
       - What did you do        
         with the body?         

739
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:10,667
       - Where's the body       
          of your dog?          

740
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,069
      - Tatianna's missing      
       the mark hardcore.       

741
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,403
        There's no jokes        
    coming out of her mouth,    

742
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:17,038
     and whatever our jokes     
   are not landing anywhere.    

743
00:31:17,073 --> 00:31:18,806
      - Thank you so much.      

744
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:21,308
      - Let's move on down      
           to Alaska.           

745
00:31:21,343 --> 00:31:23,243
       - She said, hi-ee.       

746
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:25,712
   - She said, hi-ee to them.   

747
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:27,947
  - Ru is throwing watermelons  
         down the line,         

748
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:30,816
           and, whoo,           
       swing and a miss.        

749
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:32,818
    It's like Little League     
           softball,            

750
00:31:32,853 --> 00:31:36,921
          and she has           
        no arms or legs.        

751
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:38,188
           It's sad.            

752
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:41,691
   - You still have one more    
     chance with Mae West.      

753
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:43,459
    - Well, Ru, I gotta say,    

754
00:31:43,494 --> 00:31:46,128
        she probed them         
     with her tootsie-loo.      

755
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:48,063
           - (laughs)           

756
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:49,097
     Why dontcha come on up     

757
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:51,132
          and fuck me           
      in the ass sometime?      

758
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,734
           - (laughs)           

759
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,769
     You don't beat around      
    the bush, do you, baby?     

760
00:31:55,804 --> 00:31:57,570
    - I beat around the bush    
         all the time.          

761
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:59,905
  What are you talking about?   

762
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,806
           - (laughs)           

763
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:04,208
  Okay, kids, our time is up.   

764
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:07,611
           The winner           
      of Snatch Game is...      

765
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:11,681
        - Whoo! Hallelu,        
       I'm back, Ru! Yes!       

766
00:32:11,716 --> 00:32:13,949
         - She-Angela!          
           - Hallelu.           

767
00:32:13,984 --> 00:32:17,419
   - Well, I guess there you    
 have it, ladies and gentlemen. 

768
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:18,853
      Thanks for watching,      
           everybody.           

769
00:32:18,888 --> 00:32:21,455
       See you next time        
        on Snatch Game.         

770
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,891
  - See you tomorrow, friends.  
             - Bye.             

771
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:27,192
         - Coming up...         

772
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:29,460
  - This competition is going   
   to be even more difficult    

773
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:30,727
  because everybody's a judge.  

774
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:32,762
- What do you guys think about, 
      like, the strategy?       

775
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:34,630
  Are you guys still going to   
   go with the weakest link?    

776
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:37,599
  - If I win, I'm eliminating   
   the strongest competitor.    

777
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:42,503
        (RuPaul laughs)         

778
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,239
        (RuPaul laughs)         

779
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:49,841
           - (sighs)            

780
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:52,810
     -  It's a runway day,     
      it's a runway day        

781
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,478
   Today is elimination day,    

782
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:56,246
      so, girl, you better      
    bring it to the runway.     

783
00:32:56,281 --> 00:33:00,549
      And it's going to be      
     a latex extravaganza.      

784
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:01,716
        - Will you shut         
        all the way up?         

785
00:33:01,751 --> 00:33:02,883
     - What are you doing?      

786
00:33:02,918 --> 00:33:05,085
            - Girl,             
     she is Joan Crawford.      

787
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,287
          Do you sleep          
      in a bucket of ice?       

788
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:08,554
      - You better get it,      
        Hannibal Lector.        

789
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:09,721
        You look great.         

790
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,589
      Are you wearing that      
     down the runway, mama?     

791
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,458
           - (laughs)           

792
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,159
      - I can't with you.       

793
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:18,693
      - You didn't ever do      
      a beauty mask, girl?      

794
00:33:18,728 --> 00:33:19,960
        - Obviously not.        

795
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:22,195
          (all laugh)           

796
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,764
    - What do you guys think    
   about, like, the strategy    

797
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,265
     and, like, how you're      
     gonna vote people off?     

798
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,734
  Are you guys still going to   
 go with the weakest link and-- 

799
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:30,969
  - If I win, I'm eliminating   
   the strongest competitor.    

800
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:32,570
           - Are you?           
    - Are you being serious?    

801
00:33:32,605 --> 00:33:33,804
             - No.              
             - Oh.              

802
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,272
          (all laugh)           

803
00:33:35,307 --> 00:33:37,941
     - Now, is it whoever's     
    weakest in the challenge    

804
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,876
    or challenge plus runway    

805
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,177
          or challenge          
  divided by runway time two?   

806
00:33:41,212 --> 00:33:43,913
   - That's a great question.   

807
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:45,814
     - Whoever accumulates      
        the most points.        

808
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:47,682
          - All right.          
           - Is safe.           

809
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:49,717
      It's an accumulative      
            contest.            

810
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:50,751
   - But that's a really good   
           question.            

811
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:53,019
          What factor           
     does the runway play?      

812
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:55,187
   - If it's a tie, you gotta   
    work it with the runway.    

813
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:57,322
            - Yeah.             
      - Okay, that's fair.      

814
00:33:57,357 --> 00:33:59,490
  - This competition is going   
   to be even more difficult    

815
00:33:59,525 --> 00:34:01,959
      because everybody's       
          a judge now.          

816
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:04,394
     I would like to think      
   that I would be Khaleesi,    

817
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:07,563
     but I could go over to     
    the Lannister side, too.    

818
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:09,531
              Ugh.              

819
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:10,832
        - The only point        
    in me coming on the show    

820
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:12,200
           is to show           
      that I'm a monster.       

821
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:13,868
           - (laughs)           

822
00:34:13,903 --> 00:34:14,935
   - I'll tell you one thing.   

823
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,136
    If I win the challenge,     

824
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:17,971
      I'm taking all three      
      of those lipsticks.       

825
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:18,972
      Triple elimination.       

826
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:20,506
       (snap, snap, snap)       

827
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:24,676
- how did it feel being in front
  of Raven and Juju yesterday?  

828
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,444
     - Right. That's crazy.     

829
00:34:26,479 --> 00:34:29,980
    - Half of it was, like,     
    yay, hello, old friends.    

830
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:31,881
    And then, the other half    
           was like,            

831
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:33,649
      oh, this is kind of       
        nerve-wracking.         

832
00:34:33,684 --> 00:34:35,350
  It's a little bit of dj vu  

833
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:38,586
     because Juju and Raven     
    are also Season 2 girls.    

834
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:39,887
  - Were you friends with them  
          on Season 2?          

835
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:41,855
 - Oh, yeah. I was really close 
         with Jujubee,          

836
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,324
        and me and Raven        
  had a splendid relationship.  

837
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,758
          (all laugh)           

838
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,392
    - You know what I think     
        is cool for you         

839
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:50,560
     is that, like, there's     
  potentially the opportunity   

840
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:53,563
        for you to gain         
      a whole new fan base      

841
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:56,465
        because the fans        
   are so fucking young now.    

842
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,699
            - Yeah.             
      - And a lot of them,      

843
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:58,933
      they've just started      
       watching the show        

844
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:00,401
   at, like, Season 5, 6, 7.    

845
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:01,402
     You know what I mean?      
           So, like--           

846
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:03,670
           - 4, 5, 6.           

847
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:04,637
     - It's like a rebirth.     
     You know what I mean?      

848
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:06,038
            - Yeah.             

849
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:08,573
   And that's why I'm kind of   
    taking this competition     

850
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:11,976
so seriously is 'cause I really 
   want to reintroduce myself   

851
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:13,744
         to the world.          

852
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:17,013
   The stakes for me in this    
     elimination are high.      

853
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,015
       I need to be here.       
  I need to be given a chance   

854
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:23,253
   to show everyone I'm total   
      "All Star" material.      

855
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:29,058
  - This was not intentional.   

856
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,759
      - Didn't you hear me      
       talking about it?        

857
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:33,595
     - No, I didn't hear you    
        talking about it.       

858
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,096
   I'll show you my notebook.   

859
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:36,897
     I drew pictures of it      
       last night, honey.       

860
00:35:36,932 --> 00:35:38,565
             - Oh.              

861
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,467
 - Do you guys think it's worth 
      winning the lip sync      

862
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:43,235
        and the 10 grand        
  to send someone home, Katya?  

863
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,536
       - Yes, definitely.       
       - I have to do it.       

864
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:45,904
     - Thank you. Me, too.      
         - Definitely.          

865
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:47,038
           - Me, too.           
    - I have to do it and--     

866
00:35:47,073 --> 00:35:48,172
     - It's a competition.      

867
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:49,139
     - Thank you. Me, too.      
          - That's it.          

868
00:35:49,174 --> 00:35:50,607
     - Give me a high five.     

869
00:35:50,642 --> 00:35:52,742
 - But you know what, you guys  
 are, like, high fiving stuff,  

870
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:54,143
         but everybody          
   feels different about it.    

871
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:55,811
         Like, for me--         
        - No, it's not.         

872
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:56,945
     - But we're here to--      
  - Hold on, hold on, hold on.  

873
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,146
         Can I finish?          
         I'm so sorry.          

874
00:35:58,181 --> 00:36:00,248
   We're gonna get this money   
          afterwards.           

875
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,283
         Let's be real.         
   For me, I just couldn't--    

876
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:05,886
  It's hard 'cause I wouldn't   
       want to be, like,        

877
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:07,187
       well, sorry, girl.       
     You know what I mean?      

878
00:36:07,222 --> 00:36:08,755
     - Well, it's not about     
     the cash tip, though.      

879
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,456
       It's about the end       
      of the finish line.       

880
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:11,790
          - Thank you.          

881
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,057
    - And I guess that's why    
      we're all different.      

882
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:14,224
- We all have different feelings
    about different things,     

883
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,892
          and I guess           
      that's how that is.       

884
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:17,159
         I don't know.          

885
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:18,393
I feel like my words are getting
    twisted, but never mind.    

886
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:19,660
   - Just take a deep breath    

887
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:22,963
     and go, it's gonna be      
     a lovely runway, gal.      

888
00:36:22,998 --> 00:36:24,197
           - (laughs)           

889
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,232
             - Oh!              

890
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:29,567
        (RuPaul laughs)         

891
00:36:29,602 --> 00:36:33,437
  -  Cover girl, put the bass  
         in your walk          

892
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:40,743
    Cover girl, put the bass   
         in your walk          

893
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:44,413
          Head to toe,         
   let your whole body talk    

894
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:46,014
          Cover girl          

895
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:48,282
            - Whoo!             
         - Girl, what?          

896
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:50,117
           (applause)           

897
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:51,384
  - Welcome to the main stage   

898
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:54,320
          of "RuPaul's          
     Drag Race All Stars."      

899
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:57,823
        Michelle Visage,        
     what's new, pussycat?      

900
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:01,692
       - You, my darling,       
   are the supreme All Star.    

901
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,927
       - Style superstar        
        Carson Kressley,        

902
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:06,296
     are you feeling judgy,     
            darling?            

903
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:08,765
     - I'm feeling joodgy.      
         Is that okay?          

904
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,766
          - I love it.          

905
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:11,801
         The incredible         
         Todrick Hall.          

906
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:13,302
    Are you ready for more?     

907
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:16,171
     - Ru, I was born ready     
        and the rest...         

908
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:18,973
           - Is draw.           

909
00:37:19,008 --> 00:37:20,841
         And he's back.         

910
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:23,476
         Ross Matthews,         
         how you doing?         

911
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:24,477
          - Oh, honey,          
       you know I'm back.       

912
00:37:24,512 --> 00:37:26,445
         I am a sucker          
        for the Snatch.         

913
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,213
           - (laughs)           

914
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,415
           This week,           
    we challenged our queens    

915
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,017
           to give us           
      imitations of life,       

916
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:36,620
          and tonight,          
       in latex eleganza,       

917
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:40,290
  they're ready to burn rubber  
         on the runway.         

918
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,892
           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines,       

919
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,361
  and may the best woman win.   

920
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:52,366
   First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.    

921
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:55,936
  Oh. She's got all her ducks   
           in a row.            

922
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,405
   - I'd hate to see the bill   
           for that.            

923
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,973
           - (laughs)           

924
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,474
         - This costume         
         is totally me:         

925
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,742
         fun and, like,         
        almost pinup-y.         

926
00:38:03,777 --> 00:38:05,543
    And I wanted the jewelry    
      to speak for itself.      

927
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:09,013
  I feel super skinny and then  
 the booty is, like, on point.  

928
00:38:09,048 --> 00:38:10,914
      I feel so adorable.       

929
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:12,582
   - I wonder if you put her    
  in a bathtub, she'll float.   

930
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:14,850
      - Well, if it quacks      
         like a duck...         

931
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,018
            - Yeah.             
         - Quack quack.         

932
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:18,986
       - Roxxxy Andrews.        

933
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:20,687
       Look at that body!       

934
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,022
         - Look at that         
        hourglass shape.        

935
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:25,124
     - It's inner tubular.      

936
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:28,560
     - I am fixing to sell      
     this garment, darling.     

937
00:38:28,595 --> 00:38:30,862
            I've got            
    my big nineties hair on.    

938
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:33,798
          I'm feeling           
       total gothic glam.       

939
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,399
          I'm feeling           
      very Violet Chachki,      

940
00:38:35,434 --> 00:38:37,667
    but the plus-sized thick    
   and juicy Violet Chachki.    

941
00:38:37,702 --> 00:38:40,136
       - Well, if a tire        
      goes out on my car,       

942
00:38:40,171 --> 00:38:41,971
     I'll know who to call.     

943
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:44,340
         - She's ribbed         
       for your pleasure.       

944
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:46,075
         - Yes, she is.         

945
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,010
       - Alyssa Edwards.        

946
00:38:48,045 --> 00:38:49,411
              Ooh.              

947
00:38:49,446 --> 00:38:51,212
     - Her lips don't lie.      
             - No.              

948
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,747
   - That dress is a roadmap    
          for her man.          

949
00:38:53,782 --> 00:38:55,682
   - Oh, I can read her lips    
           from here.           

950
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:57,283
        - Yeah. (laughs)        

951
00:38:57,318 --> 00:38:59,018
   Pow, right in the kisser.    

952
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:00,219
         - I am living.         

953
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,255
   I'm colorful, I'm vibrant,   
           ferocious.           

954
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,023
       I got my dress on        
         with the lips          

955
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:06,724
        'cause you know         
    I got plenty of secrets.    

956
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:07,825
    I got to hold back some     

957
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,060
      I keep in the vault       
         just in case.          

958
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:11,795
      - I want to kiss her      
           all over.            

959
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,363
    - Or just kiss her ass.     

960
00:39:13,398 --> 00:39:15,832
          (all laugh)           

961
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:18,134
       - Up next, Katya.        

962
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:19,668
    She's into water sports.    

963
00:39:19,703 --> 00:39:23,038
  - Oh, it's Esther Williams'   
    cousin, Fister Williams.    

964
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:24,806
        (RuPaul laughs)         

965
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:27,008
      - Wow. Look at those      
        breast strokes.         

966
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:29,343
          - Our cycles          
       are synchronized.        

967
00:39:29,378 --> 00:39:32,145
 - I'm giving you a skin tight  
         sea foam green         

968
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,213
        Esther Williams         
      underwater fantasy.       

969
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,815
      My waist is cinched,      
      my nose is pinched,       

970
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,818
          and my body           
is absolutely drenched in sweat.

971
00:39:40,853 --> 00:39:42,486
  - Her look is making me wet.  

972
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:46,256
          - Take a dip          
  in the cool waters of Katya.  

973
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,890
          (all laugh)           

974
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:49,057
           Tatianna.            

975
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:51,592
    - She's a tramp, a scamp    
       and a bit of a...        

976
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:53,160
            - Vamp.             
           - Uh-huh.            

977
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,061
     - That girl is poison.     

978
00:39:55,096 --> 00:39:58,397
        - My latex look         
       is real dark lady,       

979
00:39:58,432 --> 00:39:59,998
        and I'm feeling         
         a little sexy.         

980
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,866
        Also, it totally        
       shows off the fact       

981
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:04,935
that I haven't eaten in a week, 
      so I'm feeling cute.      

982
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,303
          - She's like          
       Johnny Gill said,        

983
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,238
       you better rub her       
         the right way.         

984
00:40:08,273 --> 00:40:09,472
          (all laugh)           

985
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,640
  - That's her chastity dress.  

986
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,442
       - Alaska, fashion.       
             - Yes.             

987
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:16,410
   - Just gotta do something    
      about that uni-brow.      

988
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:17,644
         - She's gotta          
       get that plucked.        

989
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,146
       - This is totally        
         Blade Rubber.          

990
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:22,448
          (all laugh)           
             - Yes.             

991
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:26,551
   - I'm wearing head to toe    
          rubber latex          

992
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:29,453
  geometrical severe fantasy.   

993
00:40:29,488 --> 00:40:31,655
   I'm nine parts super model   

994
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,725
       and one part robot       
    and ready for insertion.    

995
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,595
   - Why are her gloves so--    
       oh, oh, I get it.        

996
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,463
          (all laugh)           

997
00:40:41,498 --> 00:40:42,464
           - Bye-ee.            

998
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:44,666
  Designed for your pleather.   

999
00:40:44,701 --> 00:40:46,000
          Ginger Minj.          

1000
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:47,267
     - She's gone platinum.     

1001
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:50,270
    - I like the mermaid cut    
        or is it uncut?         

1002
00:40:50,305 --> 00:40:51,704
          (all laugh)           

1003
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:55,407
       - I'm just walking       
so eleg-wently down the runway. 

1004
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:59,510
      This gown hugs every      
    single curve in my body.    

1005
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:04,447
I have never felt more beautiful
       in my entire life.       

1006
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:05,781
         - Yeah, girl.          

1007
00:41:05,816 --> 00:41:07,749
     - Yes, you better rub      
       that lamp, honey.        

1008
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:09,584
         - Something's          
        gonna come out.         

1009
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,218
          (all laugh)           

1010
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:12,252
            - Detox.            

1011
00:41:12,287 --> 00:41:14,520
       (gasp) Yes, mama!        

1012
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,321
      - Raccoon eleganza.       

1013
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:18,956
  - Now, that is a thigh gap,   
            Beyonce.            

1014
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:20,791
          (all laugh)           

1015
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:22,759
        - My whole vibe         
         for this look          

1016
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:27,095
    is, like, this Amazonian    
        warrior goddess,        

1017
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,296
   and I feel really fierce.    

1018
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:30,498
       My tuck is right.        
         I'm brilliant.         

1019
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:33,100
         I'm beautiful.         
          Because why?          

1020
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:34,534
           I'm Detox.           

1021
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:37,403
   - Now, that's what I call    
        an apple bottom.        

1022
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:38,404
        - Red delicious.        

1023
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,639
  -  Sexy, sexy drag queen    

1024
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:41,673
         - Coming up...         

1025
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,475
        - Unbelievable,         
       like breathtaking.       

1026
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,710
  - I loved this runway look.   

1027
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:49,713
     - Um, it was a little      
          Nancy Gross.          

1028
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,748
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1029
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,684
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1030
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,485
       - Welcome, ladies.       

1031
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,355
      I want to remind you      
      why we are all here.      

1032
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,523
  I invited you to "All Stars"  

1033
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:06,859
   because I believe you are    
     the best of the best.      

1034
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:11,229
      With this invitation      
  comes great responsibility,   

1035
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:13,497
        and I've fought         
         my entire life         

1036
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:15,799
  to not only grow my career,   

1037
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:19,169
  but to build something that   
   could help launch others.    

1038
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,137
  Every week that you're here   

1039
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:25,508
     is another opportunity     
to build your brand and legacy. 

1040
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,378
        But there are no        
      free passes, ladies.      

1041
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,980
  This is still a competition.  

1042
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:34,916
            And now,            
    I need to hear from you.    

1043
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:37,585
     Ladies, are you in it      
           to win it?           

1044
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,986
             - Yes!             
             - Yes!             

1045
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:41,455
      - Good. That's what       
       I wanted to hear.        

1046
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:45,825
  Now, when I call your name,   
      please step forward.      

1047
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,996
  Alyssa Edwards, Ginger Minj.  

1048
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:53,498
         You are safe.          

1049
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,601
          Please step           
   to the back of the stage.    

1050
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,372
   The rest of you represent    

1051
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:07,408
    the tops and the bottoms    
          of the week.          

1052
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:09,376
         Now it's time          
   for the judges' critiques.   

1053
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:12,212
   First up, Phi Phi O'Hara.    

1054
00:43:12,247 --> 00:43:14,247
           - Tonight,           
    on an "All Star" stage,     

1055
00:43:14,282 --> 00:43:18,484
 coming out in a latex swimsuit 
   didn't make me very happy.   

1056
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:19,718
            - Okay.             

1057
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:21,586
 - Your makeup is a little off  
         tonight, too.          

1058
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:23,287
       Your contouring's        
       so severe for you.       

1059
00:43:23,322 --> 00:43:24,421
  - I was there for your Gaga,  

1060
00:43:24,456 --> 00:43:27,690
    so I was looking at your    
    Snatch real close, okay?    

1061
00:43:27,725 --> 00:43:29,124
            My face             
     was right up in there.     

1062
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:31,126
         Teresa Caputo          
 is the perfect kind of person  

1063
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:35,330
  to pick for the Snatch Game,  
and you did a great job with it.

1064
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,131
         So consistent          
      all the way through.      

1065
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,165
             - Yay.             

1066
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,966
          - All right.          
    Up next, Roxxxy Andrews.    

1067
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,801
             - Hey.             
   - This whole runway look,    

1068
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,537
   like, when I first saw you   
   come out, I was like, eh.    

1069
00:43:44,572 --> 00:43:46,038
         I don't know.          

1070
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:47,305
 Like, it's maybe a little too, 
   like, dead on and literal    

1071
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,439
    when you think of latex.    

1072
00:43:48,474 --> 00:43:50,741
          But the way           
    you put it all together     

1073
00:43:50,776 --> 00:43:54,077
    made for a better outfit    
 than just what this dress is.  

1074
00:43:54,112 --> 00:43:55,878
        - It was a bumpy        
      Snatch Game for you.      

1075
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:59,781
 It's like, ooh, it just didn't 
 feel like a yay kind of thing. 

1076
00:43:59,816 --> 00:44:00,782
            - Yeah.             
   - The thing about Alaska,    

1077
00:44:00,817 --> 00:44:03,184
  she's funny, quick, snappy.   

1078
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:04,852
         There's a lot          
      of little surprises       

1079
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:06,053
    that you get with Alaska    

1080
00:44:06,088 --> 00:44:08,588
       that I didn't get        
     from that performance.     

1081
00:44:08,623 --> 00:44:12,357
  - In the work room, you said  
you were gonna do Sofia Vergara,

1082
00:44:12,392 --> 00:44:13,458
   but you changed your mind.   

1083
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:16,727
      - I changed because       
       something told me        

1084
00:44:16,762 --> 00:44:18,962
    I would've bombed Sofia,    

1085
00:44:18,997 --> 00:44:21,497
        like, worse than        
    I would've done Alaska.     

1086
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:23,232
      - When you come into      
       this competition,        

1087
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:25,133
  you already know that you're  
 going to be doing Snatch Game, 

1088
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:26,501
            so maybe            
     it would've been wise      

1089
00:44:26,536 --> 00:44:29,070
   to really think about that   
       before yesterday.        

1090
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:31,338
       - Up next, Katya.        

1091
00:44:31,373 --> 00:44:33,640
   - I love this runway look    
            so much.            

1092
00:44:33,675 --> 00:44:35,408
             I like             
    when people do something    

1093
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:36,976
          that's what           
     you're not expecting.      

1094
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:38,210
      And what you gave us      
           was, like,           

1095
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:40,946
  this Esther Williams moment   
       with the full cap.       

1096
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:42,380
      And you have, like,       
        the nose thing,         

1097
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:45,416
 which is a genius little touch 
   that I expect from Katya.    

1098
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:46,550
          So right on.          

1099
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:49,719
          Snatch Game.          
    I loved the Snatch Game.    

1100
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:50,953
     When I think of Bjork,     

1101
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,356
       I think of, like,        
  an Icelandic toddler on LSD,  

1102
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,890
     and you gave me that.      
    - You're just brilliant.    

1103
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:59,693
You're an artist and all of your
answers were just so psychotic, 

1104
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:01,194
   and I just love everything   
          that you do.          

1105
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:03,529
     - Whether people knew      
     who Bjork was or not,      

1106
00:45:03,564 --> 00:45:06,265
       we all understood        
  exactly what you were doing,  

1107
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,900
     and that's what makes      
a really good characterization. 

1108
00:45:08,935 --> 00:45:10,534
        It was fabulous.        

1109
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:12,002
      - Thank you so much.      

1110
00:45:12,037 --> 00:45:15,372
          (all laugh)           
      - Up next, Tatianna.      

1111
00:45:15,407 --> 00:45:17,474
    - Tonight on the runway,    
      it's kind of basic.       

1112
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,843
 It's something you'd see in a  
Fredrick's catalog or something.

1113
00:45:19,878 --> 00:45:21,144
            - Okay.             

1114
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:23,012
   - To me, it doesn't scream   
      Tatianna in any way.      

1115
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:25,714
  Your look for Ariana Grande,  
            spot on.            

1116
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:28,450
    So the characterization     
       was there for me.        

1117
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:31,219
   I think where you lost it    
      were the comebacks.       

1118
00:45:31,254 --> 00:45:34,922
   - There were moments where   
  Ru would totally set you up   

1119
00:45:34,957 --> 00:45:37,324
   and you just had to, like,   
  spike it back over the net,   

1120
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,758
     and that didn't happen     
            for me.             

1121
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:40,893
  I can't believe I just used   
      a sports reference.       

1122
00:45:40,928 --> 00:45:43,595
     That's never happened.     

1123
00:45:45,498 --> 00:45:47,498
          - I'm sorry.          
           (sniffles)           

1124
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,135
       This means so much       
      and I fucked it up.       

1125
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:58,806
       - Don't be sorry.        

1126
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:02,409
       Be fierce because        
     you are an "All Star."     

1127
00:46:04,912 --> 00:46:07,746
      Thank you, Tatianna.      
          - Thank you.          

1128
00:46:07,781 --> 00:46:10,248
       - Up next, Alaska.       

1129
00:46:10,283 --> 00:46:12,149
  - I loved this runway look,   

1130
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:14,784
          and I think           
   what's so great about you    

1131
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:16,051
   is that you're versatile.    

1132
00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:19,454
     I know. Big surprise.      
     But yes, the details.      

1133
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:21,856
     The dress, the makeup,     
   the dye line of the hair,    

1134
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:23,490
    it's chic and glamorous.    

1135
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:24,657
        The only callout        
          on the look,          

1136
00:46:24,692 --> 00:46:27,059
       I would've loved,        
      like, a cooler shoe.      

1137
00:46:27,094 --> 00:46:30,062
           - Me, too.           
    - Right? I know, I know.    

1138
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:31,663
       - The Snatch Game.       

1139
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:35,766
     It was brilliant from      
   the beginning to the end.    

1140
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:39,102
   It was just an amalgamation  
        of sheer genius.        

1141
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:40,103
      - You did something       
         really smart.          

1142
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:41,637
  You not only entertained us,  

1143
00:46:41,672 --> 00:46:44,139
        but you educated        
    our audience out there,     

1144
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:46,374
        who may not know        
        who Mae West is.        

1145
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:49,744
    - Mae West now, for me,     
     is you doing Mae West.     

1146
00:46:49,779 --> 00:46:51,445
    Every time I go through     
       a drive thru now,        

1147
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,814
         I'm gonna go,          
  oh, I want a number one-uh.   

1148
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:55,649
           - Drive up           
     and see me some time.      

1149
00:46:55,684 --> 00:46:57,684
   - Super size me some time.   

1150
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:00,753
       - Up next, Detox.        

1151
00:47:00,788 --> 00:47:02,855
       - Let's talk about       
      this look right now,      

1152
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,323
     which I'm living for.      

1153
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:06,992
   It's like the epitome of,    
      like, latex glamour.      

1154
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,927
        - Unbelievable.         

1155
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:10,862
       Like, breathtaking       
      when you walked out.      

1156
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:12,396
        It was just like        
        an oil painting.        

1157
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:14,598
        Like a perverted        
         oil painting.          

1158
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:16,766
  - You just look phenomenal.   

1159
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,033
         You killed it.         
     - Thank you very much.     

1160
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,934
   - And I just want to know,   
     where did you put it?      

1161
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:21,568
  - Oh, you know where it is.   

1162
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:25,237
          (all laugh)           

1163
00:47:25,272 --> 00:47:27,072
       - The Nancy Grace.       

1164
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:28,306
     At first, I was like,      
          oh, my God,           

1165
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:30,141
          Nancy Grace           
    was from Staten Island?     

1166
00:47:30,176 --> 00:47:31,942
  You're, like, listen to me.   

1167
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,144
   - In the beginning, it was   
a little Nancy Gross, you know. 

1168
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:36,980
  It wasn't really there yet,   
    but you found your way.     

1169
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:39,983
- It wasn't the right voice, but
it was kind of the right person,

1170
00:47:40,018 --> 00:47:42,052
     so I'm gonna give you      
          a C on that.          

1171
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:45,687
      - Thank you, ladies.      
  I think we've heard enough.   

1172
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:47,888
   I've made some decisions.    

1173
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:54,492
         Katya, Alaska,         

1174
00:47:54,527 --> 00:47:58,595
      you are the top two       
    "All Stars" of the week.    

1175
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,330
           (applause)           
        Congratulations.        

1176
00:48:00,365 --> 00:48:03,499
        You've each won         
        two VIP tickets         

1177
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:07,835
     to Cirque du Soliel's      
 sexy adult cabaret "Zumanity," 

1178
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,506
  including airfare and deluxe  
   Las Vegas accommodations.    

1179
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:15,741
          - Wow, cool.          

1180
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,412
       - Phi Phi O'Hara,        
  you lucky duck, you're safe.  

1181
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:29,018
   That means Roxxxy Andrews,   
        Tatianna, Detox,        

1182
00:48:29,053 --> 00:48:31,153
  you are in the bottom three.  

1183
00:48:32,989 --> 00:48:37,224
       Katya and Alaska,        
  each of you needs to decide   

1184
00:48:37,259 --> 00:48:41,361
   which of the bottom three    
        you'll eliminate        

1185
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:44,530
    if you win the lip sync.    

1186
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:48,500
      So while you queens       
  deliberate in the work room,  

1187
00:48:48,535 --> 00:48:52,937
        the judges and I        
  will enjoy root beer floats.  

1188
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,973
    You may leave the stage.    

1189
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,441
          Coming up...          

1190
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:02,911
  - I know that we're looking   
 at this Rolaskatox situation,  

1191
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:05,113
          but that was          
        a long time ago.        

1192
00:49:05,148 --> 00:49:06,647
       - She can say that       
       all she wants to,        

1193
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:08,582
        but in the end,         

1194
00:49:08,617 --> 00:49:10,717
  she's not going to send home  
     her best friend here.      

1195
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,886
    - Now win this lip sync.    
            - Okay.             

1196
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:15,988
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1197
00:49:17,423 --> 00:49:19,757
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1198
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:25,695
     - It's an odd feeling      
       being in the top,        

1199
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,998
      and then coming into      
the work room for deliberation. 

1200
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,199
          - Thrilled.           

1201
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:31,867
           - Because            
     I'm one of the people      

1202
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,802
   who has to make a decision   

1203
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,503
    about some other people     
          in the room.          

1204
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:40,007
  - Tatianna, Roxxxy and Detox  
       are in the bottom.       

1205
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:42,509
 I don't necessarily agree that 
 Detox should be in the bottom. 

1206
00:49:42,544 --> 00:49:46,712
     Her runway destroyed.      

1207
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:48,780
     "National Geographic"      
     meets "Italian Vogue"      

1208
00:49:48,815 --> 00:49:50,815
             meets              
  "Better Homes and Gardens."   

1209
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,049
           Flawless.            

1210
00:49:52,084 --> 00:49:54,117
         - One of y'all         
    is about to get $10,000.    

1211
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:55,184
            - Yeah.             

1212
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:56,251
  - When you win a challenge,   

1213
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:59,053
         it's just so,          
        like, exciting.         

1214
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:02,623
     And now it's sort of,      
       like, much heavier       

1215
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:06,093
   because there's this huge    
 responsibility attached to it. 

1216
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:08,762
 I would like to have a moment  
        with each of you        

1217
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,697
       on the other sofa.       

1218
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:13,399
           So whoever           
      wants to come first.      

1219
00:50:13,434 --> 00:50:14,533
   - Well, I'm here, I guess.   

1220
00:50:16,736 --> 00:50:18,803
             - Hi.              
          - Hi, honey.          

1221
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:22,039
       I wasn't expecting       
   to see you in the bottom.    

1222
00:50:22,074 --> 00:50:23,707
        - Neither was I,        
     but at the same time,      

1223
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:27,343
       I feel good enough       
    that I wasn't the worst     

1224
00:50:27,378 --> 00:50:29,478
  and I looked the best today.  
            (laughs)            

1225
00:50:29,513 --> 00:50:31,079
           - Hallelu.           

1226
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:32,246
   - Do you know what I mean?   

1227
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:34,047
        - And it's crazy        
       because it's like        

1228
00:50:34,082 --> 00:50:36,549
          this, like,           
    Rolaskatox-esque moment.    

1229
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:38,784
        - I know. I was         
   just about to say. Mm-hmm.   

1230
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:40,786
    - But whatever decision     
            is made,            

1231
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,121
          that is not           
    going to be favoritism.     

1232
00:50:43,156 --> 00:50:45,323
     - Right, and I respect     
    whatever decision it is     

1233
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:46,624
     that you come up with.     

1234
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:49,727
   - Well, it's such a shame    
      I fucking hate you.       

1235
00:50:49,762 --> 00:50:50,861
        - Should I start        
        packing now or--        

1236
00:50:50,896 --> 00:50:52,696
           - (laughs)           
      You probably should.      

1237
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:54,397
      - Shall I send over       
        the next clown?         

1238
00:50:54,432 --> 00:50:55,498
         - Yeah, sure.          

1239
00:50:57,668 --> 00:50:59,401
         - Are you sure         
    you're gonna wear that?     

1240
00:50:59,436 --> 00:51:00,568
        - I'm gonna see         
     if I can get changed,      

1241
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:01,835
      because this little       
          hobble dress          

1242
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,937
        is not gonna be         
      very enter-tainting.      

1243
00:51:03,972 --> 00:51:05,004
      - Do you need help?       

1244
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:06,439
   - Yes. Would you, please?    

1245
00:51:07,674 --> 00:51:09,540
      - How are you doing?      

1246
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:12,175
      - Um, I expected it.      

1247
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,576
           - You did?           

1248
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:15,110
   - I definitely know I was    
 one of the weaker links, so... 

1249
00:51:15,145 --> 00:51:18,012
  - Whatever decision is made,  
        it's not coming         

1250
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:21,315
     because of favoritism      
     or anything like that.     

1251
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,582
           - Just do            
    what you feel is right.     

1252
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:24,717
      But congratulations.      

1253
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,118
          - Thank you.          

1254
00:51:26,153 --> 00:51:27,486
    - Now win this lip sync.    

1255
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:29,421
            Win it.             

1256
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:31,322
            - Okay.             
           - Win it.            

1257
00:51:31,357 --> 00:51:33,257
     I'm hoping we're gonna     
   stay true to what we said,   

1258
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,558
      because I feel like       

1259
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:36,993
 the girl who got the harshest  
    critiques was Tatianna.     

1260
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:39,695
      So if we're sticking      
      through to our plan,      

1261
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,263
    I should be good to go.     

1262
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:45,299
       - Hi, how are you?       

1263
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:48,468
        - Um, not good.         

1264
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,970
          - I'm sorry           
   that you're in the bottom.   

1265
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:56,007
  I know that we're looking at  
this Rolaskatox-esque situation,

1266
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:58,209
          but that was          
        a long time ago,        

1267
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:00,411
     and I want you to know     
     that whatever happens,     

1268
00:52:00,446 --> 00:52:05,248
   it's not based on friends    
      and family discounts      

1269
00:52:05,283 --> 00:52:08,684
    or, you know, favoritism    
     or anything like that.     

1270
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:10,385
            - Yeah.             

1271
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,019
        She can say that        
       all she wants to,        

1272
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:14,187
        but in the end,         

1273
00:52:14,222 --> 00:52:17,156
  she's not going to send home  
     her best friend here.      

1274
00:52:17,191 --> 00:52:18,757
      - So I just want you      
         to know that.          

1275
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:20,492
       - I trust it'll be       
        a fair decision.        

1276
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:24,862
   - I think you're stunning    
        and really cool.        

1277
00:52:24,897 --> 00:52:26,430
            - Sorry.            

1278
00:52:26,465 --> 00:52:28,498
       Stupid. Go ahead.        

1279
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:31,734
   - Why do you feel stupid,    
            though?             

1280
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:36,237
   - 'Cause I just feel like    
      I didn't do my best.      

1281
00:52:36,272 --> 00:52:39,240
    In something like this,     
   you can't really fuck up.    

1282
00:52:39,275 --> 00:52:41,775
       Like, I need this.       
      I really want this.       

1283
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,744
   - Right. You've been here    
   and you've held your own.    

1284
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:48,114
  - I just wanted to show more  
  'cause there's so much more.  

1285
00:52:48,149 --> 00:52:50,416
        And I hope that         
     I get the opportunity,     

1286
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:53,018
   but if I don't, I get why.   

1287
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:55,654
      - I love you a lot.       
       - I love you, too.       

1288
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,156
      - I'm not gonna lie.      

1289
00:52:59,191 --> 00:53:00,390
       There's definitely       
          a part of me          

1290
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:03,326
        that's enjoying         
this potential power situation. 

1291
00:53:03,361 --> 00:53:04,827
          - Girl, no!           

1292
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,261
   - No, no, no, no, no, no.    

1293
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:08,630
     It's just because I'm      
   so used to being terrified   

1294
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:10,798
     and, like, in the grip     
     of total anxiety here.     

1295
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:12,166
     And now I feel like...     

1296
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:17,203
         I have to say          
     there is a part of me      

1297
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:20,272
     that is very intrigued     
         and attracted          

1298
00:53:20,307 --> 00:53:23,141
          and seduced           
       by this new power.       

1299
00:53:23,176 --> 00:53:24,909
            (laughs)            

1300
00:53:24,944 --> 00:53:26,744
         But I will do          
        the fair thing.         

1301
00:53:26,779 --> 00:53:28,378
   - I just want to tell you,   
           you know,            

1302
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,080
    I want to prove how much    
     I'm a different person     

1303
00:53:31,115 --> 00:53:32,147
   than I am from my season.    

1304
00:53:32,182 --> 00:53:33,381
           - Uh-huh.            

1305
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:35,549
   - And I feel like my time    
      is too short still.       

1306
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:37,083
   I know I am in the bottom,   

1307
00:53:37,118 --> 00:53:40,853
 and I felt like all I could do 
   was my runway today and--    

1308
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,821
      - It's not personal.      
   It's just we're all here.    

1309
00:53:42,856 --> 00:53:44,622
     We're all professional     
   drag queens with careers,    

1310
00:53:44,657 --> 00:53:46,190
      and we can evaluate       
      what's entertaining       

1311
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:47,324
  and what's not entertaining.  

1312
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,993
         - It's 50/50.          
     I could be going home.     

1313
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:51,594
 You never know how these girls 
    are gonna play the game,    

1314
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:53,262
       and I'm terrified.       

1315
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,431
            - Next!             

1316
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,068
   Tell me why you should be    
   America's next top model.    

1317
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,503
          - Oh, you...          
            (laughs)            

1318
00:54:02,538 --> 00:54:04,371
    - I know you're feeling     
           terrible.            

1319
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:06,439
     - Yeah. I feel like...     

1320
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:09,341
         almost because         
  I am from an earlier season   

1321
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:11,443
       and I was so young       
          that I do--           

1322
00:54:11,478 --> 00:54:12,744
      and I've been saying      
        this whole time,        

1323
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:14,545
       like, I don't have       
  to prove anything to anyone,  

1324
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,346
       but I kind of do.        

1325
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:18,314
       I thought I was on       
  a good roll here last week,   

1326
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:20,482
    and there's so much more    
          that I have           

1327
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:22,851
  that's, like, out of the box  
   and different for Tatianna   

1328
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:24,752
     that I want the world      
             to see             

1329
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:26,820
       and I kind of need       
       the world to see.        

1330
00:54:26,855 --> 00:54:30,523
        This competition        
      means so much to me.      

1331
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:31,924
    I don't want to go home.    

1332
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:34,927
   I'm not ready to go home.    

1333
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:37,329
   I can't go home right now.   

1334
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:38,396
    - I knew coming in here     

1335
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:40,197
    that, like, everybody's     
        gonna be so good        

1336
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:42,199
    that it's just like you     
   don't know what the hell.    

1337
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:44,768
 From week to week, it's going  
to be a complete roller coaster.

1338
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:47,337
   - I don't want to make it,   
      like, harder on you,      

1339
00:54:47,372 --> 00:54:49,806
    if you're feeling, like,    
  towards one way or another.   

1340
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:51,407
       Don't think that,        
      like, this is, like,      

1341
00:54:51,442 --> 00:54:52,508
      trying to wane you,       
        'cause it's not.        

1342
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:53,475
         - No, no, no.          
       'Cause I know you.       

1343
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:54,476
       - 'Cause it's not.       

1344
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:55,477
          I would like          
    to really not have that.    

1345
00:54:55,512 --> 00:54:57,078
      - Yeah, I know you.       

1346
00:54:57,113 --> 00:54:58,946
      Here, give me a hug.      

1347
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:00,981
          - Can we get          
      a Code 69 progress?       

1348
00:55:01,016 --> 00:55:02,615
          (all laugh)           

1349
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,784
        - Oh, silencio.         
           Silencio.            

1350
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:10,288
    Bring back my girls-uh.     

1351
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:19,896
   - If I win this lip sync,    

1352
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:22,097
      someone's going home      
         because of me.         

1353
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:29,536
     I've made up my mind,      
      but it's really hard      

1354
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:32,272
      having that decision      
          on my head.           

1355
00:55:34,642 --> 00:55:37,610
 - I have to make the decision  
    about who to send home.     

1356
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:40,613
       It's really tough,       
  but it's still a competition  

1357
00:55:40,648 --> 00:55:42,314
    and I have to make sure     

1358
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:46,318
   that every decision I make   
       is the right one.        

1359
00:55:49,255 --> 00:55:51,289
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1360
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:54,892
        (RuPaul laughs)         

1361
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,796
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

1362
00:56:00,831 --> 00:56:04,599
      Two top "All Stars"       
        stand before me.        

1363
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:10,604
  Ladies, this is your chance   
  to impress me, win $10,000,   

1364
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:12,872
       and earn the power       

1365
00:56:12,907 --> 00:56:17,376
         to give one of         
  the bottom queens the chop.   

1366
00:56:19,279 --> 00:56:22,247
       The time has come        
          to lip sync           

1367
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:27,251
           (echoing)            
        for your legacy.        

1368
00:56:27,286 --> 00:56:29,553
   - I'm excited to lip sync    
        against Alaska.         

1369
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:31,855
      I am feeling myself.      

1370
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,891
    I am preparing the world    
      to gag on my legacy,      

1371
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:37,927
         which involves         
   a line of platform jellies   

1372
00:56:37,962 --> 00:56:40,529
         in every size,         
        color and shape.        

1373
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,765
  - I know that I really need   
        to turn it out.         

1374
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,134
    There's no question that    
  I want to win the lip sync.   

1375
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:49,838
    It's another opportunity    
     to impress the judges.     

1376
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,773
          - Good luck.          

1377
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,641
       Don't fuck it up.        

1378
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,477
      -  Ah, freak out        

1379
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:58,078
     Le freak, c'est chic     

1380
00:56:58,113 --> 00:57:00,480
          Freak out           

1381
00:57:00,515 --> 00:57:05,117
       All that pressure       
         got you down          

1382
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:08,986
         Has your head         
     spinning all around       

1383
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:12,989
       Just come on down,      
            to 54              

1384
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:15,524
          Find a spot          
       out on the floor        

1385
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,792
        Ah, freak out         

1386
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:21,928
   - I am in the bottom with    
   two-thirds of Rolaskatox.    

1387
00:57:21,963 --> 00:57:25,164
          So if Alaska          
      wins this lip sync,       

1388
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:27,399
        the chances are         
      I'm being sent home.      

1389
00:57:27,434 --> 00:57:29,801
            - Whoo!             

1390
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:31,369
      -  I said, freak        

1391
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:32,870
        - I'm terrified.        

1392
00:57:32,905 --> 00:57:34,771
 You never know how these girls 
    are gonna play the game.    

1393
00:57:34,806 --> 00:57:36,439
      It's so early in it.      

1394
00:57:36,474 --> 00:57:39,141
    Are they gonna eliminate    
        a bigger threat?        

1395
00:57:39,176 --> 00:57:41,176
        -  Now, freak         

1396
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:52,386
       All that pressure       
         got you down          

1397
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:56,723
       Just come on down       
            to 54              

1398
00:57:56,758 --> 00:57:59,492
          Find a spot          
       out on the floor        

1399
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:01,093
        Ah, freak out         

1400
00:58:01,128 --> 00:58:02,327
          (all laugh)           

1401
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:03,861
     Le freak, c'est chic     

1402
00:58:03,896 --> 00:58:05,429
          Freak out           

1403
00:58:07,198 --> 00:58:09,331
        Ah, freak out         

1404
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:10,699
          (all laugh)           

1405
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:13,201
            - Yeah!             
           (applause)           

1406
00:58:16,071 --> 00:58:19,840
     - Ladies, I have made      
          my decision.          

1407
00:58:24,378 --> 00:58:28,045
            Alaska,             
     you're a winner, baby.     

1408
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,280
           (applause)           

1409
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:31,347
       Con-drag-ulations.       

1410
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:35,817
    You've earned a cash tip    
          of $10,000.           

1411
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:36,951
          - Thank you.          

1412
00:58:36,986 --> 00:58:39,887
        There is sort of        
a bittersweet feeling right now,

1413
00:58:39,922 --> 00:58:41,822
         because I love         
      winning challenges,       

1414
00:58:41,857 --> 00:58:44,691
       but it also means        
 I have to send somebody home.  

1415
00:58:44,726 --> 00:58:46,926
     - Katya, you're safe.      
          - Thank you.          

1416
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:49,028
         - You may join         
        the other girls.        

1417
00:58:49,063 --> 00:58:52,831
           (applause)           

1418
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:58,202
     Will the bottom three      
      please step forward?      

1419
00:59:05,377 --> 00:59:09,913
    Alaska, with great power    
  comes great responsibility.   

1420
00:59:12,483 --> 00:59:17,118
  Which queen have you chosen   
        to get the chop?        

1421
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,120
       - Like you've said       
          many times,           

1422
00:59:20,155 --> 00:59:23,556
    "RuPaul's Drag Race" is     
 a microcosm of the real world. 

1423
00:59:23,591 --> 00:59:24,924
     And in the real world,     

1424
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:27,993
   sometimes we have to make    
  really difficult decisions,   

1425
00:59:28,028 --> 00:59:30,729
          and tonight           
     is one of those times.     

1426
00:59:30,764 --> 00:59:33,231
           I've taken           
       into consideration       

1427
00:59:33,266 --> 00:59:36,167
        the performances        
       in the Snatch Game       

1428
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:39,870
     and on the main stage      
   and I've most importantly    

1429
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:43,306
   taken the judges critiques   
  into consideration tonight.   

1430
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:44,740
           (exhales)            

1431
00:59:44,775 --> 00:59:46,675
           The queen            
     that I have chosen...      

1432
00:59:49,946 --> 00:59:51,713
          Is Tatianna.          

1433
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,484
          - Tatianna.           
             - Yep.             

1434
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:00,186
      - As it is written,       
      so it shall be done.      

1435
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,122
    See me with them hands,     
             girl.              

1436
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:07,926
        Now sashay away.        

1437
01:00:07,961 --> 01:00:09,127
          - Thank you.          

1438
01:00:09,162 --> 01:00:10,628
          - Thank you.          

1439
01:00:10,663 --> 01:00:12,730
           - Thanks.            

1440
01:00:12,765 --> 01:00:17,000
           (applause)           

1441
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:19,002
  The most disappointing part   

1442
01:00:19,037 --> 01:00:21,571
     about being eliminated     
 this early in the competition  

1443
01:00:21,606 --> 01:00:23,773
         is definitely          
    I don't have the ability    

1444
01:00:23,808 --> 01:00:27,510
       to show everything       
     that I have to offer.      

1445
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:29,078
            Not just            
    in the way of clothing,     

1446
01:00:29,113 --> 01:00:32,347
     but I have a lot more      
     personality and talent     

1447
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:34,181
  that I didn't get the chance  
          to feature.           

1448
01:00:36,618 --> 01:00:38,685
      - Con-drag-ulations,      
          "All Stars."          

1449
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,155
      Keep freaking me out      
  and you could find yourself   

1450
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,557
       in the "Drag Race"       
         hall of fame.          

1451
01:00:44,592 --> 01:00:47,793
         Now, remember,         
  if you can't love yourself,   

1452
01:00:47,828 --> 01:00:49,795
        how in the hell         
 you gonna love somebody else?  

1453
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:51,530
       Can I get an amen        
          up in here?           

1454
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:52,531
            - Amen.             
            - Amen.             

1455
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,499
   - Now, let the music play.   

1456
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:56,300
   -  Throw your hands up     

1457
01:00:56,335 --> 01:00:58,435
       Time to get down       

1458
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:02,738
       Time to get down,       
    down, down, down, down     

1459
01:01:02,773 --> 01:01:05,707
 - I would say to Ru, thank you 
  so much for having me again.  

1460
01:01:05,742 --> 01:01:08,576
    It was great seeing you     
        and your, uh...         

1461
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:10,144
            (alarm)             

1462
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:12,212
          - Ooh, girl.          

1463
01:01:12,247 --> 01:01:15,982
        Tatianna, girl,         
        all is not lost,        

1464
01:01:16,017 --> 01:01:18,017
     so stay thirsty, girl,     

1465
01:01:18,052 --> 01:01:21,586
        'cause you still        
    have a chance to return     

1466
01:01:21,621 --> 01:01:24,889
       for your revenge.        

1467
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:26,190
       - Are you serious?       

1468
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:29,693
         - (evil laugh)         

1469
01:01:31,362 --> 01:01:34,463
      Wait, does this mean      
      I get to come back?       

1470
01:01:34,498 --> 01:01:36,465
             I can.
