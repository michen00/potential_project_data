1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,735
- Previously on "All Stars"...

2
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,037
10 of my fiercest queens

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,174
return for a spot
in the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,278
- The energy in the room
is so focused.

5
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,846
They're all ready to attack.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,119
- This got really real
really quick.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,854
- Who the fuck
is going home today?

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:25,626
- Welcome to our All Star
Spangled Variety Show.

9
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,094
It's Monique Heart.

10
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,228
- This is a great way

11
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,464
to enter this competition
with momentum.

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,199
- Didn't you mean moo-mentum?

13
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,834
- Trinity The Tuck.

14
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,402
- Is that uncomfortable, though?

15
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,237
- If you only knew.
[all laugh]

16
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,373
- It's Jasmine Masters.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,341
- Your breath smell like
you have been doing nothing

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,343
but eating on assholes.

19
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,679
- Did you prepare that at all?

20
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,747
- No.

21
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:49,383
- It's Farrah Moan.

22
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,018
Oh!

23
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,987
- Leave that nervous shit home.
It's boring.

24
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,590
- Trinity The Tuck.

25
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,425
Con-drag-ulations.
You're a winner, baby.

26
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,261
[applause]

27
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,499
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

28
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,200
- The person
I've decided to go with...

29
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,038
is Jasmine.

30
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,874
- Jasmine, sashay away.

31
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,450
- Whew.

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,252
Poor Juj.

33
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,921
- Oh, Jasmine.
- Oh...

34
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,123
- The first queen has gone home.

35
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,093
Our beloved sister,
Miss Jasmine, chopped.

36
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,696
The honeymoon phase is over.

37
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,965
Stuff just got real real, y'all.

38
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:40,801
The goopery, the gaggery,
it is real.

39
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,971
- "Hey juj, much to you all.

40
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,505
Kick faith, love Jasmine."

41
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,740
- I mean, she's "Drag Race"--

42
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,275
- Legend.
- Royalty.

43
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,609
- Right.
- Legend.

44
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,978
- How do you feel, girl?

45
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,013
- This you can't
prepare yourself

46
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,648
for how you're going to feel.

47
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,184
I'm not a crier,
and it made me think

48
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,920
of, like, how I feel
about this competition.

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,455
What I want.

50
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,723
It was hard.

51
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,227
So just prepare yourself.

52
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,695
It's not gonna be easy.

53
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,398
- Trinity needs to get over
this feeling

54
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,899
of regret and remorse

55
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,235
and "Woe is me,
I had to send someone home."

56
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,037
It's part of the game, girl.

57
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,939
Like, you might lose
a friendship here or there,

58
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,540
but you know what?

59
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,909
You're $10,000 richer,
girl, you know.

60
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,347
You can buy friends.
[laughs]

61
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,782
Well, congratulations, girl.

62
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:29,783
You guys were
the top of the week.

63
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,151
- I felt good in my lip sync.

64
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,487
I'm happy that my hair loss
was iconic in the rafters.

65
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,022
[all laugh]

66
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,157
- She was in
the stratosphere, bitch.

67
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,694
- Girl, if you have a wig
come off your head,

68
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:43,864
some other something better
be up underneath your wig.

69
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,700
And this ain't the first time
I'm looking at your bald head.

70
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,237
Brown cow's thing?
Not so much.

71
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,705
- Who's lip syncing your kitty?

72
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:52,839
- Oh, yeah.

73
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,275
- Yours.
[all laugh]

74
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,977
I chose Jasmine.

75
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,680
Farrah, I love you,
and I told you--

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,881
When you started crying,
I was like she's getting it.

77
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,982
I'm sending her home.

78
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,284
And it wasn't until
you stopped crying

79
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,987
and you were like
I want this so bad,

80
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,523
and it threw me all the way back
to my season

81
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,757
when I got eliminated,
and I was like

82
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,959
this is not supposed
to be my time, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,895
If someone could have
given me grace in that moment

84
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,664
for a fumble, then I would
like that same grace.

85
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,999
- Thank you.

86
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,502
I can't even begin to express
how thankful I am

87
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,739
that I am getting a second
chance in this competition.

88
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,208
I'm not a fuck-up
and I'm not untalented.

89
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,010
I just messed up.

90
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,145
I'm excited
to have a second chance,

91
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:36,716
and literally, like, watch out,
I'm about to fuck this up.

92
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,320
- That little beautiful bitch
was lucky today.

93
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,522
But this is a show about talent,

94
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,324
and looking pretty isn't enough.

95
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,360
If she's just
going to rely on that beauty,

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,296
somebody's gonna serve it
to her soon.

97
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,631
So let the games begin.

98
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,770

If you want to earn your place

00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,230
I don't think any of these girls
really know what I do

181
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,698
other than look gorgeous.

182
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,566
Maybe they're just intimidated.

183
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,201
- Monique, who do you choose?

184
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,636
- Miss Farrah Moan.

185
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,171
- Oh.

186
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,274
- All right,
that means Gia Gunn,

187
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,610
you are Team Trinity The Tuck.

188
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,711
- Aw.

189
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,613
So you got stuck with me
anyway. You see?

190
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,981
- We are happy.
We are happy.

191
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,216
- Now I'm going to show you
how the real tuck is done.

192
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,384
[all laugh]

193
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,087
- Team Trinity,
you'll be performing the track

194
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,455
"Don't Funk It Up."

195
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,190
- Yes, honey.

196
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,460
- Team Monique,
you'll be performing the track

197
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,162
"Everybody Say Love."

198
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,730
- Everybody say love.

199
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,098
- Love.
- Love.

200
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:49,035
- Now, ladies, Henny is not
your average girl group.

201
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,671
In fact, it's a collaboration,

202
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,941
featuring one of my
all-time favorite queens

203
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,509
in "Drag Race" herstory.

204
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,213
I'm talking
the original Henny-Henny.

205
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,514
[cheers]

206
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,782
That's right.

207
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,785
From Backswamp, North Carolina,

208
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,321
please welcome
Stacy Layne Matthews.

209
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,792
[cheers and applause]

210
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,429
- The Henny, like,
the motherfucking Henny.

211
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,331
Oh, my gosh, a fucking legend.

212
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,799
- Wow.

213
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,701
- Now that's
the "Jingle Bell Rock."

214
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,802
- I'm gonna go tell her, Henny.

215
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,739
- Henny is in the house,
Henny.

216
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,173
- Who the fuck is here
that I'd want to know?

217
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,274
Is Precious back there?

218
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,709
She better be cooking me
something to eat.

219
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,378
I feel like it's couture.

220
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,246
- That meme of her
in the Season 8 finale,

221
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,548
it'll be ingrained
in everyone's brain forever.

222
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,084
- Shake it. Ooh!

223
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,319
- I really love her.

224
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,221
Like, when I see her,
it does something to me.

225
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,590
- Mmm. Mmm.

226
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,126
- [whines]

227
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,397
- Now, ladies, Stacy is our
artist in residence this week.

228
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,098
You will be judged

229
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:56,036
on how well you feature
her extraordinary talents.

230
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,872
Stacy, darling, are you ready
to share the spotlight

231
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,373
with my All Stars?

232
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,608
- Well, you know
what they say, Ru.

233
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,344
Never work with animals,
children, or drag queens.

234
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,545
[all laugh]

235
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,881
- But for you, Mother Ru,
I'll do anything.

236
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,482
- Oh, good.
- Henny.

237
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,650
- All right.
[laughter and applause]

238
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,951
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

239
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,289
Start your engines,
and may the best All Star win.

240
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,124
[cheers and applause]

241
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,293
- "Everybody Say Love."

242
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,129
- Oh, my gosh, you can--
do it again.

243
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,632
- All right, girl.
- [laughs]

244
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,367
- She didn't do that, you know,
the white-girl twerk.

245
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,035
When you do this.
- With the shoulders.

246
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,171
- All right, Farrah Moan.

247
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,506
- She was that one white girl
that can twerk at the club.

248
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,542
As team captain,
I just need to make sure

249
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,777
that my team
can come out on top

250
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,246
with lyrics and choreography.

251
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,382
I know I'm going to be stunning
at whatever I do.

252
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,585
We need to shine together
as a group cohesively,

253
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,089
but also make sure
that we shine individual.

254
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,024
And no tears.

255
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,592
- No tears. Hell, no.

256
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,728
- Farrah allegedly has a fire
under her booty to work better,

257
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,096
but just last week,

258
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,265
the bitch could barely dance
to her own fucking number

259
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,867
that she knows all the moves to.

260
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,169
How's she gonna do
a choreographed challenge, girl?

261
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,737
Sabotage.

262
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,805
- Three, two, one, say love.

263
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,006
- Three, two, one.

264
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,374
- Love.
- Love.

265
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,476
- Oh, my God,
it would be so cute

266
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,811
if we can harmonize
that last note.

267
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,881
- We can add in
a little unh-aiy.

268
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,716
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

269
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,851
[all laugh]

270
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,719
- Rrrrap on, rrrrap on.

271
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,523
- The song that we are assigned
is "Don't Funk It Up."

272
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,792
And I feel good about this team.

273
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,393
- I'm thinking more
inspirational message.

274
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,394
- Right.

275
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,063
- So right here, I've said,

276
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,598
for those of you
who don't know me,

277
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,600
I put the "T" in the LGB.

278
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,701
- Yeah.
- Oh.

279
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,002
- Okay.

280
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,272
- Mine's going to be more about
if you do funk it up,

281
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,074
get back up and keep going.

282
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:45,345
So if you Farrah on your ass,
you just gotta keep going.

283
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,946
- I was just so nervous

284
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,883
that me and Farrah were
going to be in the same group.

285
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,518
I don't know if y'all knew this,

286
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,888
but me and Farrah had a big
falling-out a couple months ago.

287
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,855
- No.

288
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,023
- At one point,

289
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,093
I considered Farrah
to be a close friend.

290
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,362
But she tried to go about

291
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,865
patching up a relationship
between me and another person

292
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,301
in an inappropriate way.

293
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:11,004
And while I'm at work,
they showed up drunk,

294
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,306
and so I kind of
let her have it,

295
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,009
and the other girl have it
at the same time.

296
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,579
I texted her and she
just didn't respond to me.

297
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,648
So seeing her
walk into this workroom,

298
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:22,682
I was a little gagged,

299
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,517
because I did cherish
our friendship,

300
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,753
but she kind of
fucked it up a little bit.

301
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,921
- Man.
- She funked it up.

302
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,022
 - She funked it.
 - She funked it up.

303
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,390
And bitch,
I was kind of hoping

304
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,625
that you were gonna
vote her off.

305
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,861
I just don't want our drama

306
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,565
to be a distraction for me
during this competition.

307
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,899
- I think that while you guys

308
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,035
are stuck here
in this workroom together,

309
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,004
it's a perfect opportunity
for you to address it.

310
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,272
- I agree. Without
the outside influences.

311
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,373
- Yeah.

312
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,642
- Just me and you, baby.
What's going on?

313
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,211
- I am not trying
to get in the middle

314
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,413
of all of this bullshit.

315
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,248
Girl, figure it out.
Move on.

316
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,283
Sounds like high school
bullshit to me.

317
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,252
I just don't think you should
even worry about it.

318
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,354
- Oh, honey,
I'm not worried about it.

319
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,389
I don't know if "All Stars"
is the place

320
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,192
to be focused
on our unfinished business,

321
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:10,063
but I hope that we can
kind of talk things out

322
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,565
because I'm sure that
she'll get the chop soon.

323
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,670
- Hi.
- Hello, gentlemen.

324
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,905
- Welcome, everybody.

325
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,542
- This week's main stage
challenge is girl groups.

326
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,211
So now it's time to record
our hit single,

327
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,446
"Everybody Say Love."

328
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,748
- My name is Leland,
and this is Freddy.

329
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,950
And we put these two songs
together.

330
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,185
You're singing along with Lizzo.

331
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,519
Lizzo is on these choruses.

332
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,254
- Yes!
- How fun is that?

333
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,790
- Her lip sync sent me home,
so I feel a little shaded.

334
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,858
But we'll work it out.

335
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,627
- Shredded.
- Hello.

336
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,829
- So as a team, who do you feel
is the strongest singer?

337
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,498
[bell dings]

338
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,834
- There have not been
a lot of good singers

339
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,569
out of the "Drag Race" family.

340
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,704
You know, there's Adore,
she's a good one.

341
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,074
There's Jujubee. I think
she's a really good one.

342
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,275
Me.

343
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,410
- Okay, here we go.

344
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,345
- ♪ Took some time
to love myself ♪

345
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,080
♪ And embrace this melanin ♪

346
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,717
♪ And now I thank God
for the beauty of this skin ♪

347
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,153
- I've never worked with Monique
in terms of a group,

348
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,757
but I do know that Monique
has very grand visions,

349
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:14,494
but her thoughts are way more
grand than her execution is.

350
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,363
- ♪ 'Cause now that--
'cause now that I've got-- ♪

351
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,032
Oh, crunchy monkey.

00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,247
Wait, I'm not doing the splits.

524
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,616
Honey, I'm not doing
a death drop

525
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,919
because that would be the end
of Stacy Layne Matthews, honey.

526
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,423
And I promise you, this studio
would have a basement.

527
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,425
- [laughs]

528
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:20,626
- So you won't turn around

529
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,062
until the song goes
♪ Oh, honey ♪

530
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,330

531
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,832
- You're gonna start
right here, sis.

532
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,001
'Cause we want you
to have a good pooch.

533
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,371
As team captain, I have
to come up with choreography.

534
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,041
Then I have to
teach the choreography.

535
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,842
We have to perfect
the choreography

536
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,378
and then perform
the choreography.

537
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,282
So the pressure,
oh, my gosh, I feel it.

00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,986

540
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,454
- So my first one
I'm stepping out.

541
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,990
- You step back
and to your spot.

542
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,092
One, two, ready, go.

543
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,727
- I still go this way?
- Yeah.

544
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,895
- Oh.

545
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,731
- So you just bum-ta-da-bum,
bum-ta-da-bum.

546
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,200
One, two, three, bang.

547
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,201
- Pressure, honey.

548
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,470
- When I thought girl group,

549
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,605
I thought
I was going to be doing

550
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,209
some fun little Britney-isms,
some hair flips.

551
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,343
I didn't really think

552
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,746
we were going to be all,
you know, getting down.

553
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,381
[laughs]

554
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,949
- Du-du-du-du-du-du-du.

555
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:22,822
I'm here...
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

556
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,291
- See, I end up like all the way
over here with that.

557
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,127
- But you can't go
too far, my love.

558
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,762
Because see I was here,
and I just go.

559
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:32,398
It's all in the movement.
You don't have to go.

560
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,699
- Take smaller steps.

561
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,667
- Yeah, smaller steps
so you don't travel as far,

562
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,801
you see what I'm saying?

563
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,002
- My spot's already
right here already.

564
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,771
- So then fake it
in that one spot.

565
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,575
Miss Farrah is plucking
my last nerve, America.

566
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,343
Okay, so let's just say
sorry, sorry, sorry,

567
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,411
for the sake of time.

568
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,313
We're trying
to do a whole lot.

569
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,148
- Yeah.
- Whoo, honey.

570
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,282
Too many things.

571
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,152
- I think Monique
kind of receives ideas

572
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:54,386
and just moves on.

573
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,823
She doesn't give people
time to process things.

574
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,059
Well, your brain
has to process shit, girl.

575
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,328
- Say love, say love.

576
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,263
Farrah, Farrah, come over here.

577
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,732
- Oh. So we're not doing
the leg kick anymore.

578
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:07,733
- No, because we need
to get you on this side.

579
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,769
- Okay.

580
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,104
The choreography
is coming off super messy.

581
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,140
I keep wanting
to like simplify it,

582
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,508
and I'm kind of
getting shut down.

583
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,444
But I will just shut up
and let Monique do it,

584
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,246
and if this all
crashes and burns,

585
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,480
she's the team captain,

586
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,183
and I guess she can take,
you know, the fall.

587
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,317
- You look stressed.

588
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,554
- I am a little bit stressed
with this.

589
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,256
- We'll work it out.
- No stress.

- Hey.
- Henny!

593
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,932
- Being on stage
is what I do best,

594
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,734
and I need to show
these other bitches

595
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,636
what real talent is about.

596
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,671
- Well, let's see what
we're working with, honey.

597
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,906
- I'm what, here?

598
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,141
- No, you are...
you are here.

00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,111
Here, Manila, and then Henny.

600
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,946
- No, but like
we're making a "V", right?

601
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,614
- Let's just walk
to our places first

602
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,817
before we even start
doing the choreography.

603
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,851

- And da-da-da.
- Start with the right foot?

609
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,793
- Yes.

610
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:10,262
- So once we get
to the first position,

611
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,064
then we start doing our...
No, no, no.

612
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,365
The march thing.

613
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:17,970
So we can march here,
turn, get back to your spot.

614
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,638
- I think we should
start it off here.

615
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,340
- Who's team leader?

616
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,042
- Her.
- Oh, okay.

617
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,277
- Why don't we just do do-do-do?

618
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,646

620
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,585
- No, because
we should be in a square.

621
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,754
- Basically there was
17 cooks in the kitchen.

622
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,590
All the servers done quit,
honey.

623
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,592
I was like, girl,
who's cooking this cake, honey?

624
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:43,295
Chaos, honey, chaos.

625
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,397
- So if we're getting there
really early,

626
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,099
then we need to figure out
something to do.

627
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,202
- That's why I didn't like
the marching idea.

628
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,939
- I'm trying to like
sift through all this

629
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,675
without seeming like a dictator.

630
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,345
- Why don't we just do
do-do-do-do?

631
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:01,714

for our super girl
group performance.

637
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,564
And I'm feeling my oats, wheats,
grains, thins, and oatmeal.

638
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,565
One, two, three.

639
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,967
- Oh!
- [laughs]

640
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,736
- That is not good, girl.
- No.

641
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:28,474
- Today's look giving you
cocktails in Palm Springs.

642
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,075
- We need to get you
some human hair wigs

643
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,644
so you can whip it around
for real.

644
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,680
- Yeah.
My girl group character

645
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,916
is kind of based off Aaliyah
for a little bit.

646
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,652
So I'm really inspired
by Aaliyah's look

647
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,153
from "Dust Yourself Off."

648
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,588
But I think it'll be good
because--

649
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,356
- Team leader.
- Yes, ma'am.

650
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,991
- Are you feeling your oats
over here?

651
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,328
- Yeah. I'm really excited
for our, like, girls

652
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,731
to get out there
and do what it is that we do.

653
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,799
You know what I mean?

654
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,303
Love her. She, uh--

655
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,370
- Uh-uh, bitch, don't lie to me.

656
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,405
- No, no, no, I didn't.

657
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,206
She triggers me,
but she didn't--

658
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,709
♪ Uh... ♪

659
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,911
- Just be honest.

660
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,480
- I would say, yeah,
but she is fighting.

661
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,815
She's doing it.

662
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,784
- It's clear that Farrah's
teammates think that she

663
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,986
is probably going
to fuck this up for them.

664
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,989
And in case she gets sent home,

665
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,391
I just want to make sure
that I did my part

666
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,995
in terms of reaching out to her
and trying to squash this drama

667
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,364
so that I can have closure.

668
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,900
- You getting ready already?

669
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,068
- Yeah.

670
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,569
- Yeah, do your makeup
and get ready, sweetie,

671
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,538
'cause according to your team,
you're the weakest link.

672
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,640
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

673
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,909
- Oh, here we go.

674
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:40,112
- Listen, I'm like way less
concerned about everybody else.

675
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,914
Like, you don't see me,
like, going around

676
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,383
and trying to get in everybody's
head and focusing on me.

677
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,585
If my team thinks
that I'm the weakest link,

678
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:48,887
then obviously I need to be
doing exactly what I'm doing

679
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,724
and getting centered, balanced,
and my makeup done.

680
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,360
And so maybe
you should do the same.

681
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,595
Because I feel like
only insecure people,

682
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,631
like, go around and try
and do what you're doing.

683
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:01,533
- Oh, sweetie, I'm very secure.
Are you secure?

684
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:05,104
- Okay. It is taking everything
in my power right now

685
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,006
not to completely go
the fuck off on this bitch.

686
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,576
- Clearly you don't really
care about our friendship

687
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,944
or anything that we had.

688
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,178
- [sighs]

689
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,747
- So I was just trying to--

690
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,648
- Gia, I'm trying to get ready.
- Okay.

691
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,450
- I don't have time
for your drama.

692
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,320
I feel like you're
not coming over here

693
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,521
as a friend right now.

694
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,856
I feel like
you're coming over here

695
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,225
trying to stir the fucking pot,
and it's like--

696
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,927
- Well, honey, coming up
to my job drunk...

697
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,129
- Oh, here we go.

698
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,965
- ...wasn't really being
a friend, either, babe.

699
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,401
And when I texted you
months ago

700
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,436
and you didn't answer me,

701
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,738
that didn't really show me
that you cared, either.

702
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,073
- Just in her tone of voice

703
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,076
I can tell that she is trying
to get under my skin

704
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:46,912
and psych me out, because
I guess she sees me as a threat.

705
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,281
But now she's trying
to backpedal

706
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,683
and say that this is
about our previous drama

707
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,086
that happened
like six months ago.

708
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,754
And it's like Gia,
stop trying to make this

709
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,925
about something that literally
isn't even a thing.

710
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,762
Honestly, that night
has been nothing in my life

711
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,297
since that night.

712
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,132
None of that was public.

713
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,868
And I don't really understand
the whole point

714
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,804
of bringing this in
in the workroom

715
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,138
while we're getting ready.

716
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,607
It seems opportunistic of you.

717
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,910
- Call it what you want.
It is what it is.

718
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,144
- Opportunistic.

719
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,647
- Sure. Honey, I'm here
for an opportunity

720
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:22,915
just like you are.

721
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,485
- Yeah, well, some of us
don't have to, you know,

722
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,687
force storylines to get airtime.

723
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,091
- [laughs]
Cutthroat Farrah.

724
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,927
- I was just trying to see,

725
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,929
in case today's your last day
here in the competition,

726
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:41,733
how you feel about
our friendship and our past.

727
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,636
- You are taking up
my time right now,

728
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,838
and I don't have time for it.

729
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,473
- Because you can't multitask.

730
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,008
- Sure, Gia, whatever
you want me to fucking say.

731
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,143
- Can you not bully my teammate?

732
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,444
- I'm not bullying her.

733
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,679
- I'm saying, but she
just asked you to step away.

734
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,447
- Literally, like,
just please get out of my face.

735
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,682
- I'm not bullying her.
- Seriously, sister.

736
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,450
She just said
she wants to get ready.

737
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,320
- Gia, you know you're over here
trying to stir shit up,

738
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,056
so, like, why don't you
go to your station

739
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,524
and put your makeup on, girl?

740
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,160
- Ooh, bitch, girl.
Farrah's clapping back.

741
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,561
She's like leave me alone.

742
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,929
She gonna get to cracking
her neck.

743
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,364
I'm like, yes, Farrah,
let that bitch know.

744
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,500
Leave you alone, girl.

745
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,601
Bye.

746
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,803
- Don't be so sensitive.

747
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,505
- Sis, no one
was being sensitive.

748
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,873
You literally went over there,

749
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,674
and you was trying
to gas her up.

750
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,909
Now I catch your game,

751
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,410
and you're trying
in get my teammate's head.

752
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,411
No, ma'am.

753
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,713
If that was your girl

754
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,548
and you was really concerned
about that friendship,

755
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,016
why didn't you address that
day one?

756
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,418
- Because it's taken a while
for things to boil up.

757
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,686
- No, you--

758
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,090
No, you found an opportunity.

759
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,594
- I like Gia, and I see
some of myself in her.

760
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,197
But, girl, don't pick on
the weakest one.

761
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,932
If you go to prison,

762
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:50,269
on the first day,
you don't shank the weakest one.

763
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,504
You have to shank the biggest
guy to show your dominance.

764
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,872
That just makes you
look like a bully.

765
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,607
Trust me, I tried that
on my season.

766
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:56,675
It doesn't work out.

767
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,243
- Just in case
it's her last time here,

768
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,945
I wanted to make sure--
- Oh, my gosh, sis!

769
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,748
That is fake-as-fuck.com.

770
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,183
- Call me what you want.

771
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,352
- America,
Gia is fake as fuck.

772
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,055
- Thank you, Monique,
for sticking up for me.

773
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,423
- Farrah, I hope
that this, like,

774
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,692
lights a fire under your ass.

775
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,327
- Baby, this is a competition.

776
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:18,597
If you can't take the pressure
of your other competitors,

777
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,198
then you don't deserve
to be here.

778
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,067
Get into it or get out.

779
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,104

00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,564
and I feel that I'm giving
the judges fashion, girl.

1039
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:20,665
And I smell good, too.

1040
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,967
- I don't bring my dress
to the red carpet.

1041
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,337
I bring the red carpet
on my dress.

1042
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,306
- You just wear it.

1043
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,043
- She's from the hood,
the Little Red Riding hood.

1044
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,145
♪ She's a super queen ♪

1045
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,480
- Welcome, All Stars.

1046
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,750
Now based on
your Henny performances

1047
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,220
and your elaguant
runway presentations,

1048
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,756
I've made some decisions.

1049
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:49,327
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward.

1050
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,828
Valentina.

1051
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,598
Monét X Change.

1052
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,967
Naomi Smalls.

1053
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,038
You are the tops of the week.

1054
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,740
[cheers and applause]

1055
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,611
Bet you don't hear that
often, do you?

1056
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,347
Manila Luzon.

1057
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,083
Monique Heart.

1058
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,520
Farrah Moan.

1059
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:20,792
You ladies are the bottoms
of the week.

1060
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,264
Latrice Royale.

1061
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,868
Gia Gunn.

1062
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,671
Trintity The Tuck.

1063
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,076
You are safe.

1064
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,113
Please step
to the back of the stage.

1065
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,153
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1066
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,723
starting with Manila Luzon.

1067
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,992
That...getup.

1068
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,627
- Get into the armpits.

1069
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,595
- Did you stone those armpits?

1070
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,863
[all laugh]

1071
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:02,000
- On the runway,
you looked stunning.

1072
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,102
This is what I expect,
and nothing less.

1073
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,070
But when it came
to your performance,

1074
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,908
almost everything on you
was like little for you.

1075
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,309
It was like small hair,

1076
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,744
you had these
little wedgie shoes on,

1077
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,780
that I was like, Manila?
In a wedge?

1078
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,683
And I almost felt you
kind of not knowing the words.

1079
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,152
You're a performer.
That's what you do.

1080
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,222
So I want to see that in you,
and that's what I expect.

1081
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:28,126
- The performance I honestly
have a giant question mark by,

1082
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,028
because I don't feel like
your intentions were super clear

1083
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,729
as to what you were
trying to get across.

1084
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,797
- Okay.

1085
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,465
- I can't pinpoint what it was.

1086
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,733
And maybe it's just that

1087
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,203
all the other queens
in your group were so good.

1088
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:43,241
- It really, really breaks my
heart that I came all this way

1089
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:46,978
and not just slay it
like I know I can.

1090
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,579
- So if you look in that mirror,

1091
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,782
if you're lucky enough
to survive, you know what to do.

1092
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,019
- Up next, Valentina.

1093
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,187
- Hola, Valentina.

1094
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,655
- Hola, mi amor.

1095
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,524
- Tonight on the runway
is very pretty,

1096
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:02,260
and your performance,
I loved most of all

1097
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,195
the nod to Selena, obviously.

1098
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,464
You had some Spanish
in your verse, which was lovely.

1099
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,467
It was fun, it was catchy,
and it was you.

1100
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,103
- Valentina, you gave me
Valentino vibes.

1101
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,538
That's how I look at your dress.

1102
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,640
I loved the energy,

1103
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,975
and I loved
when you hit the high note.

1104
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,643
Like, there was something
kind of like "I Love Lucy"

1105
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,044
about that ending.

1106
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,479
You brought it.

1107
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,915
- There's something very special
about you, Valentina.

1108
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,783
We saw it in your first season,

1109
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,219
and we are seeing it again
here in "All Stars."

1110
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,322
- Up next, Naomi Smalls.

1111
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,558
- You are a great songwriter.

1112
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,259
- Thank you.
- You are.

1113
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,894
Your verse
really stood out to me.

1114
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,229
- You were one of the few

1115
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,798
that actually just slayed
the hell out of your game.

1116
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,100
Loved what you were wearing.

1117
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,436
It was sassy,
it was fashion, it was hot.

1118
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:47,739
- I actually could see myself
rocking it on the stage.

1119
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,208
I was like, I gotta figure out
who made that.

1120
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,477
It was just lit in all ways.

1121
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,512
And you committed
and you were consistent

1122
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,247
from the performance
to the runway.

1123
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,850
- I printed out your words
to "1, 2 Step"

1124
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,651
so all my girlfriends
in sixth grade,

1125
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,053
we could memorize
all the lyrics.

1126
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:04,355
So this is fucking crazy.

1127
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,456
- Oh, thank you so much.

1128
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,425
- Up next, Monique Heart.

1129
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,793
- Hello, hello.

1130
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,696
- I loved
the kind of nod to TLC

1131
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,197
you were giving us
with your look.

1132
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,332
- I was doing Aaliyah.

1133
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:15,833
- Okay, Aaliyah.

1134
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,934
I just felt like it was

1135
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,002
full nineties
girl group moment.

1136
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,438
- Stunning.

1137
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,407
- But it got a little bit messy.

1138
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:25,343
- In a performance like that,
precision is key.

1139
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,944
Right? The words have
to be precise.

1140
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,613
The movements
have to be precise.

1141
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:31,215
And it just was a little messy.

1142
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,985
- I would say the coat
I can say was messy,

1143
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,086
but I was sweating.

1144
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,387
I'm a dude
trying to take it off.

1145
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,623
It got stuck.

1146
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:39,724
Get it?

1147
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,326
- Sometimes that happens,
but I will say,

1148
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,929
when the lights are on, as
performers and just for myself,

1149
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,531
we can't even make
an excuse for it.

1150
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:49,300
We just have to like be in
that moment and commit to it.

1151
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,968
And that's just the ownership
we have to have.

1152
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,471
- Up next, Farrah Moan.

1153
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:55,840
- Everything about your look
is perfection.

1154
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,375
Like, everything works
with each other.

1155
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:59,877
It complements each other.
Everything is just right.

1156
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,612
- So many women would kill
to look like that.

1157
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,947
- Oh, stop.

1158
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,882
- But the performance was,

1159
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,084
sorry, just like
a little bit white bread.

1160
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:11,155
- I think this is the first time
I've really seen you dance,

1161
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:14,959
and the whitest dancer
I've ever seen in my life

1162
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,828
is the nice way to put it.

1163
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,796
- Oh.

1164
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,799
- You are serving me
vegan dessert.

1165
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,334
Like they bring it to the table,
and it looks really good.

1166
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,503
And it tastes really good, too.

1167
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:28,272
- But it's not as fulfilling
as you want it to be.

1168
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,374
You have it.

1169
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,644
We're just seeing you
struggle to find it.

1170
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:38,082
- Up next, Monét X Change.

1171
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,152
- Tonight, you were my favorite
performer of all.

1172
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,420
You're actually
a really good rapper.

1173
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,454
- Thank you.

1174
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,956
- You were in the moment.

1175
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,257
You were grounded.

1176
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:48,526
- I really enjoyed
the performance, too.

1177
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:50,895
It was another memorable moment
for me for tonight as well.

1178
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:54,465
- But now let's talk about
this runway look.

1179
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,601
I love it.

1180
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:59,270
- I was thinking, damn, girl.
- [laughs]

1181
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,739
- This is a look that
you never would have served us

1182
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,041
on Season 10,
and look at you now.

1183
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,278
It's a joy to watch you
really hone your skills.

1184
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:08,546
- Thank you.

1185
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:11,282
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1186
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,618
And I've made some decisions.

1187
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,589
- Monét X Change.

1188
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,158
Valentina.

1189
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,493
Con-drag-ulations.

1190
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,929
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

1191
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,598
[applause]

1192
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:33,371
You've each won a $2,500
gift card from arda wigs,

1193
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:39,510
plus $1,000 gift card
from Coolhaus Ice Cream.

1194
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,346
Naomi Smalls, you are safe.

1195
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,618
Manila Luzon,

1196
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:50,988
You are safe.

1197
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:54,559
- Thank you.

1198
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,362
- That means Farrah Moan
and Monique Heart,

1199
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,632
you are in the bottom two.

1200
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:07,138
Monét, Valentina,
each of you needs to decide

1201
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:09,440
which of the bottom queens
you'll eliminate

1202
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,609
if you win the lip sync.

1203
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:16,047
So while you queens deliberate
in the workroom,

1204
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,817
the judges and I
will toss Ross's salad.

1205
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:23,754
Ladies,
you may leave the stage.

1206
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,358
- We have a winner!

1207
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,460
- ♪ Dee dee dee dee ♪

1208
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,995
- Oh.
- Congrats, mi vida.

1209
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,763
- Congrats to you, too.

1210
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:37,201
- I've now won
my first challenge.

1211
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,803
It's been an honor.
[applause]

1212
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:40,471
Thank you, thank you.

1213
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,740
But when you're in
this position,

1214
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,375
it makes you feel
all these feelings

1215
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,911
'cause you don't want
to have to send somebody home.

1216
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:50,114
I don't want to have to be like,
all right, I won, bitch, bye.

1217
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,148
No.

1218
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,783
- Congratulations, guys.

1219
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,285
- Yes.
- Cheers.

1220
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:55,786
- Thank you guys so much.

1221
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,589
- My first challenge win
in "Drag Race" history, girls.

1222
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,359
[cheering]
I never won any in my season.

1223
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,095
- But you're a winner, baby.
- Yay!

1224
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,663
- No, you're top two.

1225
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:08,699
- No, bitch,
I won a cash prize. I won.

1226
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,034
- Oh.

1227
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:13,971
- When can I plead my case,
because I need to stay,

1228
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:16,207
so at what point
does that happen?

1229
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,809
Can I plead my case with
one of y'all, because I cannot.

1230
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,811
America, I am so gooped
right now.

1231
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,781
Like how does a strong,
beautiful,

1232
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:27,618
talented,
fabulous queen like me,

1233
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:31,088
that was in the top last week,
be in the bottom?

1234
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,090
Was I really that bad?

1235
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,091
Can we talk?

1236
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,060
- I think we should
definitely talk.

1237
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,928
I would love
that opportunity.

1238
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,330
- But not right now?

1239
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,998
- Um, I don't know.

1240
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,867
I just wanted to share something
with you guys.

1241
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:44,435
- Oh, my God, yes.

1242
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:47,772
- Okay.

1243
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:50,074
- I feel so many emotions
right now.

1244
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,509
I should be celebrating,

1245
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:54,378
but at the same time,
I feel like, oh, my goodness,

1246
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,981
I have to focus on the lip sync.

1247
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:59,850
Valentina, you are not known
for knowing the words.

1248
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,285
- Girl, Valentina is a diva.

1249
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:05,489
She seriously thinks that she
is like this telenovela star.

1250
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,492
[Spanish guitar plays,
applause]

1251
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,998
- It's just so hard, girls.

1252
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,133
- Ugh.

1253
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,668
Are y'all gonna talk
to each other, or what?

1254
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,070
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1255
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,772
- Y'all got
about 10 minutes, bitch.

1256
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,008
- The biggest issue
with being in the bottom

1257
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,644
is the fact that
you can't fight for you.

1258
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,779
You're in the ocean.

1259
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:30,214
You can't swim.

1260
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,649
You're by the boat,

1261
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:34,318
and you're waiting for them
to throw you a lifeline.

1262
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,654
That is the most
unsettling thing

1263
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:38,389
about this whole competition.

1264
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,725
I cannot go home.
Like, I cannot.

1265
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,159
I felt like to come back

1266
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,729
and come back as strong
as I came day one in the door,

1267
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:46,430
I think that speaks volumes.

1268
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,733
It was just messy
because of a coat.

1269
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,101
Fuck.

1270
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,769
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1271
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:53,871
- If you can go back,
I wouldn't have worn the coat,

1272
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,074
but I was trying to give homage.

1273
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:00,010
- Monique is very defensive,

1274
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:02,713
but with her Aaliyah outfit,

1275
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,483
the fit of that pant
is not okay.

1276
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:08,185
That is so disrespectful
to Aaliyah.

1277
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,420
How dare you.

1278
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,921
I have to make a decision.

1279
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,323
- You do.

1280
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,191
- And ultimately, someone's
heart is going to be broken.

1281
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,459
- Very bad.

1282
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:16,861
I don't want you to pick me,

1283
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:21,332
but if you do, I would
have to swallow the bullet,

1284
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,833
and it's not personal.

1285
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:27,605
It's just what the game
has called for.

1286
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:28,939
Ouch.

1287
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,641
- I really am gagged
that you're in the bottom,

1288
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,877
because I felt like
our team as a whole--

1289
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:34,211
- Did so well.

1290
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,579
- I feel like
we were all so strong,

1291
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,747
and that you really went
balls to the wall.

1292
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,182
- Yeah.

1293
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,818
- Hold on. I just want to say
something to them real fast.

1294
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,787
Is that rude
for me to interrupt?

1295
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,456
I'm feeling
a little bit responsible

1296
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:47,458
for the way that things
played out today,

1297
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,860
and I just don't want that
weighing on my shoulder

1298
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,129
if she does get eliminated.

1299
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,330
- I'm kind of like
really holding in

1300
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,498
a lot of my emotions right now.

1301
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,133
- Ladies,
I don't want to interrupt,

1302
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,301
but I just want
to say something real fast.

1303
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,402
Is that okay?

1304
00:49:00,204 --> 00:49:02,106
- This is Farrah's time.
- Yeah.

1305
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,974
Real fast, because
you were both on your team--

1306
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,943
on each other's team.

1307
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,512
I do sincerely want to apologize
to both of you

1308
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:14,218
if I created any type of stir-up
in anyone's emotions

1309
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:15,920
or anything like that.

1310
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,589
My intentions were not to throw
you off or throw your group off.

1311
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:21,392
- Gia, this is literally
not the time

1312
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:24,328
for your fake apology
to make yourself feel better.

1313
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:29,600
God, I can't stand her.

1314
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,602
- Gia Gunn can't stop talking.
Look at her.

1315
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,537
She's over there like buying up
Miss Farrah's time.

1316
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:35,773
- I would have put Gia
in the bottom.

1317
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:36,807
- Would you have?

1318
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,475
- Just for her attitude.

1319
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,377
Girl, it's time for her to go.

1320
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,512
- You know that
I treasure our friendship

1321
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,681
and regardless
after what happens today,

1322
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,517
I would really like for us
to work on our friendship,

1323
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,452
and that's all
that I wanted to say.

1324
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,487
I don't want to take
any more of your time, okay?

1325
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,555
Thank you.

1326
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:57,027
- Girl, here she comes.
Don't say nothing.

1327
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,596
- What did you
go over there for?

1328
00:49:58,596 --> 00:49:59,697
- I know. What'd you say?

1329
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,998
- I just wanted to tell them--

1330
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,766
- Poke the bear.
- Huh?

1331
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,802
- Poke the little Care Bear.
- No, no, no, no.

1332
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:09,273
I feel like when
you make a mistake in life,

1333
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:11,742
it's okay to apologize and
let people know how you feel,

1334
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,510
in case this is the last time

1335
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,447
that I do get to talk to her
before elimination.

1336
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,781
That you know what, girl?

1337
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,017
I'm sorry if I fucked
y'all's juj up.

1338
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:25,089
- Gia is here
stirring the pot again.

1339
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:26,257
Is that all she does?

1340
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:29,526
'Cause if that was a talent,
girl, you win.

1341
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,328
- Girl, I'm just like, what?

1342
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,130
You know, I thought
they were gonna get it.

1343
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,365
I thought
they were gonna like it.

1344
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,934
I thought all the boxes
were checked.

1345
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:39,370
I cannot go home.
Don't send me home.

1346
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,238
I don't want to go home.

1347
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,307
I have worked too hard
to get back.

1348
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,809
It took too much to bounce back.

1349
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,679
- Yeah, yeah.
- But I'm not done at all.

1350
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,649
- Yeah.
- Miss Monét, that's my sis.

1351
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:53,684
And I hope she would save me.

1352
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,586
That's my mindset,
that is my game plan,

1353
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:56,654
that's where I'm at.

1354
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,789
- I love you.
- I love you.

1355
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,324
- You know I love you, too,
mama.

1356
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,159
Now I'm going to go
and change for this lip sync.

1357
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,663
- Yeah, I need you to win.
- [laughs]

1358
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,364
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

1359
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,532
- I'm sorry that
you're in the bottom.

1360
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,935
I could only imagine
how much you're feeling.

1361
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:13,237
- Honestly, it really sucks,
Valentina,

1362
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,907
because I came here
to prove something to myself.

1363
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,177
And I think you know
deep down in your heart

1364
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:26,450
that I am a bigger star
than going home right now.

1365
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,087
- But if I was to eliminate you,

1366
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:34,124
what would that do
to everything that we've built?

1367
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,527
We've worked so hard
on this relationship, Valentina.

1368
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,396
It's like we've finally got
to such a good place.

1369
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,098
And, I mean,
it would be heartbreaking.

1370
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,400
I want this

1371
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,971
more than I've wanted anything
in my whole life.

1372
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,372
If I go home tonight,

1373
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:53,110
it's going to take me a really
long time to get over it.

1374
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,713
- I just fixed my relationship
with Farrah.

1375
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,581
She apologized
about all the stuff

1376
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:59,516
that happened at the reunion,

1377
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:00,784
and we were able
to move forward.

1378
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,120
And now we're excited
to be here together.

1379
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,657
So I don't really want
to go there and do that to her.

1380
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,392
- I love you so much, Valentina.

1381
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:09,860
- I love you, too.

1382
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,629
I really do, okay?

1383
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,230
- I can't wait
to watch your lip sync.

1384
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,066
Don't let the stress
of this decision

1385
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,802
affect your moment right now,
because, Valentina,

1386
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,206
this is exactly
what you came here to do.

1387
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:24,141
[laughs]
- Thanks, mi amor.

1388
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,546
- Sending someone home

1389
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,914
is harder than
I thought it would be.

1390
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,785
My Miss Congeniality
crown, girl,

1391
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:36,020
is gonna be a little tarnished.

1392
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,521
It's gonna be a little tainted

1393
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,857
because someone's dreams
are on a lipstick

1394
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,026
underneath my sweaty sock boob.

1395
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,495
That ain't congenial.

1396
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:48,465
- This decision sets the tone

1397
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:52,436
about who I am
and what I'm here to do.

1398
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:55,672
There's going to be
so many opinions

1399
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,009
about why I decided that person.

1400
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,745
Are you threatened?
Are you jealous?

1401
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:05,315
Or are you mean?
Are you empty?

1402
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:09,853
Their entire future
is in your hand,

1403
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,090
and it's up to you
to cut it short.

1404
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,525
To go, whoosh.

1405
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,592
Bye, girl.

1406
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:20,164
 Adiós, mi amor.

1407
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:22,099
But that's the game.

1408
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,773
- Welcome back, ladies.

1409
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:33,610
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

1410
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,878
Prior to tonight,

1411
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,048
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

1412
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,251
of "Into You" by Ariana Grande.

1413
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,521
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

1414
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,959
win $10,000,
and earn the power

1415
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:52,362
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

1416
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,900
The time has come...
[thunder]

1417
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,002
for you to lip sync...

1418
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:02,339
[echoing] for your legacy.

1419
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,610
- I now have the opportunity

1420
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:11,181
to completely redeem myself
with an Ariana Grande song.

1421
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:15,385
And if I fuck this one again,
it's over, girl.

1422
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:20,591
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

is a big triumph
for me in my life.

You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

please step forward.

Valentina, with great power
comes great responsibility.

1480
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:31,148
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

1481
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:34,951
- I made this decision
confidently tonight,

1482
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,486
but with a broken heart

1483
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:41,558
strictly because
the person I'm eliminating

1484
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:45,028
had the opportunity
to prove themselves,

1485
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,863
and it simply wasn't enough.

1486
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:50,434
And I hope
this is not the end of us...

1487
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,271
But I chose...

1488
00:57:54,271 --> 00:57:56,073
Farrah Moan.

1489
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:01,445
Farrah, I'm so sorry,
 mi amor.

1490
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:02,779
- It's okay, baby.

1491
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,048
You don't love me.

1493
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:08,452
- I do.

1494
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:11,021
- I'm just kidding, baby.

1495
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:16,326
- Farrah Moan, as it is written,
so it shall be done.

1496
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:21,064
You are and will always be
an All Star.

1497
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,999
- Thank you so much, Ru,
for this opportunity,

1498
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,169
and I'll never forget it.

1499

Bye, guys.

1504
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,726
I really didn't think

1505
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,162
that Valentina
was going to send me home.

This competition
meant so much to me.

1507
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,335
And I really wanted
to prove to myself

1508
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:00,437
that I could do it,

1509
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:02,939
and I'm so disappointed
in myself.

00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:06,643
But at the end of the day--
fuck--

1511

don't let anybody
tell you ever

if you can't love yourself,

00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,958
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1517
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,760
Can I get an amen up in here?

00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,595
