the good Lord made sure
that I shimmied good enough

She's fucking fierce.

83
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,529
Very Oz-mopolitan.

84
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,830

it was perfection.

85
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,665
America's first drag president

86
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,834

87
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,868

88
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,969
It's all about attitude.

89
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,604
Now, when I look at you
as a model--

90
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,939
You're gonna take
great photos,

91
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,875
but that does not take talent.

92
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,011
Even though I made it
all the way to the Top Three,

93
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,846
a lot of people still think

94
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,115
I'm just a tall,
pretty fashion model.

95
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,517
- You're gorgeous!
- A goddess!

96
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,953
So I'm going to seize
this opportunity

97
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,254
to show the world

98
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,090
that I'm not just
this beauty queen.

99
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,525
There's only one crown
and it's mine.

100
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,327
- Damn her waist.
- Thank you.

101
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,297
I don't really know
what to expect of Naomi.

102
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,400
she's beautiful, young,
creative.

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,370
But Naomi doesn't have
a very big personality,

104
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,873
and you either stand out
or you get out.

105
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,074
Thank God you're pretty.

106
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,046
Guess who's black
in the house, bitch. Yes!

107
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,782
I am Monet X Change

108
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,984
your current reigning
Miss Congeniality.

109
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,085
I am here to slay,

110
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,687
and until I snatch that crown,

111
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,790
a bitch brought her own. Ooh.

112
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,725
Soak it up, bitches!

113
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,560
Monet X Change.

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,595

116
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,700
In Season 10, I thought
I was going all the way,

117
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,801
and I was really surprised

118
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,237
that I didn't win
any challenges.

119
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,339
The look seems homemade.

120
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,607
Really sloppy.

121
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,875
If I could go back in time,

122
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,977
the one thing that I would
change from my season

123
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,846
would be my rickety-crickety
runway girl

124
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,847
so I could have
some challenge wins.

125
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,115
I want a challenge win.

126
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,085
- Yes! Yes!
- You are a nasty queen.

127
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,420
I'm excited to see
my Season 10 sister.

128
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,890
I feel like both of us
have something to prove.

129
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,192
But this is "All Stars" 4.

130
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,561
A black jumpsuit
like a leotard?

131
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,829
It's not stunning.

132
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,899
Hail Mary.

133
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:01,101
Step aside, boys,

134
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,538
'cause the real queen is here.

135
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:07,040
My name is Gia Gunn,
I'm from Season 6,

136
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,443
and this fresh tilapia
is now seasoned.

137
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,212

My God,
there's room for everybody.

143
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,556
I could tell
that you're the feisty one.

144
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,823
Absolutely.

145
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,659
There's still a big percentage
of the world

146
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,060
who thinks that Gia Gunn

147
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,930
is the "absolutely, let me
feel my oats," shady character.

148
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,466
But since Season 6,
I did a huge self discovery

149
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,571
and drag was the gateway
for me to realize

150
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,941
that I am not a man
that dresses up as a woman.

151
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,877
I'm a woman that participates
in the art of drag.

152
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,478
Y'all got the same look.

153
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,314
Uh-uh. She got
a crown of thorns on.

154
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,616
That means we about
to crucify her real soon.

155
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:54,254
It feels amazing
to be back in the workroom

156
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:56,656
as the proud trans-woman
that I am.

157
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,392
So get ready,
because she's here.

158
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,794
Yes, God.

159
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,729
Thank God I didn't add
any more roses.

160
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,863
[all laugh]

161
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,732
Her look
may be similar to mine,

162
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,434
but, honey,
there's a big difference.

163
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,770
Mine is couture
and hers is just hot glue.

164
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,139
I saw you on "Botched."

165
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,408
- Yeah, girl.
- Yes, yes, you did.

166
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,110
I just saw a monster.
I said, that's my sister.

167
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,913
Ooh! No!

168
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:23,450
Girl, Gia's
gonna let everybody have it.

169
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,652
She is shady.
She's not the same person.

170
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:26,653
She's worse.

172
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:39,032
Oh...

173
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,500
The crybaby's back.

174
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,002

175
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,537
I'm Farrah Moan
from Season 9,

176
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,641
and I'm here to moan and groan
my way to the top, honey.

177
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,442
Oh.

178
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,578
- Farrah Moan.
- I like the peek-a-boobs.

179
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,513
Are you feeling lucky?
On Season 9,

180
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,616
I felt prematurely cast
only because I was so young.

181
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,219
No. I don't want
to do this.

182
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,687
She whines
like a six-year-old.

183
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:01,755
She knows she's a cute girl,

184
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,123
but there's nothing more
than that yet.

185
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,357
Oh.

186
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,660
I think a lot of people
still see me

187
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,664
as this scared, whiney,
little 22-year-old girl,

188
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,198
But I just want to show people

189
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,669
that I am now
a ferocious, fierce

190
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,804
25-year-old. [laughs]

191
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,606
Oh, my God, it's
Christina Aguilera, girl.

192
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,074
Girl. [laughs]

193
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,644
Farrah Moan is one of the most
stunning queens I've ever seen.

194
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,447
She has more Instagram followers
than a lot of these bitches do.

195
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,216
Aah! Oh, my God,
y'all look so good.

196
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,885
Miss Farrah is gorgeous.

197
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,186
Let's tell facts.

198
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,323
But, America,
if you gonna have your ass out,

199
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,826
it's supposed to look like J-Lo,
not like Mr. Rogers.

200
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,562
I see that they went
straight from 8 to 6,

201
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,630
so we're skipping 7.

202
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,597
Let's all praise the Lord
for that.

203
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,733
- Pages.
- Oh.

204
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,739
I am Jasmine Masters
and I have something to say.

205
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,107
Oh!

206
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,143
I am back for "All Stars 4,"
you junky whores!

207
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,546
For those of you
who don't remember me,

208
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,147
I was on Season 7.

209
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:05,218
Jasmine Masters, your
personality is off the hook.

210
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,020
Where did you get
a loaf of bread?

211
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,289
[all laugh]

212
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,890
Watch out, sisters. Oh.

213
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,992
- Head cheerleader.
- Head--head cheerleader.

214
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,296
I've never seen a car crash
like this before.

215
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,797
I don't want to hear
any goddamn excuses?

216
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,899
Be prepared!

217
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,102
- Aah!
- Aah!

218
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,937
- Oh, my God!
- How you been?

219
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,239
There's a lot of queens,
a lot of fans out there

220
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,041
who don't believe
that I'm a great drag queen.

221
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,809
But since I've been on the show,

222
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,678
I became the mean queen,

223
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,581
and I'm always in
somebody's video or clip.

224
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,782
You know, I don't understand

225
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,050
why people's breath
be motherfucker's stink

226
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,385
and they don't taste it.

227
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,254
Because when you go... [chomp]
you don't taste that?

228
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,991
The mean queen is back
to snatch the crown.

229
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,092
Oh, look at you,
You're still beautiful.

230
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,560
You tall bitch,
get out of my face.

231
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,296
I'm glad to see
Jasmine Masters back

232
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,199
because she did so poorly
on her season.

233
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,902
But that bitch fucking
dug herself out of a grave

234
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,471
with those Vines
and Instagram videos,

235
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,906
and the bitch is so funny.

236
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,175
- So you were Season 7.
- Yes.

237
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,410
That's the season
you wanted to skip.

238
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,911
- Oh, really?
- Well, what I--

239
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,247
But if anybody,
at least we got Jasmine.

240
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,582
- You know what I mean?
- What is there from Season 7

241
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,352
that we were not
looking forward to seeing?

242
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:15,555
Season 7 was a pretty boring
fucking season,

243
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,223
and Season 9,
y'all were next on the list.

244
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,060
Wait a minute.
No. No, bitch.

245
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,128
I call shade, bitch.

246
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,097
Everyone thinks
that their season

247
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,165
was the best of the best,

248
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,667
but Monet
ain't got half the talent

249
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,503
that the girls
from Season 9 have, honey.

250
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,806
Season 9 is about to slay.

251
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,874
Season 9 was just fine, okay?

252
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,844
Fan favorite is here.

253
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,145
Oh, shit.

254
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,880
- Ha!
- No.

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,083
Brbrbrbrbr.
I'm back.

256
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,351
It's you, Valentina.

257
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,154
I'm glamour, high fashion,

258
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,656
a Latin-American diva.

259
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:53,493
And this is the Valentina
confessional look 2.0.

260
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,727
Shush.

261
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,098
We have a beautiful
designer beret by Dior,

262
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,899
and look at this manicure.

263
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,534
I'm ready for my closeup.

264
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,636
- Aw...
- Aw...

265
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,205
Linda Evangelista.
I like it.

266
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:08,041
Stop. Take that thing
off of your mouth.

267
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,476
I'd like to keep it on,
please.

268
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,078
It's a lip sync. What part
of that do you not understand?

269
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,013
After my elimination
on Season 9,

270
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,150
I felt the weight
of being a failure.

271
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,853
But eventually
I took it as motivation.

272
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:22,288
And since my season,

273
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,857
I've had the opportunities

274
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,692
of working with
a man from "Vogue,"

275
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,293
"Vogue Mexico."

276
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,462
And I don't really intend
on being known forever

277
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,165
as the person that
doesn't know how to lip sync.

278
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,233
Let's do a conga line.

279
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,767
♪ Dee dee dee dee dee da ♪

280
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,603
 ♪ Dee dee dee dee dee da ♪

281
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,538
I'm surprised you know
the words to that song.

282
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,273
- Oh!
- Well, girl, whatever.

283
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,943
I feel good.

284
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,512
We were a close-knit season,

285
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,013
despite the reunion.

286
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,448
[all laugh]

287
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,183
We were such close friends,

288
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,453
and you have not spoken to me
in almost five months.

289
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,587
Text me, call me.
Let's talk about it.

290
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,856
I have texted you.
You ignore my texts.

291
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,758
I respect you and love you.

292
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,393
You don't love me.

293
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:04,330
I know that everybody wants
the fun little telenovela,

294
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,266
"Valentina vs. Farrah,

295
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,334
You Don't Love Me" fantasy.

296
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,171
However, she's apologized,
I've apologized,

297
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,339
and I feel like
we're on the route

298
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,041
to a better relationship.

299
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,509
Do you even have
her phone number?

300
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,710
Yeah.

301
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,245
She's texted me back now.

302
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,014
[laughs]

303
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,450
In the eyes of some,
I am Miss Congeniality.

304
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,321
And in the eyes of other people,
I'm a snake.

305
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,890
But I just know I'm both

306
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,225
because I know
I can be really nice,

307
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,360
but I've always loved
the villain.

308
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,663
[evil laugh]

309
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,664
So wait, you guys.

310
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,866
Do you think
this is all of the cast?

311
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:40,867
No, there's more girls.

312
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,101
How many trophies is it?

313
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,636
Eight is too little.

314
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,471
There's no way there's
just eight of us girls.

315
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,006
[alarm]
Uh-oh.

316
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,809
You bullshitting, you
bullshitting, you bullshitting.

317
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,411
Ooh, girl.

318
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,480
She done already
done had herses.

319
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,349
- Aw...
- Come on, bitch.

320
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,952
Hey, hennies.

321
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,188
The moment
you strutted through that door

322
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,224
your fate changed forever.

323
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,126
You're no longer mere mortals.

324
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,429
You're super queens,

325
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,997
and if you can harness the power

326
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,534
of your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve and talent,

327
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,637
you'll rule
the Drag Race Hall of Fame

328
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,039
from here to eternity.

329
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,375
Now, who the fuck is Heather?

330
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,844
[all laugh]

331
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,814
Hello, hello, hello.

332
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:31,484
[cheers and laughter]

333
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,486
Hey, super queens, welcome back.

334
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,788
- Hey!
- Hey!

335
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,690
Now, out of all the queens
in the world,

336
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,093
I've invited the eight of you
to return.

337
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,394
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

338
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:45,198
Because each of you possess
a unique super power

339
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,267
that puts you
in a league of your own.

340
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,334
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,970
All Star rules
are in full effect.

342
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,272
Each week, the top two queens

343
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,575
will lip sync for their legacy,

344
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:59,946
and the winner will receive
a $10,000 tip.

345
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,715
- Whoo!
- $10,000, yeah!

346
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,485
Plus, the power to eliminate

347
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,921
one of her fellow All Stars.

348
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,823
Now, this is your chance
to prove

349
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:15,361
that you can compete
with the best of the best.

350
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,296
And at the end of the day,

351
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,500
if you slay,
you'll earn your way

352
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,069
into the Drag Race Hall of Fame

353

[cheering]

355
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,344
Now, there may be a twist.

356
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,046
Of course.

357
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,647
- Or two.
- Oh!

358
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,350
So without further ado,

359
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,285
please welcome Team...

360
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,288
Latrila.

361
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,357
Oh!

362
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,559
Oh! Oh! Oh!

363
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,263
[cheering]

364
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:53,666
Latrila is back in the house.

The bitches
are handcuffed together,

366
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,639
and I'm like, not teams,
not teams, not teams.

367
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,274
We all saw how "All Stars" 1
turned out.

368
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:03,543
Everyone competed in teams,

369
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,478
and if this is teams again,
I'm done.

370
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,714
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

371
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:08,981
I know I'm stunning,

372
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,818
but just 'cause I'm fabulous

373
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,386
don't mean I'm gonna be paired
with somebody fabulous.

374
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,687
Twist, honey.

375
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,522
Why y'all gagging so?

376
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,124
I still don't get
what's going on.

377
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,493
Me, neither. Oh.

Team Latrila.

391
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,460

Aah! Everybody screaming?
I know you're screaming. Stop.

396
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,273
I'm the large, in charge,

397
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:12,178
chunky and funky
Latrice motherfucking Royale.

398
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:13,479
Eat it.

399
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,414
Look at Manila-nila-nila.

400
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,183
I'm Manila Luzon.

401
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,384
I'm the runnerup from Season 3,

402
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,754
and something-up
from "All Stars" 1.

403
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,922
On your own,

404
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,192
none of you
were able to reach the top.

405
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,027
So this time around,

406
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,030
you'll be competing
as teams of two.

407
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,331
- [laughs]
- Shit.

408
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,867
When we did "All Stars" 1
in teams,

409
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:38,004
it was the gagger
because we weren't expecting

410
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,007
to have to work with someone
the entire season.

411
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,775
Latrila.

412
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,911
This has been like
the best pairing in the world

413
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,079
because like you always know
how to take it

414
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,017
that extra step beyond,
and I love that.

415
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,287
Manila and Latrice,
sashay away.

416
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,990
This time
is gonna be different.

417
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,060
Now, ladies,
Latrice and Manila

418
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,865
competed as a team
in the first "All Stars."

419
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,802
But I invited them back
to compete as individuals.

420
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,504
[cheering]

421
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,273
[laughter and applause]

422
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,309
- [sighs]
- Whoo, girls!

423
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,012
I am very relieved
that it's not a team situation.

424
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,415
But at the same time,
having Latrice and Manila here,

425
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,217
things literally just got
three times harder.

426
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:27,453
They are two of the most
fierce competitors

427
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,688
in "Drag Race" history.

428
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,256
Game on.

429
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,426
Now that all 10 All Stars
have arrived,

430
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,428
I'd like to celebrate.

431
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,963
- Ooh.
- Yay!

432
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,332
Oh, Pit Crew.

433
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,434
[cheering]

434
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,435
Oh, yes!

435
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,371
And the bulge is real. Yes.

436
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,308
In the great tradition
of "Paris Is Burning," darling,

437
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,611
the library
is about to be opened.

438
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,679
Because reading is what?

439
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,114
[all] Fundamental.

440
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,317
That's right,
especially with fabulous frames

441
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,653
from l.a. Eyeworks.

442
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,723
All right, first up,
Monet X Change.

443
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:07,126
Ooh. RuPaul,
but I'm Miss Congeniality.

444
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,028
I could never...

445
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,264
[deep voice] Here we go, bitch.
[all laugh]

446
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,431
Tiffany The Tuck,

447
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,067
you've had so much plastic
in you,

448
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,302
you won't be buried in a coffin.

449
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,904
You'll probably be buried
in a recycling bin.

450
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,274
[all laugh]

451
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,975
Manila Luzon.

452
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,110
Emphasis on lose.

453
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,778
- Oh...
- Twice.

454
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,647
[all laugh]

455
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,982
Monet X Change.

456
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,384
The sponge queen.

457
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,885
Yes.

458
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,453
Too bad
you couldn't soak up a win.

459
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,621
[laughs]

460
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,923
Oh!

461
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:39,425
Ru, thank you so much
for bringing someone here

462
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,227
that's going to make me
look smart.

463
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,228
What's up, Farrah Moan?

464
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,163
[all laugh]

465
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,331
Farrah Moan is so dumb,

466
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,266
she thought Valentina
was her best friend.

467
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,635
Ooh!

468
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,237
Oh, my God.

469
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,373
Naomi Smalls,
legs you are known for.

470
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,008
However, you should
be known for toes,

471
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:56,943
'cause they're always
hanging out.

472
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,110
Oh!

473
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,745
Just like you
in that nineties video, Ru,

474
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,980
you know, when you
were in the bodega?

475
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,981
Oh!

476
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,316
Security.

477
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,750
[all laugh]

478
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,053
Monet X Change.

479
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,221
Now I know why
you have your name.

480
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,623
You look so cheap,
it looks like

481
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,359
you've broken your piggy bank
for some change.

482
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,594
[laughs]

483
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,128
For workshopping,
good to know.

484
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,030
Trinity Taylor.

485
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,866
When is the second
nose job planned?

486
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,235
I think you could still cut
a little bit more of her off.

487
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,471
You should tell that
to your ass.

488
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,441
[all laugh]

489
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,642
[laughs]

490
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,844
G-G-G-Gia Gunn.

491
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,680
I guess you can
buy a Gunn at Walmart.

492
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,282
[all laugh]

493
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,884
Jasmine Masters,
you know what--oh!

494
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,319
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

495
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,154
I'm sorry. I was just
looking for her talent.

496
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,890
[all laugh]

497
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,561
Monique Heart,
you brag so much

498
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,497
about how you make
your own clothes,

499
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,533
but your dresses are so ugly,
they hang themselves.

500
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,801
[all laugh]

501
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,670
Tell.

502
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,041
Manila Luzon, I loved you
so much on your season.

503
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,076
But who's a booger now,
bitch?

504
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,645
[all laugh]

505
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,880
It's me, guys.

506
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,683
All right, all right,
you janky whores.

507
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:13,686
Latrice Royale.

508
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,354
You are my sister, bitch.

509
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,256
I liked it better
when you was my bodyguard.

510
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,159
[all laugh]

511
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,094
- And Ru.
- Uh-huh?

512
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,230
Thank you
for having me back, bitch.

513
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,698
I want my suit back.

514
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,299
[all laugh]

515
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:32,038
Trinity The Tuck, was that
legal or illegal silicone,

516
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,673
and whose kitchen table
did you get done on?

517
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,841
I'll give you
my doctor's number.

518
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,676
I don't wanna die.
Thank you.

519
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,945
[all laugh]

520
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,048
Miss Farrah Moan.

521
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,650
Sweets, if I was as untalented

522
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,586
and unoriginal as you are,

523
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,555
I too would invest
everything I had

524
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,858
in looking like somebody
more famous than I.

525
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,062
Okay.

526
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:59,398
Naomi Smalls,
legs, legs, legs.

527
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,000
Could we get
a side of brains with that?

528
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,134
[all laugh]

529
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:06,205
Valentina, take that thing
off your face.

530
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,141
Oh. It is your face.

531
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,343
[all laugh]

532
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,378
Your other one.

533
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,547
Oh! Damn.

534
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,682
[all laugh]

535
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,817
Jasmine, say it's true.

536
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,885
You got a key
to my house, bitch.

537
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,787
Girl, welcome to a season

538
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,355
that somebody
will give a shit about.

539
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,757
[all laugh]

540
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,559
That's how it's done, ladies.

541
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,760
That's how it's done.

542
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,296
Monet X Change,
I'm sure you get compared

543
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,998
to Bob the Drag Queen
all the time.

544
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,967
And in this competition,
that's a good thing,

545
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,170
because at least you know
you'll beat Naomi Smalls.

546
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,972
Oh-ho-ho. [laughs]

547
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,007
A two-for-one read.

548
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,810
Monique Heart,
do you remove your makeup

549
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,479
with flushable toilet wipes?

550
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,380
Because you're an ass
and your makeup is shit.

551
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,684
[all laugh]

552
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,018
All right now.

553
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,655
The library is closed
officially.

554
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,959
And, ooh, child,
I'm gonna need some aloe

555
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,294
for all them burns.

556
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,164
But the winner of today's
mini challenge is...

557
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,934
Latrice Royale.

558
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,203
[laughter and applause]

559
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,938
Con-drag-ulations.

560
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,576
You've won a $2,500 gift card
from l.a. Eyeworks.

561
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,779
I'm the ultimate reader,
bitch.

562
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,213
I won it on my season,

563
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,715
and I won it here.

564
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,217
So if anybody had a doubt

565
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,119
of why I am back,

566
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,355
here's your answer.

567
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,290
And I'll be posting
more of your reads

568
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,926
at RuPaulsDragRace.com.

569
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,661
#AllStars4.

570
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,631
Ladies, since appearing
on "Drag Race,"

571
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,766
you've served
as ambassadors of drag

572
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,635
around the world.

573
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,870
Now it's time to see

574
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,942
how your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve and talent has grown.

575
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,277
For this week's maxi challenge,

576
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:55,915
you'll be headlining an All Star
Spangled Variety Show.

577
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:58,150
[cheering]

578
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,953
And you'll be showcasing
your best talent

579
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,556
to entertain a patriotic mix

580
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:08,327
of LGBTQ veterans
and active service people.

581
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,962
- Oh.
- Ooh.

582
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,231
Maybe I'll find
my straight military husband.

583
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,832
Except for it's LGBTQ.

584
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,234
Oh.

585
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,536
That was the key word.

586
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,773
So my fellow drag Americans,

587
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:25,911
start your engines
and may the best All Star win.

588
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,680
- Whoo!
- Ow!

589
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,914
- Oh!
- Whoo!

590
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:29,949
Claim!

591
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,050
Bitch, my nails
is there already.

592
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,184
My nails is on the counter.

593
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,119
I lost a nail.

594
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,222
It's okay, it's okay.

595
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,457
That's not the only thing
you're gonna lose.

596
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,125
[laughs] Oh, my God.

597
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,027
Heave!

598
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,429
Latrice and Manila.

599
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,496
That's the gag of the season.

600
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,865
It really is.

601
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,967
It's so wild

602
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,502
being on the same season
with legends,

603
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,905
but I can't let that admiration

604
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,107
get in the way
of my performance.

605
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:58,010
Because I know I can outperform
these bitches

606
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,246
who've been at this shit
since before I was born.

607
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,480
[laughs]

608
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,249
It's so nuts to be here
on the same season as you.

609
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,416
You are a legend.

610
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,018
- Yeah, girl.
- Thank you. That's so cool.

611
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:09,755
I mean, I remember
when I first met Lady Bunny

612
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,156
when I first moved
to New York City.

613
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,558
You're my Lady Bunny.

614
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,995
[all laugh]

615
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,096
Oh, my gosh.

616
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,699
Lady Bunny is old
as a dinosaur, okay?

617
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,135
Uh, thank you, I guess.

618
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,704
That's okay.
I have longevity, okay, girl?

619
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,805
Read between the lines.

620
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,773
We'll talk to you
in a couple years

621
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,041
and see where you at.

622
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,209
Read between the lines
on your forehead, darling.

623
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,711
[all laugh]

624
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,913
You know what?

625
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,649
You are the reason why
I wear highlight now.

626
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,217
- That should be your talent.
- It is.

627
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,954
Oh, my God. That's great.

628
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,089
I wanna show something
that's my brand,

629
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,225
so I've put together

630
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,560
a tucking tutorial.

631
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,029
[laughs]

632
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,731
I want to show you
that I can be funny

633
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,467
and still teach you
how to tuck.

634
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,736
That's never been done
on the show.

635
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,039
You do have to take risks
if you want to win.

636
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,209
No. Well, just the song,

637
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,444
'cause it's
"Brown Cow Stunning."

638
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,512
This is for something else.

639
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,247
For my performance,

640
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,750
I decided to debut my song
"Brown Cow Stunning,"

641
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,752
and sing live
because last time

642
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,055
I went home right before
the singing challenge.

643
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,257
So this time, oh, honey.

644
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:21,160
trust I'm gonna give you
the ooh-ah-ah sensation.

645
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,361
Trust.

646
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,963
[clicks tongue]
♪ La vaca, moo ♪

647
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,566
- What does it mean?
 - La vaca means the cow.

648
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,967
♪ Moo, the cow, moo ♪

649
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,602
Aah, yes!

650
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,872
Brown cow stunning.

651
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:37,943
Uh, I don't know how stunning
it's really gonna be.

652
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,378
I'm excited to see
what we're all doing.

653
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,713
I know.

654
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,325
We're gonna find out.
Hopefully it's not comedy.

655
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,960
I doubt that.

656
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,662
I'm uncertain about how I feel

657
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,098
with Farrah here
in the competition.

658
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,733
I'm a little bit worried for her

659
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,068
because I don't really think
that she's an All Star.

660
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,972
I don't think that she
is anything more past Instagram,

661
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,441
and this is a place
for legends, okay?

662
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,382
Okay!

663
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:17,583
Here we go, girls.

664
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,017
Here we are!

665
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,487
Today we're getting ready
for our first maxi challenge,

666
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,790
an All Star
Spangled Variety Show.

667
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,526
All right, y'all.

668
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,328
Yes, get into the outfits.

669
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,462
Yes!

670
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,564
- Model.
- Always being a diva.

671
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,199
[all laugh]

672
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,501
[laughs]

673
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,069
Latrice!

674
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,838
You guys are interrupting
my outfit moment.

675
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,775
- Are you excited, bitch?
- I am!

676
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,011
I'm nervous. Very excited,
but nervous, girl.

677
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,012
What are you
most nervous about?

678
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:47,946
I don't know.

679
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,248
What if the judges don't think

680
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,582
that what you think
is your talent is your talent?

681
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,750
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

682
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,386
"All Stars"
is a very different game.

683
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,454
The stakes are higher.

684
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,122
The chances
that you can go home

685
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,191
for a tiny fumble
are greater.

686
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,427
I'm trying to put these on
so I don't slip and fall, girl.

687
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,061
You know
that is the kiss of death.

688
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,998
Like you're done.
Game over. Career's ended.

689
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,299
Goodbye.

690
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,169
Honey, "Brown Cow Stunning"
is gonna get debuted.

691
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,937
- Yes.
- I'm so excited.

692
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,839
- Good for you.
- I am gonna do standup.

693
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,040
Yes?

694
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,542
Yeah. It's just like,
bitch, gimme the mic.

695
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,744
I'm gonna talk some shit.
We gonna have a good time.

696
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,146
I have always been told,
from very young,

697
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,347
"Ha ha, you're so funny."

698
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,949
Just saying
whatever I need to say.

699
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,017
But I've just been myself.

700
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,685
The women love me,
the men love me,

701
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,887
the kids love me,
the cats, the dogs, the mice.

702
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,556
Everybody love me, so...

703
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,858
Guess what?
Up in the ring, bitch.

704
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:34,593
Did you write or are you
just gonna go off the cuff?

705
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,795
I'm just gonna go off of it.

706
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,364
I figure
if I write something down...

707
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,732
- Uh-huh.
- I will forget it,

708
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:41,733
'cause I'm trying
to stay here.

709

I'm a little bit worried
about yours

738
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,461
'cause I don't think tucking
is a talent.

739
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,431

740
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,400
Okay, but just because
you're dressing up in kabuki

741
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,569
doesn't mean
you're talented, either.

742

Well, honey, I'm
actually doing something

743
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:52,671
that I've studied for 15 years.

744
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,307

and tucking

745
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,375

00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,576

really quick.

Baby, those are some balls
getting pushed out.

749
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,083
The important thing is
I'm not worried,

750
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,952
so you'll see
when I'm out there.

751
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,020
I sure will.

I don't remember her
ever being this shady.

754
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,960
I don't know if she's got
something up her sleeve

755
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,162

tucking is not a talent.

00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:57,935
And when you come out,

1067
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,171
I would have liked
a bigger bang.

1068
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,272
Okay.

1069
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,342
I kind of enjoyed
the late reveal.

1070
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,776
It was unpredictable.

1071
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,578
I got it and I liked it.

1072
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,014
You're wearing an outfit now
that doesn't require a tuck.

1073
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,016
Have you maintained the tuck?

1074
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,018
Oh, no, girl.
She's still there.

1075
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,087
- Oh.
- Oh, wow, okay.

1076
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,788
Is that uncomfortable,
darling?

1077
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,023
If you only knew.

1078
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:21,025
[all laugh]

1079
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,026
God bless you all.

1080
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:24,095
Up next, Naomi Smalls.

1081
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:29,700
The world is starved for fun,
and you gave it to us.

1082
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,237
I found the whole thing
very beautiful to watch.

1083
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,439
But beautiful can get kind of
boring after a while.

1084
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:40,178
The best part about this
wasn't how gorgeous you looked.

1085
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,013
It was the weird part

1086
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,548
when you popped that wig off

1087
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:45,483
and you had like
my Uncle Lenny's hair.

1088
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,151
[all laugh]

1089
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:51,222
That intersection where drag
and glamour meets comedy,

1090
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,823
for me, that's great drag.

1091
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:56,594
Up next, Monet X Change.

1092
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:58,362
- Soak it up.
- Hi, Michelle.

1093
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,797
Glad to see
you're on the sponge.

1094
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,899
- The same.
- No pregnancies here.

1095
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,568
[laughs]

1096
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:05,836
You had your own voice
in the beginning of that song.

1097
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,639
- Yeah. ♪ Undercover ♪
- That's interesting.

1098
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,308
Yeah, it wasn't
a good vocal day.

1099
00:45:10,308 --> 00:45:12,243
Mm.

1100
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:13,611
That sponge thing,
yes, is part of your brand,

1101
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:14,912
something we know you for.

1102
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,781
All designers have their
kind of their bread and butter

1103
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,082
and what they're known for.

1104
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,451
But then each season,
they try to take it forward.

1105
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:21,519
We've seen it before.

1106
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,520
- This is "All Stars."
- Yeah.

1107
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,055
So I'm going to push

1108
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,524
for you to be on par
with everybody else.

1109
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:27,558
Yeah.

1110
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,493
Up next Farrah Moan.

1111
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,828
Hi.

1112
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,497
This look tonight
is delicious.

1113
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,333
It is like sparkly rock candy.

1114
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,667
I want to come over there

1115
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,670
and lick everything--
well, on your clothes.

1116
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,072
[all laugh]

1117
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,207
Everything
just looks gorgeous.

1118
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,243
So feel good about that,

1119
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:49,080
because I know
you were so nervous.

1120
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,749
It just didn't really happen
how I had dreamed of it.

1121
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,618
Like I just wanted everything
to be perfect,

1122
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:56,387
and it just...it just wasn't.

1123
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:02,493
You have everything it takes
to win this whole thing,

1124
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,630
but not if you can't
summon the confidence.

1125
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,897
Yes.

1126
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:09,100
Leave that nervous shit home.
It's boring.

1127
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,701
Can I get an amen up in here?

1128
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,637
- Yes.
- Yes.

1129
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:18,209
Up next, Jasmine Masters
in that pantsuit.

1130
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,577
Hi.

1131
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:21,012
Oh, my goodness.

1132
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,947
Very Liza Minnelli.

1133
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,348
[all laugh]

1134
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,150
It was a smart choice
to do comedy for you,

1135
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,852
because you are very funny.

1136
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:30,121
Those jokes just kind of
weren't landing.

1137
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,889
Did you prepare that at all?

1138
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,357
Well, I knew
what I was going to say

1139
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,059
because I went off
my bad breath video.

1140
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:36,794
But was it planned
when you did the video?

1141
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,629
- No. No.
- No.

1142
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,897
I know exactly what happened
with you tonight.

1143
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,632
I'm a funny person, too, right,

1144
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,367
and I think I'm funniest
when I'm off the cuff.

1145
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,635
That's why that video went viral

1146
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,004
because it was hilarious
and it was so authentic.

1147
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:50,241
But doing standup
is a different thing.

1148
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,043
- Mm-hmm.
- It's gotta be flawless,

1149
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,878
because one little stumble
and you lose us.

1150
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:59,717
Now, based on
the judges' critiques,

1151
00:46:59,717 --> 00:47:01,619
I've made some decisions.

1152
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,822
Trinity The Tuck.

1153
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,191
Monique Heart.

1154
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:11,762
You're the top two All Stars
of the week.

1155
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:15,366
[applause]

1156
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,934
- Thank you.
- Con-drag-ulations.

1157
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,703
 - Thank you.
 - Yes, children, yes.

1158
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:22,540
You've each won
a seven night's stay for two

1159
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,810
at the Sand Castle
on the Beach Hotel

1160
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:28,412
in St. Croix,
U.S. Virgin Islands.

1161
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,980
Yeah!

1162
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,384
Naomi Smalls,

1163
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:35,553
Monet X Change,

1164
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:36,787
you are both safe.

1165
00:47:39,824 --> 00:47:43,694
That means Farrah Moan
and Jasmine Masters,

1166
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,664
you are in the bottom two.

1167
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:51,969
I came here with such
high expectations for myself,

1168
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,638
and it's hard for me
not to feel like

1169
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:57,174
I just don't have it in me
or something.

1170
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:01,312
How can you go from being so
confident and proud of yourself

1171
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,647
to feeling so small?

1172
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:08,452
Monique and Trinity,
each of you needs to decide

1173
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:12,356
which of the bottom two
you will eliminate

1174
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:14,625
if you win the lip sync.

1175
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,896
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

1176
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,800
the judges and I will be
tooting our own horns.

1177
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,237
You may leave the stage.

1178
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,109
- Oh, girl.
- I'm getting a drink.

1179
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,178
It feels great
to be in the top two.

1180
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,646
This shows right out the gate

1181
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,449
who is competition
and who is not.

1182
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,684
Girl, this is
the first elimination.

1183
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,319
- I know.
- I want to win,

1184
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,456
but then again, like, winning,

1185
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:47,525
you have to send someone home.

1186
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,928
Someone's dreams are
about to be crushed forever.

1187
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,063
- Not forever, honey.
- No.

1188
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,166
We're on "All Stars"
because we're All Stars.

1189
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,901
- Yeah.
- That's never going to go away.

1190
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:59,904
The real T, you can say
we're all All Stars,

1191
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,572
but when you are going home,
packing up your stuff,

1192
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,107
it doesn't feel like that,
you know what I mean?

1193
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,109
It feels like shit.

1194
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,877
How do you feel, Jasmine?

1195
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,679
You can't say
that I wasn't funny.

1196
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,482
You may not like
what I was saying,

1197
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:14,218
but you cannot say
I wasn't funny.

1198
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,487
Jasmine does not get it
at all.

1199
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:20,891
She refuses to take any
responsibility for her faults

1200
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,393
and fucking up her talent.

1201
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:26,063
I was so excited
about this number.

1202
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,065
Like, I've literally dreamt
of this number

1203
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,466
ever since I started doing drag.

1204
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,901
Maybe one day
I'll be able to afford

1205
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,370
to be as sparkly and beautiful
as I've always dreamed of.

1206
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,607
I'm going to cry again.

1207
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:39,510
This crying,
let me get her lipstick,

1208
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,879
'cause I'm not doing it.

1209
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:44,315
You a grown-ass man.

1210
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,284
Girl, I'll talk to you
over there, honey.

1211
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,090
I love you,
but your crying annoys me.

1212
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:57,294
If you continue on, sis, like
you gotta be, like, do or die.

1213
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,562
Like in that fall,

1214
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,664
I would have loved
if you would have just posed.

1215
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:07,037
I get it.
We all have those moments.

1216
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,907
Beyonce. We saw the video.

1217
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:13,978
Ring the alarm, bla-ka-ka-ka,
she fell down them stairs.

1218
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,679
But you get up.
You hold it.

1219
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,415
It's not that you fell.
It's how you fell.

1220
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,352
All I want
is to just be the best.

1221
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:26,123
And I want
to fucking just...do it.

1222
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,825
That's what I want.
That right there,

1223
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:29,693
I would like to see her
more often.

1224
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,463
Sis, if you are here...

1225
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:33,797
Because if you fuck up again,

1226
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:34,899
I'm going to send you home
personally.

1227
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,201
I'm telling you that
to your face.

1228
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,905
Why should you stay
and not your counterpart?

1229
00:50:40,905 --> 00:50:42,640
She breaks down too much.

1230
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,208
Every little thing go wrong,

1231
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,609
she just gonna
keep breaking down

1232
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,244
and breaking down
and breaking down.

1233
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,445
- Right, okay.
- And this is "All Stars."

1234
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,881
I want to eliminate
the weakest link,

1235
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,484
because if I'm going
to be the best,

1236
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,152
- I want to beat the best.
- Beat the best.

1237
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,620
Well, if you want
competition, bitch,

1238
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:59,156
I'm gonna bring it to
your ass, though. [laughs]

1239
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:02,059
If you were in their position,
who would you send home?

1240
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,627
- Ooh.
- Oh.

1241
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,298
I'm not as confident
in Farrah's skills.

1242
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:10,701
Honestly, girls like her,
to me, they're not showgirls.

1243
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:12,503
They look good on Instagram,

1244
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,940
and they hope that the clothes
and the jewels and the--

1245
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,074
Make up for talent.

1246
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,342
But it doesn't.

1247
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:20,444
And tonight proved that.

1248
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,980
I'm just disappointed
that Jasmine didn't even think

1249
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,215
to like write down an outline.

1250
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,885
At least Farrah Moan, she had
a fully realized concept.

1251
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,354
I mean, we could tell some
preparation went into it.

1252
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:31,855
Right.

1253
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:34,458
My mind is not made up.

1254
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,993
Why should you stay?

1255
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:40,064
I have come to "All Stars" 4
with something to prove.

1256
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:43,033
If you choose me to stay,
I'm going to fucking fight,

1257
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,002
because I never once felt
like I could be a winner,

1258
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:47,271
and like for the first time
in my life,

1259
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,573
I really feel like
I could win something.

1260
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:50,975
Ugh.

1261
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:56,280
If you stay or you go,
you've got to stop crying.

1262
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,049
You've got to pull it together.

1263
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,851
Sis, I think
you are stupid funny.

1264
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,086
Right.

1265
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,421
And I think that
if you just had a skeleton,

1266
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,524
it would have went by
just a lot smoother.

1267
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,793
Recently, within
the past couple of years,

1268
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,362
I've been doing
the Laugh Factory.

1269
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,530
I have got nothing
but great reviews.

1270
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,733
I can go down a list,
oh, you know, this happened,

1271
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,501
this happened, this happened,
that happened.

1272
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,802
But it's not about that.

1273
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,405
If I stay, I stay.
If I go, I go.

1274
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,107
There's no love lost,
because it's a game.

1275
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,641
Things happen,
you know what I mean?

1276
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,244
You know how the girls
don't want to beg.

1277
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:28,946
But there's a difference
between like begging

1278
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:31,949
and saying if you keep me,

1279
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:34,551
trust and believe
you won't see me here again.

1280
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:36,620
Where's that extra fight, girl?

1281
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,889
If you keep me, you keep me,
then we gonna ride it out.

1282
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:40,658
If you don't,
we still gonna ride it out.

1283
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,026
Right. I can't with her.

1284
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,228
Like if you can't fight
for yourself,

1285
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,997
there's a whole lot
of other girls who will.

1286
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,167
Now that I have the power,
can you send both?

1287
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,635
I don't know.

1288
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,204
So...yeah.

1289
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:57,374
[playing a Sousa march]

1290
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,890
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

1291
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,925
Silence.

1292
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,995
Bring back my All Stars.

1293
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:27,171
I'm coming from an excitement
that I'm in Top Two

1294
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:30,107
to, oh, shit.

1295
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:33,110
I have to send
one of these girls home.

1296
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:39,183
And I wasn't expecting
the emotional side of this

1297
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,618
to be as hard as it is.

1298
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,555
Feelings are not fact.

1299
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:49,526
We cannot let the way we feel
determine how we act.

1300
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:53,030
They know I'm not malicious,
whatever, da-da-da-da.

1301
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,699
I'm not really worried
about them.

1302
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,802
I'm here to take the crown.

1303
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,170
Period.

1304
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,610
Welcome back, ladies.

1305
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,247
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

1306
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,250
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

1307
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,021
win $10,000,
and earn the power

1308
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,758
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

and it's a great start.

You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

Monique, you are safe.

1358
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:31,148
And I think you should invest
in some duct tape.

1359
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:33,450
Maybe Trinity
can give you some of hers.

1360
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,454
Because you know the other girls
duct tape their heads.

1361
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,488
Yes, ma'am.

1362
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:39,656
Or a stapler.

1363
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,025
Stapler. [laughs]

1364
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:43,660
All right, you may join
the other girls.

1365
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,661

Trinity, with great power
comes great responsibility.

00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:08,452
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

1370
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:11,521
You picked a great song
for the first episode,

1371
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,256
'cause this is very emotional.

1372
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:17,394
Unfortunately, I have
two friends that are here,

1373
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,997
and I'm trying to give
the fairest decision

1374
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,866
that I can make at this time.

1375
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:27,471
And, um, the person
I've decided to go with...

1376
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:31,108
is Jasmine.

1377
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,116
It's okay.
You're going to be good.

1378
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:42,419
Just do what you do
and prove all your haters wrong,

1379
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:43,987
'cause you have a lot of talent.

1380
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:48,625
Jasmine, as it is written,
so it shall be done.

1381
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:53,330
You are and will always be
an All Star.

1382
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,766
Yes! [laughs]

1383
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:57,934
Sashay away.

1384
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,503
Thank you.

1385
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:00,737
I still love you, sis.

1386
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,506
- I love you.
- I love you.

1387
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:05,142
- Bye, girls.
- Love you.

1388
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,343
I love you, too.

1389
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:07,677
[applause]

1390
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:10,914
I don't really believe

1391
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,716
I should have eliminated
for this one,

1392
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,618
because if they went
by mistakes,

1393
00:59:14,618 --> 00:59:18,755
I had nowhere near big
of mistakes as anybody else.

1394
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:22,492
I don't do the whole crying
situation and woe is me

1395
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,895
and all this and all that,
because I'm just not about that.

1396
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,497
But you have not seen
the last of me yet.

1398
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,269
Because I'm coming.
I am coming.

if you can't love yourself,

how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

I'm holding auditions
