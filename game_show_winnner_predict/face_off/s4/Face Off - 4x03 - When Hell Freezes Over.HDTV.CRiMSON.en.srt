00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:04,351
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:08,489
the artists headed
to Comic-Con

3
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:10,524
and brought
original superheroes to life.

4
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:12,893
Anthony's fiery creation
brought him to the top.

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:14,295
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:17,164
And Michael was sent home.

7
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:21,902
Now 12 artists remain.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,272
And tonight, they'll face
a demonic challenge.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,374
Welcome to Hell.

10
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:30,978
This is my kind of challenge.

11
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:33,614
And an unexpected twist
pushes them to the limit.

12
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:36,217
The note will dramatically
impact your designs.

13
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:38,118
- What?
- Oh, no.

14
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:40,020
Quit irritating me.

15
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:42,823
My partner
isn't pulling her weight.

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,861
The face sculpture
is very rough.

17
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:48,229
Those are beautiful pieces.

18
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:50,931
It punches you in the face
with how bad it sucks.

19
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,567
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

20
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:56,537
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

21
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:57,938
in New York and Paris,

22
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,908
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,

23
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,210
and $100,000.

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,816
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

25
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:11,652
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

26
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:47,877
Sync and corrections by n17t01

27
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,698
It's tough.
I really feel bad for Michael

28
00:01:57,765 --> 00:02:00,367
and honestly thought
that maybe he had more to offer.

29
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,936
I think we all just want
to beat Anthony at this point...

30
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:04,171
We want to see a new winner.

31
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,572
...than let Anthony win
another challenge.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
Anthony won the last challenge.

33
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:09,943
He's probably gonna be
my biggest competition here.

34
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,079
I would feel really good
about myself

35
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:15,305
if I could just beat Anthony
one time.

36
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,386
This one's for Michael!

37
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:22,356
Michael!

38
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,898
It is early morning.

39
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:32,766
Where we're going,
we have no idea.

40
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:34,401
All I know
is it seems like we're

41
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:37,304
in the middle of the desert.

42
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,508
It is hot.

43
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:43,877
There's these pitchforks
stabbed into the earth,

44
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:46,713
and then there's
signs hanging from them.

45
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,749
And I don't recognize
any of the names.

46
00:02:48,816 --> 00:02:49,950
They're, like, foreign.

47
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:52,786
I have no idea
what we're doing.

48
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:57,124
Welcome to Hell.

49
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:58,392
We brought you
all the way out here

50
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,160
in this horrible heat

51
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:02,429
to get you
in the right frame of mind

52
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,897
for your next challenge.

53
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,466
Beside me here
are several pitchforks,

54
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:09,136
each one with the name
of a demon

55
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:11,205
from a different culture
around the world.

56
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:12,372
Awesome.

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,941
So working in teams of two,

58
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,576
your spotlight challenge

59
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:18,445
is to bring one of these
horrific demons to life.

60
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:19,780
Oh, yes.

61
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:22,182
This is my kind of challenge.

62
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,884
Finally get to make
some cool monsters,

63
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:25,719
and I'm loving it.

64
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,888
Your teams have been
randomly selected.

65
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:31,091
- Team one, Kris and Eric Z.
- Nice.

66
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,760
Team two is Alam and Anthony.

67
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,195
- Yay.
- There you are.

68
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:36,496
We were all talking about,

69
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:37,664
"we can't let Anthony
win again."

70
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,566
But this one,
I'll let him win again.

71
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,903
Team three, House and Meagan.

72
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,805
Team four, Alex...

73
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:47,207
I'm just hoping,
"don't pair me up with Autumn.

74
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,076
Don't pair me up with Autumn.
Don't pair me up with Autumn."

75
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,845
- And Autumn.
- All right.

76
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:55,315
I'm really looking forward
to working with her.

77
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:57,718
Team five, Katie and Jenna.

78
00:03:57,785 --> 00:03:59,486
Yay.

79
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:03,757
Team six is Eric F and Wayne.

80
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:08,562
All right, go ahead and stand
next to your new teammates.

81
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,531
Yeah, dude.
This is a good one.

82
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,368
Kris and Eric Z,
you're up first.

83
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:15,769
- Pick us a winner.
- All right.

84
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:16,770
None of these names
of the demons

85
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:18,138
are ringing any bells.

86
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,774
But if it is a demon
from a certain culture,

87
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:22,609
it's gonna be something that
we can do a lot with creatively.

88
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:24,411
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,180
We picked Abraxas.

90
00:04:27,248 --> 00:04:29,182
Deumus.

91
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,785
So many good ones.

92
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:32,786
We like Azi Dahaka.

93
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:34,721
He's half-man, half-snake,

94
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,524
and he's bound with chains.

95
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:39,559
Pazuzu.

96
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,695
Eurynome.

97
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:45,299
Chort.

98
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:48,068
I really want you
to soak up this place

99
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:50,103
and let it inspire
your designs.

100
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,005
So I'm gonna leave you
out here all alone

101
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:53,340
to sketch.

102
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:54,941
And watch your step out here.

103
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:56,743
This is rattlesnake country.

104
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:57,744
Of course.

105
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:03,884
Okay, go grab your sketch pads
and get started.

106
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,120
So now that we know
what we're doing,

107
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:09,289
we have 30 minutes
to sketch it.

108
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:11,925
But we have to do it out here
in the scorching heat,

109
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:15,028
so we're just trying
to find a "comfortable spot."

110
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:18,265
You want to keep him--
his skin, like, really fleshy

111
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,033
- and pink and, you know...
- Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:22,969
Pazuzu is
an ancient Babylonian demon.

113
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:25,972
He has the head of a dog,
eagle-like feet,

114
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,375
two pairs of wings,
a scorpion's tail.

115
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,844
And the only way we thought
of incorporating it

116
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:32,379
is a gargoyle theme.

117
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:35,315
We're pretty sure we nailed
this design, actually.

118
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:38,118
That is gonna be incredible.

119
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:40,987
We have Azi Dahaka.
It means "fiendish snake."

120
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:42,923
And he's gonna have an arm
that is a snake.

121
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,324
And that'll be
a foam latex puppet, almost,

122
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:46,693
that wraps over his hand.

123
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,228
And so we couldn't ask
for a better demon.

124
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,630
I really want to try
to change, like, human form

125
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,265
as much as possible.

126
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,266
Right.

127
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,468
Chort is a Russian demon,

128
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,670
and it has a pig face, hooves,

129
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:57,637
and it has horns.

130
00:05:57,705 --> 00:05:59,840
We have the most iconic demon.

131
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:01,908
We will definitely
be top looks on this.

132
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,144
It's saying that she's got
feet like a rooster

133
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:06,279
and then, like, a really pointed
and hooked nose.

134
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,181
So we got Deumus,
a Hindu goddess.

135
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,684
We both really want
to make this demon beautiful

136
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,587
to take it away
from a grotesque nature,

137
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:15,021
which we know that's

138
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:16,957
where everybody else
is gonna take their demons.

139
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:18,892
Come on, guys,
get out of the heat.

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,660
- I'm tired of being safe.
- Yes, me too.

141
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:21,695
I got to be honest.

142
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:22,863
Time is up.

143
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,364
We're hot, we're flustered,

144
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:25,599
and really excited
to get in the shop

145
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,368
and get started.

146
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,142
We get to the lab,
pick our models,

147
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:38,445
and the first thing I do
is go search the lab

148
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:42,249
to see what kind of
electronics I can find.

149
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:45,952
It's very fun
working with Eric.

150
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,321
We're just, like, thinking big
right off the get-go.

151
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,824
- Do the other axis?
- Yeah.

152
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:55,328
Our goal is to have animatronic
blinking eyes for this demon.

153
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:58,398
So we're gonna have
the actress look out the mouth,

154
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,233
so we can really elongate
the head

155
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,235
and leave room
for the eye mechanisms.

156
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:05,806
All right,
animatronics are a go.

157
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:08,542
Eurynome is a Grecian demon

158
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:10,343
who is covered in sores

159
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,045
and has wolf-like teeth

160
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:14,548
and eats dead flesh.

161
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:17,083
We have four hours
in the lab today.

162
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,985
And the first thing is
we start sculpting the face.

163
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,554
And we have a lot to do

164
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,622
because we want small horns,

165
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,659
a big mouth
with wolf-like, gnarly teeth.

166
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,260
I want to tackle the legs,
just to be, like, okay...

167
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:28,528
Yeah.

168
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,496
I just want to make sure
that it works.

169
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:30,997
Katie wants to do a walker.

170
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:35,435
A walker is a creature
that has very long arms

171
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:38,605
so it looks
like they're walking.

172
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:42,042
Just hoping that
we can pull it off.

173
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:44,010
We want the mouth
partially open, right?

174
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:45,846
Well, if we're gonna do
any of the extensions,

175
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:46,746
it's gonna have to come out.

176
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,181
Yeah.

177
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:49,216
Our demon, Abraxas, is a demon

178
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:50,817
from Egyptian culture.

179
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,319
He has the head of a lion,
and a whip,

180
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,987
and the feet of a dragon.

181
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,256
And there's deserts in Egypt
where it's, like, hot as hell,

182
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:59,626
so we want to use
dry, crackly browns and beiges.

183
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:00,894
- You liking it?
- Yes.

184
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,963
- Cool.
- Good.

185
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,164
Wait, there's more hands
in here.

186
00:08:04,232 --> 00:08:05,398
Yeah.

187
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,334
The pieces that we intend
to complete

188
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:10,136
will be a full headpiece
facial prosthetic,

189
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,005
a snake glove,

190
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:14,474
a full chest piece,
a back piece.

191
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:17,277
So there is quite a bit to do.

192
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:18,712
It is a snake hand.

193
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,247
It's looking
a little turtle-ish.

194
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:23,383
I'm just doing
the inside right now!

195
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,985
House has really strong ideas,

196
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:29,356
and one of the ideas is
to create a puppet on the hand.

197
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,791
Okay. Let me work on it
for one minute.

198
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,260
He doesn't like
what I'm doing to the puppet.

199
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:34,594
Don't do the outside yet.

200
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:35,962
I want to just
do the inside right now

201
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,430
so that it's really detailed,

202
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:39,332
and then--
because I'm gonna put it--

203
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,401
- I think you're spending
too much time on it right now.

204
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,370
I'm just gonna
let him finish the puppet,

205
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:45,071
but I'm a little nervous
that none of my ideas

206
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:46,573
are gonna come through.

207
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:49,609
- How's this?
- Ooh... uh...

208
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,048
Alam is going
to sculpt one rooster foot,

209
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:58,852
and we're gonna mold that,
cast it twice.

210
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,588
And I'm working
on the facial prosthetic

211
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:04,357
and figuring out how these horns
are going to work

212
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:07,394
in relation to that.

213
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:13,199
We need a lot
of really cool wrinkles in this.

214
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,535
- Yeah.
- This sculpt has to be bad ass.

215
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:16,970
Yeah,
that's what's gonna win it.

216
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:19,673
Autumn's telling me
what a great sculptor she is,

217
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,207
so I'm gonna trust her on that

218
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,376
and let her
really sculpt her vision.

219
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:25,946
The only thing
I'm really afraid of is,

220
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,914
is this entire concept

221
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:30,350
gonna marry itself
really well together

222
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:31,985
with the scorpion tail
and the wings?

223
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:33,954
'Cause it has to have
an overall look.

224
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:37,757
It just can't be random parts
all thrown together.

225
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,262
I can't feel.

226
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,496
I'm pushing on the clay,

227
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,764
and since it's numb,
I can't feel...

228
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:46,666
what I'm doing at all.

229
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,201
I have a tumor--

230
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,870
it's a growth--
in this hand,

231
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,205
and it's pressing
on a bundle of nerves,

232
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:55,241
which cause my fingers
to be completely numb.

233
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:57,777
Quit irritating me.

234
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,145
I'm already a slow sculptor,

235
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:00,914
so I'm really, really worried.

236
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,816
I'm like, "how am I
gonna sculpt this?"

237
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,927
I can't believe how fast
some of these guys are.

238
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:06,166
Mmh-mm.

239
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,713
The last thing I want to
do is let Katie down.

240
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:16,997
Hey, guys.

241
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:18,298
- Come gather 'round here.
- Hey!

242
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,100
McKenzie walks in,

243
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,801
and she doesn't have
her dad with her,

244
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:24,537
so, um, you know
something's up.

245
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:25,505
Uh-oh.

246
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,007
As you know,

247
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:29,743
Hollywood producers
often give script notes

248
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,012
that can completely
transform a story.

249
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,448
Well, that's the case today,

250
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:37,117
'cause the note I have for you

251
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:41,388
will dramatically impact
your designs.

252
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:43,657
Oh, shit.

253
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:46,092
- Coming up...
- Ow! Dang!

254
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
Oh, my God, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

255
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,728
- Are you happy with this?
- Not really.

256
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:51,665
There's no way
I could put a camera on that.

257
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,789
Hey, guys.

258
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:59,857
So McKenzie walks into the lab

259
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,959
and stops us all from working.

260
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm nervous.

261
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,295
As you know,

262
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,464
Hollywood producers
often give script notes

263
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,100
that can completely
transform a story.

264
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,602
Well, that's the case today,

265
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,404
'cause the note I have for you

266
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,475
will dramatically impact
your designs.

267
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,810
Oh, shit.

268
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:22,146
Hell has frozen over.

269
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,848
- Oh, no.
- What?

270
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,216
- What?
- That's right.

271
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,452
You're now going to need
to turn your designs

272
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,921
into ice demons.

273
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,125
The twist for this challenge
scares me

274
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,693
because it's
the exact opposite feeling

275
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,161
that we were going for.

276
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,298
Good luck
changing your designs.

277
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,066
I'll see you all tomorrow.

278
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,502
Bye.

279
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,271
Waah!

280
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,506
- Maybe for the toenails...
- Uh-huh.

281
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,807
...we can do icicles,

282
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,843
like, icicle talons
or something clear.

283
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,077
Oh, nice.

284
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,278
We're gonna change our concept

285
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,913
by changing the color scheme.

286
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,682
Our warm colors
are obviously gonna be turned

287
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,284
into some colder colors.

288
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,586
Let me go see
if there's any white hair.

289
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,249
Okay.

290
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:06,958
We don't have
to make it made of ice.

291
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:10,795
Just, it dwells
in a cold climate.

292
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,463
Our demon's from Russia,

293
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,066
so we already had
these kind of cool elements

294
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,334
going in anyway.

295
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,468
So we're like,
"okay, cool."

296
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,471
Well, like,
since he has so many teeth,

297
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,274
we can make them
look like icicles... maybe.

298
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,377
He should definitely
have icicles somewhere.

299
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,680
I think that would
translate well as icicles.

300
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,216
We're not gonna change our demon
too drastically,

301
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,318
'cause he still needs
to be a demon

302
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,953
even though he's
in an ice environment.

303
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,089
So we're just making his skin
a little more chapped

304
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,691
and adding
a little more snow elements.

305
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,894
- But it's, like, completely...
- Frozen over.

306
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,629
That would be awesome.

307
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:46,931
You know what would be cool?

308
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,300
What if you made the cowl,
the back of it, like that?

309
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,169
- Or is it too much?
- Maybe, maybe.

310
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,404
- It's-- I don't know.
- Just so it fucking like...

311
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,639
Yeah.

312
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:56,541
I think we should have
two different snakes

313
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,409
on the body.

314
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,011
You know, especially since
you get this room

315
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,380
to play with it,
why not make a big cobra?

316
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,715
That would look so dope.

317
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,684
- I think Glenn would love that.
- Okay.

318
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,186
That's what we're doing.

319
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:09,353
- Six minutes.
- Awesome.

320
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,995
Let's keep going.

321
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,362
The end of day one,

322
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,565
I'm not happy with the way
the sculpt is going.

323
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:21,766
I'm getting
more and more frustrated,

324
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,301
especially when Katie and I see

325
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,421
all the amazing stuff
that's going on.

326
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,473
Time's up, everybody!

327
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,211
I feel bad for Katie

328
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,446
because she has
to work with somebody

329
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,881
who cannot perform
to their optimum level.

330
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,093
Now here it is, day two,

331
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,494
and, man, we got a lot to do.

332
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,631
I start blocking out the horns.

333
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,733
Wayne's working like a madman

334
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,468
finishing detailing up
the head.

335
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,104
We are on track.

336
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,341
Definitely no playing it safe
on a demon challenge.

337
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,349
So I start sculpting,

338
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,985
and my hand feels a little bit better.
Still not optimally

339
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:17,154
but I'm feeling
more positive about this.

340
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,792
That looks good.

341
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,065
Hey, everybody.

342
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,500
Hello.

343
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,004
McKenzie and Mr. Westmore
come out,

344
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,972
and we're not
where I'd like to be,

345
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,608
so I'm apprehensive of what
they're going to say to us.

346
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,809
This is Azi Dahaka.

347
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,745
He's a Persian demon.

348
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:42,713
Our character has two snakes.

349
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:47,451
So this snake is actually going
through into the shoulder,

350
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,386
and the big texture
from the cowl

351
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:50,388
will go right here.

352
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:51,822
It would be very helpful
if you, you know,

353
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,992
within your hood--
to have a different color

354
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,428
or a shade-- a variation
of a shade or something.

355
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,997
Otherwise, it's all gonna look
as one flat plane.

356
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,098
Give yourself
a little depth in there.

357
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,335
He's a Grecian demon.

358
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,071
And this particular demon
feasted on dead bodies

359
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,407
and has wolf-like teeth.

360
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,175
I'm concerned
with the face here now,

361
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,843
'cause I'm seeing
a pair of lips

362
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,046
peeking out of a mask.

363
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:16,414
And so how are you going
to hide that?

364
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:17,381
We'll have little teeth
and then more teeth.

365
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,449
Double, maybe even triple.

366
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,518
If you have a moment to do it,

367
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,019
just make a little teeny piece

368
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,021
that you would glue over
the lips.

369
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,356
Just bring it down
over his lip.

370
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,491
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's smart. Okay.

371
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,727
This is the horn
we just blocked out.

372
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,029
We have the hoof, the hands.

373
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,631
We have
these shoulder sections.

374
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:34,965
And the cool thing too

375
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:37,768
is we are actually
adding some animatronics.

376
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,504
You know,
if you don't have time for it,

377
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,108
don't let your paint jobs
suffer for animatronics.

378
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,410
I want to see
the time management, you know?

379
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,547
- That is one of my specialties.
- Okay.

380
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:50,915
- Not mine, but his.
- I know.

381
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,117
Our demon has lion features

382
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,553
mixed with dragon feet.

383
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,987
Just a thought...

384
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,689
with all of these characters
that are put into it,

385
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,225
some kind of a hump
on the back, possibly?

386
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,326
'Cause, I mean, most of all,

387
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,294
like, the lions and the cats,

388
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,528
when they walk,

389
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,664
they have that arch
in the back, yeah.

390
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,065
- See the shoulder blades move.
- Yeah.

391
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,068
Mr. Westmore had a lot
of great advice for us.

392
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,037
We're definitely going
to take that in consideration

393
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,306
and kind of beef up the neck
a little bit.

394
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,608
- She's a Hindu goddess.
- Hindu? Oh, wow.

395
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,744
She's known for her four horns,

396
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,212
hooked teeth, hooked nose,

397
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,147
and a soul
that she holds in her hand

398
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,348
and is ready to devour.

399
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,549
- You going to do it in foam?
- Yes.

400
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,851
It's gonna shrink.

401
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,085
So by making him
just a little but larger,

402
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,453
you're gonna allow
for that shrinkage.

403
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,256
Otherwise, you're gonna have
this lip up here

404
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,824
and down here...

405
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,326
- I see.
- ...when the foam dries.

406
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,661
He is Pazuzu from Babylon.

407
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,998
He has features of a man's body

408
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,335
with a dog-lion face.

409
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,936
He's almost gonna look
gargoyle-ish.

410
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:49,039
You don't have a lot
of-- of depth detail,

411
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,908
so you're gonna have
to do shading and things

412
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,877
to really pop that.

413
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:56,347
All right, everybody,
we're heading out.

414
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,715
Good luck tomorrow.

415
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,785
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you, guys.

416
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,655
How's it going?

417
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:08,993
You know, I took
so much ibuprofen this morning.

418
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,327
As the day progresses,

419
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:13,431
my hand's getting more painful
and more numb.

420
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:15,065
You doing okay still?
No?

421
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,835
No. I mean, it's always--
it's just

422
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,270
gonna be like this, you know?

423
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:20,805
There's not much
I can do about it.

424
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:22,239
It's really frustrating

425
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,942
knowing that my partner
isn't pulling her weight,

426
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,610
but not 'cause
she doesn't want to.

427
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,045
It's just 'cause
she physically can't.

428
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,849
Being not able
to do things the way I want to

429
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,452
is just really pissing me off.

430
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,187
How am I gonna sculpt this?
I can't sculpt it.

431
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,322
Ow! There it goes again.

432
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,990
Dang.

433
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,258
Oh, my God, what am I gonna do?

434
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,526
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

435
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,695
And I start
going into panic mode.

436
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,264
Damn. I cannot sculpt
with my hand like this.

437
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,779
I can't.

438
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:57,002
- Damn, there it goes again.
- Mm.

439
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,539
It feels like I just stuck
my hand in a light socket.

440
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,674
I'm trying not to yell at her

441
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:04,676
or tell her that she's
not doing enough

442
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:07,012
because I understand,
her hand doesn't work,

443
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,514
but I'm worried
because I don't know

444
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:10,883
how that's going
to affect our time management.

445
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,019
We got to hustle on molding this
'cause it's our base.

446
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:16,088
Yeah, yeah, we don't want
to screw that one up.

447
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,557
At this point, there's not
really anything that can be done

448
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,026
about my hand,
not even temporarily.

449
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:23,328
It's just so frustrating
when I can't make my hand

450
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:24,663
do what I want it to do.

451
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:26,098
I'm nervous about it,

452
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,801
but I've beaten
way worse things.

453
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:30,502
I've been
in way more pain before.

454
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,405
I can deal with this.

455
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:39,812
We only have
a couple hours left,

456
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:43,949
so I start hacking out the wings
as quick as humanly possible

457
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:47,319
just to at least get them done.

458
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:48,520
They're a little low?

459
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:51,356
We could-- boop--
move 'em.

460
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:56,662
We got 40 minutes.

461
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,564
I get my sculpt finished.

462
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:00,465
Now I have to mold
these things.

463
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:02,201
We're in good shape

464
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:04,703
but we're not there yet.

465
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:07,439
40 minutes, dude, is insane.

466
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:09,041
We still got to mold the hands,

467
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,844
mold the second half
of the thing...

468
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:13,812
and get
these molds cleaned out.

469
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,547
We're cutting it
down to the wire.

470
00:19:15,615 --> 00:19:17,934
I don't know about this.

471
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:20,919
I'm running out of time today.

472
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,888
I'm working on the feet,

473
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,324
and I still have a lot to do.

474
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,634
Yeah, dude.

475
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:37,970
- Nice.
- Yeah.

476
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,712
Time's up, everybody!

477
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:47,846
At the end of day two,

478
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:49,248
I'm pretty nervous

479
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,849
because Alam and I

480
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,285
were hoping
to have both feet cast.

481
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:54,987
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

482
00:19:55,054 --> 00:19:57,689
So now we are gonna have
to cast them

483
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:00,158
on the day of the application.

484
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:01,960
There is a lot
that has to be covered tomorrow,

485
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:05,797
and I'm just hoping
that we can finish it.

486
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,809
Let's go.
Good luck, guys.

487
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:20,045
- We're running.
- Running.

488
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:25,083
So it's application day.

489
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:27,185
We only have four hours
in the lab.

490
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:28,820
I'm a little bit concerned

491
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:30,389
'cause I got a lot
of painting to do,

492
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:32,257
so I'm loading up
my airbrushes right away.

493
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,393
There is no time.

494
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,362
We got to get this show
on the road.

495
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,101
- Here they are.
- Hi.

496
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,236
Get comfortable.

497
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:45,570
- This is gonna go on your back.
- Okay.

498
00:20:45,638 --> 00:20:46,538
I'll start pre-painting it
then.

499
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:48,040
Okay, cool.

500
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:57,215
Got the first horn.

501
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:59,318
Got my mechanisms laid out.

502
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,954
Wayne and I have the impossible
in front of us.

503
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,923
Not only do I got
to cast two horns,

504
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:06,892
two gloves, two hooves,

505
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,695
and do
a full animatronic unit...

506
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:11,063
Check this shit.

507
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,431
Nice.

508
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:14,366
We got to get
this thing pre-painted

509
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:17,402
and on this actress
in four hours.

510
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,039
It usually takes stuff longer
than four hours just to dry.

511
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:26,912
I don't know.

512
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,780
I still think
this doesn't look right.

513
00:21:28,848 --> 00:21:31,216
I'm not too happy
about the leg extensions

514
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:32,317
'cause they're not turning out

515
00:21:32,385 --> 00:21:34,386
the way that I want them to.

516
00:21:34,454 --> 00:21:35,821
One claw is totally sideways

517
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:37,356
and doesn't match the form

518
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:39,424
of the leg
that we had tried to make.

519
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,660
And they were my idea,

520
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:43,328
so I want to make sure
that I can pull them off.

521
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:46,231
It's not working.

522
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,544
Damn it.

523
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,306
All right.

524
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,475
One of the things
that is so easy to do

525
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,044
with opening any mold
is opening it way too fast,

526
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:00,946
which could damage the piece.

527
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,748
And unfortunately,
under these conditions,

528
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:05,217
we have to do that.

529
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,552
- Yay.
- Awesome.

530
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,155
Luckily, there was only
a slight tear in the seam,

531
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:11,323
so we have a successful cast.

532
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:12,591
- You want to take care of those?
- Yeah.

533
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:14,659
All right.

534
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:19,464
The clock is ticking down

535
00:22:19,532 --> 00:22:22,167
and no paint is on yet.

536
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:23,984
I am freaking out.

537
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:29,041
We start base-coating
our model,

538
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:32,201
painting her like the outside
of a house.

539
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:38,150
Meagan and I are both
painting the snake demon.

540
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:39,351
Are you happy with this so far?

541
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,452
Not really.

542
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,486
I'm a little frustrated.

543
00:22:41,554 --> 00:22:43,355
It's not really coming together.

544
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:44,923
It's just sloppy.

545
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:47,426
We do paint different,
and House wants to start

546
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:49,327
with hard detail,
with airbrushing,

547
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:51,129
and I'm used
to going in with sponges

548
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:52,998
so that it has a nice balance.

549
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:55,667
Which part is sucky that
you're, like, annoyed about?

550
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:58,837
The paint, particularly.

551
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:00,439
15 minutes, everybody!

552
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:16,054
That's time!

553
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:19,357
Time is up, and I'm,
once again, freaking out.

554
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,960
We're gonna have to paint
our piece at last looks.

555
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:24,396
To be painting at last looks

556
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:25,730
puts the weight
on <i>my</i> shoulders a little bit,

557
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:27,799
just because it's been
a recurring thing with me.

558
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:29,668
If we are in the bottom,

559
00:23:29,735 --> 00:23:32,838
probably gonna be the one
to be sent home.

560
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:34,606
Coming up...

561
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,441
This is crazy, dude.

562
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:39,044
First time anyone's done that.

563
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:40,979
The face sculpture looks

564
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:42,047
like you just carved it out
with a spoon.

565
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:43,949
Those are beautiful pieces.

566
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:48,653
It punches you in the face
with how bad it sucks.

567
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:57,113
Good luck, everybody.

568
00:23:59,775 --> 00:24:01,409
- Eric, I'll work on the hooves.
- Okay.

569
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:04,579
We have an hour at final looks.

570
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:06,548
The mechanisms
are working great,

571
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:08,917
but nothing is painted.

572
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:11,355
The thing is just
the base coat.

573
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,189
Definitely, this is gonna
be a good one.

574
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:15,423
You look awesome,
awesome, awesome.

575
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:19,127
Autumn feels super confident
with our demon.

576
00:24:19,195 --> 00:24:21,529
She's convinced that she's
gonna get a standing ovation,

577
00:24:21,597 --> 00:24:23,064
and I don't think
that's gonna happen.

578
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:25,867
30 minutes, guys!
30 minutes!

579
00:24:25,935 --> 00:24:29,003
If they called time right now,
we'd be comfortable with it.

580
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:30,705
Good, got some purple on there.

581
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,707
- I got the black.
- Cool.

582
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,442
I'll start blacking out
his fingers.

583
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,444
Should we do that
or a smaller one?

584
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:37,812
- I'm okay without it.
- Okay.

585
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,522
You want to go ahead
and get the head on?

586
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:44,486
Oh, no... the mechanism.

587
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:46,688
I knocked the cable loose.

588
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:48,556
So all of this mechanics
that I did

589
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:50,859
just slipped off the servo.

590
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:52,060
Oh, fuck!

591
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:54,527
All that hard work for nothing.

592
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,029
Thank you.

593
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:05,273
That's time!

594
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:06,441
Whoo!

595
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:09,811
- This is crazy, dude.
- I feel sick.

596
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:11,045
I'm not happy
with the paint job.

597
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:12,781
Eric's not happy
with the paint job.

598
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:14,616
That's probably what's gonna
put us in the bottom,

599
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:16,904
and I could be going home
at this point.

600
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:31,176
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

601
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:35,303
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

602
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,467
First, let's say hello
to your judges.

603
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,883
Owner of Optic Nerve Special Effects
Studio Glenn Hetrick.

604
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,577
Good evening, guys.

605
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:45,180
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

606
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:46,347
Hi, everybody.

607
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:47,649
Hi.

608
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:49,484
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

609
00:25:49,552 --> 00:25:50,585
Hello.

610
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:51,786
- Hello.
- Hi.

611
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,955
This week,
your spotlight challenge

612
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:55,824
was to create a demon character

613
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:57,025
from somewhere around the world

614
00:25:57,092 --> 00:25:58,660
and bring it to life.

615
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:01,296
Then we threw you a twist.

616
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:02,630
Hell had frozen over,

617
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:04,566
which meant that you
had to adapt your demons

618
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:07,302
to their new, icy environment.

619
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,770
So let's see
what you've come up with.

620
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:35,697
I'm so excited
about our creature.

621
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:37,599
I can't take my eyes
off of him.

622
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:41,202
It's the cutest little gargoyle
I ever saw in my life.

623
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,305
So we're feeling really
confident about this character.

624
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,028
I'm not feeling very good.

625
00:27:07,096 --> 00:27:09,931
What's bothering me the most
is the snake puppet.

626
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:13,101
The finishing piece
that makes this character great

627
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,169
is just, like,
a wobbly rubber snake.

628
00:27:15,237 --> 00:27:18,540
I'm disappointed by that.

629
00:27:38,193 --> 00:27:42,063
The silhouette is crazy
on this creature,

630
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:44,999
and the 3-foot demon horns
look beautiful.

631
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:47,235
The paint job sucks,
but overall,

632
00:27:47,303 --> 00:27:50,038
the thing actually
looks pretty damn cool, man.

633
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:13,328
He does look different,
but not in a good way.

634
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:15,396
I know that it's crap.

635
00:28:15,464 --> 00:28:16,598
I have a feeling
that it's going

636
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:19,367
to be one of us
that's going home.

637
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:42,991
He came out
and snapped that whip,

638
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:45,460
and both Eric and I
were very happy.

639
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:05,747
Our demon looks beautiful
on the stage.

640
00:29:05,814 --> 00:29:07,715
It's pretty,
it's very colorful,

641
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:09,851
with all those sparkly things.

642
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:11,692
I like how it turned out.

643
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:20,561
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look.

644
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,869
I don't see any teamwork
on this thing.

645
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,137
Yeah, 'cause there's
a definite disparity

646
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:30,672
between components.

647
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:32,040
Different styles.

648
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:33,274
And the sculpting on this face

649
00:29:33,342 --> 00:29:34,676
is actually rougher
than I thought it was.

650
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:36,611
Yeah.

651
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:44,419
Can you turn around for us?

652
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:47,021
I think the whole thing
could've been much bolder.

653
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,322
Could've been bigger.

654
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,490
And no matter what you do
with this,

655
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:50,525
it's still a hand puppet.

656
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,179
Yup.

657
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:54,862
You know what?

658
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,097
I like this better up close

659
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:57,432
than I did from far away.

660
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,300
I love the fact
that we're using the mouth

661
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:02,236
as an orbital cavity.

662
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:05,369
First time on <i>Face Off</i>
anyone's done that.

663
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:11,312
I'm really not thrilled
about those giant eye shades.

664
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,382
My heart is beating
about a million miles an hour.

665
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,516
Turn for us.

666
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:16,584
Our guy didn't come out looking

667
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:18,052
the way we wanted him to
at all.

668
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,310
I just know we're gonna
wind up in bottom looks.

669
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:25,059
We want to know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

670
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:28,162
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

671
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:31,877
There's an attempt
to change the physiology

672
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:33,446
a huge amount, which is great.

673
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:35,881
They made a huge mistake
in doing it, though.

674
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,350
I'm terrified
for the both of us.

675
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,072
Our demon looks
like a big, black mess.

676
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:43,556
The top part's kind of groovy.

677
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,925
You get the whole feeling
of a goat from there up,

678
00:30:45,993 --> 00:30:47,708
but that's
very demonic-looking.

679
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:53,499
Normally, this would
just be grotesque.

680
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:54,767
The detailing here.

681
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:55,801
It's still very beautiful.

682
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:57,036
Yeah, it's pretty.

683
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:58,971
- I like the turquoise.
- Yeah.

684
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,845
The judges have scored
your creations.

685
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:07,980
Let's find out
what they thought.

686
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:11,684
Meagan and House.

687
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:15,388
Kris and Eric Z.

688
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:18,524
You guys are safe and can
head back to the makeup room.

689
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:20,024
Thank you.

690
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:25,498
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

691
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:28,000
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

692
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,802
to learn more about your work.

693
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,539
Anthony and Alam,
please step forward.

694
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:39,378
Tell me a little bit

695
00:31:39,446 --> 00:31:41,714
about the inspiration
for this makeup.

696
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:44,083
The character is called Deumus.

697
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:45,351
She's a Hindu goddess.

698
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:50,723
I sculpted the face prosthetic
and the horns.

699
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:55,328
And alam did the feet
and the body painting.

700
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:57,897
Overall, it seems
like the themes

701
00:31:57,964 --> 00:31:59,365
that we asked you
to present here

702
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,300
have been
very successfully addressed

703
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:03,669
in your creation this week.

704
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:08,107
It's an absolutely
gorgeous fusion

705
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:11,577
of the demonic
and the cultural references.

706
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:12,912
Thank you.

707
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:15,047
What made you choose
the colors that you used?

708
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:19,018
Initially, we were gonna go
with kind of more purples.

709
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:22,655
But it changed to
a "hell froze over" situation.

710
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:26,525
We both recalled having seen
some Hindu artwork

711
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:29,829
that a lot of their gods
are blue in tone.

712
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:32,365
Well, that was really
a great choice.

713
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:35,968
You do have a real
super strong furrowed brow,

714
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:38,104
but it's handled
in such a delicate way,

715
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:40,339
particularly that little crease
just at the nose,

716
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:43,943
that you maintained beauty

717
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,912
in something
that normally would have turned

718
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,748
into a classic witch makeup.

719
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:49,949
That's a testament to reserve.

720
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:51,117
Thank you.

721
00:32:51,184 --> 00:32:53,285
Anthony and Alam,
please step back.

722
00:32:53,353 --> 00:32:55,655
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

723
00:32:57,357 --> 00:33:00,354
Alex and Autumn,
please step up.

724
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:07,566
Okay, ladies, can you tell us

725
00:33:07,634 --> 00:33:10,903
who your demon is
and who did what?

726
00:33:10,971 --> 00:33:12,538
He is Pazuzu.

727
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:15,708
He's a demon
that actually protects humans

728
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,177
from other demons,

729
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,079
so we incorporated
something endearing about him.

730
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:23,115
I sculpted the face
and made the wings.

731
00:33:23,183 --> 00:33:25,351
She did the chest piece,
the hands,

732
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:26,685
and all the airbrush work.

733
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:28,621
How do you think you did
on your creation?

734
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:30,022
I think he's adorable.

735
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,290
I got to tell you,

736
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:33,092
I'm not quite sure

737
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,629
that he's adorable.

738
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:38,230
Autumn, I think
the face sculpture

739
00:33:38,298 --> 00:33:39,799
is very, very rough, honey.

740
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:43,135
It looks like you just carved
it out with a spoon, basically.

741
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:45,171
One thing
that really makes this

742
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:47,440
so difficult
for me to enjoy--

743
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:49,975
there is no anatomy
in the wings,

744
00:33:50,043 --> 00:33:52,311
and the fact
that they're out doesn't help

745
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:55,448
because he looks
like he's broken and damaged.

746
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:57,650
What did you change
when McKenzie came in

747
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:59,151
and gave you the twist?

748
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,619
- The color scheme changed.
- Yeah, the color scheme.

749
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:01,921
Like, we decided
to make him, like, paler

750
00:34:01,988 --> 00:34:03,456
and more, like,
sickly-looking.

751
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:06,025
A lot of what you've done
tonight works from far away,

752
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:07,359
but when we get up close,

753
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:08,727
there's no way I could put
a camera on that

754
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,996
in a close-up.

755
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:12,731
Autumn, Alex,
thank you very much.

756
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:14,272
Please step back.

757
00:34:16,703 --> 00:34:20,339
Wayne and Eric, please step up.

758
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:27,046
Tell us about the character

759
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:29,014
and the division of the work
that you've done here.

760
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:31,283
Our character's demon name
is Chort.

761
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:32,785
It's a Russian demon.

762
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,421
It carries a lot
of the same similarities

763
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,189
to the iconic pan.

764
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:39,291
I sculpted the chest
and the whole back piece.

765
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,128
And while I was doing that,
fox was blocking out the head.

766
00:34:43,196 --> 00:34:46,131
We actually had an animatronic
mechanism for the eye blinks.

767
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,967
But at last minute,
the cable slipped

768
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:49,902
and we didn't get a chance
to fix it.

769
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,203
You just got to be so careful.

770
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:53,172
But the silhouette
is wonderful.

771
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,309
There's nice, big moments,
graphically.

772
00:34:57,377 --> 00:35:00,212
The dark horns,
those are beautiful pieces.

773
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,114
They really, really are.

774
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:07,152
There's some
really smart decisions here.

775
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,921
Letting the performer
see through the mouth

776
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:10,155
and extending the form up

777
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:11,023
and past the top of the head,

778
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:12,124
that's awesome.

779
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:13,626
That would happen in my shop.

780
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,861
I really dig the thing overall.

781
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:18,130
But you cannot
paint something this huge

782
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:19,198
on the day here.

783
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:20,499
Give yourself time to paint.

784
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,735
This thing could have been
so much cooler

785
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:24,303
had you given it
a good paint job.

786
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:27,606
The fact that you put
all that pink into the face

787
00:35:27,674 --> 00:35:29,308
to turn it into
more of a pig character

788
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:30,476
was really helpful.

789
00:35:30,544 --> 00:35:31,844
Really beautiful work, guys.

790
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:33,424
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

791
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:36,515
Eric, Wayne, please step back.

792
00:35:40,453 --> 00:35:43,255
Jenna and Katie.

793
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:51,096
Begin by explaining where
you took your reference from

794
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:53,899
and what everybody's role
in the makeup was.

795
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:56,135
Well, this is
the demon Eurynome.

796
00:35:56,202 --> 00:36:00,406
He's covered in sores
and feeds on dead bodies.

797
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:03,108
I sculpted the back
and the leg extensions,

798
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:06,312
and Jenna focused mostly
on the face.

799
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,747
How successful do you feel
in creating a demonic character?

800
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:09,915
Not at all.

801
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:11,584
We had time-management
issues

802
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:12,985
because Jenna's hand
is completely numb--

803
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:14,420
her dominant hand.

804
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:16,855
- So he's a hot mess.
- He is a hot mess, yeah.

805
00:36:16,923 --> 00:36:18,657
Well, that's good, that you're
both on the same page as me.

806
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:20,240
That's awesome.

807
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:23,963
When you have so little variance
in your colors,

808
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,731
it's always gonna be
a problem for me.

809
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:27,166
You've got to show me the form

810
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:28,100
of what you're doing
with your colors.

811
00:36:28,168 --> 00:36:29,568
You must do that.

812
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:33,973
Unfortunately, I don't see
any sores on this demon.

813
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,108
I sculpted a bunch of 'em
in there,

814
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:37,509
but I think
the paint job ruined it.

815
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:39,411
That's unfortunate, you guys.

816
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,347
You can fix a bad sculpt
with a good paint job.

817
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:42,915
Right.

818
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:47,786
It's such a huge concept to do
this physiology manipulation.

819
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:51,423
So with the time you have,
it can only have failed.

820
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:54,243
Katie, Jenna,
you can step back.

821
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,101
Okay, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

822
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:03,736
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

823
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:05,485
while they make
their decisions.

824
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:12,244
Why don't we start with
the looks you like the most.

825
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:14,947
How about Anthony and Alam?

826
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,215
I dig this one.

827
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:18,217
That furrowed brow.
That pointed chin.

828
00:37:18,284 --> 00:37:20,352
The hooked nose
with four nostrils.

829
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,487
That stuff
shouldn't have worked,

830
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:24,223
but they just handled it
so well.

831
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,524
I think it's beautiful

832
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:28,260
and very God- and goddess-
and demon-like,

833
00:37:28,328 --> 00:37:29,828
all rolled into one.

834
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:33,432
Let's move on
to Wayne and Eric F.

835
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,733
Such a beautiful piece.

836
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,268
Yeah, I mean, from head to toe.

837
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:38,337
That body sculpt is so amazing.

838
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:40,005
I mean, the anatomy
was all there.

839
00:37:40,073 --> 00:37:42,675
They managed to evoke "demon"
with those beautiful horns,

840
00:37:42,742 --> 00:37:44,677
and then they went off
in their own direction.

841
00:37:44,744 --> 00:37:46,578
All right, let's move on

842
00:37:46,646 --> 00:37:48,714
to some of the looks
you liked the least.

843
00:37:48,782 --> 00:37:50,382
Why don't we start
with Katie and Jenna.

844
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,485
Now Jenna, she did
the head, the face?

845
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:55,754
Katie did the back
and the arms.

846
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:57,289
When you look at the arms,

847
00:37:57,357 --> 00:37:58,791
those extensions,
they were abysmal.

848
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:03,796
They were un-definable
as canes or sticks or anatomy.

849
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:05,964
The arms don't match
the rest of the body.

850
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:08,233
The pustules are--
there's zero effort.

851
00:38:08,301 --> 00:38:12,004
So when your head fails,
your arm extension idea fails,

852
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:13,539
what else is there
to talk about here?

853
00:38:13,606 --> 00:38:15,741
It's really just
whose fault is it?

854
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,776
- Yeah.
- Last one, Alex and Autumn.

855
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,212
The concept,
there was nothing there.

856
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,981
They just executed verbatim
what they were asked to do

857
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,483
and poorly at that.

858
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:27,086
Autumn had a single plane
of wet clay

859
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:30,022
that she just gouged in
some marks to be wrinkles.

860
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,291
If she's happy with that work,
there's little hope for her.

861
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:35,027
The chest was savable,
but the face was--

862
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,829
like, I don't even know
what it looks like.

863
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:38,964
When you walk up to that thing,

864
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:41,033
it punches you in the face
with how bad it sucks.

865
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,502
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

866
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,237
- No doubt.
- Yes, we have.

867
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:46,872
Let's bring 'em back out.

868
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:56,014
Glenn, tell us about
the top teams.

869
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,616
The top teams tonight are...

870
00:38:57,684 --> 00:38:59,785
Anthony and Alam.

871
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:01,120
There's a very strong synthesis

872
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:02,621
between your demon's attributes

873
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:04,223
and the region
that it was from.

874
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,691
We could immediately
tell a lot about it

875
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:06,992
just looking at it.

876
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,328
Wayne and Eric.

877
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:12,197
The sculpture on the abdomen
is really beautiful.

878
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:13,866
And we also felt that yours
was probably

879
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:16,368
the most uniquely "demon"
tonight.

880
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:18,203
Which team came out on top?

881
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:21,373
The top team tonight is...

882
00:39:26,217 --> 00:39:28,585
Okay, which team
came out on top?

883
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:31,922
The top team tonight is...

884
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:36,627
Anthony and Alam.

885
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,665
Awesome job.

886
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:43,133
Basically,
it came down to the fact

887
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:45,102
that everything
that you guys did

888
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,637
worked so extremely well
together.

889
00:39:46,704 --> 00:39:47,805
Well done.

890
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,306
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

891
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:50,507
Anthony and Alam, as you know,

892
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:52,242
we can only have one winner.

893
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,011
Glenn?

894
00:39:54,078 --> 00:39:57,514
The winner tonight is...

895
00:39:57,582 --> 00:39:58,916
Anthony.

896
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,020
Couldn't have done it
without you.

897
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:04,988
The whole character
is really very strong,

898
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:07,724
but the stand-out
is the face and the horns.

899
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:10,093
Thank you, guys.
I can't believe it.

900
00:40:10,161 --> 00:40:12,062
I won four challenges in a row.

901
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,931
It's one of
the most amazing feelings,

902
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:15,666
but it puts
a lot of pressure on me.

903
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,534
Anthony, congratulations.

904
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:19,069
Thank you.

905
00:40:19,137 --> 00:40:20,838
You and Alam can head back
to the makeup room.

906
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:22,639
- Thanks again, guys.
- Thank you.

907
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:25,742
Eric and Wayne,
you guys are also safe.

908
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,044
Please head back
to the makeup room.

909
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:30,347
Thank you, guys.

910
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:35,919
Unfortunately, that means

911
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:37,387
the rest of you
are on the bottom this week

912
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:40,043
and one of you
will be eliminated.

913
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,008
Please step forward.

914
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:51,001
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

915
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:53,070
Alex and Autumn.

916
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:55,105
You made some really big
sculptural mistakes,

917
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:59,176
and it ended up coming off
a bit confused.

918
00:40:59,244 --> 00:41:00,677
Jenna and Katie.

919
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:02,713
You had a really great concept,

920
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,148
but the sculpture
and the paint job

921
00:41:05,216 --> 00:41:07,885
really let you down tonight.

922
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:09,686
So who's going home tonight?

923
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:12,856
The person going home
tonight is...

924
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:18,695
Katie.

925
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:21,064
There was a lot wrong
with the makeup tonight,

926
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:23,333
but the back
and the arm extensions

927
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:24,868
were particularly rough.

928
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:28,805
Katie, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

929
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:31,341
That means the rest of you
are safe this week

930
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:33,810
and can head back
to the makeup room.

931
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,873
It's okay.

932
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,153
Katie, just keep practicing,
keep doing your art.

933
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,354
We've really loved
having you here.

934
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:46,490
It's been a huge honor
to be here.

935
00:41:46,557 --> 00:41:47,925
Thank you so much.

936
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:50,294
Katie, it has been great
having you here with us,

937
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:52,029
but please head back
to the makeup room

938
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:53,297
and pack up your kit.

939
00:41:53,364 --> 00:41:54,498
Thank you.

940
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:56,639
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Good luck.

941
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:02,706
It just sucks to go home
before you're ready to.

942
00:42:02,774 --> 00:42:05,575
- I'm going home.
- Oh.

943
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:07,928
It took a really long time
to get here,

944
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:10,000
and it's just been great
that I was able to come

945
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:13,250
and just meet everyone.

946
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:15,419
I'm proud
of what I've done here.

947
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:18,522
I will definitely
move on past this

948
00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:19,690
and create something
really awesome.

949
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:22,774
I really want to show
what I can do.
