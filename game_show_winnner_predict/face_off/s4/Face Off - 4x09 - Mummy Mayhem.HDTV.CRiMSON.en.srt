Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:08,554
Anthony's
bioluminescent creature

3
00:00:08,588 --> 00:00:09,641
brought him his fourth win...

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,928
Thank you guys so much.

5
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,698
And Meagan
and Eric Z were sent home

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,228
in a surprise
double elimination.

7
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:17,911
Now, just five artists remain.

8
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:19,640
Tonight, they'll tackle
a challenge

9
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,967
inspired by one of the most
iconic film franchises

10
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,179
of all time.

11
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,525
Everybody loves this film.

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,665
Use this as inspiration
for your designs.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,510
With the finale on the horizon,

14
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:31,062
the pressure begins
to take its toll.

15
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:33,380
I don't have any paint
on the body at all.

16
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:34,523
I'm not gonna be able
to get this out,

17
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:36,506
and if I try
to rush this thing,

18
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,155
I could destroy all the work
that I've done.

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,739
It's time, guys!

20
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,662
This is really rad.

21
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,544
Oh, wow!

22
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,659
You totally ruined
your whole makeup.

23
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:48,972
If I'm gonna be eliminated
for this,

24
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:50,446
this is a good one
to go home on.

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,760
This is pretty much camera-ready.

26
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:55,278
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

27
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:58,029
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

28
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,835
in New York and Paris,

29
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,249
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,

30
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:04,827
and $100,000.

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,740
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

32
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:11,666
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,123
Sync and corrections by n17t01

34
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,451
- Good morning.
- Morning, dude.

35
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:56,622
What's this?

36
00:01:56,656 --> 00:01:58,796
Ah, Meagan left a little note
for me, man.

37
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:01,005
"Rule number one, don't fart
in women's faces."

38
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:03,848
Meagan and Eric are gone.

39
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,686
I got a really sweet note
from Meagan

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,199
saying that it's nice
that she can call me a friend

41
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,472
and to definitely give
the other boys hell,

42
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,079
which I'm planning on doing.

43
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:15,086
Good morning, guys!

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,096
Last Eric standing.

45
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,436
Can you believe it's just us?

46
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,210
The elite team of badasses.

47
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:24,383
- Final five.
- It's insane, man.

48
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:25,286
I can't believe
we made it this far.

49
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,623
I got to be honest.

50
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:28,261
It's really crazy at this point

51
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:30,700
because the five of us
that are left,

52
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,172
we're all very run down.

53
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:33,776
This is the longest I've been

54
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,251
out of communication
with the wife and kids,

55
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:38,357
and I really
want to make them proud,

56
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:42,435
so, that is the biggest drive
to do well in this.

57
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,210
We can take on anything, guys.

58
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,805
We're walking through this
awesome, very historic theater,

59
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,043
and it's very beautiful.

60
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,879
It's decked out in Egyptian art

61
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:00,651
all around the building.

62
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:03,893
McKenzie's standing there,
and there's six tablets,

63
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:06,900
and on the tablets,
there's these sculpted beings,

64
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,740
and they all have these
headdresses on and staffs.

65
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:16,024
Welcome to American
Cinematheque's Egyptian Theater,

66
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:19,233
the location of Hollywood's
first-ever movie premiere,

67
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,603
but we're actually here to talk

68
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:22,808
about the cult classic
<i>Evil Dead.</i>

69
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:24,947
Yes.

70
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,049
I love this film.

71
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:27,887
My kids love this film.

72
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,291
Everybody loves this film.

73
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:31,096
It's <i>Evil Dead.</i>

74
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,699
The original franchise
was so successful

75
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,935
that it's currently
being remade

76
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:37,577
and is set for release
by Sony Pictures in April.

77
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:40,617
In the film, five friends are
holed up in a remote cabin,

78
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,689
where they discover
a book of the dead

79
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,563
and unwittingly summon
dormant demons

80
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:47,065
which possess them
in succession

81
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,407
until only one is left intact
to fight the survivors.

82
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:51,843
The real <i>Book Of The Dead</i>

83
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:55,317
is actually
an ancient Egyptian spell book,

84
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,686
and some of the most
iconic images from the book

85
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,922
are the gods they worshiped.

86
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:03,092
Those gods are the basis
for your spotlight challenge,

87
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,093
select one of the Egyptian gods

88
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,562
and bring it to life.

89
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:08,830
<i>Evil Dead</i>
meets an Egyptian God.

90
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,833
- This is right up my alley.
- But there's more.

91
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,503
Ancient Egyptians
had a very specific way

92
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:17,478
to ensure they would find their
way back from the afterlife...

93
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:19,579
- mummification.
- Hm.

94
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:21,481
So, inspired by<i>Evil Dead,</i>

95
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:25,084
you will create
an Egyptian God mummy

96
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:28,120
rising after thousands
of years of decay.

97
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:29,721
Oh, yeah.

98
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:30,955
You know, that's a lot
to incorporate.

99
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,126
I've never made a decomposed
or mummified body,

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,228
so this challenge is gonna be
really, really interesting.

101
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:39,296
Kris, you're up first.

102
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,300
Khnum.

103
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:47,269
Anubis.

104
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:50,372
Ra.

105
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:53,208
Sobek.

106
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:56,243
Thoth.

107
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:00,011
Before I send you off
to work on your sketches,

108
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:02,180
I have a special message
for you.

109
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:03,681
Hi, folks.
Bruce Campbell here.

110
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,549
Oh, wow.

111
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,849
Bruce Campbell is great.

112
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:09,384
He is the star of
the <i>Evil Dead</i> franchise,

113
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,053
so it just really pumped me up.

114
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:14,388
I am very excited
that you are creating makeups

115
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:16,257
inspired by <i>Evil Dead.</i>

116
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,058
I want to give you
a couple pointers, though.

117
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,794
The latest movie has a more
serious tone than the original,

118
00:05:20,828 --> 00:05:22,762
so make sure your makeups

119
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:25,797
are very haunting, creepy,
and scary,

120
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,932
so have fun, be original.

121
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,268
Good luck.

122
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:33,606
Everyone who knows<i>Evil Dead</i>
knows Bruce Campbell.

123
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,443
He's a horror icon.

124
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:37,381
All right, look around
and use this great place

125
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,821
as inspiration
for your designs.

126
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,791
When you're finished, head back
to the lab and get started.

127
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:45,027
I will see you tomorrow.

128
00:05:49,401 --> 00:05:52,803
We get 30 minutes to sketch.

129
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:55,973
There was all these great
Egyptian symbols on the wall.

130
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,474
I open up my sketchbook,

131
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:00,377
and there's a small paragraph
about the God that I chose.

132
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,280
He is the God of water
and creation,

133
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:05,782
and he's got a ram's head.

134
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:07,082
I want to make sure

135
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:10,018
that the head really shines
to impress the judges.

136
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:11,185
I'm excited
about this challenge.

137
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,088
I love <i>The Evil Dead.</i>

138
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,323
This makeup's very important.
I've been on the bottom twice.

139
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:18,125
Luckily, I was able
to bounce back.

140
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,826
I just got to continue
to bring it

141
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,426
because everybody's so good.

142
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,761
I chose Anubis.

143
00:06:22,795 --> 00:06:25,897
Anubis is the God of embalmers
and death and everything.

144
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:28,600
The skin's gonna be very tight
to the bone structure,

145
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:30,301
and parts are gonna be torn

146
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,603
as well as he's obviously
gonna be wrapped

147
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:33,704
in a lot of cheesecloth.

148
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,839
So...

149
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,207
I picked Sobek.

150
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:38,875
The Egyptians would pray to him

151
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,911
because the Nile river
was so important to them,

152
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,846
and he's the God
of the crocodiles.

153
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,181
To bring in
that <i>Evil Dead</i> sense

154
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,883
to where it's mummified,

155
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,052
I'm gonna exaggerate
the rib cage.

156
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:51,687
This time, I'm really gonna
try to focus on the paint.

157
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:54,156
I know I've said it before,
but they know I can sculpt,

158
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,191
but it's pointless
to have good sculpting

159
00:06:56,225 --> 00:06:59,161
if you can't bring it to life
with your paint job.

160
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:01,063
Love<i>Evil Dead.</i>

161
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:03,798
One of my favorite films
growing up as a kid.

162
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,600
Yeah, this one, I got.

163
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,302
Ra is the God of the Sun,

164
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:11,403
and I'm really gonna
put the <i>Evil Dead</i> spin on it,

165
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:14,673
a real stylized,
predominant brow.

166
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:16,378
So it's gonna be sweet, man.

167
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,737
Thoth is the Egyptian Moon God,

168
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,067
and he's a scribe.

169
00:07:21,102 --> 00:07:22,401
He writes on his tablet,

170
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,034
but I'm seeing his body
as the tablet.

171
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,701
He's gonna have etchings
all over him.

172
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:29,634
I thought last challenge
was something

173
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:30,868
that I was familiar with
as well,

174
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,301
but I came up short
on that one.

175
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,869
So I have to redeem myself
on this week's challenge.

176
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,301
Come on, guys.

177
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:49,133
First day at the lab,
we got five hours.

178
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,027
We get to pick our models.

179
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:54,325
I decide to pick a female model

180
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,858
just because it's hard to take

181
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,390
one of these
big, muscle-bound guys

182
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:01,857
and turn them
into an emaciated mummy.

183
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:09,692
I want to spend time
on the chest

184
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,225
which is going to have
a lot of detail

185
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,859
with all the hieroglyphics
on it,

186
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,492
and the face, which is going
to be very busy,

187
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,259
and rotting, and decaying.

188
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,326
I'm also creating a headpiece.

189
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,794
So I'm juggling three
different sculptures at once.

190
00:08:27,962 --> 00:08:30,194
I'm gonna go ahead
and start on the body first.

191
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:32,728
I'm gonna do
a giant chest piece,

192
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,995
almost like a giant vest,

193
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:37,228
that he just slips on
over his head.

194
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:38,595
I'm gonna sculpt the body first

195
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,395
and then make the head
fit the body,

196
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,563
so, that way, the neck matches
better to the headpiece.

197
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,596
You know, at this stage
of the game,

198
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:46,964
we're all such great artists.

199
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,697
They're gonna be really, really
picky on every aspect.

200
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,363
Someone's gonna be going home
with a really good makeup.

201
00:08:56,332 --> 00:09:00,034
It's really important
that I get my face sculpted

202
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:01,668
and get the body started,

203
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:04,502
so, that way, they're all
textured uniformly

204
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,937
as opposed to sculpting a head,

205
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:08,937
and, then, going back,
and sculpting a chest,

206
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:12,004
and hoping everything lines up.

207
00:09:12,037 --> 00:09:13,470
To give it the <i>Evil Dead</i> twist,

208
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:20,871
I'm just gonna go with
'80s-style zombie corpse makeup.

209
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:25,606
My plan for my mummy
is to give him

210
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,940
this wolfman-esque,
mummified face

211
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:31,140
that will entail a foam latex
prosthetic on the face,

212
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:33,474
a chest piece, a back piece,

213
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:36,073
and then I have to sculpt
some kind of headdress.

214
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:43,074
I finish the sculpture
of the chest,

215
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:44,975
and now it's time
to make the mold.

216
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:46,942
You do this by putting
a cement-type substance

217
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:48,175
over the sculpture.

218
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:50,242
Once it's hardened,
you open it up,

219
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,976
clean out the clay, and fill it
with silicone or foam latex

220
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,009
which becomes the prosthetic.

221
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,375
How's your mummy coming
along there, House?

222
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:00,442
It's coming.

223
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:02,776
The last challenge
didn't go so well for me.

224
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,175
That was a nail-biter, man.

225
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,543
Yeah, that last challenge
was seriously

226
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:08,444
the most stressful one yet.

227
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:10,211
I am a little stressed out

228
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:11,945
because, for a piece this size,

229
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:15,077
it's almost impossible to do
in 14 hours,

230
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:16,678
but I'm still trying
to keep it together.

231
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:22,645
I really am missing the family
at home really bad right now.

232
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,546
It's the longest I've been away
from my kids and my wife,

233
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,813
and it's really taking its toll
on me at this point.

234
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,946
You're gonna make them proud.

235
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:33,246
Thanks, man.
I'm trying.

236
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:34,814
It's been really difficult
to be away

237
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:36,113
from the wife and kids,

238
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:38,647
and it's hard.

239
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,881
I'm feeling
very, very worn out.

240
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:42,814
I don't know
if I can pull this off.

241
00:10:42,848 --> 00:10:44,380
I'm exhausted.

242
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:46,914
This is a lot of work.

243
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:48,047
Coming up.

244
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,580
I may need some help
on this one, Kris.

245
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,347
If I can't get
this mold finished,

246
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:53,848
I won't have a prosthetic.

247
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,948
There's a couple of odd things
about this.

248
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:57,180
All that's going
through my mind

249
00:10:57,215 --> 00:10:58,281
is "three strikes,
and you're out."

250
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,381
I think you all
did a great job.

251
00:11:03,978 --> 00:11:06,846
It is day one of our
<i>Evil Dead</i>challenge.

252
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,746
It's been really difficult.
I'm tired.

253
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:11,815
But I just remember
I'm doing this for my family.

254
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:16,452
That, to me, is the biggest
drive to do well in this.

255
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:20,222
So I'm going to work
like a madman to get this done.

256
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:25,160
- 45 minutes, Kris.
- 45?

257
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:26,996
- 45.
- Fuck.

258
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,097
I'm trying to finish up
my chest mold.

259
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,132
I've got a hairdryer
on the stone part,

260
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:32,867
trying to speed up the process.

261
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,702
I'm really racing
against the clock here.

262
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,769
I want to get
this thing done...

263
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,537
37 minutes.

264
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,005
So close, baby.
So close.

265
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,674
And then I realize that I'm not
gonna get this done.

266
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,175
If I try to rush this thing,

267
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:44,376
I could break the mold

268
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,409
and destroy all the work
that I've already done.

269
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:47,709
I'm not gonna be able
to get this out in time.

270
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:49,010
There's no way.

271
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:51,712
In the end, I opt to just wait
till the next day.

272
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:53,980
Gonna keep rubbing it down
until they call time.

273
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,187
All right, guys!
It's time!

274
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,422
So close.
Always ten more minutes.

275
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,157
When I come in tomorrow,

276
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,992
all I have to do
is clean that thing out,

277
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:10,026
and that's all ready to go.

278
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,593
Then I can jump on the face.

279
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:22,602
It's day two.

280
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:24,303
Today, I have
to finish sculpting

281
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:26,938
the chest and back piece,
get that molded,

282
00:12:26,973 --> 00:12:30,809
jump onto the headpiece,
and get it casted.

283
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:32,276
I open my mold,

284
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:35,112
and I'm trying to be
very careful so it won't crack.

285
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:37,347
Luckily, everything
opens up okay.

286
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,115
Everything looks beautiful.

287
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,252
First thing I want to do

288
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:48,759
is get that giant, two-piece
mold open and cleaned out.

289
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:50,194
I want to let it sit in the sun

290
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,895
so it bakes
all the moisture out,

291
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:53,896
so my chances of getting
a really good

292
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,432
foam latex appliance
is gonna be better.

293
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,970
I still have
to fabricate my headdress

294
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:06,573
as well as get my face
and my body molded.

295
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,742
I got a lot of molds to make

296
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:10,810
and a lot of sculpting
to finish up.

297
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:18,416
The mood in the lab
is a nervous quiet.

298
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,051
There's only five people left.

299
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,086
I was bottom looks last week.

300
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,921
I would like to redeem myself.

301
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:26,490
I have to, man, go big.

302
00:13:26,524 --> 00:13:27,657
There's no more room for error,

303
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:30,392
no more room
for just making it good.

304
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:32,027
Good's easy.

305
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,428
It's great
that I strive for it.

306
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,129
Oh, that's cool.

307
00:13:35,164 --> 00:13:37,832
That's super cool.

308
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,566
- Hello, guys.
- Hello. - Hello.

309
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,134
Here to do
a walk-through.

310
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,502
Yeah, I'm looking
forward to it.

311
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:45,004
I was an art history major,
so I know all about Egypt.

312
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,504
Let's see what you're doing.

313
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,738
- Hi.
- Wow.

314
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,173
- I like it already.
- Excellent.

315
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,041
- Okay, so you have Thoth--
- Thoth.

316
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:53,410
Yes, he was known
as the scribe,

317
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:54,744
and instead of writing
on a tablet,

318
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,713
I'm using his body
as the tablet.

319
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,915
With your scribing
that you're doing on the body,

320
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,584
make it deep enough
and wide enough

321
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:02,919
so when you go to paint,
it'll actually read,

322
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:04,787
and it doesn't look
like just a scar.

323
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:05,988
Yeah, good point.

324
00:14:06,022 --> 00:14:07,556
All right, so you have Anubis.

325
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,991
Part of my inspiration
for this,

326
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:10,759
especially with the face,
is kind of a mixture

327
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:13,094
between Boris Karloff's mummy

328
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:15,997
- meets Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolfman...
- Wolfman.

329
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm gonna paint the skin, then
do a little bit of open latex

330
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,535
to just give some texture.

331
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,605
It wouldn't hurt to maybe have
a little bit of flesh hanging,

332
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,173
a couple of little spots
that are hanging

333
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,241
that you could paint,
that would make it

334
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,744
look more like rotting flesh
than just--

335
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:31,978
- Laying over.
- Yeah.

336
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:34,214
All right, so tell us
about the god you chose.

337
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,183
He's a human
but with a crocodile head.

338
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:38,252
Now, how are you feeling
with your time on everything?

339
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:39,487
Really, the only pieces
I'm sculpting

340
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:40,522
is the chest and the head,

341
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:41,956
and so I really wanted
to take time

342
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:44,525
to really show that sculpting
ability that I have.

343
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,926
I know in the last challenge,

344
00:14:45,961 --> 00:14:47,561
where you had all
this wonderful sculpture,

345
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,664
your luminescent painting
didn't pop

346
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,065
like some
of the other ones did.

347
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,066
It all disappeared.

348
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,735
Did you leave that
to the very end

349
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:54,936
and not have enough time
to do it?

350
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,204
Yeah.
Yeah, pretty much.

351
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:58,372
Yeah, if you make it down
to the end,

352
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:01,141
this is what could make or break
your chances of winning,

353
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:04,244
is not having
your time management down.

354
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,078
So you have Ra?

355
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,514
- Ra, God of gods.
- That's right.

356
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:10,451
I'm trying to incorporate some
of the<i>Evil Dead</i>aspect.

357
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:14,354
Therefore, I did the kind of
traditional, like, arched brow,

358
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:17,557
extended the chin,
which are two characteristics

359
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:20,125
used in the <i>Evil Dead</i> makeups.

360
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,326
What are you gonna do
that's extra

361
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:22,828
to give it a mummified look?

362
00:15:22,862 --> 00:15:25,764
I'm actually using these
Make Up For Ever sponges.

363
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,832
Once I get
my detail carved lines,

364
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,834
- I go back in and...
- Show me.

365
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:32,803
Give that kind
of beef jerky-type look.

366
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:34,505
Yeah, the rougher,
the better probably.

367
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,474
Yeah, it'll really pick up
the washes.

368
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:37,775
- Oh, yeah?
- Very good.

369
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,877
All right, so tell us
about Khnum.

370
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:42,113
Khnum is the God of water
and creation.

371
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,381
What are you doing to mummify?

372
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:45,784
Latex and tissue,
or cotton or whatnot, yeah.

373
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:48,856
I don't want to wrap it up
all the way in the bandages,

374
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:51,525
'cause I really want to show off
all the work I put into it.

375
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,894
With the eyes here, are you
going to be able to see eyes?

376
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,029
Yeah.

377
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:55,897
As long
as they're gonna be there,

378
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:57,298
and he's gonna be blinking.

379
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,966
- When he blinks-- because--
- It'll look young.

380
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,234
- It'll look young.
- Yeah.

381
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,436
So blend your eyelids
right into the makeup.

382
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:03,537
Thank you for that tip.

383
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:04,738
All right, everybody.

384
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,206
We're leaving,
but it's looking great.

385
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,075
It's gonna come down
to time management.

386
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,009
Be thinking of that
as you're working now.

387
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:11,777
It's gonna be very important.

388
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,213
- Good luck, guys. Thank you.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

389
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:21,987
That's gonna look
so frickin' good, dude.

390
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,089
Thanks, man.

391
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:24,723
I sculpt two horns,

392
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,657
and I get to a point
to where I know

393
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:27,824
they're gonna fit perfectly,

394
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:29,158
and once I have that,

395
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:31,126
I put my final touches
on the goat face,

396
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:34,496
and I start molding then.

397
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,266
One hour.

398
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,368
I'm really nervous about time
on this one.

399
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:43,638
I need to get the chest molded
and ready to run foam in it.

400
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:45,640
I'm gonna have to make
the fastest two-piece mold

401
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:48,175
of my life to try to get
this thing ready for foam.

402
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,945
For the blow-dryer?
Extension cord?

403
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,914
The ultracal has to set up
in a certain amount of time

404
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:54,248
before you can
de-mold it.

405
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,184
If not, it's just gonna crack
and fall apart,

406
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,786
so I'm gonna throw a plastic bag
and a blow-dryer on it,

407
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,888
get this dried
as fast as possible.

408
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,457
Tomorrow is application day,

409
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,391
and if I can't get
this mold finished,

410
00:17:05,426 --> 00:17:07,293
then I won't have
a chest piece.

411
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:11,905
How is your mummy
coming along there, House?

412
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,029
It's coming.

413
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,996
Fox and I start talking about
the Evil Dead.

414
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,551
I saw Evil Dead in a movie
theater when I was 12 years old.

415
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:21,251
Evil Dead 2, saw that one
when I was 17.

416
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:24,009
Army Darkness, that
movie is so cool.

417
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:26,727
The Evil Dead franchise
is huge to me.

418
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,889
Mi kids would love
the Evil Dead 2.

419
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,345
Thant thing is playing
quite often over

420
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,469
at the Fox family house.

421
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,423
I saw these films
as a kid too, so,

422
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:36,887
I'm all in favor of it.

423
00:17:36,994 --> 00:17:38,864
One of the ultimate
party flicks.

424
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:47,512
Today is the second day of our
mummified<i>Evil Dead</i>challenge.

425
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:49,477
I'm really nervous about time
on this one.

426
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:52,107
If I can't get this chest
finished, I'm gonna be screwed.

427
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,540
You need help, man?

428
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,903
I may need some help
on this one, Kris.

429
00:17:55,937 --> 00:18:00,133
I have to pray that this mold's
not gonna crack or break.

430
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:02,130
These pieces
are gonna be foam latex,

431
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,327
but foam latex needs
to bake overnight,

432
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:06,958
so I have to get it done quick.

433
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:08,957
Clean the core for me, please.

434
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:10,489
Here's some paint sticks
right here.

435
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:12,087
We get my mold ready for foam,

436
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:14,619
and it's gonna be able
to bake overnight,

437
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:17,583
but there's still a lot to do.

438
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:24,742
I start sculpting a headdress.

439
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:27,639
Unfortunately, I only have
about 40 minutes

440
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,806
to get this thing roughed in
and sculpted

441
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,975
before I have to put it
into molding.

442
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,612
Otherwise, I'm not gonna have
this piece,

443
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,716
and it's very stressful towards
the end, very hectic.

444
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,919
Four of us are in there making
molds in the last 40 minutes.

445
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:42,522
Fox starts his
at the last 15 minutes.

446
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,191
I'm just hoping to get the front
and back halves made

447
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,059
before the day goes out.

448
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,231
Agh!

449
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,501
- Is that hot water?
- I think so.

450
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,902
All right.

451
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,971
We're all doing the same thing
at the exact same time,

452
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,141
and we're rushing really fast,

453
00:19:04,175 --> 00:19:06,910
but we don't have enough time
to open them

454
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,779
and clean them
and fabricate them...

455
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,781
That's it!

456
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:11,948
Wrap it up!

457
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:15,085
...which means that we have
to do it on day three.

458
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,653
Not a good sign.

459
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:29,464
What a day.

460
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:30,598
End of day two,

461
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:33,367
we're physically
and mentally exhausted.

462
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:36,670
We know we have a lot to do
on day three.

463
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:38,439
The four of us have
to open our molds,

464
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:40,474
clean out the molds,
latex them up,

465
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:42,142
- and polyfoam them.
- Polyfoam 'em.

466
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,110
Opening the mold and getting
that piece polyfoamed

467
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:46,812
will take a good chunk of time
for all of us.

468
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,414
They're all gonna be so badass.

469
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,416
It's gonna be a small detail
that's gonna send someone home.

470
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:53,785
You know, somebody's gonna be
going home with a good makeup.

471
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,392
I love you guys like if you were
my brothers, man.

472
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:58,800
- Yeah, same here, man.
- Right on.

473
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,703
- Pound it.
- Right on.

474
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,450
So application day,
the first thing I do

475
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:16,854
is run straight
for that Anubis headpiece mold,

476
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:19,789
just try to slowly
and easily open it.

477
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,658
I clean out all the clay

478
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,360
so I can start running it
in polyfoam.

479
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:28,364
We have four hours in the lab,

480
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,533
and an hour at last looks.

481
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,201
I mean, it's kind of funny
because everybody

482
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,536
is in the mold room,
pulling their pieces,

483
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,672
cleaning out clay,
and slip latexing

484
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:38,306
and polyfoaming.

485
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,710
I'm already behind.
I have to open my molds.

486
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:44,877
I have to clean them out.

487
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,912
I have to do latex
and polyfoam.

488
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,148
So much to do.

489
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,918
You're gonna be Ra.

490
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,519
- Nice.
- What's going on?

491
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:55,787
- Ready for another one?
- Yeah.

492
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,590
- Ready to become a mummy God?
- Right on.

493
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,960
- You'll be actually inside the head,
- Yeah.

494
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,928
so you'll be able
to move the jaw with your jaw.

495
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,897
Really?

496
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,666
I make a vac-u-form copy
of my model's face

497
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,168
for the chin piece,
and also for the horns

498
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,403
to rest on his forehead,

499
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,970
so it's comfortable
for the model.

500
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:24,912
And this will be
your headdress.

501
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:27,080
I test fit the Anubis head.

502
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,416
- Is that really tight?
- It's tight.

503
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,051
It's initially too small...

504
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:33,153
Yeah, it's pretty tight.

505
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:35,488
So I have to rip out
quite a bit of foam

506
00:21:35,523 --> 00:21:38,658
in order for it to fit
and sit properly.

507
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:39,659
That's better.

508
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:51,002
I immediately get the torso
on my model.

509
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:52,970
Okay, go ahead
and blow-dry down.

510
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:55,206
Get the arms covered,
get the legs covered

511
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,908
using a build up of latex
and paper towels.

512
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,277
It leaves
a really cool texture.

513
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:04,113
With this makeup, no jumping
jacks or anything crazy.

514
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:05,113
Okay.

515
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:16,090
I'm planning on getting some
of those good color bursts

516
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:20,093
in his skin to get this old,
amber-type look.

517
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:21,794
I'm noticing it's looking
a little flat,

518
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:24,296
so I'm doing some drybrushing
over that

519
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,465
to push those layers
of color deeper within the skin,

520
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,468
and, like, sink in the shadows,
and bring out the highlights.

521
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:31,636
All right.

522
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,705
That's good for now.

523
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,873
I sculpted on a pretty
big mannequin, dude,

524
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,040
but we'll see.

525
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:39,942
I know it's still gonna be
a little tight.

526
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:42,211
The face
is mostly pre-painted.

527
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:45,347
It needs some paint to bring it
a little more to life,

528
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:48,540
but the headpiece doesn't come
out as nicely as I planned.

529
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:50,739
My sculpture is a little rough
in the chest area,

530
00:22:50,773 --> 00:22:52,571
but it's a mummy, so...

531
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,736
and I'm thinking
it will come off okay.

532
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:56,370
Ten minutes left, guys.

533
00:23:03,743 --> 00:23:05,410
Looking around the shop,
everyone else

534
00:23:05,445 --> 00:23:07,912
has a paint job going, and
pretty much a finished piece,

535
00:23:07,946 --> 00:23:09,147
and I don't have any paint

536
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:12,416
on the body or arms or legs
at this point.

537
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:16,153
Let's go.

538
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:18,989
It's time, guys!

539
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,523
At last looks,
when I get there,

540
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:22,725
I'm gonna have to,
faster than a ninja,

541
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,892
put this thing on his face.

542
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:25,594
I am very worried at this point

543
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:28,430
that I'm not gonna get any paint
on him at all.

544
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,300
Coming up...

545
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:33,767
It's stuck, and I still have

546
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,535
to push it back
another four inches.

547
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,270
I'm sorry
about the face thing, dude.

548
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:39,405
At this point in the game,
mistakes will cost you.

549
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,206
This guy
is camera-ready.

550
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:48,350
So we get to last looks.

551
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:51,552
It's gonna be one
of those crazy times again.

552
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:53,253
We have one hour
to finish this makeup,

553
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:56,956
and I have to base out
my entire character,

554
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:59,659
put the face on,
and, then, put the wardrobe on.

555
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:02,528
So I have a ton of work to do.

556
00:24:02,563 --> 00:24:05,197
Let me see the inside
of your hands.

557
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:08,868
I put the telesis
over your eyebrows

558
00:24:08,902 --> 00:24:11,303
so the pros-aide
will stick to it.

559
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:13,372
Awesome. Thank you.

560
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:14,740
I glue his face down,

561
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:18,010
and I'm feeling
it's underpainted,

562
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:21,479
so I drybrush a gold
onto his body

563
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:25,048
to really lift them up from
the lower cracks and crevices.

564
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,049
How's that hold?

565
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:27,284
Do I need to make it tighter?

566
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:31,154
There's ten minutes left,

567
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:35,124
and I'm having some problems
putting the face on.

568
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:35,991
It's literally stuck,

569
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,926
and for it to fit properly,

570
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:40,662
I still have to push it back
another four inches.

571
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,230
I'm sorry
about the face thing, dude.

572
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:44,799
I thought it would fit better
than that.

573
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,400
I think the headdress
looks great.

574
00:24:46,434 --> 00:24:48,102
- Does that feel okay?
- Yeah.

575
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:49,703
It lines up right
above his eyes,

576
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,171
so you can see a little bit
of a brow.

577
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:03,148
That's it.
Time's up.

578
00:25:03,183 --> 00:25:04,449
Brushes down.

579
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:06,218
You're actually
looking pretty good.

580
00:25:06,252 --> 00:25:08,319
Nice.
Good job.

581
00:25:08,354 --> 00:25:10,755
I get the head on,
but it's sitting off his face

582
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:12,156
by about two inches,

583
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,657
but it still moves enough

584
00:25:13,692 --> 00:25:16,226
to where I'll be able
to get by.

585
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,203
Welcome to the
<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

586
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,938
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

587
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:34,940
Say hello to your judges.

588
00:25:34,974 --> 00:25:37,809
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effect Studio Glenn Hetrick...

589
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:40,044
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hey, Glenn.

590
00:25:40,078 --> 00:25:42,579
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

591
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:44,113
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Ve.

592
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:46,881
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

593
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,516
- Hello.
- Hey. - Hi.

594
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,384
This week,
your spotlight challenge

595
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:53,553
was to bring one of the ancient
Egyptian gods to life,

596
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:56,089
but since this challenge was
inspired by the <i>Book Of The Dead</i>

597
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:57,824
from the <i>Evil Dead</i> franchise,

598
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,292
we asked that you make
a mummified

599
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:01,761
or decomposed version of them.

600
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,495
So let's see
what you've come up with.

601
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,279
My crocodile God Sobek
walks out on stage.

602
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:27,249
It looks like he just came
right off that tablet,

603
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:28,251
and he's standing out there.

604
00:26:28,285 --> 00:26:29,720
It's a really cool presence,

605
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,522
and I'm so excited
to see this makeup.

606
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,404
I feel like the design
is super.

607
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:53,973
I'm hoping the judges notice
all of the hieroglyphics

608
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:55,775
that are carved into the skin.

609
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:58,510
I think he's pretty striking.

610
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,958
I do like the way he looks,

611
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:18,126
but the gauze
is a little too white,

612
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:21,262
and some of the paint job
does kind of meld together.

613
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:22,830
I'm definitely nervous
on this one.

614
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,449
Ra comes out on stage,

615
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:50,351
and it is
just "Ra-kin'" it, man.

616
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:52,052
The thing is cool.

617
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,720
I got a good feeling
about this.

618
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:14,791
I feel pretty good
about my makeup.

619
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,092
I'm pretty proud of it,

620
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:18,661
and if I'm gonna be eliminated
for this,

621
00:28:18,695 --> 00:28:19,895
I did a good makeup,

622
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:24,199
and this is a good one
to go home on.

623
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:31,638
Judges, why don't
you take a closer look?

624
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:39,310
Can you turn around for us?

625
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:40,945
Yeah.

626
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:42,346
Now, see, he even did the back.

627
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,914
- That's bitchin'.
- Wow.

628
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:47,050
There's some great
sculpting detail.

629
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:48,451
Yeah.

630
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:51,153
Thank you.

631
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,921
Odd things about this.

632
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:55,353
I personally
don't like the gloss.

633
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:57,319
It takes it out of the vibe

634
00:28:57,353 --> 00:29:00,321
that it is a dried, dead mummy.

635
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:01,355
Turn.

636
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,957
Yeah. Actually, see--

637
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,892
- That's cool.
- Wow, that's great.

638
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,093
That's emulating the wing.

639
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,764
There's some really nice
sculpture going on,

640
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,267
which is a total waste
because of the paint.

641
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:18,639
Yeah, the paint job everywhere
is kind of bizarre.

642
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,573
These high yellows, I don't
feel like they belong

643
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:22,340
in the color scheme at all.

644
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:26,009
It's a shame that these
are not blended much better.

645
00:29:26,044 --> 00:29:29,811
The judges seemed to be
spending a lot of time on mine.

646
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:31,246
It's a scary place to be in,

647
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,282
especially having been
on the bottom twice before.

648
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:35,349
All that's going
through my mind

649
00:29:35,384 --> 00:29:39,119
is "three strikes,
and you're out."

650
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:44,386
It's a shame that these
are not blended much better,

651
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,953
or at all.

652
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:48,856
The judges seemed to be
spending a lot of time on mine.

653
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:51,025
Having been on the bottom
twice before,

654
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,092
all that's going
through my mind

655
00:29:52,127 --> 00:29:53,560
is "three strikes,
and you're out."

656
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:56,063
This is always fun,
at least to me.

657
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:58,031
Mm-hmm.

658
00:29:58,613 --> 00:29:59,688
_

659
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:01,533
_

660
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:02,935
- Hmm.
- Full size.

661
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:07,139
Let's open and close,
and see how much it moves.

662
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,607
Not a great deal.

663
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:13,611
- Love the dryness of this one.
- I know.

664
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:15,680
- I really like the paint job.
- Yeah.

665
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,582
Can you open your mouth?

666
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,983
Snap at us.

667
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,885
Give me a grin.
Now, relax your forehead.

668
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,854
- Oh, okay. Oh.
- Good. Nice line, nice eyes.

669
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:27,657
It's like more than
camera-ready, all this stuff.

670
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:33,595
Glenn, this challenge
seems right up your alley.

671
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,997
How do you think they did?

672
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:36,965
You know, it is, and this
is one of my favorite challenges

673
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,734
I've ever seen on the show,

674
00:30:38,768 --> 00:30:40,969
and I mean this.

675
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:43,705
- I think you all did a great job.
- Thank you.

676
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:46,273
Okay, the judges would now
like to speak with each of you

677
00:30:46,308 --> 00:30:48,009
to learn more about your work.

678
00:30:48,043 --> 00:30:51,245
Wayne, you're up.

679
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:56,816
Wayne, tell us
about what you've done here.

680
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,051
The god that I have is Sobek.

681
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:01,153
The Egyptians used to pray
to Sobek to protect them

682
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:03,054
from the crocodiles
in the Nile river.

683
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:05,823
He's said to have a human body
with a crocodile head,

684
00:31:05,858 --> 00:31:08,926
and I wanted to keep the head
a different color from the body

685
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,861
to really have that contrast.

686
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,363
I think you did a lot
of great things,

687
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:13,631
and I'm pretty happy with this.

688
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,132
Thank you.

689
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,100
I'm glad to hear
that it's purposeful

690
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:19,769
that you go
from crocodile to human,

691
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:21,970
but there are probably
some better ways

692
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,638
to handle that transition.

693
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:24,839
Wayne, I'm really proud of you

694
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:27,607
because you finally did
a complete makeup job.

695
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:29,676
You finished
the whole character,

696
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,977
which is really awesome.

697
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,512
I love the whole chest cavity.

698
00:31:32,546 --> 00:31:34,647
It really looks
like he's sunken in.

699
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,282
I love all the textures
and everything.

700
00:31:36,317 --> 00:31:38,351
Did you not put eyes in there
for a reason?

701
00:31:38,385 --> 00:31:40,553
Yeah, I figured the eyes
would rot away, yeah,

702
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:42,087
so that's why I didn't want
to have it.

703
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:44,089
But it does look like
they are missing

704
00:31:44,123 --> 00:31:46,858
as opposed
to it's an orbital cavity.

705
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:48,694
That's really
my only negative criticism.

706
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:51,062
That is a good sculpt.

707
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:53,131
- Impressive work, man.
- Thank you.

708
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:54,499
Wayne, please step back.

709
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,700
Thanks.

710
00:31:58,303 --> 00:31:59,770
House.

711
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:07,643
Tell us about your character.

712
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:11,547
This is Thoth,
the Egyptian God of the Moon,

713
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,481
and he is known as the scribe,

714
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:17,052
so, I made his finger a pen,
and made his body the tablet.

715
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:21,089
I think that possibly
was kind of to your detriment.

716
00:32:21,123 --> 00:32:24,125
I think you've created
a bulkiness to this character

717
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,927
which made him look
a little chunky.

718
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:27,828
It takes away from the fact
that he's supposed

719
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,064
to be decimated and mummified
a little bit.

720
00:32:31,098 --> 00:32:32,499
Why did you paint him all gold?

721
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:36,239
Being a god, I thought he was
deserving of the color gold.

722
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:40,545
The fact that the color
is so unified is a huge issue,

723
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,614
because you've got
all this cool work,

724
00:32:42,648 --> 00:32:43,848
and we can't really see it

725
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:46,117
because it's all blended
together into one color.

726
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:48,019
That puts you in a bad spot
this week

727
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,287
because, at this point
in the game,

728
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:51,622
those kind of mistakes
will cost you.

729
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:52,990
There's some
really cool ideas in this.

730
00:32:53,024 --> 00:32:56,393
The mask does feel a little more
Venetian to me

731
00:32:56,427 --> 00:32:59,796
in terms of the sculptural form
language that you chose.

732
00:32:59,831 --> 00:33:02,265
I love the ideas,
but the makeup itself

733
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:04,867
just feels a little rough.

734
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,836
- House, you can step back.
- Thank you.

735
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,557
Kris, you're up.

736
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,577
All right, Kris.
Tell us about the concept.

737
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:19,079
My God is Khnum.

738
00:33:19,113 --> 00:33:21,881
He's the god of life
and creation.

739
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:27,486
In regard to the palette,
it's flat, dead, and is dull,

740
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,654
appropriately so.

741
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:31,956
I think you nailed it there.

742
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:36,794
From my perspective, this guy
is pretty much camera-ready,

743
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,829
and, up-close
camera ready.

744
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:41,832
There are moments on this
that are just so tight.

745
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:44,034
It's really quite beautiful.

746
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:47,803
- Thank you.
- This is really rad.

747
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:49,972
Like, I think you did
an exceptional job this week.

748
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:54,243
You handled the sculptural
detail in the face

749
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:55,877
with exquisite nuance.

750
00:33:55,912 --> 00:33:57,980
Also, it emotes really well.

751
00:33:58,014 --> 00:33:59,481
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

752
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:03,819
I really like this as well.
I love the texture of the skin.

753
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,320
I love all the coloration.

754
00:34:05,354 --> 00:34:08,957
I mean, it really reads
like a mummified body to me.

755
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:11,025
- Really well done.
- Thank you, Ve.

756
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:14,061
- Kris, you can step back.
- Thank you.

757
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,598
Anthony, step forward.

758
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,468
Tell us about the ideas
that you used

759
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:23,836
to bring this concept to life.

760
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,405
I had Anubis
who is the god of death

761
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,174
and also the patron god
of embalming,

762
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:31,876
so I wanted to keep his face
relatively preserved,

763
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:34,111
and the concept
was to make him proud

764
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:36,414
and having a lot of strength
within death.

765
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:37,848
I've got some huge issues

766
00:34:37,882 --> 00:34:42,185
with the angularity
of the sculpture of the face.

767
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,386
The biggest concern

768
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,921
is the proportion
of the death mask.

769
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:49,223
In order to accomplish that
regal feeling that you wanted,

770
00:34:49,258 --> 00:34:53,093
that headdress needs to be
pulled out much wider,

771
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:55,162
and the shoulders
need to be pulled out,

772
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:57,330
and that would have changed
the proportions

773
00:34:57,365 --> 00:34:58,798
of everything
that you're doing here.

774
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,033
I think that
you have accomplished

775
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:02,135
that <i>Evil Dead</i> look
with the face,

776
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:04,070
which is something I have
to give you credit for,

777
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,337
but it's disproportionate,

778
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:07,506
and I've seen so much better
from you.

779
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,708
Anthony, I think
you've totally ruined

780
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:11,809
your whole makeup
with that paint job.

781
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,945
I mean, you've completely
wiped out

782
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,312
any sculpting
that you did on the chest.

783
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:19,115
I mean, all I can see is a flat,
messy, splotchy thing.

784
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,783
This is not what I expect
out of you,

785
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,952
and I'm very disappointed
this week.

786
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:25,054
Getting past the paint
is a tough one,

787
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,958
but looking at the rib area
in particular,

788
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:31,928
there's some really
beautiful sculpture going on.

789
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,663
There's moments that I like,

790
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:36,264
but you kind of ruined
the whole thing

791
00:35:36,298 --> 00:35:38,432
as a result of the paint work.

792
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,101
Thank you, Anthony.
You can step back.

793
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:43,403
Thank you, guys.

794
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:45,805
Eric, you're up.

795
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,243
So, Eric, I bet
you really had fun this week.

796
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,845
Would you tell us
about your character, please?

797
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:59,648
My God was Ra.
He is the Sun god.

798
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:02,650
I wanted to go with a real kind
of '80s zombie style

799
00:36:02,685 --> 00:36:04,452
to kind of pay tribute
to <i>The Evil Dead,</i>

800
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:06,354
the stuff I grew up on.

801
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:09,557
You definitely got
the<i>Evil Dead</i>thing going on.

802
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,758
All in all, I think you did
a great character.

803
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:14,361
- I really love this makeup.
- Thank you.

804
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:15,896
Your propensity
and appreciation

805
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,299
for a particular period
in filmmaking and <i>Evil Dead</i>

806
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:22,866
feels so on the mark.

807
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:24,801
I want to caution you
about having

808
00:36:24,836 --> 00:36:26,036
this permanent open mouth.

809
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,904
I don't know
if that was necessary

810
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:30,473
to have it be open
all the time,

811
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:31,474
so, just be careful of that
in future.

812
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:33,042
Okay.

813
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:35,377
I am not a big fan
of the colors that you chose.

814
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:38,046
Contrast should have come
from brown, mummified tones,

815
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,148
and I don't understand
the redness in it.

816
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:43,518
But I think that your sculpting
style works well

817
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:46,020
because of the <i>Evil Dead</i> aspect
of this challenge.

818
00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:49,423
If that aspect
was not one of the parameters

819
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,791
of the challenge this week,

820
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:51,958
I think you'd be
in a lot of trouble.

821
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:54,460
Show me something
super realistic

822
00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:55,694
the next time
you're standing in front of me.

823
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:57,728
- I will.
- Okay.

824
00:36:57,762 --> 00:37:01,564
- Thank you, Eric.
- Thank you, guys.

825
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,632
Okay, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

826
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:05,501
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

827
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:07,703
while they make
their decisions.

828
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,907
All right, why don't
we talk about the looks

829
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:12,707
you like the most this week.

830
00:37:12,742 --> 00:37:14,376
Let's start with Wayne.

831
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,912
There's so many cool things
about that crocodile head,

832
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:21,582
and I don't think I can pick
anyone that's come before him

833
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:24,985
that has sculpted
as much as fast as well

834
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,786
as what Wayne is doing
on this show.

835
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,021
- It's unreal.
- And it was symmetrical...

836
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:31,723
- Yeah.
- And it had scale details.

837
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:33,090
I mean, are they perfect?
No.

838
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,793
But within the time
that he did it, they're perfect.

839
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:37,361
He wanted it specifically to be

840
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:39,162
a gator head with a human body.

841
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:40,963
I would have liked
to have seen it blend in

842
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:42,665
'cause it just looks a little
wrong to the eye, you know?

843
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:43,799
You're absolutely right,

844
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,300
and the eyes,
it's the same thing,

845
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:47,869
but I'm really happy with
this week's makeup from him.

846
00:37:47,903 --> 00:37:49,370
All right,
let's move on to Kris.

847
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,605
My favorite thing
was the use of subtlety.

848
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,103
It was exquisite.

849
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,035
He didn't go too far
with the zombification,

850
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:57,903
but it is not absent
from what he did.

851
00:37:57,938 --> 00:38:01,139
For me, it felt so complete.

852
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:02,907
I think it's the best thing
Kris has shown us so far.

853
00:38:02,942 --> 00:38:04,175
- Yeah, it is.
- I think so, too.

854
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,610
I think he did
a really great job this week.

855
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:08,012
- How about Eric?
- Oh, I loved it.

856
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:09,513
It was really clean.

857
00:38:09,547 --> 00:38:10,514
I know you didn't like
the redness.

858
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:11,982
That didn't bother me.

859
00:38:12,016 --> 00:38:14,917
I thought he did a really
cohesive, really nice makeup.

860
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:16,218
For this challenge,

861
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,287
that <i>Evil Dead</i> aesthetic
is what he's doing.

862
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:21,255
The problem is everything
Eric does looks like that

863
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,258
because he's so influenced
by those types of films.

864
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:27,125
That being said, this was
a fun, cohesive makeup for him.

865
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,594
All right,
so let's move on to the looks

866
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:31,195
you liked the least this week.

867
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,396
Let's start with House.

868
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:33,965
- Great idea.
- Strong concept.

869
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,366
Yeah, it was very, very strong.

870
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,397
Brilliant way to integrate
the scribe aspect of Thoth.

871
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,193
It was awesome conceptually,

872
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:44,493
but that's bigger than what
he was able to deliver.

873
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:45,526
Yeah, it was just too scruffy.

874
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:46,925
You know, I don't even know

875
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,826
that it would have been good
without the paint scheme.

876
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,059
It was very bulky.

877
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:51,292
It didn't read zombie.

878
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:52,891
It didn't read, you know,
<i>Evil Dead.</i>

879
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:54,625
Okay, let's move on to Anthony.

880
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,391
I was really disappointed
with Anthony this week.

881
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:59,491
If you would have told me
that was his makeup,

882
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:00,491
I wouldn't have believed you.

883
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:01,956
The paint is unfathomable.

884
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,456
It was just a big bunch
of splotches.

885
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:05,790
None of that bothers me

886
00:39:05,824 --> 00:39:09,121
as much as his inability
to look at that headdress,

887
00:39:09,156 --> 00:39:12,088
and the proportions,
and want to make it regal,

888
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:13,488
want to make it majestic,

889
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:14,588
and not be able
to look straight at it,

890
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:15,954
and go, "of course."

891
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:19,187
The Anubis headdress felt like
a toy on top of his head.

892
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:20,788
- So bad.
- All right, judges.

893
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:23,253
- Have you made your decisions?
- Yes. - Yes. - Yes.

894
00:39:23,287 --> 00:39:25,186
All right,
let's bring them back out.

895
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:37,518
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about the top looks?

896
00:39:37,552 --> 00:39:40,751
Kris, we love the ram look
of your makeup,

897
00:39:40,785 --> 00:39:42,617
and some of the smaller
sculptural details

898
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:43,883
were very impressive.

899
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:45,818
It was a very
comprehensive makeup.

900
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:49,983
Wayne, your use of proportion
was excellent this week.

901
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:52,983
We were also blown away
by how much killer sculpting

902
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:54,283
you pulled off.

903
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:56,216
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

904
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,915
The winner
of this challenge is...

905
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:07,847
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

906
00:40:07,882 --> 00:40:12,518
The winner
of this challenge is...

907
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:14,886
Kris.

908
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:16,121
Whew.

909
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:18,189
We thought you did
an exceptional job

910
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:19,958
at handling all
the various components

911
00:40:19,992 --> 00:40:21,125
of this week's challenge.

912
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,894
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

913
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:24,328
It means so much to me.

914
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:25,696
I am just floored.

915
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,832
I finally got the comment,
"this is camera ready."

916
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:30,867
That just makes me feel
so good as an artist.

917
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:32,368
Kris, congratulations.

918
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:34,770
You and Wayne can
head back to the makeup room.

919
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:37,239
Thank you, guys.

920
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:39,041
Eric, you are also safe

921
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:40,343
and can head
back to the makeup room.

922
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:42,678
Thank you, guys.

923
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:44,847
Good luck, guys.

924
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:48,583
Unfortunately,
that means, Anthony, House,

925
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:50,385
you guys were our bottom looks
this week,

926
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:53,254
and one of you
will be eliminated.

927
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,356
Please step forward.

928
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:03,530
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

929
00:41:03,564 --> 00:41:07,200
House, we thought you had
a lot of really good ideas,

930
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:10,069
but the overall appearance
was bulky

931
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:12,305
and more than a little rough.

932
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,775
Anthony, between
that angular facial sculpt

933
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,344
and the wretched paint job,
suffice it to say

934
00:41:18,378 --> 00:41:20,979
that this was not up
to your usual standards.

935
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:22,647
So who is going home tonight?

936
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:25,150
The person going home
tonight is...

937
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,954
House.

938
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:36,725
Your character looked
pretty cool from afar,

939
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,127
but when we got up close,

940
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,396
there were just too many
problems to overlook this week.

941
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,233
House, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

942
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:47,035
Anthony, that means
you are safe this week

943
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:50,771
and can head
back to the makeup room.

944
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:52,806
Thank you, guys.

945
00:41:52,841 --> 00:41:54,908
House, while you
have been with us,

946
00:41:54,942 --> 00:41:58,477
you've brought some absolutely
huge concepts to the table.

947
00:41:58,512 --> 00:42:01,113
And I can't wait to see,
as you grow into your skill set,

948
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:03,049
how you express yourself
as an artist

949
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:04,750
and bring those things to life.

950
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:06,352
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

951
00:42:06,386 --> 00:42:10,056
House, it's really been great
having you here with us.

952
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:12,192
Please head back to the makeup
room and pack up your kit.

953
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:15,094
- Thank you, guys.
- Good night, House.

954
00:42:15,128 --> 00:42:17,630
I should have done better,
certainly.

955
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:20,967
My hieroglyphics
could have been read better.

956
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:25,404
I bid my <i>adieu.</i>

957
00:42:25,439 --> 00:42:26,706
Dude...

958
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,040
You know it.

959
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:30,809
This season had some incredibly
talented people,

960
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:32,043
and I fought
with the best of them.

961
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:33,945
- You're gonna be missed.
- Thank you.

962
00:42:33,979 --> 00:42:35,413
I definitely enjoyed
my experience here.

963
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:38,348
How many people really get
to represent their artwork?

964
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:40,750
There's many things
that I still want to create.

965
00:42:40,784 --> 00:42:45,621
So I'm going to go home
and make a bunch of new stuff.

966
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:47,022
It's all good.
