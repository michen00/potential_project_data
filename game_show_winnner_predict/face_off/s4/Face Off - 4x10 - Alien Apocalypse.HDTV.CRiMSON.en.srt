00:00:01,385 --> 00:00:03,586
Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:09,659
Kris's Egyptian mummy
brought him his fourth win.

3
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:11,561
It means so much to me.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,429
And in a difficult elimination,

5
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:16,099
House was sent home.

6
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,201
Now just four artists remain.

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:21,371
Tonight, the artists are transported
to a whole new world.

8
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:23,740
Being on the set of<i>Defiance</i>
is pretty amazing.

9
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,441
Action.

10
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:27,777
And with only three
advancing to the finale,

11
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,939
the stakes
are higher than ever.

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,914
I'm panicking right now.

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,750
I'm feeling completely lost.

14
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,486
This is a nightmare for me.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,055
There's a cool vibe
to the character here.

16
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:40,356
It's so mediocre.

17
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:42,191
I think
it's anyone's game right now.

18
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:45,561
Guys, come on, he's a mutant.
Give him a break.

19
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:47,563
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

20
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:50,600
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

21
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,068
in New York and Paris,

22
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:55,204
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,

23
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,808
and $100,000.

24
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:02,345
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic?

25
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,414
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

27
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:49,992
Hanging in there?

28
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:53,062
Yeah. You know,
yesterday was pretty rough.

29
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:55,631
I thought they were gonna
call my name. You know?

30
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,133
Last week, I really believed

31
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,669
that it was gonna
be me going home.

32
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,371
But there's one challenge left
to get to the finale,

33
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:05,174
and all the time my mind is,
"don't be in the bottom again."

34
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,476
Sucks that House
is gone, though.

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,777
Yeah. I'm really bummed.

36
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,779
It's definitely tough
saying good-bye.

37
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:10,913
It is, man.

38
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,448
We're down
to the final four now.

39
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,951
Somebody's going home.
Nobody wants to go home.

40
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:17,687
It's time to really
push the envelope

41
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,088
and make sure
the makeups are shiny.

42
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,324
Final four, guys.
Final four.

43
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:23,526
Final four.

44
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:33,136
We're in the lab.

45
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,605
McKenzie's standing there
with four monitors,

46
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,574
and again, there's
that whole fear of the unknown.

47
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,943
- Good morning, guys.
- Good morning.

48
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:42,979
For the minds
behind<i>Battlestar Galactica</i>

49
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,380
and <i>Caprica</i>

50
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:48,885
comes <i>Defiance,</i> a sci-fi
drama series and video game

51
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,053
about human and alien species

52
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,256
forced to coexist on Earth
after years of war.

53
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,758
Now before I tell you more, I'd
like to introduce you to someone

54
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,727
who has helped
bring <i>Defiance</i> to life.

55
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,496
Please welcome executive
producer and co-creator

56
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:04,433
Kevin Murphy.

57
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:05,434
Kevin, thank you
so much for being here.

58
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:06,435
Oh, thank you for having me.

59
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,537
So can you tell these guys

60
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,772
just a little bit more
about <i>Defiance?</i>

61
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:11,574
<i>Defiance</i> is a brand-new
science-fiction adventure drama

62
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,010
set 35 years in the future

63
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:17,713
after aliens arrive
and war breaks out.

64
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:19,749
The setting is a small
frontier town called Defiance.

65
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,386
Seven races of aliens
and human beings

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,520
learning to live side by side,

67
00:03:24,555 --> 00:03:26,889
it's a melting pot
bubbling over

68
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:28,124
with really,
really cool creatures.

69
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:30,626
<i>Defiance</i>has got
a lot of great concepts,

70
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:32,061
and it's got
really cool makeup.

71
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,197
So I'm really excited
about this.

72
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:35,398
Your spotlight challenge

73
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,800
is focused on some
of the more exotic aliens

74
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,469
in the <i>Defiance</i> universe.

75
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:42,104
And they are Liberata,

76
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,442
99er, Bioman, Volge,

77
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,012
Sensoth, and Mutant.

78
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,582
I really like the Mutant.
It's right up my alley.

79
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:55,117
I just don't want
any of those fuzzy things.

80
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,786
If all these aliens

81
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,521
happen to be living together
in the town of <i>Defiance,</i>

82
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:01,224
they might begin to procreate.

83
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:04,260
So your spotlight challenge
is to choose

84
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:06,929
two of these alien races
and create their offspring.

85
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,066
I love aliens
because I think they'll give me

86
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,101
the chance to do
something more original.

87
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:15,504
Anthony, you're up first.

88
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,608
I decide to pick
the Mutant and the Liberata

89
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:19,609
because I like
more organic things.

90
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:23,112
Kris.

91
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:27,149
I'm going for the Bioman
because he's extremely buff.

92
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,384
And then I picked the Mutant

93
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,419
because I like
his deformed body.

94
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:31,420
Damn it.

95
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,689
Kris grabs the last Mutant.

96
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,292
This is not going
the way I hoped it would go.

97
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:39,328
Wayne.

98
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:43,032
I'm watching
all the characters I want

99
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,734
get snatched up,

100
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,168
and it's driving me crazy.

101
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,473
Eric, your pick.

102
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:53,809
I pick the 99er
and the Sensoth.

103
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:56,045
Whatever.

104
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,049
The one thing I did not
want to get was a fuzzy critter.

105
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,618
Not happy about this.

106
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:03,853
Now, before you get started,

107
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,521
we've got
one more surprise for you.

108
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,889
Kevin?

109
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,457
If you guys really want
to get inspired,

110
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:09,859
you've got to immerse yourself
in the world,

111
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,327
and for that reason,
we're sending you

112
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,628
to the actual town of <i>Defiance</i>

113
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:15,364
in Toronto, Ontario,
where you're gonna

114
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,200
tour the set and spend some time
among the actual aliens.

115
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,869
That's right.

116
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,203
Oh, man.

117
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,706
Unfortunately, due
to some family circumstances,

118
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,342
Eric will not
be joining you guys.

119
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,777
Everything's okay,
but he'll be staying behind.

120
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:31,414
I'm really bummed
I can't go to Canada.

121
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:33,616
Nothing seems to be working
in my favor at this point.

122
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,551
For the rest of you, you're
headed straight to the airport.

123
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,120
Have fun, guys.
I'll see you soon.

124
00:05:38,155 --> 00:05:41,357
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

125
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:46,529
Never been to Toronto before,

126
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,864
so this is a really exciting
experience for me.

127
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:50,833
And to actually meet
the <i>Defiance</i> makeup artist,

128
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,168
there's nothing
better than that.

129
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:53,803
- This place is awesome.
- I know, man. It's sick.

130
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,271
Frickin' crazy.

131
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:58,641
It's just so cool to be here
on the set of<i>Defiance.</i>

132
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:01,744
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

133
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,017
- Hello.
- How's it going?

134
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,752
Good. Welcome to defiance.

135
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,454
Nice to meet you.
I'm Stephanie.

136
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:15,524
I play Irisa, and I'm an
Irathient alien, as you can see.

137
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,861
We're very feral
and quite wild,

138
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:20,796
and we talk
when we need to talk,

139
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,298
but otherwise
we're not interested

140
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,233
in having a chitchat,
so you're very lucky

141
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:26,402
today, guys.

142
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:27,803
Is that a silicone piece?

143
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,039
Yeah, yeah, you can probably
see, like, it's all...

144
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:31,173
Oh, yeah.

145
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,942
So you guys
should go and meet Allan.

146
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,944
He's the guy that put
all my prosthetic on.

147
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,381
And I'll see you later.
I've got a scene to shoot.

148
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,484
I'm so excited
to meet with Allan Cooke.

149
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:43,786
I can't wait to ask him secrets.
Hopefully he tells me.

150
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,989
Today we're gonna glue on an
Irathient makeup to Lauren here.

151
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:48,324
Awesome.

152
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:49,792
Special effects
is, you know, a dream of mine,

153
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,894
and the makeup
of all these characters

154
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,629
and getting a chance
to see them come to life

155
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,500
is truly inspiring.

156
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:58,934
So you normally
do pre-painting?

157
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,805
As much as you can do, so
there's less time in the chair.

158
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,876
We'll call that done.

159
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,577
- It looks fantastic.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

160
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,947
- Thanks.
- Great job.

161
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,716
- Mark.
- Action.

162
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,918
There's Stephanie.

163
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:18,721
- We're gonna drink a toast.
- You want me to drink this?

164
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:21,257
Then we're gonna
talk about your uncle Eddie.

165
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,026
It was really co
and inspiring to see everything.

166
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,394
It'd be a dream come true
to work on this set.

167
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:27,730
Can't wait to get back
in the shop and get creative.

168
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:29,765
I know.

169
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,607
We're back in LA,

170
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:40,076
and we're all jazzed up
and ready to start

171
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,444
the <i>Defiance</i> challenge

172
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,579
and create an alien offspring.

173
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:47,249
We pick our models,
and we start sketching.

174
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:51,487
The two species that I have
are Bioman and Mutant.

175
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,622
I want to use
the bulk of the Bioman,

176
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,424
gonna make him really buff,

177
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,060
also gonna keep the glowing
green eyes and teeth

178
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,062
because I figured the Mutant

179
00:08:00,097 --> 00:08:03,165
would spoil the perfect gene
from the Bioman,

180
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,702
which would just make him
a huge monster.

181
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,871
My concept is basically

182
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,041
mixing the Liberata
with the Mutant,

183
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,409
making a Mutant Liberata.

184
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:16,112
Gonna be taking the main
structure from the Liberata.

185
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,714
He has, like, a gorilla-shaped
head, rolls on his neck,

186
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,249
and also has a nose
that looks like a baboon.

187
00:08:20,283 --> 00:08:22,051
It's a very grumpy character,

188
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,420
and from the Mutant,

189
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:26,355
I'm just going to make it
very grotesque,

190
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:29,625
give him a hump, and make things
very asymmetrical.

191
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,730
I look at the Liberata
and the Bioman,

192
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,465
how I'm gonna
breed these two together.

193
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,934
The Liberata is basically naked,
and the Bioman

194
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,604
is all muscle with
these little, spandex shorts.

195
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,339
So it's like,
oh, here we go again

196
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:44,907
with another
full-body creature suit.

197
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,910
I'm gonna incorporate a lot of
characteristics of the Bioman.

198
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,212
The Liberata
has texture down the nose,

199
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:51,947
so I want
that element in there.

200
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:53,015
And the Liberata's face

201
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,316
is a little bit wider
than the Bioman.

202
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,785
So I'm gonna widen
the alien's face out.

203
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,956
Hopefully, if I have time,
I can lay some hair in there.

204
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:03,959
It's really weird to take

205
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:05,928
something so big
like the Sensoth

206
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,930
and combine it with the 99er,

207
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,034
which is actually a very skinny,
mechanical creature.

208
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,670
I keep coming up with this
big, sasquatch-looking thing

209
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,673
with a little bit
more bulkier mechanics.

210
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:21,143
I can't stand my concept.

211
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:22,778
So I'm just gonna
sculpt a Sensoth,

212
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:27,116
put machine parts on it,
and see what I come up with.

213
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,153
What I really wanna do
is get the face blacked in

214
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:36,158
as well as black in
the whole torso piece and cowl.

215
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:38,394
I'm working with wood clay

216
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:41,063
because I can add
a lot of bulk real quick.

217
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,331
I definitely want
to get the face sculpted,

218
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,400
so I want to spend
more time on it

219
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,001
to really get
the expression that I want.

220
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:48,837
We all really want
to impress the judges,

221
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,105
so we're all going big.

222
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,407
Everyone's sculpting
these massive pieces

223
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:53,442
because no one's
gonna play it safe.

224
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,277
Wow.

225
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:56,979
Kris's Mutant's really cool.

226
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,882
It's right up my alley.

227
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:03,419
But I'm stuck
with the aliens that I got,

228
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:05,921
and I'm not really
getting into it.

229
00:10:05,956 --> 00:10:08,057
This is ridiculous, isn't it?

230
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,558
I got freakin' <i>Harry And</i>
<i>The Henderson</i> meets <i>Robocop.</i>

231
00:10:09,593 --> 00:10:11,193
You know?
I'm just like, shit.

232
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:12,194
Yeah.

233
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,631
Definitely not
my first selection.

234
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:16,765
I'm feeling completely lost.

235
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,534
It's not a good thing.

236
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,437
Especially
with that clock ticking.

237
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:22,571
I think this is probably

238
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:25,040
the first time any of us
are seeing Eric Fox

239
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:28,277
a little worried
and unhappy with his concept.

240
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,046
I'm really
just getting bummed out.

241
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,816
I already know that

242
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,885
I'm in a world of hurt
for this competition.

243
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,354
Fuck.

244
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,889
Coming up...

245
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:43,158
I only have
half my body molded.

246
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:44,159
Holy shit.

247
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,562
Gotta go to plan B.

248
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:47,796
He had a major blowout.

249
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,565
Mine is probably
the weakest character up there.

250
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:53,235
Going into the finale,
this is inexcusable.

251
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,757
It's really weird to take

252
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:02,758
something so big
like the Sensoth

253
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,860
and combine it with the 99er,

254
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:07,696
which is actually a very skinny,
mechanical creature.

255
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,500
So at this point, I don't know
if I can pull this off,

256
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:13,301
but I'm gonna try.

257
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:17,205
There's only three artists
in the finale,

258
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,640
and I really need to get
one of those spots.

259
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:22,344
- Looks good.
- Thanks, bro.

260
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:37,125
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

261
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,126
We're gonna
do a little walkthrough,

262
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,327
see how you're doing.

263
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:41,229
All right, so which two aliens
did you pick?

264
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:43,565
I picked the Liberata
and the Mutant.

265
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,835
How exactly are you
going to utilize both of them?

266
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:48,403
He's gonna have the hunchback,

267
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,105
and his face and head
are gonna be deformed.

268
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,641
Are his legs larger,
to the point where you need

269
00:11:52,675 --> 00:11:54,810
- maybe an oversized pant?
- Didn't really think of that.

270
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:57,879
Wrap it in some foam,
but then use an oversized pant

271
00:11:57,914 --> 00:12:00,382
to give that heftiness
to the body.

272
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,417
- You chose...
- Liberata.

273
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:03,652
Bioman and Liberata.

274
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,754
I'm trying to marry the two

275
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:07,222
to try to keep
the lip area and the nose.

276
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,191
Similar to what Liberata is,

277
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:11,226
where it's very wide
in the lip and the chin area,

278
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,495
then also bring in
the human element.

279
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:15,731
With the chest here
and the muscles in the neck,

280
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:16,998
really make them big enough.

281
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,200
Think of that
when you're doing the chest.

282
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:20,635
Taking your shoulder muscles

283
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,170
all the way out
to the end of your shoulders.

284
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:23,438
Okay.

285
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:26,942
I have the cross
between the Mutant and Bioman.

286
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,311
So he's a big monster.

287
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:30,679
I think the fun thing is

288
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,848
is I can have a little bit
of freedom with the anatomy,

289
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,117
since the Mutant is so strange

290
00:12:35,151 --> 00:12:36,785
and nothing has
to really match up.

291
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,755
When you finally
get this out in rubber...

292
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:41,990
- Mm-hmm.
- ...this is going to be a problem,

293
00:12:42,024 --> 00:12:43,291
- so tear out...
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:46,561
About three lines
from the inside,

295
00:12:46,596 --> 00:12:48,063
- and that allows him to do...
- Have some movement.

296
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:49,231
Gives him
a little bit more freedom.

297
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,232
Freedom.

298
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,333
That's a great idea.

299
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,902
He has the 99er, Sensoth.

300
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm using the size of him
with the mechanics of him.

301
00:12:58,474 --> 00:13:00,142
Figured that would be
the best way

302
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:02,210
to incorporate
these two characters.

303
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:05,380
Are you going
to bring hair down to the legs?

304
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,382
I'm bringing hair
down the stomach.

305
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,519
But I definitely want
to tie in a beard.

306
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:12,554
- Well, keep going.
- Thank you, guys.

307
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:16,458
I'm really bummed I'm stuck
making <i>Harry And The Hendersons.</i>

308
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:19,027
But I think this is definitely
a good opportunity

309
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:21,029
because I can show the judges

310
00:13:21,063 --> 00:13:24,466
cleaner character makeup
without all the gags and getups.

311
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,068
All right, guys.
We're heading out.

312
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:29,971
Buh-bye.

313
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,277
The upper body
is close to finished,

314
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,846
so when I come in the next day,
I can sculpt the face mold

315
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,381
and try to get him ready
for foam latex.

316
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:42,484
Luckily, I only need to sculpt
a small face piece

317
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:46,454
and not a whole neck piece
'cause that's on the bodysuit.

318
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,759
Oh, cool.

319
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:54,863
I got a lot done today, but I
still got a lot more to do.

320
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:56,031
That's time, guys.

321
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:58,400
But by the end of the day,

322
00:13:58,434 --> 00:14:01,970
I have had a revelation.

323
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:04,973
I'm actually
really liking my piece.

324
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:14,449
Yeah! Whoo!

325
00:14:14,483 --> 00:14:17,152
So it's day two.
We have ten hours.

326
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,421
My biggest priority right now is
to get the sculpture finished.

327
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:22,157
That way, by the end of the day,
I can run foam in it.

328
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:24,593
Trying to give him that
really big neck in the back.

329
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:26,928
- Awesome, dude.
- Yeah.

330
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:33,268
Get a good look at you.

331
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:36,705
I'm going to bounce back and
forth from the body to the face.

332
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,974
I know that I got
a lot of work ahead of me,

333
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:39,975
but I'm gonna
do the best I can.

334
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:42,244
Awesome.

335
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,548
Just trying to make it
as gross as I possibly can.

336
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:47,549
Yeah, it looks good.

337
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,650
There's a lot at stake.

338
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:49,885
I'm doing this for my family,

339
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,987
to repay them
for everything they've done.

340
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,822
It's something
that I know is obtainable,

341
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:55,790
but I can't take that
for granted.

342
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,293
I just gotta do the best I can

343
00:14:58,327 --> 00:15:00,295
and hopefully
get to the finale.

344
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:02,797
Just so much clay.

345
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:04,366
Hard to believe
that we're applying this shit

346
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,367
tomorrow morning, huh?

347
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:06,668
Here we go.

348
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:08,103
I don't want to let
my wife and kids down.

349
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:11,306
$100,000
would change our lives.

350
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,110
So it's imperative
that I get these molds done.

351
00:15:15,144 --> 00:15:18,146
'Cause I can't be doing any of
that stuff on application day.

352
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:22,550
I really want to manage
my time efficiently,

353
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:25,787
so I decide to call
the sculpture finished

354
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:28,924
and start molding.

355
00:15:32,261 --> 00:15:34,129
The sculpt
is going pretty well.

356
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:38,500
Just trying to bring the Bioman
and Liberata together.

357
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:42,671
It's taking me
longer than I expected.

358
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:47,208
I start to spray my body
sculpture with crystal clear.

359
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:51,846
I want to let that really dry up
so it de-molds a lot easier.

360
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:54,516
If you molded something without
putting any of the spray on,

361
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,320
it would stick inside that mold
like you wouldn't believe.

362
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:01,623
We have, like, two hours
left in the shop.

363
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:02,857
I really, really have to
start molding this.

364
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:05,060
If I can't
get this mold finished,

365
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,996
I'm gonna be screwed.

366
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,597
Everybody else is doing

367
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:11,666
these giant creature suits
with arms, torsos,

368
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:14,269
backs, and cowls,
all into one piece,

369
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,237
and some of the other artists

370
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,744
still haven't started
molding their characters yet.

371
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,394
_

372
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,244
So I feel a lot more at ease
than the rest of the guys.

373
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,445
_

374
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:28,483
The clock is ticking faster
than I've ever seen it tick.

375
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,885
I'm running really behind.

376
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,154
Oh, man.

377
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:34,756
It's really important
that I get these molds done up

378
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,926
because the foam
has to bake overnight,

379
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,561
and I don't want to have
to run it in polyfoam.

380
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,696
It's gonna kill the movement

381
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:44,232
and not be as comfortable
on the actor.

382
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,368
I gotta get this in foam latex.

383
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:51,773
Everybody's scrambling
to get their molds done,

384
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,442
and I'm struggling
to get my piece open.

385
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,077
Yo, Kris, can I get a hand?

386
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:57,645
Oh, jeez, man.

387
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,548
Luckily, Kris helps me,
and I'm able to open it.

388
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,484
Thanks a lot.
Thank you, dude.

389
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,185
And now I have
to really clean it out

390
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,454
and get it ready for foam.

391
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:08,256
But time is definitely
a factor here.

392
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,225
- How many minutes?
- Not enough.

393
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,359
God.

394
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:12,794
If I can't
get this mold finished

395
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,697
and run it for foam, I'm--
I'm gonna be screwed

396
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:17,332
'cause I'm gonna have
to run it in polyfoam.

397
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,967
It's gonna suck to have a shit.

398
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:20,802
That's something that could
ultimately send me home.

399
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,604
It's impossible.

400
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:25,340
This is the final four.
One person has to leave.

401
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:26,741
I really don't want
to be sent home tomorrow.

402
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:28,643
Fucking sucks.

403
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,143
Everybody is pretty
quiet in the lab.

404
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:37,305
And then you hear...

405
00:17:39,322 --> 00:17:40,515
Eric Fox.

406
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,234
He's a maniac.

407
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,362
Mine's gonna come out
with a freaking beard.

408
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,249
His laugh is so unique...

409
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,557
When he laughs,
you start laughing.

410
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,125
And you're crying
and laughing because

411
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,655
you're laughing
at him laughing.

412
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:01,533
Yeah, buddy.

413
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:07,176
It's day two.

414
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,212
I'm molding, but it's taking me
longer than I expected.

415
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,180
I know I'm definitely
not gonna be able

416
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,683
to get the molds finished
in time for the foam latex.

417
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,485
I'm not happy about that

418
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,654
'cause I'm gonna have to run it
in polyfoam tomorrow.

419
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:20,290
And that's the last thing
I want to do

420
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:23,393
because the movement
on polyfoam is very limited.

421
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:26,329
I'm really stressed out
at this point.

422
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,765
I only have one half
of my body molded,

423
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,334
and the stuff takes, like,
half an hour to even set up.

424
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,503
There's no way
I can get these molds

425
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:37,874
completed in time
for foam latex.

426
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:43,446
This is a hernia right here.

427
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:48,685
These molds are really heavy.

428
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,219
Holy shit.

429
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,988
The clay is stuck
inside the mold.

430
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,324
I thought the clay was just
gonna peel right out of there,

431
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,758
but I'm sadly mistaken.

432
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,927
It's gonna take a long time
to get it all cleaned out.

433
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:01,397
And just like Wayne and Eric,

434
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,865
I'm not gonna be able
to run it in foam latex.

435
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,033
Gotta go to plan B.

436
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:07,070
Latex and polyfoam.
I'm disappointed.

437
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,871
It's just not gonna have
the same quality

438
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:10,473
of movement as foam latex.

439
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:12,842
This is the first time
I fucked up.

440
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:16,245
- Gonna have a polyfoam party.
- Come on.

441
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,885
How's your mold coming,
Anthony?

442
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,654
Fine.
I nearly got the core out.

443
00:19:24,688 --> 00:19:26,789
The clay's all stuck
in the back of the mold,

444
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:29,092
as well as on the core.

445
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,796
I take him outside, get as much
clay out as I possibly can.

446
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:37,233
In the last second,
I'm able to finish it.

447
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,602
That's time!

448
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,038
- Damn it.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

449
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:45,641
Anthony is the only one
that made the deadline.

450
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,143
Me, Wayne, and Kris

451
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:49,379
get to have a polyfoam party.
In the morning.

452
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,847
What a day, man.

453
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,081
Whoo! Fun times.

454
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:55,585
This is not a party
I wanted to be invited to.

455
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:57,820
But I RSVPed that one.

456
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:09,966
Whoo-hoo!

457
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,967
It's application day.

458
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,336
We got four hours in the shop

459
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,072
and one hour at last looks
at the stage.

460
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:17,440
Three of us are gonna
walk into the finale,

461
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:18,608
and one of us is gonna go home.

462
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:20,977
So we gotta do
whatever we gotta do.

463
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,479
My foam pieces
came out beautifully.

464
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,882
And that's a great thing
because I have all the time

465
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:30,586
I need to paint before I
start applying and assembling.

466
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:37,293
- How you doing?
- Hey.

467
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,228
That's the face
that you're gonna be wearing.

468
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:40,329
You have
this real powerful neck.

469
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,697
Cool.

470
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:43,166
But I'm still
working on the body,

471
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,400
so I'll be a little bit,
so just relax, and I'll be back.

472
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:46,569
Okay, cool.

473
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:50,072
Eric and Wayne and I
have to run our suit molds

474
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:51,207
out of latex and polyfoam.

475
00:20:51,241 --> 00:20:52,875
I'm worried

476
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,911
'cause I've probably got the
biggest piece out of 'em all.

477
00:20:54,945 --> 00:20:57,413
Yeah, I'm gonna get you
going here in a second.

478
00:20:57,448 --> 00:21:00,049
I still gotta clean clay
out of my mold,

479
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,352
brush latex, foam it,
seam it up, paint it.

480
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,522
This is really cutting
into my four-hour application.

481
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,925
I think all three of us

482
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,092
are feeling the pressure
on this one.

483
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:12,628
I'm running pieces
on application day.

484
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:14,030
That's not where I want to be.

485
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,533
I'm painting
based on what the judges said

486
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,635
about the last challenge
with my spattering.

487
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,071
They said I overdid it, so I'm
gonna hold back a little bit

488
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:26,409
to create a more cohesive look.

489
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:27,710
So now it's time
to de-mold

490
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,612
the polyfoam from the mold,

491
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,247
and I'm having a hell of a time
getting this thing opened.

492
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,483
It's a very large piece.

493
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,151
I'm trying to pull it apart,

494
00:21:35,185 --> 00:21:36,252
and I'm just
sweating everywhere.

495
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:38,754
I'm hitting it, breaking it,

496
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,857
just ripping the mold apart.

497
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:43,059
I finally get the piece
out of the mold, and actually,

498
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,561
it looks really nice.

499
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,230
_

500
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:48,331
As I'm opening my mold,

501
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:49,799
I see that my appliance

502
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,100
is ripping right in half.

503
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:52,835
Oh, man, what a mess.

504
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,537
I need to fix this,
or I'm going home.

505
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,072
Oh, wow.

506
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,673
The thing
that's going through my mind

507
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,276
is how lucky I am not to be
in that polyfoam party.

508
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,446
I am definitely
in a much better spot

509
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,614
than I feel
the rest of the guys are.

510
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:05,848
How's it coming, Anthony?

511
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:07,216
Good. I'm just about
to start applying.

512
00:22:07,251 --> 00:22:09,585
How's yours?
It come off okay?

513
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,920
I can't complain about it.
I got it out.

514
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,955
How's everybody else's?

515
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,123
Kris's ripped pretty bad.

516
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:15,691
He's patching it
and stuff, so...

517
00:22:15,726 --> 00:22:16,993
Oh, really?

518
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:18,227
I'm panicking.

519
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:20,229
My suit ripped in half.

520
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:22,765
I've got major rips
on the seams.

521
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,833
I've gotta
make something of this.

522
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,234
So I take dental dam.

523
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:27,904
I start barging it
on the inside of the appliance

524
00:22:27,938 --> 00:22:29,605
to keep everything together.

525
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,043
I have to do it.
I have no other choice.

526
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:35,344
- Final four.
- Yeah.

527
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,546
Everybody goes crazy.

528
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,481
How much time do we have?

529
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:39,482
An hour and 56 minutes.

530
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:40,716
Oh, my God.

531
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:44,554
It's really important
that this piece turns out

532
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:48,224
because it is
the main part of my makeup.

533
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:51,427
I'm just really nervous.

534
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:53,696
Luckily, my piece
comes out very easy.

535
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,431
That's at least some good news.

536
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:00,836
I'm just gonna get
a base coat on here real fast.

537
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:02,004
Just keep your eyes closed.

538
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,339
Time is running out,

539
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:05,408
and I'm taking a lot of time
applying all the pieces.

540
00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:07,143
So I look around,

541
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,812
and everybody has at least some
type of paint on their model.

542
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,447
I'm pissed off at myself,

543
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:14,750
because once again, I'm gonna
be painting at last looks.

544
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:15,952
What's the time?

545
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:18,921
Ten minutes, guys!

546
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,896
I'm running out of time,
but I still have to do

547
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,964
some sparse hair work

548
00:23:27,998 --> 00:23:31,367
while keeping
most of him very fleshy

549
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:36,005
and very grotesque,
just like the mutant is.

550
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,641
Time's up, guys!

551
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:41,277
I pulled through. I actually
got the suit on the guy.

552
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,412
I've got everything patched up,

553
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:46,148
so I have something to start
with once I get to last looks.

554
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:47,917
Coming up...

555
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:49,418
Oh, my God.

556
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,187
Just stressing out.

557
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,888
It's anatomically atrocious.

558
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,590
I think
it's a bitchin' character.

559
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,058
Who is the winner
of this challenge

560
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:59,228
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

561
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,496
We're in last looks,
and we have an hour left.

562
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,966
I need to do
the whole entire paint job.

563
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,936
If it's not finished
and the judges know that,

564
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,937
then they're gonna
send me home.

565
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:18,005
The atmosphere is pretty crazy.

566
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,374
Basically, the other guys don't
have anything fully painted,

567
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:24,245
so they're rushing
to get it done.

568
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,749
I got one hour
to finish this thing.

569
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:32,553
It's just gonna be
paint, paint, paint.

570
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:35,890
There's a lot more seaming
that has to be done

571
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:37,124
than what I thought.

572
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:38,893
I'm just aggravated at myself

573
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,929
because I have a weakness,
and that's time management

574
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:44,765
and getting pieces
finished and pre-painted.

575
00:24:46,835 --> 00:24:48,836
Oh, my God, dude.

576
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,606
This is probably one of the most
difficult challenges I've had.

577
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,543
Just stressing out.
It's a madhouse.

578
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,145
Time, time.

579
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,181
30 minutes!

580
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:02,249
It's a nightmare
right now for me

581
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:05,319
because I have 30 minutes left
to paint everything.

582
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:08,723
Once again, I just
grab a 5-inch chip brush,

583
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,924
and I start painting
as fast as I can.

584
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,559
Gotta paint you like a house.

585
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:16,230
At this point, I'm pretty sure
that I'm gonna be going home.

586
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,331
Damn.

587
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,500
Come on.

588
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,638
You'll have dirt
on your hands too.

589
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:26,107
The beard on this piece
is very important

590
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:27,675
because it's gonna be
covering the neck seam.

591
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:30,978
It's very important that I
at least get something up there

592
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,814
before time's up.

593
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,253
Time's up, brushes down!

594
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,055
All right, well,
that's what we got.

595
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,524
This is the worst situation
I could be in.

596
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:45,059
There's only one person
getting eliminated,

597
00:25:45,093 --> 00:25:47,061
and three are going
to the finale.

598
00:25:47,095 --> 00:25:49,864
I'm kinda worried because I
don't have a finished paint job.

599
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:51,666
Oh, well.

600
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:04,578
Welcome
to the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

601
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:08,549
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

602
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:10,351
And three of you
will move on to our finale.

603
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:14,054
Say hello to your judges.

604
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:16,590
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio Glenn Hetrick.

605
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:18,325
- Good evening.
- Hey, Glenn.

606
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,594
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

607
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,529
- Gentlemen.
- Hello.

608
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:24,899
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

609
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,333
- Hello.
- Hi.

610
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:27,701
And joining
our panel this week,

611
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:30,404
he's a highly accomplished
producer and director,

612
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:32,539
whose work includes <i>CSI,</i>

613
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,342
<i>Caprica,</i>
and <i>Battlestar Galactica.</i>

614
00:26:35,377 --> 00:26:38,445
He's also producer
and director of <i>Defiance.</i>

615
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,815
Please welcome Michael Nankin.

616
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,550
It's just really cool to have

617
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,586
somebody so close to the project
looking at our characters

618
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,489
to see if we did them justice.

619
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,424
Michael, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

620
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:51,625
Thank you for having me.

621
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,727
I can't wait to see
what you guys have.

622
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,629
This week,
your spotlight challenge

623
00:26:55,664 --> 00:26:58,165
was to choose
two unique alien races

624
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,466
from the <i>Defiance</i> universe

625
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:02,136
and create
their potential offspring.

626
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,771
Wayne, you're up first.

627
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,827
I was really worried
about my alien baby.

628
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:28,262
But now he's looking
so powerful,

629
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:30,931
and I could really
see his expression

630
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,866
emoting through the makeup,

631
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,903
so I'm feeling pretty good.

632
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,921
I did everything, pretty much,

633
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,089
that I wanted to do
with this character.

634
00:27:55,123 --> 00:27:58,192
One thing I really
wanted to make sure

635
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:00,728
is that the chest and the body
really read from far away,

636
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,029
especially with the paint job.

637
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:04,898
Actually looks really cool.

638
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,150
It's intimidating looking

639
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:24,818
at the presence and
the silhouette of my character.

640
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:26,887
It's got no neck,
it's all muscle,

641
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,222
and his arms are humongous.

642
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:30,858
You've got elements
from the Bioman and the Mutant.

643
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:33,394
He's a big, mutated monster.

644
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:35,829
I love it.

645
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,715
When my character
comes out onstage,

646
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:56,717
I'm actually
pretty happy with it.

647
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,018
I think it looks really good.

648
00:28:58,053 --> 00:29:01,255
It has a lot of the elements
that I was going for.

649
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:05,259
It's a pretty cool piece.

650
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:10,564
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

651
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,038
It evokes much more Liberata
than Bioman, I think.

652
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:20,140
- In the height--
- Well, I think it's

653
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,875
the overall physique of him
that sort of...

654
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,177
- Right.
- ...emulates Bioman.

655
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:24,178
The judges go in
for their close look,

656
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:25,679
and I'm dreading this

657
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:29,149
'cause I still think mine is
the weakest character up there.

658
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,820
Can you give us
some facial expressions?

659
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,489
This nose, and that lip...

660
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,724
Just those two pieces
kind of bring it to life.

661
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,160
Could we see the back?

662
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,595
I kind of dig that divot.

663
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:43,831
The paint job on this,
again, is--

664
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,967
this looks like they're putting
it on with a chip brush only.

665
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,035
Or a baseball bat.

666
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,271
I'm already
mentally preparing myself

667
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:53,273
to be sent home on this one.

668
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:55,275
It's unfortunate,
but I really don't think

669
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,744
my alien's as good
as the other three.

670
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:04,794
The paint job on this...

671
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,563
This looks like they're putting
it on with a chip brush only.

672
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,631
I'm already
mentally preparing myself

673
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,133
to be sent home on this one

674
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:14,170
'cause I think mine is
the weakest character up there.

675
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:15,705
See, this head shape
is correct for the Liberata.

676
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,074
A sort of pointed skull.

677
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,476
That's accurate.

678
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,544
Looks like a Mutant Liberata,
doesn't it?

679
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:23,613
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

680
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:25,048
I'm hoping the judges
like what they see,

681
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:28,518
the tiny details and the
grotesqueness of this character.

682
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,655
The green teeth
and the green eyes

683
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,324
distract me from everything.

684
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:37,160
Come all the way
around to the back.

685
00:30:37,194 --> 00:30:38,762
He had a major blowout.

686
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,164
Going into the finale,
this is inexcusable.

687
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:44,267
I'm definitely gonna take
some lumps from the judges.

688
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,802
I don't know if I'm gonna
be a finalist or not.

689
00:30:45,836 --> 00:30:48,905
I think
it's anyone's game right now.

690
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,608
- This is really shoddy here.
- The hair work's rough.

691
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:54,744
I'm tired of being nervous.

692
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,580
At the end of the day, it comes
down to whether or not I'm happy

693
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:59,249
with something that I put
out there on the stage or not.

694
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:02,886
He's definitely sculpted the
most out of everyone tonight.

695
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,593
The judges will now
speak with each of you

696
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:11,728
to learn more about your work.

697
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:14,030
Wayne, please step up.

698
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:22,839
Tell us
about your design, please.

699
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:26,242
My design came from picking
the Liberata and the Bioman.

700
00:31:26,277 --> 00:31:28,778
I wanted to bring
the Bioman's essence into it

701
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:31,147
by keeping the face more human

702
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,582
and then bringing
the Liberata into it

703
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:34,117
with the nose piece
that comes down

704
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:36,152
and bumping the forehead out.

705
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:39,756
I definitely give you credit
for the lip and the nose.

706
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,291
Thank you.

707
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:46,095
You have successfully
bridged this large,

708
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,733
elongated skull
into the shoulders.

709
00:31:50,768 --> 00:31:54,637
But I wish you put
more of you into this makeup.

710
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:55,939
It's so mediocre,

711
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:59,676
and a lot of that is the paint.

712
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,813
Wayne, overall, I really kind
of like the whole character.

713
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:06,449
I think the back
was quite well done.

714
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:09,085
I think he's a pretty
cohesive-looking character,

715
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,420
and I think you did
a pretty great job.

716
00:32:10,454 --> 00:32:12,689
Thank you.

717
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,958
From afar, it's hard to tell
what you did on the face.

718
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:16,960
But when you get up close,

719
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:19,662
there's some really nice
detailing going on.

720
00:32:19,697 --> 00:32:21,497
I found your proportions
very pleasing to my eye.

721
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:23,099
And the bulge
in the back of the head

722
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,802
doesn't exist on a Liberata,
and it doesn't exist on Bioman.

723
00:32:25,836 --> 00:32:27,904
It's a creation of yours,

724
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:29,672
and yet, it helps
make it all sort of work.

725
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:32,942
- Thanks.
- Wayne, you can step back.

726
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:35,845
Thanks.

727
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,781
Anthony.

728
00:32:43,187 --> 00:32:45,521
Hi, Anthony. Would you tell us
about your creation, please?

729
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:47,957
My character is basically
a Mutant Liberata.

730
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:51,127
I used forms of the Liberata,
such as the rolls in the neck,

731
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:53,596
the shape of the head,
and just Mutated 'em.

732
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:55,798
I also added
grotesqueness into it.

733
00:32:55,833 --> 00:33:00,403
I think you've really
been successful with this.

734
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,171
I think he looks actually
like a Mutated Liberata.

735
00:33:02,206 --> 00:33:04,007
I like your paint scheme,

736
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,676
I love the fact that you did add
those little tufts of hair,

737
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:09,545
which really brings
the Liberata's furry texture

738
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,014
into the makeup,
which was nice.

739
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:12,482
Thanks.

740
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:13,816
You've got the Liberata,
and you've got the Mutant,

741
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,085
and they go together
in a very believable way.

742
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,921
- It's a really nice job.
- Thank you.

743
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:21,658
I think that
the face sculpture is fantastic.

744
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:24,994
There's just so much character.

745
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:27,363
- I'm quite impressed.
- Thank you.

746
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:32,068
- Anthony, please step back.
- Thanks, guys.

747
00:33:32,102 --> 00:33:35,338
Kris, you're next.

748
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:41,511
Kris, tell us
about the concept, please.

749
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:44,013
I chose the Bioman
and Mutant combination.

750
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:47,850
What happens is the Mutant's
genes spoil the perfect Bioman.

751
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:49,185
I think, head to toe,

752
00:33:49,219 --> 00:33:52,689
there's a cool vibe
to the character here.

753
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,424
I like that his head
didn't get huge.

754
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,427
He's scary, off-putting,

755
00:33:57,461 --> 00:33:59,329
and from that standpoint,

756
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:02,665
the design feels
very appropriate.

757
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,067
The Mutant character
is a really hard one

758
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,469
because he's sort of
a generic zombie.

759
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,239
Having said that, I think
his face is really scary.

760
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:12,875
Makes me feel bad
for the Bioman.

761
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,544
It's anatomically
quite atrocious.

762
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:17,113
I think you know that.

763
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:18,781
I like the idea, though.

764
00:34:18,816 --> 00:34:20,183
I think that the sense
of proportion is very nice.

765
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:24,821
There's something quite
redeemable about the makeup.

766
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,323
Okay, so he's
anatomically not correct.

767
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,692
Blah, blah, blah.

768
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:32,195
Guys, come on, he's a Mutant.
Give him a break.

769
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:33,596
I think he's awesome.

770
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,897
He's scary,
he's got green glowing eyes,

771
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:37,600
and I think it's
a bitchin' character, so there.

772
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:39,068
Thank you.

773
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:42,772
- Kris, you can step back.
- Thank you.

774
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:45,742
Eric,
please step to the center.

775
00:34:51,248 --> 00:34:52,815
So, Eric, tell me
about your creature here.

776
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,884
Basically,
a hardworking miner 99er

777
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,987
got together with one of the
cute, cuddly, little Sensoths,

778
00:34:58,022 --> 00:35:01,357
and this is the offspring.

779
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:04,227
It-- it disturbs me.

780
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:07,030
But it disturbs me
in the right way.

781
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:08,664
Having said that, I wish
it had been more of a blend.

782
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:11,768
What comes across is,
rather than a genetic mush,

783
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:13,870
you've got sort of a patchwork.

784
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:18,174
He's all Sensoth in one part,
and he's all 99er in the other.

785
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,542
I actually quite like it.

786
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,578
You've given him this wardrobe,
and he tells a story.

787
00:35:22,613 --> 00:35:23,780
I think it succeeds in that.

788
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:24,881
Yeah.

789
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:25,982
I think you took
a big stride forward

790
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,650
personally
as an artist this week.

791
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:28,751
Thank you.

792
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:30,486
I love you,
I think you're adorable,

793
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:32,855
and you've done
some really funky stuff.

794
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,392
But, dude,
this is not one of 'em.

795
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,528
The hair is just so funky.

796
00:35:38,562 --> 00:35:40,596
It just takes me
out of the whole moment.

797
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:42,265
I think particularly
at a distance,

798
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:45,701
it's got a really
well-done quality about it.

799
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:47,370
You've elevated yourself

800
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,772
to where there's
an element of sophistication

801
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:52,875
that you're starting
to impart into your makeup,

802
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,812
so that's wonderful.

803
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:59,449
- Eric, you can step back.
- Thank you, guys.

804
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:03,886
Okay, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

805
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:05,488
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

806
00:36:05,522 --> 00:36:06,889
while they make their decisions

807
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:09,625
on who will move on
to the finale.

808
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,800
All right, guys, let's talk
about tonight's looks.

809
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:18,968
Why don't we start with Wayne?

810
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,636
His sculpting

811
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:24,774
has been shocking.

812
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,810
The speed with which
he approaches is mind-numbing.

813
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:29,212
Yeah.

814
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:31,948
He had the sculpture that was
most appealing at a glance.

815
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:33,583
I think Wayne
has a lot of talent.

816
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:36,185
I think he's really gonna
go far in our business.

817
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,620
Okay, let's move on to Anthony.

818
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,155
It is the one that has

819
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:40,857
the best morph
of the two characters.

820
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:43,493
It looks like
a Mutant Liberata.

821
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:46,729
And it has the best
paint job of all of them.

822
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:50,066
The primary forms of
the sculpture are really solid.

823
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,136
I think he also
satisfies the equation

824
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,304
of combining
the by-product of their union,

825
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,307
and this one felt
the most complete.

826
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:02,311
Anthony created something that
lived in the world of the show.

827
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,880
Let's move on to Kris.

828
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:06,883
He took on so much

829
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:08,885
that there was
too much surface area

830
00:37:08,919 --> 00:37:11,988
to actually
design and sculpt for him.

831
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:13,489
He somehow managed to succeed

832
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:15,424
in bringing out
this mutant character.

833
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:17,160
If he would've
put a torn-up,

834
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,729
horrible, filthy shirt
on this guy

835
00:37:19,763 --> 00:37:21,797
and given a little bit
more attention

836
00:37:21,832 --> 00:37:23,332
- to the paint job on the face...
- Yes.

837
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,333
I think this
probably would've been

838
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,968
one of my favorite makeups
tonight.

839
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:28,938
On one side, I felt like, you
know, of these creature designs,

840
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:31,007
the Mutant is the most generic.

841
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,175
They need to rise above that.

842
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,476
All right, and last
but not least, Eric.

843
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,612
It's one of the nicest makeups
he's done.

844
00:37:36,647 --> 00:37:38,648
For him, it's extremely subtle.

845
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:41,117
For once,
we don't have muscles,

846
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:43,619
and we don't
have blood all over everything.

847
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:46,289
Are these supposed to be
that simian?

848
00:37:46,323 --> 00:37:48,758
Sensoth is-- is simian.

849
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,794
So the ape that he brought
to the makeup is correct.

850
00:37:51,828 --> 00:37:53,062
Yes, it is.

851
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,697
You know, the thing that just
killed me was the hair.

852
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,365
Well, and, you know,
in a funny kind of way,

853
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,135
it's probably the one that's
closest to being a character.

854
00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:01,571
The face seems more specific
than the other ones.

855
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:03,172
Although it's
not really a hybrid.

856
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:05,441
It's a shoulder of one
and a stomach of another

857
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:07,276
and an arm of one.

858
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:09,845
Ultimately, what three
get to go on to the finale?

859
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,747
And that's tough
because these guys

860
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:14,817
all deserve to be here.

861
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:16,385
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

862
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,521
- Yeah, we have.
- I think so.

863
00:38:18,555 --> 00:38:20,990
Okay, let's bring 'em back out.

864
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,968
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge

865
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:35,238
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

866
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,298
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge

867
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:48,269
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

868
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:55,509
Anthony.

869
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,311
You did a great job

870
00:38:57,345 --> 00:39:00,648
handling the hybridization
of your two aliens.

871
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:03,584
And we particularly loved
all of the character

872
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,286
that you put into the face.

873
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,520
Congratulations.

874
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,956
Thank you, guys, so much.
Thank you.

875
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,724
Anthony, congratulations.
You've made it to the finale.

876
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:11,892
Thanks.

877
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:13,828
It just feels so good

878
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:16,363
to come back and win
another spotlight challenge.

879
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,432
It's so surreal
and humbling every time.

880
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,468
That never gets old.

881
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:21,535
Now, as the winner
of this challenge,

882
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,737
you have also
won the opportunity

883
00:39:23,772 --> 00:39:25,473
to shadow the special effects
makeup department

884
00:39:25,507 --> 00:39:28,108
- on SyFy's new series <i>Defiance.</i>
- Oh, wow.

885
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:29,276
Congratulations.

886
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:31,278
- Oh, my God. Thank you, guys.
- Good job.

887
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:34,849
To have that added education
on top of this,

888
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:38,752
it's just the coolest thing
in the world.

889
00:39:38,787 --> 00:39:40,688
All right, Glenn,
who is the next person

890
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:43,390
to make it to the finale?

891
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:51,432
Kris.

892
00:39:51,466 --> 00:39:55,536
We were a bit conflicted
about your makeup tonight,

893
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,439
but the essence of him
really came through,

894
00:39:58,473 --> 00:40:00,574
and you've been
a strong competitor all season.

895
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,776
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

896
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:04,011
Wow.

897
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:05,913
I'm really excited about this.

898
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:07,581
Being in the finale was my goal

899
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:08,682
when I got
into this competition.

900
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:09,683
Thank you.

901
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:10,751
I feel like a winner already.

902
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:18,192
We have two artists and only
one spot left in the finale.

903
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:21,629
My dream has always been
to make it to the finale

904
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:22,763
and show everybody
what I can do.

905
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:25,766
I want this so bad

906
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,835
because I don't
want to let my family down.

907
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:31,205
Glenn, who gets the last spot
in our finale?

908
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:34,775
The last spot
in the finale goes to...

909
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:42,917
Wayne.

910
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:47,922
Once again, your sculpture is
the strongest part of your work.

911
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:49,323
There are
some really nice moments

912
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:51,125
on both the face and the back.

913
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,027
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

914
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,829
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

915
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:57,197
Oh, my gosh.
I'm gonna be in the finale.

916
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:59,166
I'm just blown away.

917
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,702
But at the same time,
it's bittersweet

918
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:03,037
because Eric Fox
isn't gonna be there,

919
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:04,538
and he deserved
to be in the finale

920
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:06,640
as much as the three of us.

921
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,043
Wayne, you have
our last finale spot.

922
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:12,212
Unfortunately, that means, Eric,
you will be leaving us tonight.

923
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:13,714
Okay.

924
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:16,817
Eric, you're a very colorful
character, and I love that.

925
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,385
You've really evolved
on the show by leaps and bounds.

926
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,622
And I really am excited
to see some of your work

927
00:41:21,656 --> 00:41:23,457
that will be coming
from you in the future.

928
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:26,460
Thank you.

929
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:29,129
Eric, it really has been great
having you here with us.

930
00:41:29,164 --> 00:41:30,264
If you'd please head back

931
00:41:30,298 --> 00:41:31,799
to the makeup room
and pack up your kit.

932
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:34,168
Okay.

933
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:38,305
- Love you guys.
- Chin up, man. Good luck.

934
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,576
Yes.

935
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:45,479
Three of you have done an
incredible job to get this far.

936
00:41:45,513 --> 00:41:47,581
Congratulations.

937
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:48,616
Go celebrate tonight,
and I will see you soon

938
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,818
for your final
spotlight challenge.

939
00:41:50,852 --> 00:41:52,286
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck, gentlemen.

940
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,024
Congratulations.

941
00:41:59,094 --> 00:42:00,294
Congratulations, man.

942
00:42:00,328 --> 00:42:02,363
Damn, dude.

943
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:03,897
Oh, that's cool.

944
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:05,099
Love you, bro.

945
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:08,135
Love you too, man.
Congrats.

946
00:42:08,169 --> 00:42:11,639
I'm really happy
for Anthony, Wayne, and Kris.

947
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:13,407
They definitely deserve
to be in the finale.

948
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:15,643
They've worked really hard,
just as hard as I have.

949
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:17,311
I learned so much from you.

950
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:19,680
You pushed us all
to go farther and bigger.

951
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:21,081
Absolutely.

952
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,616
It's all good.

953
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:24,818
I accomplished what I wanted
to accomplish by coming here.

954
00:42:24,853 --> 00:42:27,287
I'm proud
of everything I've done

955
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:29,089
and had a blast doing it.

956
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:32,526
Good luck, man.

957
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
I think
the most difficult thing

958
00:42:33,595 --> 00:42:35,629
about not making it
to the finale

959
00:42:35,664 --> 00:42:38,399
is I didn't want
to let my wife and kids down.

960
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,300
I just wanted them
to be proud of me.

961
00:42:40,335 --> 00:42:45,005
It's been a great experience,
and I wouldn't change anything.

962
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,980
This has been awesome.
