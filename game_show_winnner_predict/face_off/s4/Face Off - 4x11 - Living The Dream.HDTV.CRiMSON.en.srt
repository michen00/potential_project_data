00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,474
Welcome to the season finale
of <i>Face Off.</i>

2
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:16,110
Tonight, we're headed
to Las Vegas

3
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:17,978
and reaching epic new heights.

4
00:00:21,816 --> 00:00:23,784
Three artists remain,

5
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:26,186
but only one will win it all.

6
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:29,189
I really wanna win
that $100,000.

7
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:32,059
- Anthony.
- He's absolutely amazing.

8
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:35,428
My family's been
very supportive of me.

9
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:36,997
I wanna show them
that everything

10
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:39,266
that they've sacrificed
has not been in vain.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,367
Wayne.

12
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:42,302
His sculpting is genius.

13
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,973
Winning<i>Face Off</i>would just

14
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:49,176
make my dreams come true,
to have my own shop.

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,978
Kris.

16
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:52,913
He's really, really good.

17
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:54,614
I'm a married man.
I got two kids.

18
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,049
If I win,
it'll changed my life.

19
00:00:57,385 --> 00:00:58,585
And dreams turn to nightmares

20
00:00:58,619 --> 00:00:59,887
as the pressure takes its toll.

21
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:02,055
You're gonna re-sculpt
the face?

22
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,390
I'm terrified.

23
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:04,658
That's a lot of time
that I don't have.

24
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:06,260
Just not feeling it.

25
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm just worried
it might not be enough.

26
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:08,762
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:10,630
If my makeup falls apart,
I'm finished.

28
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:14,334
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:15,702
It all comes down

30
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:18,505
to one spectacular
and death-defying performance.

31
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,779
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

32
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:28,348
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

33
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:30,150
in New York and Paris,

34
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:32,920
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,

35
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:36,556
and $100,000.

36
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,427
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

37
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:42,729
Welcome to <i>Face Off!</i>

39
00:02:26,174 --> 00:02:27,908
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:31,979
My arms are killing me,
my hands are completely swollen.

41
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,680
Now, it's down
to the last three.

42
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:35,548
I can't believe
we made it to the finals.

43
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,817
- It's already here.
- It's crazy.

44
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:39,419
It's a very surreal feeling
being here.

45
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,988
The house is so quiet now.

46
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:43,757
It's definitely
an emotional roller coaster.

47
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,960
So I go into the kitchen,
and my wife is on Skype.

48
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,362
My love!

49
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,063
I can't believe
I'm staring at you right now.

50
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:53,533
I love you so much,
and I'm so proud of you.

51
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,568
Hey, mom.
Hi, dad.

52
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,037
Hi, Anthony.

53
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,772
Hey, it's so good to see you.

54
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:00,473
Being here has
been really hard,

55
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,542
because when I've fallen,
my parents aren't there

56
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,411
to help pick me back up.

57
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,678
How are you?

58
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:08,181
Hi!
You having fun?

59
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:10,317
Yeah, it's a lot of stress.

60
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:13,253
- Hey, daddy.
- Hi, daddy.

61
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:15,222
Seeing my wife and kids
for the first time

62
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:17,391
in almost two months,

63
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:19,726
it just really makes me
wanna come home.

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,362
But I'm here for them,
and I'm gonna stick it out.

65
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:24,398
God, I miss you guys so much.

66
00:03:24,432 --> 00:03:25,832
- I love you.
- Where are you?

67
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,600
Where are you?
Where are you?

68
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,305
I'm so happy
that you made it this far.

69
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm so proud of you.

70
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:34,707
I just love you so much.

71
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:38,045
Seeing my wife reminds me
why I'm here.

72
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,780
This could be a life-changer
for both of us.

73
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:42,416
This has been
the most exciting,

74
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,418
most amazing experience.

75
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,589
_

76
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,424
_

77
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:52,499
_

78
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,928
Thank you.

79
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:55,929
_

80
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,730
It's definitely a treat,

81
00:03:57,765 --> 00:03:58,966
especially
going into the finale,

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,700
having a chance
to have talked to them.

83
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:03,403
Daddy, did you knock
their socks off?

84
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:06,006
Keep your head up.

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,042
Being in the finale is
something special.

86
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:12,112
I'm a married guy
with two kids.

87
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:14,747
And if I win,
my life will change.

88
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,049
Let's do it.

89
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:19,019
I don't want to let them down.

90
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:26,793
Well, well, well.

91
00:04:28,296 --> 00:04:31,231
All I keep telling myself
is it's one more time around,

92
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,467
do the best that I can
and hopefully win.

93
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,836
Congratulations,
and welcome to the finale.

94
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:39,172
- Surreal.
- Unbelievable.

95
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,375
Your final spotlight challenge

96
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,044
will take place
on our biggest stage yet

97
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,679
in Las Vegas.

98
00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:48,748
You'll each be creating makeups

99
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,817
for the most spectacular show
in town,

100
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:53,920
<i>Le Reve, The Dream</i>
at the Wynn Resort.

101
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,755
Now, before I give you
all the details,

102
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:57,557
please welcome
the artistic director

103
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:59,592
of <i>Le Reve, The Dream</i>
James Santos.

104
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:01,428
James, what can you
tell these guys about it?

105
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:04,231
<i>Le Reve, The Dream</i>
is an aquatic show

106
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,799
with over 90 artists, acrobats,

107
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:08,101
and Olympic athletes.

108
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:10,470
There's no other show like it
in the world.

109
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:13,507
<i>Le Reve, The Dream.</i>

110
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,108
Wow.

111
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:16,876
All right,
for your final challenge,

112
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,778
you'll be focusing
on characters

113
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:20,280
that come to life

114
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,282
only in the depths
of the subconscious.

115
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:23,683
Dream thieves.

116
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:26,019
The dream thieves collect
dreams that are in the water.

117
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,787
They are adrenaline junkies

118
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,290
who cannot get enough danger
in their world.

119
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:32,625
Each of you will create
two fantasy makeups

120
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,027
that will be featured

121
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,728
in this aerial
and acrobatic performance

122
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:38,831
in front of a live audience
at the Wynn Theater.

123
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:41,468
I might be smiling
on the outside,

124
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:43,437
but on the inside
I'm terrified.

125
00:05:43,471 --> 00:05:46,940
Now, one of your characters
must be a dream thief,

126
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,141
and the other their victim

127
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:50,843
who has something
the thief wants to steal.

128
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:52,912
Since your characters
will exist in the subconscious,

129
00:05:52,947 --> 00:05:55,848
you'll each pick
one of these dream themes

130
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:57,584
to help guide your looks.

131
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:01,521
Anthony, you're up first.

132
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:02,922
I go straight for sinister.

133
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,958
I feel that I can come up
with something mischievous,

134
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:06,359
evil, but whimsical.

135
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:07,961
Just that alone,

136
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:10,297
I can get a lot of really
cool character into a face.

137
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:13,133
Wayne.

138
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,601
Supernatural
is really cool to me,

139
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,336
'cause it's the unexplained.

140
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,172
It's really wide open
for interpretation.

141
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,307
Kris.

142
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,978
I gravitate
to the ethereal category.

143
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:27,514
It's very celestial.

144
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,049
I think this will fit in
the <i>Le Reve, The Dream</i> show.

145
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:33,086
Vegas, baby.

146
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:37,724
Now, there's one huge element
that we haven't discussed yet,

147
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:40,059
and that is the water factor.

148
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:43,263
<i>Le Reve, The Dream</i> features
a 1 million gallon water tank

149
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:44,897
throughout the show.

150
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:46,799
So... your makeups
will need to be

151
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:50,003
100% waterproof.

152
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:52,506
It's terrifying knowing

153
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,840
that the makeups
that we're gonna be doing

154
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,342
have to withstand water.

155
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,377
It's something
I've never done before.

156
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,279
To win this finale,
you're gonna need some help.

157
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,480
Guys?

158
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,951
Hi!

159
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:07,621
You'll each get to choose
two of your former competitors

160
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:09,289
to join your team.

161
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:10,757
Wayne, you're got first pick.

162
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,326
Well, I have to go with Fox.

163
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:14,594
Yeah.

164
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,496
- Kris.
- Let's go PowerHouse.

165
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,232
Thank you.

166
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:20,800
- Anthony.
- Eric.

167
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:24,638
Meagan.

168
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:26,239
Alam.

169
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:27,807
- Autumn.
- Awesome.

170
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:29,676
Welcome back.

171
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,313
Okay, it is time
for you to get started.

172
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:35,782
All right, gang, here we go.

173
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:37,517
I picked ethereal.

174
00:07:37,552 --> 00:07:40,687
So I go water celestial
like a space God,

175
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,322
slick and streamlined,

176
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:45,258
where there's smooth areas
on these characters.

177
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:47,093
So they're
just perfect looking.

178
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:48,695
Something Vegas-y.

179
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,029
A lot of that's gonna be
in the coloring.

180
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:51,364
Yeah.

181
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,566
Some silvers would be nice.

182
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,966
I think that'll be cool.

183
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,968
I really like my team,
and I trust them.

184
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:58,171
There's, like,
so many different elements...

185
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,173
That you have to consider
and bring into it

186
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,341
to make it work.

187
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,109
I've never had to do
waterproof makeup.

188
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:04,244
Ever.

189
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:05,645
You just can't sculpt--

190
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,813
But I think
if you keep different pieces

191
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:08,147
and not sculpt the suit,
you're fine.

192
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:09,449
Oh, no, no.

193
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:10,883
I'm not gonna sculpt
a full suit, I can't.

194
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:12,652
This is the biggest stage ever
in <i>Face Off</i> history,

195
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:13,820
which is really cool.

196
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,255
And I'm gonna be a part of it.

197
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,423
But we have two makeups to do,

198
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:17,657
and I can't even finish
one makeup.

199
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:19,526
The demon's after her
to steal her wings,

200
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,361
'cause usually
they get cast out of heaven.

201
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,230
- So he can fly back.
- That's right.

202
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,598
- That's cool.
- So he's trying to, uh--

203
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:26,399
- Yeah, I like that.
- I like that a lot.

204
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:29,603
My concept is
the dreamer is an angel.

205
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:31,438
She's growing these wings

206
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:33,973
and her dream
is to make it to heaven.

207
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:35,942
The dream thief wants to steal
that from her

208
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:38,077
and get his own set of wings.

209
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:40,680
This is a hard one.

210
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,349
No, you've got this.

211
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:45,685
Um, let's get ready
to start sculpting.

212
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:50,223
The thing with this challenge
is to keep it very minimal

213
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:53,059
and not have anything
restrictive on their bodies.

214
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,594
I decide to keep it

215
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:58,164
to a cowl face
and a minor chestpiece.

216
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:00,700
My concept
is a sinister dream thief,

217
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:03,403
and the soul embedded
in his chest was torn out.

218
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:05,972
He's trying to lure
this princess character

219
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:08,608
and steal her soul.

220
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:11,043
I'm sculpting
the facial prosthetics,

221
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:13,346
Eric Z starts working
on the chestpieces,

222
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:15,982
and Autumn starts
blocking in the cowls.

223
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:17,717
- Follow-- follow the structure.
- You like that? Okay.

224
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:18,918
- That's beautiful.
- You like that structure?

225
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:20,086
- I love it.
- Okay.

226
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,421
That's what I wanna hear.

227
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,256
Just start sculpting it.
We'll just make it work.

228
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,624
For the angel,

229
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,059
I'm having Eric get started
on the face appliance.

230
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:28,328
And Meagan's working
on the angel's wings

231
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:30,630
that are growing out
of her back.

232
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:33,667
Then for the demon, we're going
with a face appliance,

233
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,369
a cowl, and a chestpiece.

234
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:38,838
The prosthetic is actually gonna
stop right around his nose,

235
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:40,206
so that way
I don't have to worry

236
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,376
about trying to glue just around
the inside of the nostril.

237
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,212
Because if water gets in there,
that whole thing's coming off.

238
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:51,150
One of the bigger pieces
that need to be made

239
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:53,286
is the dream thief's
chest and back.

240
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,322
So I have House jump on that.

241
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:57,123
I know he's gonna be able
to get it banged out

242
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:58,391
by the end of the day.

243
00:09:58,426 --> 00:10:00,126
I'm working on this face,

244
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,963
and Alam's gonna start sculpting
the female's chestpiece.

245
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,865
I'm just watching you
sculpt boobs, that's all.

246
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:08,568
Kinda distracting.

247
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,108
Cover it up.
We got 30 seconds.

248
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:22,281
That's time, everybody.

249
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:23,817
I think I have a great team,

250
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,017
and everyone's bringing in it.

251
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:26,419
Feeling pretty good
about day one.

252
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:38,064
So it's day two, ten hours.

253
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:40,467
All that's going through my mind
is get these pieces done

254
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,802
so that we have
time to run 'em in foam.

255
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:49,776
That looks nice.

256
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,846
I wanna try to mold everything
that we possibly can.

257
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,382
But I'm scrambling for ideas
right now.

258
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,649
Fuck. I hate this challenge.

259
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:59,151
I love this challenge.

260
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,887
I don't.

261
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,390
For a water challenge
like this, we're limited.

262
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:05,358
Everything's got to
be streamlined and thin.

263
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:07,494
Can't cover the ears,
the eyes, or the mouth.

264
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:10,563
Now, I have to rethink
everything

265
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,231
as far as designing
prosthetics.

266
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,601
I know this is the finale

267
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:16,235
and there's a lot of money
on the line.

268
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,037
Mm, just not feeling it.

269
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,939
And I'm more than concerned.

270
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:23,009
I'm really worried what
I'm doing might not be enough.

271
00:11:23,043 --> 00:11:24,076
Coming up...

272
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:26,078
You're gonna re-sculpt
the face?

273
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:28,615
I'm terrified.
That's a lot of wasted time.

274
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:29,816
Oh, my God.

275
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,819
If my makeup falls apart,
I'm finished.

276
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:35,354
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

277
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:40,139
Fuck. I hate this challenge.

278
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:42,775
For a water challenge like this,
we're limited.

279
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,844
Everything's got to
be streamlined and thin.

280
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:47,646
Can't cover the ears,
the eyes, or the mouth.

281
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:49,215
I'm really worried
what I'm doing

282
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:50,283
might not be enough.

283
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:52,118
Mm, just not feeling it.

284
00:11:52,152 --> 00:11:56,155
So I have to rethink everything
going into this finale

285
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,790
as far as designing
prosthetics.

286
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,058
This is a big deal,

287
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:01,127
and I need to
make this thing shine.

288
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:10,203
Hey, everybody.

289
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:12,404
- Hello.
- Here for a final walk-through.

290
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,106
So it's Mr. Westmore's
last time

291
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:15,574
checking out our work
in the lab.

292
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:16,775
It's kind of a sad thing,

293
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,610
because he has been
a mentor of ours

294
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,313
and given us a lot of advice.

295
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:21,948
- I chose sinister.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:24,583
I figured I could do some cool
storytelling with that,

297
00:12:24,617 --> 00:12:26,785
especially with characteristics
in the face.

298
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,588
So we're basically doing
a prosthetic facepiece

299
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,290
and we're gonna be working
to the cowl,

300
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:33,860
tie it in texturally
and aesthetically.

301
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:35,627
And then for
our female character,

302
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:38,231
it's gonna be the same species
but a lot softer.

303
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,899
Do you think it's a smart idea

304
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,467
not to put the cowl
on the female?

305
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,302
I really like the cowl idea.

306
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:45,004
It's just--
really glue it down.

307
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:47,940
Because if there's one spot
the water can get into

308
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,976
it's going to turn
into a sponge.

309
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,378
I'm so much more confident
knowing

310
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:56,015
that Mr. Westmore said
you gotta go with the cowl.

311
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,450
- I love Mr. Westmore, dude.
- Yeah, he's so cool.

312
00:12:58,485 --> 00:12:59,852
He's somewhat of a demon,

313
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:02,255
and he's after our angel.

314
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,023
She's developing these wings,

315
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,724
and they're growing out
of her back.

316
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:06,859
So it's underneath the skin.

317
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:08,294
As far as the dream thief goes,

318
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,862
there's a cowlpiece
and it stops here.

319
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,697
So we're not putting anything
on the neck area.

320
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:14,400
He has a facepiece.
It'll be blended over the cowl.

321
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,969
And he'll also have tattoos
that'll be black

322
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,504
that go around his shoulders.

323
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,907
What are you gonna use
for paint to do the tattoos?

324
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:22,141
Probably alcohol inks.

325
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:23,609
Is that what you've been doing?

326
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:25,411
- I'm their test subject.
- I love it!

327
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:26,545
- Ah!
- We're the Guinea pigs.

328
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:27,980
We have all
the different paints.

329
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,315
- Have you put it in water?
- Not yet.

330
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,516
- Use warm water.
- Okay.

331
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,884
Yes.

332
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,185
Because the tank they're going
into is gonna be warm.

333
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,453
Oh, okay.

334
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:35,788
I'm bummed out
that Mr. Westmore won't be there

335
00:13:35,822 --> 00:13:37,056
for the rest of my life
to tell me

336
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,490
how to have
good time management.

337
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:39,792
It's kind of, like,

338
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:42,428
an aquatic, celestial
kind of look to the whole thing.

339
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,530
So it's sleek, Vegas-y.

340
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,165
The colors will be bold.

341
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:47,499
It's definitely a challenge.

342
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:50,202
And water is my biggest fear
on this one.

343
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:53,172
Probably the most important
thing is getting it sealed in.

344
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,506
Right.

345
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,774
I don't know, maybe,
what you think about this

346
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,177
- but the zinc oxide powder...
- Yep.

347
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,579
...on the edges
to really get a good bond.

348
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:02,481
That'll actually give it
a better bond.

349
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:05,851
It's been amazing having him
as a mentor in the shop.

350
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:08,220
I can't thank him enough for all
the great advice he's given us.

351
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,622
All right, everybody.
We're heading out.

352
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:11,857
We'll see you in Vegas.

353
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:12,959
- Bye!
- Bye. Thank you.

354
00:14:12,993 --> 00:14:14,460
- Waterproof.
- Good luck, guys.

355
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,395
- Thank you.
- Bye.

356
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:24,370
What's the time?

357
00:14:24,404 --> 00:14:25,771
Eight minutes.

358
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:29,075
Yeah, I like that.

359
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,380
Time's up!
Let's go home!

360
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,248
Thanks, guys.

361
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:37,649
For day three,

362
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:39,718
I'm gonna have to finish
sculpting the demon's chest.

363
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,787
But we're behind
because I really needed

364
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:44,490
all those pieces completed
by day three to pre-paint.

365
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:48,461
So... I'm kind bummed out that
it's not gonna happen that way.

366
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:01,874
It's day three,

367
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,076
I'm sculpting the five pieces
for the male model,

368
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,844
and House is gonna finish up

369
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,047
some arm pieces
for the female model.

370
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:10,549
We'll just be playing
with the paints today.

371
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,485
'Cause I want these pieces
pre-painted.

372
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,820
Her face is
pretty bad up here, man.

373
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,155
Oh, man.

374
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:18,290
The female face
second-skinned,

375
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:19,325
which means there's air pockets

376
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,592
underneath the surface
of the foam.

377
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,528
I might've been able
to get away with it,

378
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:24,397
but this being the finale,

379
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:25,998
I need to make sure
that face is perfect.

380
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28,967
So all I can do
is run it in foam again.

381
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:32,405
But I can't re-run it,
because the mold is destroyed.

382
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,941
So all I can do now is spend
the time and re-sculpt this.

383
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:38,544
You're gonna re-sculpt
the face?

384
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:40,212
Because of this?

385
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:42,614
- Yeah.
- Patch it.

386
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,051
But look at all the--
I mean, the details there.

387
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,585
And look how thick
the seam is over here.

388
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,555
Oh, that is really thick.
Oh, my God.

389
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:51,557
I'm terrified.

390
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,259
That's a lot of time
that I don't have.

391
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,294
So I have Autumn mold
the chestpiece

392
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:58,397
while I start re-sculpting the
face as fast as I possibly can.

393
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:00,178
_

394
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:01,516
_

395
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:03,325
_

396
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:09,975
This is gonna be cool.

397
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:15,814
I'm just looking
for a nice complimentary color

398
00:16:15,848 --> 00:16:17,083
to the orange.

399
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,417
- I know yellow is probably...
- Yellow.

400
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,685
- ...the most...
- Yup.

401
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,852
...suggested.

402
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,254
I really want the judges to see

403
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,456
what I can do with paint.

404
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,791
So I wanna come up with
a unique color scheme.

405
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,427
Let's think of a design
for the girl

406
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:31,597
that has the orange color,
the turquoise color,

407
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:32,731
and yellow.

408
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:34,366
Center around those colors.

409
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:47,379
Not gonna pry more
underneath the paint stick.

410
00:16:48,345 --> 00:16:50,913
_

411
00:16:50,914 --> 00:16:52,214
_

412
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,553
Shit.

413
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,356
I see Autumn and Eric
really struggling

414
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,358
to open Anthony's chestpiece.

415
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:01,160
I think Anthony's in trouble
on this one

416
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,428
because the only way
to get that off

417
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:03,729
is to break the mannequin.

418
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,631
But then you don't have
a core piece for the mold.

419
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:14,039
I notice Eric and Autumn
attempting to open this mold,

420
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:16,308
and it's not opening.

421
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:18,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

422
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,513
It's locked around the neck.

423
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:23,315
It's way too far back.
It's way too far up the jaw.

424
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,384
What else can possibly go wrong

425
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,886
in the last moments
of shop time?

426
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,856
The one mold
I ask Autumn to make,

427
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,291
she... locks.

428
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,490
Wow!

429
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,586
Eric Fox is hosing me down!

430
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:42,604
Turn your arm around.

431
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:44,457
I wanna be able to get it
from different angles.

432
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,220
But your spraying me!

433
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm sorry. Here, here, yeah.
I'll go from this angle.

434
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,516
We're making sure that
the prosthetic will stay on,

435
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,485
we're also testing, um,
colors *.

436
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:57,319
Wow! That hurt! You're spraying
like high doses of water.

437
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,355
They're jumping 30 feet
into a pool, man!

438
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,620
I think it's a great
test if it showed us how

439
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,153
far we can go protecting
the appliance.

440
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,690
Yea, that's *.

441
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:17,382
I notice Eric and Autumn
attempting to open this mold,

442
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,485
and it's not opening.

443
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,319
Shit.

444
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:22,821
The one mold I ask her to make,

445
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:24,690
she... locks.

446
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,574
_

447
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:28,133
_

448
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,595
I did lock a mold.

449
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:31,530
It's the first thing I've done,

450
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:34,399
so I'm feeling
like a jerk right now.

451
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:36,635
I don't wanna let Anthony down
in any way.

452
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,605
- Oop! There she goes.
- Oh, geez!

453
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:41,540
Oh, man.

454
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:43,308
- And look.
- Sorry about that.

455
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:44,510
She has her head on.

456
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:45,677
Luckily, the piece comes off.

457
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:47,345
There's a little damage
to the mold,

458
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,480
little damage to the skull.

459
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:50,448
Make me an elastic, like...

460
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,083
choker thing.

461
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:53,585
But nothing that can't be
worked with.

462
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:01,860
This is gonna take two hours
just to seal this.

463
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:04,095
My biggest concern is how
to make these makeups work.

464
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,365
I know this one's more
about application and painting,

465
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,334
so I'm stressed out about it.

466
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,339
I'll just get a gallon bucket.
You can dip your braid into it.

467
00:19:14,373 --> 00:19:17,009
Our female has long hair.

468
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:20,846
So Alam is braiding in fabrics
into her hair

469
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
and leaving them kind of loose.

470
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:25,083
Because trying to put
all that hair into a bald cap

471
00:19:25,117 --> 00:19:27,185
isn't gonna work out
for this challenge.

472
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:29,320
All right, house, check it out.

473
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:31,590
Yeah.

474
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:33,458
- I love it!
- I think that'll look cool.

475
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,994
Good.

476
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,366
At the end of day three,

477
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,301
I think nerves
are definitely still there.

478
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:45,236
But I feel a lot more at ease

479
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:49,240
that we got everything done
that we needed to get done.

480
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:56,815
That's time, everybody.

481
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,149
Whoo!

482
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,484
- Let's go to Vegas.
- Yeah!

483
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:00,886
I am glad today is over.

484
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,921
Now, it's just one more day
in Vegas.

485
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:05,691
I'll have to bring it
with my team,

486
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,793
because I totally want
to win this.

487
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:21,273
We're pulling up
to the wynn in Las Vegas.

488
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,474
It's beautiful.

489
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,276
Definitely a surreal feeling.

490
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,077
I never thought
that I would make it this far.

491
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:28,947
This finale is gonna be
unbelievable.

492
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:30,916
Oh, my God.

493
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,452
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

494
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:34,720
We're walking in the suite

495
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:36,822
that Kris and Wayne
and I are gonna be staying,

496
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,057
and it's just the craziest place
I've ever been in.

497
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,192
Holy geez.

498
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:42,260
This suite's pretty sweet.

499
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:43,829
Oh, no way!

500
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,898
A pool table, man!

501
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:48,901
Dude, this is freakin' killer!
Damn!

502
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:50,168
I never been in
something so nice before.

503
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,103
Each one of the rooms

504
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:53,839
is bigger
than a normal hotel room,

505
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:56,475
with big screen TVs
and a beautiful view.

506
00:20:57,977 --> 00:20:59,311
It's just crazy.

507
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,279
- This is insane, man.
- This is nuts.

508
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:02,614
It starts setting in
that this is gonna be

509
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:03,715
the last challenge.

510
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,350
Oh, yeah.

511
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:06,819
It's been such
a great experience.

512
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:09,254
But in the end,
may the best man win.

513
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:11,056
- To the final three.
- Final three, man.

514
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,224
Cheers.

515
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,399
It's application day,

516
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:24,069
and we're finally
at the Wynn Theater.

517
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:25,537
We have four hours
for application,

518
00:21:25,572 --> 00:21:27,339
and then one hour
for last looks.

519
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,741
I immediately start sealing
the appliances.

520
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,610
It's very important
to make sure

521
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:33,111
that these pieces
are sealed properly

522
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:35,380
because if they absorb water,
they're just gonna fly off.

523
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:38,350
I'm scared as hell.

524
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,319
We're getting into
some water acrobatic stuff.

525
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:44,322
I'm worried about
the pieces not holding up.

526
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,128
I'm Wayne.

527
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:51,797
Our models are actually
performers from the show.

528
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:53,431
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

529
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:56,001
These guys are so conditioned
for this acrobatic performance.

530
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,102
But they've never
had makeup like this

531
00:21:57,136 --> 00:21:58,436
applied to them before.

532
00:21:58,471 --> 00:21:59,705
This is your headpiece.

533
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:01,039
My biggest concern
is making sure

534
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:02,440
everything gets on in one piece

535
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,643
and also keeping my teammates
on track.

536
00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:05,944
You good?

537
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,246
- It's real sticky.
- Yeah, it is.

538
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,181
While Alam's sealing
some of the other pieces,

539
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:13,284
House and I are putting
the appliances on the male

540
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,187
because he's got more
than a female.

541
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:19,324
I have to sew it in first.

542
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:20,993
Meagan's getting
her hairpiece in.

543
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:22,494
And then once that's finished,

544
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:24,630
then we start applying pieces
as fast as we can.

545
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:31,403
We're a little bit behind.

546
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:32,804
I was hoping that my team and I

547
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,806
could have
all the appliances done

548
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,142
within the first two hours,
but that's not gonna happen.

549
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:38,476
So there's still quite
a bit to go

550
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:39,645
before we even start painting.

551
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,980
See how this fits.

552
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:46,084
Don't pull that tight.

553
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:47,519
I feel like I'm pretty far
behind at this point

554
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:48,921
'cause a lot of people
have already started painting,

555
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:51,222
and they've got a lot
of their pieces on already.

556
00:22:51,257 --> 00:22:53,525
So... seeing that,
I'm thinking, oh, my gosh,

557
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,060
I have no idea
where the time's going.

558
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:58,000
_

559
00:22:58,097 --> 00:23:00,599
Hey, guys!

560
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:02,968
- Hi.
- This is last looks.

561
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:05,003
You have one hour left
and it starts now.

562
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:07,205
- Oh! Geez.
- All right.

563
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,640
- Good luck!
- Let's keep going.

564
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:10,275
It's really about putting
our butts in gear

565
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:11,677
and just getting this done.

566
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:13,045
Give him a good powdering
all the way down his head,

567
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,046
everything.

568
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,313
- Get her-- her chest done.
- Okay.

569
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:16,514
Make sure you paint
his fingertips.

570
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:18,149
Got it.

571
00:23:20,386 --> 00:23:23,655
Can't believe
this is already last looks.

572
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,090
I'm detailing the male model,

573
00:23:25,124 --> 00:23:28,126
adding some metallic
blue colors to him.

574
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,630
House and Alam finish
the body painting.

575
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:33,732
I could never do this
all by myself.

576
00:23:33,766 --> 00:23:35,901
Get her costume ready.

577
00:23:35,935 --> 00:23:37,335
- This is it?
- Yeah, that's it right there.

578
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:38,637
I was on track.

579
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,806
Then one thing after another
started happening

580
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,007
and I'm falling right back

581
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,875
into not having
anything painted.

582
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,645
Yeah, so we got
so much painting to do.

583
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,313
- Oh, my God.
- 15 minutes left, guys!

584
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:51,449
Fucking unbelievable.

585
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:58,556
Keep your head
really still for me.

586
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,125
I'm gonna paint these horns
as fast as I can.

587
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,326
God.

588
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,661
And I don't even know
if I have time

589
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,129
to paint the horns
that are on the chest.

590
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:12,303
That's time, everybody.

591
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:13,705
- We did it.
- Aw.

592
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,573
I wanna win, but there's
two other artists here

593
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:16,775
equally as good as I am.

594
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:18,010
It's looking good.

595
00:24:18,044 --> 00:24:20,746
Dude.

596
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,114
Honestly, I feel great.

597
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:25,651
You know, my team
really came through for me.

598
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:26,818
And I know I'm gonna have
something up there

599
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:27,986
that I'm proud of.

600
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:30,421
This is very intimidating.

601
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:31,890
The huge audience, you know,
looking at your work.

602
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:35,193
If my makeup falls apart,
I'm finished.

603
00:24:36,896 --> 00:24:38,229
Coming up...

604
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:40,465
Well, that was just
the beginning.

605
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:42,734
Oh, God, here it goes.

606
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:46,705
It's one of the coolest things
I've ever seen.

607
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:50,475
Who is the winner of<i>Face Off?</i>

608
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:59,596
Please welcome your host
McKenzie Westmore.

609
00:25:10,874 --> 00:25:13,209
Welcome to
the beautiful Wynn Las Vegas

610
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:15,945
and the <i>Face Off</i> season finale.

611
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,353
Tonight, you will witness
an incredible performance

612
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:26,322
from one of the most
amazing shows in the world,

613
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,057
<i>Le Reve, The Dream.</i>

614
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:39,068
For their final
spotlight challenge,

615
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,103
we asked
each of our contestants

616
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:44,940
to create two original
fantasy makeups.

617
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,876
The first is a dream thief,

618
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,077
and the second their victim

619
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,647
with something
that the thief wants to steal.

620
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:53,616
Now, each of our finalists
also chose a dream theme

621
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:55,185
to help guide their work

622
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:56,619
and their characters
will participate

623
00:25:56,654 --> 00:25:58,221
in tonight's performance.

624
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:59,822
So needless to say,

625
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:02,325
you guys are in
for an amazing treat tonight.

626
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:07,963
With that,
I'd like to introduce you

627
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:09,432
to our judges.

628
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:12,669
First, we have owner of Optic
Nerve Makeup Effects Studio

629
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,136
Glenn Hetrick.

630
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:22,345
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

631
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:30,786
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

632
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,860
Tonight's first creations
are from Kris,

633
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:39,729
and he chose "ethereal"
as his theme.

634
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:41,197
So let's take a look.

635
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,234
Whoo!

636
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,531
I think my characters are cool
under all these lights.

637
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:18,200
And having this metallic
silver paint,

638
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:20,936
it just reflects off of 'em,
it's changing.

639
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,406
He just looks so God-like.

640
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,668
I'm definitely ready for this.

641
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:53,869
I'm satisfied with my makeups

642
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:56,639
and proud of my team
for what we accomplished.

643
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,007
And now, whatever happens
in the water

644
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,609
is gonna happen in the water.

645
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,471
There's a huge audience
looking at your work.

646
00:28:28,505 --> 00:28:29,806
It's very intimidating.

647
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,774
From a distance,
they look great.

648
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:33,476
But when the judges
take a close-up look,

649
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,244
I'm just gonna be dreading it,

650
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:37,847
because there's just something
missing about it to me.

651
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,954
All right,
before we see the performance,

652
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:47,557
judges... why don't you come
take a closer look?

653
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:01,938
Can you tilt down so we can see

654
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:04,274
how it blends in your forehead?

655
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:06,342
Can you turn around for us...

656
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,843
if you don't mind?

657
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:09,446
There's some nice
little detail throughout.

658
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,581
I get it.
It's a simple aquatic approach.

659
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:14,050
- All right.
- Thank you.

660
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,552
Thank you.

661
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,122
It's really great
metallic color.

662
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:21,023
Let's get a good look
at your head.

663
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:22,758
Everything's blended.

664
00:29:22,793 --> 00:29:24,794
Look, we don't have any hard,
horrible edges or anything.

665
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:25,828
Yeah, this is pretty fantastic.

666
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:27,297
- Thank you.
- Okay.

667
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:28,664
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

668
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:35,438
So this is all prosthetic,
this whole thing.

669
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,475
This is, by far,
my absolute favorite profile.

670
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:39,709
Because
it's so natural looking.

671
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:40,843
Yeah, it is.

672
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:42,245
I can believe
this thing exists somewhere.

673
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,513
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:45,081
He looks like he's made
out of stone almost.

675
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,382
- Yeah.
- Which is really cool.

676
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,584
- Gargoyle.
- Yeah.

677
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:49,219
- They're clearly related.
- Yeah.

678
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:50,353
We'll hear their back story.

679
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:51,687
But you look at all the details
of this.

680
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:52,855
Yeah.

681
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:54,257
The cheeks,
the shape of the head.

682
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,058
The shape of the head is
what really pulls it together.

683
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:57,760
I do love this paint job
up-close.

684
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:58,861
Yeah, absolutely.

685
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:01,231
Thank you.

686
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,169
Are your eyes a bit compressed
from the piece?

687
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:08,070
It seems like you're having
a little bit of a hard time.

688
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:10,640
- I can't lift my eyebrows.
- All the way up, yeah.

689
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:14,710
Can you turn around and take
a look at these things?

690
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:17,313
The back is my favorite part.

691
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,714
Thanks.

692
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,550
This is really interesting,
this makeup.

693
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:21,951
- Yeah.
- Surprising!

694
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:24,854
The level of detail
to the sculpture

695
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,189
is so much greater
than when it--

696
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:27,290
Yeah, it's really kinda cool.

697
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,091
Can you turn
all the way around?

698
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:32,595
These actually go back--
they return into the head.

699
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,897
Which is very strange.
Instead of mak--

700
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:37,133
Even if the tips kind of came up
and out a little.

701
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,501
That doesn't bother me.

702
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,602
I think
it's kind of interesting.

703
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:41,070
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

704
00:30:41,104 --> 00:30:42,572
This is the biggest challenge
I've ever done,

705
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,240
which I'm excited about.

706
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,575
But I'm also terrified.

707
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:47,843
Because I may have
a nice piece on stage,

708
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:50,146
but once the performers
go in the water,

709
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,981
my makeup could
become a big mess.

710
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:59,622
Well, that was just
the beginning.

711
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,625
Now, it's time to put them
all to the test.

712
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,562
I present to you
<i>Le Reve, The Dream.</i>

713
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,569
Oh, God, here it goes.

714
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:22,022
Well, that was just
the beginning.

715
00:31:22,057 --> 00:31:25,025
Now, it's time to put them
all to the test.

716
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,962
I present to you
<i>Le Reve, The Dream.</i>

717
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,099
- Whoo! - Oh, my God!
- Oh, my gosh!

718
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:04,311
Oh, my God, this is so amazing.

719
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:06,080
All my fears are gone
with the makeups

720
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:07,782
'cause they're holding,

721
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:10,584
and it just looks
so amazing out there.

722
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:11,819
It's the most beautiful thing

723
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:12,953
I think I've ever seen
in my life.

724
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:19,693
All right, well,
to our studio audience,

725
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:22,229
you've all helped make this
a fantastic evening.

726
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:25,032
Thank you so much
to everyone for being here.

727
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,600
Have a great night.

728
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:36,476
So, judges, what do you think

729
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:37,912
about what
you've seen here tonight?

730
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,613
It's one of the coolest things
I've ever seen.

731
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:42,249
Congratulations.
Everything stayed on.

732
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:45,385
And the makeups looked as good
when they came out of the water

733
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,586
as they did when they went in.

734
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:48,189
I gotta get tips
when this is over.

735
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,491
It was a phenomenal job,
all of you.

736
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,627
Thank you.

737
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:55,830
Well, the judges would like
to speak with each of you

738
00:34:55,864 --> 00:34:57,298
to learn more about your work.

739
00:34:57,332 --> 00:35:00,167
Kris, please step forward.

740
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:04,305
Begin by explaining
your concept.

741
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:05,940
I went with water celestials.

742
00:35:05,974 --> 00:35:07,641
The male doesn't dream,

743
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,343
but the female
has beautiful dreams

744
00:35:09,377 --> 00:35:10,777
and he's there to steal them.

745
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:13,180
I wanted to do something
that I haven't done before--

746
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:16,116
bold colors of silver
clashing with yellow and orange.

747
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:17,952
I thought that the silver color

748
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:20,154
was a great choice

749
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:23,423
to encapsulate
the ethereal concept.

750
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,426
But what you did on her
compared to what you did on him

751
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:28,362
seemed disconnected.

752
00:35:28,396 --> 00:35:30,664
But it definitely stood out
as uniquely yours.

753
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:31,798
Thank you.

754
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,167
I thought your sculpting
was terrific.

755
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:35,502
Everything was very clean.

756
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:36,770
I loved your silver guy.

757
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:38,305
And when the lights hit him,

758
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,975
oh, my God, it was fabulous.

759
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,676
The sculpture--
particularly on the face--

760
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,479
was that perfect balance
of hard and soft

761
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:47,647
and really looked so beautiful.

762
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:49,283
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

763
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:51,252
Kris, you can step back.

764
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,723
Anthony.

765
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:58,926
Would you tell us
your concept of your characters?

766
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,027
I had sinister.

767
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,728
The male character
is the dream thief,

768
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:04,331
and he had his identity and soul
ripped out of his chest.

769
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:05,966
So he's trying to steal
the princess'.

770
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,601
I wanted to go
as two opposite ends

771
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:08,835
of similar characters.

772
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,538
The female being very soft
and round features

773
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:14,541
compared to the male's jagged
and angular features.

774
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,643
I think you did an amazing job.

775
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,578
Thank you.

776
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:20,281
The characters looked like
they belonged together.

777
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,849
I love the coloring
on both of them.

778
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:25,652
I especially liked
your dream thief,

779
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,555
because the paint job
was absolutely gorgeous.

780
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,925
Thank you.

781
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:34,161
The profile of the princess
was, for me, perfect.

782
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,797
That head shape
was so beautifully balanced.

783
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:39,566
She's still
a very female character.

784
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,468
And she's beautiful
in an alien way.

785
00:36:41,502 --> 00:36:44,171
And to be accomplishing that
at your level

786
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:45,639
is truly impressive.

787
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:46,740
Thank you, guys.

788
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:48,742
Anthony, thank you very much.

789
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,778
Wayne, please step forward.

790
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:54,081
Hi, Wayne.
Tell us about your concept.

791
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:55,649
I picked supernatural.

792
00:36:55,683 --> 00:36:58,052
I wanted to go with an angel
and a demon theme.

793
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:00,154
On her back,
I wanted to sculpt these wings

794
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:01,355
that were in development
of growth.

795
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:03,123
As far as the dream thief goes,

796
00:37:03,158 --> 00:37:07,361
his goal is to
steal these wings from her.

797
00:37:07,395 --> 00:37:11,065
They're a great team
as characters.

798
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,300
They felt like they
were related to one another.

799
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:16,170
I could definitely tell
your sculpting.

800
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:18,339
Beautiful stuff going on
with the head.

801
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:19,873
Great detailing.

802
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:23,610
It was one of the first times
I saw some wrinkles and aging

803
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:25,879
that felt organic
and realistic.

804
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,014
I concur.

805
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:29,549
I feel that most
of your successes tonight--

806
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,018
and there were quite a few--

807
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:32,987
can be found
on your demon character.

808
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:35,789
I loved the back
of the female as well.

809
00:37:35,823 --> 00:37:39,860
It was both original
and well-executed sculpturally.

810
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,528
I, too, thought your characters

811
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:43,330
were very well-suited
for each other.

812
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:46,833
It was obvious that they also
were from the same world.

813
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,869
And I really enjoyed the way

814
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:51,372
that you had the horns
going back into his skull,

815
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:52,873
which was really inventive.

816
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:55,309
- I love that idea.
- Thank you.

817
00:37:55,343 --> 00:37:56,843
Thank you, Wayne.
You can head back.

818
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:58,879
Well, the judges have heard
what you have to say,

819
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:01,548
and it's time for them
to decide who will become

820
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:03,083
this season's champion.

821
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:05,986
If you'll please head backstage
while they make their decisions.

822
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,824
Yeah!

823
00:38:14,629 --> 00:38:16,530
Let's talk about each one
of our contestants tonight.

824
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:17,764
Let's start with Kris.

825
00:38:17,798 --> 00:38:19,333
Beautifully done.

826
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,735
And I have a lot of respect
for the originality

827
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,404
that he infused
into the challenge.

828
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:24,771
I could look up

829
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,740
- and immediately identify...
- You knew.

830
00:38:26,774 --> 00:38:28,642
- ...both of Kris' characters.
- Absolutely.

831
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:30,344
Which you could not do
with anyone else's.

832
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:31,645
You had to hunt 'em down.

833
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,380
He was the only one
that went bold with the colors,

834
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:35,682
albeit, I think
it was kind of an odd choice

835
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,584
to use orange with ethereal.

836
00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:39,186
But his dream thief--

837
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,388
when he came out
with that silver makeup on

838
00:38:41,423 --> 00:38:42,889
and those lights hit him,

839
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,458
- oh, my God, it was spectacular.
- Beautiful.

840
00:38:44,492 --> 00:38:47,027
The water celestial character.

841
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,629
Even though the paint job
camouflaged it,

842
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:52,533
the sculpture underneath
was really quite good.

843
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:53,800
Yeah.

844
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,370
All right,
let's move on to Anthony.

845
00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:58,272
I love the fact
that the female had no hair,

846
00:38:58,306 --> 00:39:01,708
and she still looked
really uniquely beautiful.

847
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:04,778
It was just the actual subtlety
of the sculpture

848
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:07,714
and the way that it swept back.

849
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:09,616
And she really looked amazing.

850
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,151
It looks natural.

851
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:13,554
The proportions
have been reined in

852
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:15,722
and thought about so well.

853
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:18,358
That is a culmination
of listening

854
00:39:18,393 --> 00:39:21,462
to so many of the notes
that we have all given him.

855
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:25,432
These designs
are absolutely usable.

856
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,734
It's also sinister.

857
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:29,136
It's what
it was supposed to be.

858
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,604
All right,
let's move on to Wayne.

859
00:39:30,638 --> 00:39:32,772
- He is such a good sculptor.
- Yes.

860
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,142
And not just, like,
the surface of the sculpting,

861
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:37,311
but the ideas of the big forms.

862
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:39,946
He's definitely improved
his paint skills

863
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,181
since he came here.

864
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,516
That decision to vein
that guy up--

865
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,218
what a huge step!

866
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:45,819
I really thought
that it was a coup

867
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,921
that he put those horns
on that demon

868
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,423
and embedded them in his head.

869
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:50,757
He wanted to get those horns
on the demon,

870
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,426
and he figured out
a way to do it.

871
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,328
And he made some really
interesting choices

872
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:55,962
with some
of the structural things

873
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,264
on the demon's face.

874
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:59,032
While that's incredible, "A,"

875
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,601
and "B," we've never seen it.

876
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:02,035
Mm-hmm.

877
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,104
In our collective knowledge
of character design,

878
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:06,140
that's a difficult thing
in and of itself,

879
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,975
to come up with something that's
truly unique and original.

880
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,478
All right, judges.
Have you chosen a winner?

881
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:14,281
- It was a close one, but...
- It really was.

882
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:15,882
- Yeah.
- We're there.

883
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,784
All right,
let's bring them back out.

884
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,293
One of you will become
the winner of <i>Face Off.</i>

885
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:29,829
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about tonight's makeups?

886
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:34,934
Kris, we were delighted
with your silver character.

887
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,370
And we really appreciate

888
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:39,173
that you stepped
outside of the box tonight.

889
00:40:39,207 --> 00:40:40,674
Anthony.

890
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,677
There was an immediately
recognizable harmony

891
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:45,212
between your characters,

892
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:47,914
and the profiles
were quite striking.

893
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,082
Thank you.

894
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,551
And Wayne.

895
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:51,885
As always,

896
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:54,354
there were some truly original
ideas in your sculpting,

897
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:58,625
and your characters were very
clearly from the same world.

898
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:02,829
Glenn, who is the winner

How does it feel?

908
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:49,556
Oh, my God, it's amazing!
Oh, my God!

909
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,660
To be the <i>Face Off</i> season four
champion is awesome.

910
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:54,928
Oh, my God.

911
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:56,630
Words can't describe

912
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:57,831
what I'm feeling right now.

913
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,365
Congratulations.

914
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,368
It's just so surreal.
I'm so thankful.

915
00:42:02,403 --> 00:42:03,870
I'm <i>Face Off</i>
season four champion.

916
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:05,004
Yeah!

917
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,640
Here are the keys

918
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:08,308
to your new Fiat 500.

919
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,579
Anthony!
Whoo!

920
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,315
Oh, my God.

921
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:17,484
Thank you guys so much.

922
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:19,753
I feel like
I'm trapped in a dream.

923
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,087
This is awesome.

924
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,690
Oh, my God.

925
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:25,492
I'm honored
to have been part of the finale

926
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:28,628
with Wayne and Anthony.

927
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:29,996
This has been
the best experience.

928
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,265
This competition
has meant a lot to me,

929
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,501
because I showed myself
that I was able to do things

930
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:35,902
that I thought
that I couldn't do.

931
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:38,338
I'm not giving up makeup.
I'm gonna stick to it.

932
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,877
We all worked really hard,

933
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:45,479
so for me to come out on top

934
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:47,080
against such amazing artists
is truly an honor,

935
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:49,616
and it just makes me
even more proud

936
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,519
to be with all them.

937
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:53,787
This has definitely been
an experience

938
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,789
I will never, ever forget.
