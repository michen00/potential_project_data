Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:09,359
Kris's butterfly creation
brought him his second win.

3
00:00:11,162 --> 00:00:13,196
But Alam's incoherent design

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,666
failed to impress,
and she was sent home.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,834
Now eight artists remain

6
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:18,869
and tonight they'll face

7
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:21,371
two of their toughest
challenges ever.

8
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:22,205
We're in the zombie apocalypse.

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,907
Where's my fucking sponge?!

10
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:26,109
Your spotlight challenge

11
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:27,511
is to create
an original werewolf.

12
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:29,947
This is awesome.

13
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:32,549
For some, the pressure
will be too much.

14
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:34,417
I just need to take a breath.

15
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,920
Gonna fucking punch him.

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,458
Oh, he blew apart.

17
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:43,326
It really does not work.

18
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:46,751
It's terrible.
The proportions are nightmares.

19
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:49,099
He is so beautiful,
it's an amazing job.

20
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,400
In the end,

21
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,202
only one will win
the opportunity

22
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:54,805
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's

23
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,306
academies in New York
and Paris,

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,409
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,

25
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:02,445
and $100,000.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,717
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

27
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:08,418
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

28
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,225
Sync and corrections by n17t01

29
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:55,732
I miss Alam.

30
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,333
- You guys missing Alam too?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,501
Super talented.

32
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,070
The mood in the house is sad

33
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:03,473
because everybody really liked
Alam's aesthetic.

34
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:04,975
Both Meagan and I are nervous

35
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,543
about the next challenge

36
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:07,818
because it seems like
the judges

37
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,813
are really gonna be looking
at us

38
00:02:09,847 --> 00:02:11,081
with a magnifying glass.

39
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,616
I liked your moth.

40
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,530
Looked like it had
Joe Dirt in a headlock, but--

41
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,789
I can't continue to put work
out like that moth.

42
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:21,091
I need to show
that I am a strong artist

43
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,192
and I belong here.

44
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,226
- Let's go, guys.
- Let's go.

45
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,494
Let's do it.

46
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:27,397
I have to knock it
out of the park this week.

47
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:37,007
We're walking up
to this country house,

48
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,342
and we see this barn,
and we're thinking

49
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,444
that it's going to be
some kind of a animal challenge.

50
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,848
Maybe it's some kind
of an alien challenge.

51
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:46,149
I brought you out here today
to talk

52
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,351
about one
of the most iconic makeups

53
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,620
in film history.

54
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:50,921
They've been featured
in everything

55
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:53,724
from <i>Dawn Of The Dead</i>
to <i>28 Days Later</i>

56
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,493
and even the massive hit
<i>The Walking Dead.</i>

57
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,995
- Yes.
- That's right.

58
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,129
I'm talking zombies here.

59
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:00,463
- Yes!
- Excellent.

60
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:01,564
Whoo!

61
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,899
I'm from Pittsburgh,

62
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:06,202
and zombies were invented
pretty much in Pittsburgh.

63
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:08,765
So I'm very excited
about this challenge.

64
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:11,066
I'd like to introduce you
to your guest judge.

65
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:14,377
She has produced some
of Hollywood's biggest hits,

66
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,712
including the <i>Terminator</i> films,

67
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:16,847
<i>The Incredible Hulk,</i>

68
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:18,081
and <i>Aliens.</i>

69
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,449
She's also
the executive producer

70
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,451
of <i>The Walking Dead.</i>

71
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:23,020
Please welcome Gale Anne Hurd.

72
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,387
Hi.

73
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,856
Everything Gale Anne Hurd
has done

74
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,490
has been classic.

75
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:28,725
There's no messing around
when she's on set.

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,993
What advice do you have
for these guys

77
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:31,327
to make a convincing zombie?

78
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:35,431
Think about how
your particular zombie died.

79
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,834
Were they bitten in the neck,
maybe the arm?

80
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,804
And that will help you create
a believable makeup.

81
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,139
So let's meet your models.

82
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,109
Aah!

83
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,651
This is rad!

84
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:00,657
Literally a stampede
of people come out.

85
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,059
I'm hoping we're not doing
all of these people

86
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,360
because there's, like,
80 of them.

87
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:05,528
That is gonna be rad!

88
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,097
These models are coming out.

89
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,332
It's so fun and so scary.

90
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:11,046
We're in the middle
of a zombie apocalypse.

91
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:18,208
Professionals in the industry
are often tasked

92
00:04:18,242 --> 00:04:20,010
with not only making up
the stars,

93
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:22,012
but they also have to make up

94
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,780
an army of background actors.

95
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:25,916
Working in teams of two,

96
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,350
your foundation challenge
is to transform

97
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:28,585
all of these extras

98
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:31,722
into a horde
of flesh-eating zombies.

99
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:34,624
We have 20 zombies each team.

100
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,193
This is insane.

101
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,661
Your randomly selected
teams are...

102
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,097
Eric F and Wayne...

103
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:41,397
Dude!

104
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:42,665
Meagan and Anthony,

105
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,736
House and Eric Z,

106
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,470
Kris and Autumn.

107
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,072
And I'm sure you've noticed
that we don't have

108
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:50,406
any makeup stations set up
for you today.

109
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,875
So you're actually
going to be working

110
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,990
in the farmhouse over there

111
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,571
with just the most basic
items necessary

112
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:56,813
to get the job done.

113
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,448
You are working in teams today,

114
00:04:58,482 --> 00:04:59,783
but only one of you
will receive immunity

115
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:00,784
for winning the challenge.

116
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,285
So make sure
that you each create

117
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,855
at least one featured zombie
that showcases

118
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,522
your individual work.

119
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:09,692
You've got 2 1/2 hours
to complete your horde.

120
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,195
Your time starts now.

121
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,033
Just another day at the office.

122
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,135
- I--
- You know?

123
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,340
- Ready to be a zombie today?
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,409
Our strategy is to get
as many of their faces

125
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:29,612
built up as possible,
so like in the last hour we can just

126
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:32,015
run through 'em painting
as fast as we can.

127
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,984
I'm thinking that it's
probably around eight minutes

128
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,118
per zombie.

129
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:36,286
For an eight-minute zombie,

130
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,687
I'm going with cotton
and latex.

131
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,656
It's quick, you can form it
to the face,

132
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,958
so it looks like
the skin is open.

133
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:44,995
They just need
to look gross and bloody.

134
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:50,934
I've done hundreds
upon hundreds of zombie makeups.

135
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:52,468
So I want to win
this challenge.

136
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:53,569
I want the immunity.

137
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,704
I gotta speed up.

138
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,173
Let's have a lady up.
Here you go.

139
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,640
I love working
on lots of people.

140
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:00,110
This is perfect.

141
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,783
I use a lot of airbrush
and spatter,

142
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:09,419
things that I know
are gonna be quick.

143
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,321
Autumn's painting with a brush.

144
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,756
We don't have time
to be elaborate

145
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,825
with any of this makeup.

146
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,659
Should I go further with this?

147
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,461
No, let's move on
to the next one-- next!

148
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:20,130
I'm basically gonna
line them up

149
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:22,565
and just start sponging them
with different colors.

150
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,968
Me and Wayne,
we need to speed this up.

151
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:26,903
So I just line them all up

152
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,272
and start smacking them
in the face with stuff.

153
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:30,707
I got the one hero,

154
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:32,876
and I got one, two,
three, four going.

155
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,445
We have one hour left!

156
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,713
Eric Z's knocking 'em out.

157
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:38,348
His makeups
are looking fabulous,

158
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,416
and we're keeping up
with each other per zombie.

159
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:43,519
It's really about just
getting everyone done right now.

160
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:45,588
Can I get all the people
that aren't done

161
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:46,756
on both sides of us?

162
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,625
We are running out of time.

163
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,062
So I decide to start
an assembly line

164
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:53,964
just to paint quicker.

165
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:57,533
30 minutes left, guys!

166
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:00,036
- Boom.
- Scrape more...

167
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,198
They're probably outside
on the table.

168
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:08,879
Okay, not a team player.

169
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,413
Man, we got a lot left.
We gotta hustle.

170
00:07:10,447 --> 00:07:11,714
If you want me to hustle,

171
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:13,616
pull one out of your kit,
seriously,

172
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,485
'cause I have no sponges
in here.

173
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,987
Use your hands.

174
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:18,321
I don't know
if Autumn's expecting me

175
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,623
to stop what I'm doing
to get sponges,

176
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:21,624
but time's ticking.

177
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:22,698
I need to get my job done.

178
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,794
Where's my fucking sponge?

179
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:27,597
If you see any
that need something, Anthony,

180
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:29,065
tell me, and I'll grab 'em.

181
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,533
Here's another cup of blood
going around.

182
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:31,534
Pass it around.

183
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,203
Five minutes, guys!

184
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:34,737
How many more?

185
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:36,373
I think just one after this.

186
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:38,674
- Last one, last one!
- Great.

187
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,510
In the last three minutes,

188
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:44,114
I'm just slapping them
with blood.

189
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:46,449
- One minute!
- Boom! Here it comes.

190
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,018
Boom!

191
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm just raining blood
down on my zombies.

192
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,122
There we go.

193
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,629
Time is up!
Put your blood down.

194
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:13,410
Can you show us one
of your featured zombies?

195
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,544
This young lady, I just thought

196
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,479
she was a fresh victim
and lots of bites.

197
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:18,181
This gentleman,
he has great bone structure,

198
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,951
so we wanted to keep more
of a traditional look.

199
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:22,419
Eric did
this wonderful job here

200
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:24,587
on the severed arm.

201
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,356
Your attention to detail,
I think, was terrific.

202
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,224
So I think overall,
you did a really good job.

203
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,062
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

204
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:33,896
Tell me about the choice

205
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,031
of the color palette
that you went with.

206
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,766
I think mine are
slightly different.

207
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,069
He airbrushed a lot,
and I hand-painted mine.

208
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,704
So mine have more green
and purple hues to them.

209
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,573
I went
where the blood stops flowing,

210
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,109
the veins start to blacken up
and purple up a little bit more,

211
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,078
a lot of bruising,
things like that.

212
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,579
Can you guys turn around?

213
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,984
- So you didn't address the back.
- We ran out of time, so--

214
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,151
The big issue that I have is

215
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:56,486
you are going to see them
from the back,

216
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,787
the camera will be there.

217
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,755
Producers will be calling you
to set saying,

218
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,724
"I'm sorry, we need them now.
The time's running away."

219
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,455
Right.

220
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,830
This one's mine,
with a tooth from a fight.

221
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:11,734
I really liked her
and the guy with the tattoos.

222
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:13,703
There is a uniformity.

223
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:16,906
They all look like they're
in the same film or TV series

224
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,129
even though you worked on them
separately.

225
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,679
I built up cotton
with this one.

226
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:25,815
- Nice.
- Also right here under the eye.

227
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:27,550
Hers is
a complete silicone buildup.

228
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:30,753
And then I did a little
nice bite wound in her cheek.

229
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:31,868
You have a total aesthetic.

230
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:34,157
All of your zombies look like

231
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,759
they're in the same TV show
or film.

232
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,228
Zombies, would you mind
turning around, please?

233
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:43,799
They have blood and gunk
in the back.

234
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:45,201
- Yes.
- You did it.

235
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,770
- I smacked them on the back.
- Good job.

236
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,518
- Good luck, guys.
- Thanks.

237
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,443
So, Gale, that was probably

238
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:54,710
the most difficult foundation
challenge

239
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:55,978
we've ever had on the show.

240
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,680
How did they do overall?

241
00:09:57,714 --> 00:10:00,216
I think they did great.
I was really impressed.

242
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:03,219
All right, which teams
had the best zombie hordes?

243
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:07,290
- I would say Eric Z and House.
- Good job, buddy.

244
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:10,593
They had fantastic work.

245
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,862
And Meagan and Anthony.

246
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:15,265
You guys were able to create

247
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,699
a single aesthetic.

248
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,701
All right, Gale,
which team came out on top?

249
00:10:18,735 --> 00:10:20,770
It was a difficult decision,

250
00:10:20,804 --> 00:10:23,254
but the top team is...

251
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:26,376
Coming up...

252
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,645
Where's my fucking partner?
I don't know.

253
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,491
I'm already
in a world of trouble.

254
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,550
This is a great concept.

255
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:36,619
It wasn't a collaboration.
It was a dictatorship.

256
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,635
We're getting up and
getting ready...

257
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,593
My style is
go big *, that means

258
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,147
my hair too.

259
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:49,196
- * good, guys! Good morning.
- Wow!

260
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,784
I love it!

261
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,072
Can I touch it?

262
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:55,029
The cool thing about
my hair is it's a mohawk.

263
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:57,072
It's just as crazy as I am.

264
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,528
It's... it's getting there.
It's still quite...

265
00:10:59,563 --> 00:11:01,443
He's gonna * his
war paint on, he's ready to go.

266
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:02,962
Yeah, I'm ready
for this battle.

267
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,517
- You look like a badass.
- I like it.

268
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:06,673
I wish I could pull that off.

269
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:08,865
This is like my brand here.

270
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:11,814
All right, Gale,
which team came out on top?

271
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:13,949
It was a difficult decision,

272
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:16,117
but the top team is...

273
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,289
Anthony and Meagan.

274
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,326
Awesome.

275
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,927
You paid attention to detail,

276
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,296
to the prosthetic makeup,

277
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,998
the clothing, even twigs
and moss in the hair.

278
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:30,700
Congratulations,
Anthony and Meagan.

279
00:11:30,734 --> 00:11:32,902
However,
we can only have one winner.

280
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,069
Gale?

281
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:35,249
The winner is...

282
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:38,675
Meagan.

283
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:42,578
Meagan!

284
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:43,579
I won, and I have immunity.

285
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:44,980
And it feels really good.

286
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:48,884
I saw you directing
the entire operation.

287
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,487
You could start work
on <i>The Walking Dead</i> tomorrow.

288
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,922
- Good job, Meagan.
- Oh, my God.

289
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:53,956
- Thank you.
- Awesome job.

290
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,257
As the winner
of this challenge,

291
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:57,059
you have won immunity
in the next spotlight challenge

292
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,394
and cannot be eliminated.

293
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:00,430
All right, guys.

294
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:01,831
You better get out of here
to avoid

295
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:03,599
getting eaten
by your own zombies.

296
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,180
We're walking
through this field,

297
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:19,749
the moon is shining,

298
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,217
this fog is rolling in,

299
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:24,013
and it feels like
we're about to go into battle.

300
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:27,256
Throughout history,

301
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,325
the full moon has had
an unsettling effect

302
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,394
on humans and the world
around us.

303
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:34,731
Its power has been associated
with violence

304
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:36,366
and werewolves.

305
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,101
Yes.

306
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,071
Werewolves are featured
in all kinds of movies,

307
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:44,741
everything from
<i>An American Werewolf In London,</i>

308
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:48,678
the <i>Underworld</i> films, and
even <i>Michael Jackson's Thriller.</i>

309
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:52,281
But Earth isn't the only planet
in our solar system

310
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:53,879
that has a moon.

311
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:59,054
Each of these planets also has
at least one moon.

312
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,357
Working in teams of two,

313
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,393
your spotlight challenge is

314
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:05,027
to create an original werewolf

315
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:08,731
that might exist on another
planet in our solar system.

316
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:13,403
This is awesome and crazy.

317
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:16,338
Your randomly selected teams
of two are...

318
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:19,942
House and Meagan,
Eric Z and Autumn.

319
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:22,612
Autumn is, for the most part,
very negative.

320
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:23,646
And no one wants to work
with somebody

321
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,720
they don't get along with.

322
00:13:24,748 --> 00:13:26,783
Eric F and Anthony.

323
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:28,684
- Yes.
- Wayne and Kris.

324
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,253
- Yeah, man.
- Stand with your new teammate.

325
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,955
- What's up, man?
- Dude!

326
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:35,858
House and Meagan,
which planet would you like?

327
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:37,993
Mars.

328
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,396
- Eric Z and Autumn.
- Jupiter.

329
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:42,998
- Eric F and Anthony.
- Saturn.

330
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:45,367
- Wayne and Kris.
- Neptune.

331
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:46,682
Since the moon
is the inspiration

332
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:47,837
for this challenge,

333
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,204
I'm gonna leave you guys
out here all alone

334
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:50,740
to start work on your designs.

335
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:53,029
I will see you all tomorrow
in the lab.

336
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,778
All right.
Let's go.

337
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,282
- I'm counting on these guys--
- Doing a...

338
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,284
- A typical werewolf.
- Wolf form.

339
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,286
So the surface of Saturn
is very dry.

340
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,689
It's got real jagged
rock formations,

341
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:07,723
so we're gonna incorporate

342
00:14:07,758 --> 00:14:09,091
all those elements
into our design

343
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,460
by making the skin very jagged

344
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:14,229
and then utilizing
the color palette of Saturn.

345
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:16,532
And the model is going
to walk backwards.

346
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:17,633
That's badass.

347
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:20,803
He's a human that was on Mars

348
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,472
and has become infected.

349
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:24,540
'Cause I have immunity,
I really feel

350
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:26,676
that House should take
the wheel on this.

351
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,110
We have a pretty cool concept.

352
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:31,681
He is an astronaut
that was bitten by a lycan

353
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:34,717
and transformed
into this crazy werewolf.

354
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,688
And maybe, like, um, keep
the teeth, like, more metal.

355
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:40,089
Mm-hmm.

356
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:43,025
I want our creature to be
morphing into the werewolf.

357
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:45,227
I'm thinking, like,
shapes and silhouettes

358
00:14:45,261 --> 00:14:48,263
and bone protrusions
coming out of his back.

359
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:52,668
Pretty darn intense, dude.

360
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:55,137
Neptune's temperatures are
as low as 218 degrees Celsius.

361
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:57,940
Our concept is this alien being

362
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,910
who would stay in the dark area
of Neptune.

363
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:04,279
But when he has to eat,
he comes into the moonlight

364
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:06,348
and changes
into this massive beast.

365
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,283
Dude, I think
we got something here.

366
00:15:08,318 --> 00:15:11,654
That's time.
Let's rock this.

367
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,098
It's day one, and there's
a lot of sculpting to do.

368
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,535
So we want to sculpt the face
with the other clay.

369
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:28,471
Autumn and I decide
to break up the responsibilities

370
00:15:28,505 --> 00:15:29,505
pretty evenly.

371
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,607
She beings to sculpt
on the face,

372
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:33,843
and I begin the sculpture
on the chest.

373
00:15:33,877 --> 00:15:37,146
Let's make it pretty.

374
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,549
We want to do a full bodysuit.

375
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,983
Wayne's focusing on the front,

376
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:42,719
and I'm gonna focus
on the back.

377
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:43,753
I think
we're gonna end up using

378
00:15:43,787 --> 00:15:47,357
about 200 pounds of clay
on this thing.

379
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:49,792
I'm giving, like,
the bicep, tricep, bicep.

380
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:51,227
Yeah.

381
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:53,462
Me and Anthony have a lot
of crap to get sculpted today,

382
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:57,066
but we have a solid game plan.

383
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,471
I have Meagan blocking out
arms and chest for me.

384
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:03,373
I start sculpting on the face
and the head.

385
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:07,142
I will not be doing
a long, dog-like snout,

386
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:10,580
but I have a good feeling
that it will come together.

387
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:12,615
I look over
at Autumn's sculpture,

388
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:13,816
and it's looking
a little rough.

389
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:15,485
It's looking kind
of, like, piggish.

390
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,486
You mind if I take that off
a little bit?

391
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,653
Yeah, that's fine.

392
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:22,592
We switch off, and Eric
completely resculpts it.

393
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,496
Autumn gets offended
very easily.

394
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,664
It's just not a way to work.

395
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:30,232
If at all you're uncomfortable
with going on

396
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,334
- with this particular look--
- No.

397
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,670
I just want it to be
slightly different.

398
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:35,865
I already had it blocked out.

399
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:37,791
All he had to do was detail it.

400
00:16:41,344 --> 00:16:43,591
I don't know
if I can fully trust him.

401
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,484
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

402
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,185
- Here for a walk-through.
- How are you?

403
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,055
So tell us about your werewolf
and what planet you picked.

404
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,424
- We picked Mars.
- Mars.

405
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,259
So your coloring's gonna be
on the red side?

406
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:59,796
Red coloring, dried skin,
it's gonna be very sparse.

407
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,130
Except for, like,
a stripe of mohawk

408
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:02,231
that's running down his head.

409
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:04,600
Pre-paint the skin
and texture

410
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:06,368
maybe with
some spotting or something.

411
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:08,438
- So you see it underneath.
- Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:09,572
Tell us what planet you picked.

413
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:10,673
Saturn.

414
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:12,041
Because of its strong winds,

415
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:14,744
we're actually
incorporating wings.

416
00:17:14,778 --> 00:17:16,879
With the wings,
make sure your model is aware

417
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:18,314
- of what they can do.
- Exactly.

418
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:20,650
The face will sit on top
of his head,

419
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:22,117
so his face is actually
the neck of the werewolf.

420
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:23,285
What are you gonna do
with hair?

421
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,120
We're putting
the hair on sparse

422
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,488
so that you could see
through it.

423
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:27,690
How are you gonna put
the hair on?

424
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,458
- Telesis.
- If you work together on it...

425
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,053
one paints,
and the other lays the hair.

426
00:17:31,895 --> 00:17:33,362
Jupiter has a lot of gravity,

427
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:36,566
so he's gonna have
internal structure of rock.

428
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,067
Show me the face, Eric,
'cause that--

429
00:17:38,101 --> 00:17:41,136
it seems like you haven't
really gotten into that yet.

430
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:42,471
No, I had it roughed out.

431
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:45,441
And then Eric completely
resculpted it.

432
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:46,676
Why did you resculpt it?

433
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,611
It was looking a bit cartoony.

434
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:50,079
You've got a long way
to go on this.

435
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:51,914
- Yeah, definitely.
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:17:51,949 --> 00:17:53,816
The worst part is, if I make
a big deal out of it now,

437
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,085
it's going to slow down
the process even more so.

438
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,954
If we're going to show up
with something,

439
00:17:57,988 --> 00:18:01,356
our only hope is for me
to keep my mouth shut.

440
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:04,460
- Okay, guys. Looking good.
- Bye, thank you.

441
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:07,597
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

442
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,738
Sculpting in circles
over there.

443
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:16,924
Fuck it.

444
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,744
I just have to step outside
and take a breath.

445
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:29,986
Where's my fucking partner?

446
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:32,855
Gonna fucking punch him.

447
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:34,323
I don't know where he is,

448
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:37,994
and I'm getting pissed
that he's given up completely.

449
00:18:38,028 --> 00:18:42,531
- Oh, man.
- He's given up on me.

450
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:49,353
I'm choosing to bite my lip.

451
00:18:49,354 --> 00:18:53,054
If I don't, we're not gonna
have anything on that stage.

452
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:54,772
She told McKenzie
and Mr. Westmore

453
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:56,573
that I totally resculpted
her face.

454
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,743
And I was like, "that's not
what happened at all."

455
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:01,378
What?

456
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:02,780
This isn't
what a collaboration should be.

457
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:04,849
You know
she's gonna say that onstage.

458
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:07,885
Yeah, I know.
That's what scares me.

459
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:11,242
Right there.

460
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,325
That's time, everybody!

461
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,762
I'm hoping that day two
is going to be better,

462
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,830
but I'm dreading it.

463
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:31,308
We have ten hours,
and we still need to finish

464
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:35,012
sculpting the body, the head,
some teeth, and some claws.

465
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:37,948
- We're about to make a mess.
- I think so.

466
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:40,785
Fox is going to block out
the false arms,

467
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:42,553
and then
we can start molding it.

468
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,388
So there's still so much to do,

469
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:45,656
but we do have a game plan.

470
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,158
- It's gonna be a rush.
- It always is, man.

471
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,560
It always is.

472
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:53,664
Ooh.

473
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,200
We know that we have
to start getting things done.

474
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,902
I'm gonna get these pieces out

475
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:00,237
that I know that I at least
have some control over.

476
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,206
I'm not looking forward
to working with Autumn,

477
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,275
but today I've decided
that I'm going to just work.

478
00:20:11,883 --> 00:20:14,318
I thought
I was going into it simple,

479
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,253
and I'm already
in a world of trouble.

480
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:18,622
Chest, arms, and hands need
to be sculpted and molded.

481
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:21,592
The back needs
to be constructed.

482
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,360
Hollow it out,
so it hugs her back.

483
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:27,998
I'm doing seven different
projects all at one time.

484
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,202
Meagan's doing the hair
on the back.

485
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:35,940
The hair work is taking
a long time.

486
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:39,710
- We gotta move.
- House is very meticulous.

487
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:41,745
A little heavy on the purple,
but we'll fix that.

488
00:20:41,747 --> 00:20:43,881
- He's very stern.
- Running out of time.

489
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,635
He might just think
that I'm, like, silly.

490
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:49,920
Meagan is moving too slow.

491
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:50,921
How's your turkey cutting?

492
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:52,854
- I cut my finger.
- Of course.

493
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,394
We have our foam piece,
and it's beautiful.

494
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,063
It's massive.
Damn.

495
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:02,833
You just start laughing
because it's a full suit.

496
00:21:02,868 --> 00:21:04,168
Oh, it's gonna be perfect.

497
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:05,502
Look at the muscle
you got in the neck.

498
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:06,703
That's gonna blend in
perfectly.

499
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:08,205
I think
we're intimidating everybody

500
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,908
just because of the mass size
of everything that we're doing.

501
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,409
That looks fucking awesome.

502
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:15,512
It smells like cookies.

503
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,242
Three minutes!

504
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:28,492
There's a lot of tension
with House today

505
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:30,427
because I think he's concerned
he could go home.

506
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,229
Meagan has immunity.

507
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:33,964
If something goes wrong,

508
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:35,599
it's gonna be my butt
on the line.

509
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,139
That's time!

510
00:21:38,837 --> 00:21:41,272
I feel I'm in trouble.

511
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:44,308
Day three, I have a lot to do.

512
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:57,490
Whee!

513
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,057
So it's application day.

514
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:01,058
We have four hours in the lab

515
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:03,327
and one hour at last looks.

516
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,997
I run in right away,
I grab the head,

517
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:08,432
and I'm ready to fill it
with polyfoam.

518
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,234
Kris is pulling a leg,

519
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:11,668
getting ready to cast
the other one,

520
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,404
and slush latexing the hands.

521
00:22:13,438 --> 00:22:15,840
So we have a lot to do.

522
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:20,611
Basically you're gonna
be walking backwards.

523
00:22:20,646 --> 00:22:21,946
Uh-huh.

524
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,996
You know, you're gonna be
a werewolf from Jupiter.

525
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,253
Should we start brushing
that shit?

526
00:22:29,287 --> 00:22:31,622
We have so many pieces
that we have to run today.

527
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:34,258
It's never a good idea
to have to run pieces

528
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,560
on application day.

529
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:38,095
That's great.

530
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:39,530
Fox is gonna finish running
everything else.

531
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:41,498
I'm gonna start cutting
the seams

532
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:43,000
of the legs and the arms.

533
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:45,670
He brings me the chest piece.

534
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:47,038
Keep 'em coming.

535
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:49,139
I start cutting the seams off
of that.

536
00:22:49,174 --> 00:22:50,608
We're both kind of panicking.

537
00:22:50,642 --> 00:22:51,976
It just feels like that,
you know,

538
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,578
in a way, we've bitten more
than we can chew.

539
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:55,512
As long as we can get
everything painted

540
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:58,749
and assembled, we can apply it
at last looks.

541
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:01,351
I don't care if we got
to duct-tape this shit on.

542
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:05,056
- It's gonna look good.
- We'll do it.

543
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:08,525
Makeup!

544
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,294
Yeah, your butt's
gonna be covered.

545
00:23:10,328 --> 00:23:11,696
Congratulations.

546
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,997
We get to the lab,

547
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:16,433
I just start painting
and pre-painting everything.

548
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:18,669
We got to get
this model covered.

549
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:20,471
- Almost like his color.
- Mm-hmm.

550
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:23,007
And then we'll do
the dead wash on it.

551
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,108
Okay.

552
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:26,376
And if you want
to start painting.

553
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:27,511
Let's do that.

554
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:29,379
I hop on painting
the pieces with her.

555
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:32,382
They're not my favorite colors,
but I'm going with it.

556
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,918
I trust you.

557
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:35,493
Kind of.

558
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:42,318
15 minutes, everybody.

559
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,031
Keep it organized, Eric.

560
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:48,365
Okay, you're gonna help me
lead the way.

561
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,934
Grab the edge of the mask.

562
00:23:49,968 --> 00:23:52,970
I want my model to have
her wolf head on.

563
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:54,939
I don't want it glued down
completely though.

564
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:56,874
I want to save that
for last looks.

565
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:59,744
- My chin is right here.
- Okay, let me pull it back.

566
00:23:59,778 --> 00:24:02,212
But I made a bad mistake.
The head doesn't fit.

567
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:05,082
And the face is not snug
like it should be.

568
00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:08,786
The face is odd, the mouth is
2 inches away from her mouth.

569
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,155
I'm gonna go in there and loosen
that up a little bit,

570
00:24:11,189 --> 00:24:13,357
so I can pull it tighter.

571
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:17,962
That's time!

572
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:20,821
I tack her down,
and then it's time's up.

573
00:24:23,535 --> 00:24:26,270
I need to fix this makeup.

574
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:29,460
If I don't,
this one's all on me.

575
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,508
Coming up...

576
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:34,378
- Hot-glue it up top.
- It doesn't look very good.

577
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:35,880
It's an amazing job.

578
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:37,948
There's some beautiful work
going on in there.

579
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:39,616
It's a travesty.

580
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:40,785
- May I interject?
- Sure.

581
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,887
There are some things
that I need to explain.

582
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,346
We're at last looks.

583
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,217
We have one hour
to finish it off.

584
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:55,219
And we're really trying
to budget our time

585
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:58,155
the best we can.

586
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,324
Have a seat, my man.

587
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:03,928
We have to finish
the paint job, let it dry,

588
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,964
and then get all this hair
laid on.

589
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:10,034
It's very stressful.

590
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:14,071
If you can just adjust this
a little lower.

591
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:15,572
Mm-hmm. Okay.

592
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:17,774
I have to get the face
glued onto her.

593
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,744
It's not going to look as good
as I would like it to.

594
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:22,579
But I'm going to take
the heat on it.

595
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:26,317
Positive and negative,
bring it on.

596
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,319
The spray glue's right there.

597
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:29,786
Fox is playing with the wings.

598
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:33,290
And I've got to get something
on the guy's head

599
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:34,725
so that it covers his face.

600
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,126
Hot-glue it up top.

601
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:37,527
I'm gonna have to cover that *.

602
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:38,762
I don't care.

603
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,164
The last thing I want to do

604
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,631
is cover half of the sculpture

605
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,133
with this big red wig.

606
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,335
It doesn't look very good.

607
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:46,135
Just drape it over.
Yeah.

608
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,015
Time!

609
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,187
I'm very proud of our werewolf.

610
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,355
I never thought it was possible

611
00:26:04,389 --> 00:26:05,789
to get that much amount
of work done

612
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,358
in such a short amount of time.

613
00:26:07,392 --> 00:26:10,127
I'm just glad we got everything
on our character.

614
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:13,530
The makeup came together
in one sense.

615
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:14,631
It is a piece.

616
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:17,634
A piece of what, I don't know.

617
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:29,679
Welcome
to the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

618
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:33,250
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

619
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:34,751
Say hello to your judges.

620
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:37,021
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

621
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,688
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

622
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:39,823
- Hey, Glenn.
- Glenn.

623
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:41,258
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist,

624
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:42,793
- Ve Neill.
- Hi, guys.

625
00:26:42,827 --> 00:26:43,994
- Hi.
- Hello.

626
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:46,230
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

627
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:48,332
- Hello.
- Hi.

628
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:49,833
This week
your spotlight challenge

629
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:51,701
was to create
an original werewolf

630
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,370
that might exist
on another planet

631
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:55,205
in our solar system.

632
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,074
So let's see
what you've come up with.

633
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,195
The makeup application
isn't perfect,

634
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,730
but the face sculpture's
looking okay.

635
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:24,645
There's something beautiful
about her to me.

636
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:46,123
It just looks so big
and so massive up there

637
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,858
that Eric and I
are just really hoping

638
00:27:47,892 --> 00:27:50,950
that the judges see
where we're coming from.

639
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,647
It looks a chihuahua

640
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,849
that's just been shaved
by a child.

641
00:28:12,884 --> 00:28:16,220
It obviously is a piece
that Autumn did

642
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,839
and not me.

643
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:41,778
Wayne and I are excited.

644
00:28:41,812 --> 00:28:44,281
I mean, we really love
what we did.

645
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:45,949
It was a lot of fun working
with Wayne,

646
00:28:45,983 --> 00:28:48,593
and we're both just ecstatic.

647
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,229
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

648
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,564
There's no reason
why we shouldn't.

649
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:08,705
Hmm, hmm, hmm.
Mm-hmm.

650
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,006
One thing I'm
kind of digging about this is

651
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,341
I feel like I see a story.

652
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,609
See what I'm saying?

653
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:15,412
I also like the direction
of some of this.

654
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:16,447
Wonder what's happening here.

655
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:17,514
Is this
where it was scratched, maybe,

656
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,715
and that's how it got infected?

657
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:19,716
I thought that's
what it looked like too.

658
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,118
Right?

659
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:23,152
That's a lot of scratch marks
if that's the case.

660
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,625
As a whole, what an
interesting sculpture going out.

661
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:31,128
Dude, it's, like,
hot-glued and--

662
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:35,099
- let's take a look at this.
- Oh, he blew apart.

663
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,800
They don't get much bigger
than that.

664
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:39,303
- It's almost full body.
- Turn around.

665
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:41,338
They went this far and then
made stubby, little feet.

666
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:44,174
Yeah, they look more like
the heels than this foot does.

667
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:46,009
Man, that's a lot of work.

668
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,111
Yeah.

669
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:49,313
It is absolutely a ton of work

670
00:29:49,347 --> 00:29:50,481
for the time that they had.

671
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,149
The question is,
is that the right decision?

672
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:53,283
I don't think it is.

673
00:29:53,318 --> 00:29:54,879
This hair work
is pretty crappy, guys.

674
00:29:54,885 --> 00:29:57,754
What's with cousin itt wig?

675
00:29:57,788 --> 00:30:00,824
The overall shape
of this head sadly

676
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,126
is looking terrier-esque.

677
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,361
It's not like a wolf head.

678
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:07,264
Can you open your mouth?
Articulate that at all?

679
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:09,233
Oh, man.

680
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:13,069
Is there a fantastic four theme
here?

681
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,640
It sort of has, like, a
thing-esque rock texture going.

682
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:19,376
And turn your head
to the right.

683
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,710
It's--

684
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:23,347
Damn.

685
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:26,316
I don't like muzzle werewolf.
I never have, and I never will.

686
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,717
It doesn't work.

687
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:30,387
That shape on a human head
does not and will never work

688
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,422
because the rest of the shape
of our skull

689
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,158
- doesn't flow into that.
- Mm-hmm.

690
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:35,259
The piece is bad.

691
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:36,760
They're not judging my work.

692
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:39,429
They're judging this piece
that I helped on.

693
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:43,069
It wasn't a collaboration.
It was a dictatorship.

694
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,635
The piece is bad.

695
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,896
I might as well go
up there * guillotine.

696
00:30:51,897 --> 00:30:54,198
I want to explain to the judges

697
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:56,634
this is not
what I wanted to make.

698
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:58,068
This is not my work.

699
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:00,505
He's pretty.

700
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,939
I like the blue wolf.

701
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:04,509
It's an interesting concept.

702
00:31:04,543 --> 00:31:07,478
All right,
let's see the back then.

703
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:08,879
This is interesting stuff.

704
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:10,147
There are these strokes

705
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:11,549
where they're just
going in and, like,

706
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,218
subdividing up muscle
and making it look interesting.

707
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:15,620
Also the flow through the neck.

708
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:16,854
- Mm-hmm.
- See, I like this thing.

709
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:20,090
They're doing a whole suit
in 19 hours.

710
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:22,059
Like,
there's definitely latitudes

711
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:24,182
that I'm willing to grant them.

712
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,368
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

713
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:32,002
to learn more about your work.

714
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:35,840
House and Meagan,
you're up first.

715
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:42,880
Begin by explaining the concept

716
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:45,516
and how you divided up
the duties here.

717
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,386
The concept is
an American astronaut on Mars

718
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,823
that's bitten by one of
the native lycanthrope species

719
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:53,758
and is
in mid-transformation.

720
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,427
I sculpted the head,
the chest, the hands,

721
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:59,096
painting, and constructed
the latex suit.

722
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,400
I did the hair and the back.

723
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:04,702
I think
this is a great concept.

724
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:05,870
When it walks out,

725
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:08,373
there's
a very conspicuous backstory

726
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:10,541
fulfilling that aspect
of our challenge.

727
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:13,411
- I'm pretty happy with this.
- Thank you.

728
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,813
I do like the fact that
she can actually use her mouth,

729
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:18,383
which is something some
of our others can't do.

730
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,884
And that's really good.

731
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:23,654
Massing out the shoulders,
keeping the head small,

732
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:26,724
those are all things that feel
very classic wolf-like,

733
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:29,026
so that's where the success
is for me on this.

734
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,796
Meagan and House,
please step back.

735
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,463
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

736
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:37,740
Eric F and Anthony.

737
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,610
Tell me what your concept is.

738
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:48,245
Our werewolf is from Saturn.

739
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,680
And there's 62 moons,

740
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:52,650
so we figured
we'd be pretty wolfed out.

741
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,952
I think you really did
a lot of work this week,

742
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:58,188
and I have to give you a hand
at how much you accomplished.

743
00:32:58,223 --> 00:32:59,891
However, the head looks like

744
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:02,827
a big, rubber Halloween mask,
guys.

745
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,695
I'm not really happy with this.

746
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,598
And it could have been
so bitchin'.

747
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:10,200
Having your character
in reverse

748
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:11,302
is a neat concept,

749
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:14,472
but it really does not work.

750
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:17,241
There's no way
this guy could perform.

751
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:19,275
Somewhere along the line,
you had to have stopped

752
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:22,279
and looked at the proportions
that are nightmares,

753
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:24,214
especially on a wolf creature.

754
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:25,750
You need mass and bulk up here,

755
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:28,986
and then the head is way too big
even for that construct.

756
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,322
Anthony, Eric,
please step back.

757
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,357
Thanks for everything.

758
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:37,651
Wayne and Kris.

759
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:45,002
Start off by telling us
the concept.

760
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:47,037
Basically our werewolf
is from Neptune.

761
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,874
Neptune is
218 degrees below Celsius,

762
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:51,075
so it's very, very cold.

763
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:52,549
So we wanted to keep
those blue tones

764
00:33:52,578 --> 00:33:54,979
to where he's camouflaged
into this environment.

765
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:57,281
Turn to the back,
if you don't mind, real quick.

766
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,984
What's really cool is

767
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:02,252
the detailing that you're doing
along the spine

768
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:07,481
and up into the neck,
extending that into the skull.

769
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,270
You're messing with
the forms appropriately.

770
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:11,428
There's some beautiful work
going on in there.

771
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:14,565
When you were sculpting,
did one person focus

772
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,333
more on the front
and another on the back?

773
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:17,368
Wayne pretty much handled
the front,

774
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,036
and I did the back.

775
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,138
I really appreciate
all of those flourishes,

776
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:22,540
and it is amazing amount
of work.

777
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:25,810
For me, he is
a very cohesive makeup.

778
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,979
And you did a whole suit.
It's an amazing job.

779
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:29,313
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

780
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,749
Wayne and Kris,
please step back.

781
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:34,088
- Thank you.
- Good job.

782
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:39,089
Good job, man.

783
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:41,390
Autumn and Eric Z.

784
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:49,967
Please explain the concept
behind this creation.

785
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:51,368
Being the Jupiter werewolf,

786
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:55,372
he has a stone structure inside

787
00:34:55,407 --> 00:35:00,310
to help him withstand
Jupiter's gravitational pull.

788
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:03,548
This is a nightmare.

789
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:08,052
Tell me what the breakdown
of responsibility was.

790
00:35:08,986 --> 00:35:12,160
Eric had blocked out the chest,
and the spine and

791
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:14,610
I had blocked out the head,
and then he resculpted it,

792
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,471
- and then I resculpted it again.
- Well...

793
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:18,135
- Can I-- may I interject?
- Yeah.

794
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,348
Sure.

795
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:22,231
I had not resculpted the face.

796
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:24,968
I did do sculpting on the face.

797
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:27,403
- Yeah.
- But I did not resculpt it.

798
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:30,574
I felt that I needed to fix it
or make it better.

799
00:35:30,608 --> 00:35:33,643
The overall execution--
the giant, gaping holes

800
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:35,812
on his arms that are covered
with dental dam,

801
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:38,414
the shoes--
there's no attempt at all

802
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:40,717
to make those blend
onto the legs.

803
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:42,486
It's a travesty.

804
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,490
Could you turn him around
for me?

805
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,692
So you blocked out
the whole sculpture...

806
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:49,726
- The spine.
- I did, I blocked out--

807
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,799
- And then Autumn
finished it off? - Exactly.

808
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:53,097
Once again, this is not exactly

809
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:54,231
what I had sculpted.

810
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:55,732
It is very much the same idea,

811
00:35:55,766 --> 00:35:57,734
but it turned out
completely different.

812
00:35:57,768 --> 00:35:58,802
It seems like the relationship

813
00:35:58,836 --> 00:36:00,104
was dysfunctional,
and Autumn--

814
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,058
It seemed great until we
got right here actually.

815
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,440
Until this moment?

816
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:04,841
- Yeah.
- Okay.

817
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:06,410
We asked you at the beginning,
both of you, who did what,

818
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:10,147
and you finished
that dissertation.

819
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:11,315
But you're a team.

820
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,750
So I don't know
what's going on.

821
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:16,987
But I know
what the end result is,

822
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:19,956
and it's not good.

823
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,291
It's a match made in hell.

824
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:23,293
You're walking all over him,

825
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:26,563
and he's sitting back
and not talking up enough,

826
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:29,966
and that combination
is what led

827
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:30,700
to this travesty of makeup.

828
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:32,702
I didn't feel at the time

829
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:34,571
that I was walking
all over him at all.

830
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:36,706
And he didn't let me on
to feel that way.

831
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,142
- That I was--
- I find that hard to believe.

832
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:42,012
You were too busy being bossy
probably to hear it.

833
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:45,115
Enough said.

834
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,970
Eric and Autumn,
please step back.

835
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:51,626
Thanks, man.

836
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:57,861
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

837
00:36:57,895 --> 00:36:59,229
If you'd please,
head back to the makeup room

838
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,876
while they make
their decisions.

839
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:07,071
All right, guys.

840
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:09,373
Let's start with some
of the looks you liked the most.

841
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:11,641
Why don't we begin
with House and Meagan?

842
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,111
I felt they had some really
good ideas that told a story.

843
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:15,479
Right off the bat, you knew

844
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:17,281
that it was like
some sort of astronaut

845
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:18,982
went to a foreign planet,
got attacked--

846
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:20,484
A lot of brilliant decisions

847
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:25,122
in the terms of sculpture
and the paint job.

848
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,424
Huge amount of work
in a small amount of time.

849
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:28,959
I did like the head sculpture.

850
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,795
In comparison
to the other head sculptures,

851
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:35,732
- it felt the most plausible.
- Mm-hmm.

852
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:38,034
All right, let's move on
to Wayne and Kris.

853
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,436
Beautiful sculpting all around.

854
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:43,273
The back was
a cooler featured element.

855
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:46,076
When it turned around,
it looked so amazing.

856
00:37:46,111 --> 00:37:47,511
I mean, it was just all there.

857
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:48,912
I see a color pattern here.

858
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:50,514
It's starting to head
in the direction

859
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:51,915
of professional paint job.

860
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:53,517
It's not just blue,

861
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:55,486
and it's not just highlight
and shadow.

862
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,387
It's also
some really nice patterns

863
00:37:57,422 --> 00:37:58,755
on top of it breaking it up.

864
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:00,657
And it looks good from far away
and close up.

865
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:02,058
- Truly impressive.
- Yeah.

866
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:03,827
All right, let's move on

867
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:05,962
to the looks you liked the least
this week.

868
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:08,999
Why don't we start
with Eric F and Anthony?

869
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,834
I think they needed
to think it through

870
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,536
and realize that actually

871
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,972
turning somebody around
is a neat idea,

872
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:19,443
but it made the performer
unable to perform.

873
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:20,544
Yeah. At all.

874
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:21,645
Except for to wave
his wings around.

875
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,879
Yes.

876
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:25,115
I think Eric's got
some really cool ideas,

877
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,484
but he's going to continue
to do what he's doing,

878
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,186
as long as he keeps getting by.

879
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,821
He's gonna swing for the fences
with these gigantic concepts

880
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:33,590
going, "ah, yeah, I know
it's not as good as I can do,

881
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,526
but I'll get through
this week."

882
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,362
And eventually,
it's gonna be the wrong week.

883
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:41,097
Let's move on
to Autumn and Eric Z.

884
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:42,699
Oh, my God.

885
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:45,402
The core concept of this
was so asinine.

886
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:47,704
I find it almost insulting,

887
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:49,739
this completely
ludicrous concept.

888
00:38:49,774 --> 00:38:52,876
I concur completely,
and I've just about had it.

889
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,778
I think that her teamwork,

890
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:58,048
her attempt at getting through
this challenge is loathsome.

891
00:38:58,082 --> 00:38:59,583
She's ready to throw him
under the bus

892
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:00,817
for something that she did.

893
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,319
I also think
what's unacceptable

894
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:05,522
is the fact that Eric
is not defending himself.

895
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:09,259
He needs to address it,
not just for the competition,

896
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:11,595
but just to set the tone
for himself professionally.

897
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:13,269
If you put it
into a studio environment,

898
00:39:13,298 --> 00:39:14,364
the way that they explained it,

899
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,599
I'd probably fire both of them.

900
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,933
- Yeah.
- It just doesn't matter.

901
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,569
- No.
- All right, judges.

902
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:20,070
Have you made your decisions?

903
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,271
- Yes, we have.
- We have.

904
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:23,923
Let's bring 'em back out.

905
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:36,986
Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

906
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,155
Wayne and Kris.

907
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,025
There were
some unique sculptural moments,

908
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:43,993
and it was
a very comprehensive makeup,

909
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:47,698
the whole thing accentuated
by a really well done paint job.

910
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:50,166
House and Meagan.

911
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,536
We really liked the shape
and proportions of your makeup,

912
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,071
and your backstory
was very conspicuous.

913
00:39:55,106 --> 00:39:57,241
We saw what it was right away.

914
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,875
Which team came out on top?

915
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:00,750
The top team tonight is--

916
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:07,979
- Okay, which team
came out on top?

917
00:40:08,014 --> 00:40:10,058
The top team tonight is...

918
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,387
Wayne and Kris.

919
00:40:15,421 --> 00:40:17,856
- Yeah.
- Good job, man.

920
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:20,325
You found a really nice balance

921
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,462
between werewolf and alien.

922
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:25,531
And it was
a very complete character.

923
00:40:25,565 --> 00:40:27,533
- Well done.
- Thank you.

924
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,401
Kris and Wayne,
great job, guys.

925
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:31,370
But we can only have
one winner.

926
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:32,404
Glenn.

927
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:34,828
The winner tonight is...

928
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:40,512
- Kris.
- Wow.

929
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:41,746
Wow.

930
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:43,315
Thank you.

931
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:44,583
It came down to figuring out

932
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:46,218
what our favorite part
of it was.

933
00:40:46,252 --> 00:40:48,953
And that was the sculptural
detail on the back.

934
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,189
Thank you so much.

935
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:52,991
I am really happy to hear
the judges call my name.

936
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:56,295
I don't know what to say
other than I feel great.

937
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,629
Kris, congratulations.

938
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,366
You and Wayne can head back
to the makeup room.

939
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:02,634
Good job.

940
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,470
House and Meagan,
you are also safe this week.

941
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,805
Please head back
to the makeup room.

942
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,841
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

943
00:41:11,877 --> 00:41:13,845
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

944
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,514
are on the bottom this week,

945
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:18,883
and one of you
will be eliminated.

946
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:21,953
Please step forward.

947
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:29,994
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

948
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,130
Eric F and Anthony.

949
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:34,899
Once again,
you tried to do so much

950
00:41:34,934 --> 00:41:36,702
that it was a detriment
to your work.

951
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:39,170
The head,
some of the proportions

952
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,039
really killed the whole thing
for us.

953
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:42,841
Autumn and Eric Z.

954
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,644
This was
a horrific collaboration,

955
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:46,978
start to finish,

956
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:50,014
which resulted in a truly
disjointed final product.

957
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,383
So who is going home tonight?

958
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,787
The person leaving
tonight is...

959
00:41:58,258 --> 00:41:59,491
Autumn.

960
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:02,093
This was your concept

961
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:04,663
and a lot of your work,
which you took credit for,

962
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:08,066
but then you didn't take
ownership of the end result.

963
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,335
That means the rest of you
are safe this week

964
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,304
and can head back
to the makeup room.

965
00:42:12,338 --> 00:42:13,772
- Thank you.
- Keep in touch, guys.

966
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:16,908
Thank you.

967
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:18,610
Autumn, it's been great having
you here with us.

968
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,412
Please head back
to the makeup room

969
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:22,213
and pack up your kit.

970
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,315
Thank you, guys.

971
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:24,949
- Good luck, Autumn.
- Good luck.

972
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:26,330
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

973
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:29,488
I'm out.

974
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:31,823
I feel let down by Eric Z.

975
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:35,494
And to say I didn't listen to
or I didn't take input

976
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:37,513
is absurd.

977
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:40,399
I'm not ready to leave
the competition.

978
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:44,803
To go out like this
is a little harsh.
