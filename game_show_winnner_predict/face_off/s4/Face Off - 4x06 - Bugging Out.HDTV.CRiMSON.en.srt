1
00:00:01,342 --> 00:00:03,476
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,382
Eric F's two-headed giant
gave him the win.

3
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,317
Yeah, boy.

4
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:14,023
And Jenna was sent home.

5
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:18,458
Now, nine artists remain.

6
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:20,593
Tonight, things take on
a whole new proportion

7
00:00:20,627 --> 00:00:22,294
with the creepiest
creatures yet.

8
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,231
There's just one little detail
that I left out.

9
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:26,932
No way!

10
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:29,602
The halves
are not going together.

11
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:31,036
Oh, shit!

12
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:32,972
Meagan can't leave
the wings alone.

13
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:34,707
It's, like,
whatever could go wrong

14
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:36,942
is going wrong.

15
00:00:36,977 --> 00:00:38,711
This makes me want to die.

16
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:41,146
It's awful.

17
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:42,348
What were you thinking?

18
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,417
If you ran out of time
and it looks like hell,

19
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:45,451
don't put it on.

20
00:00:45,486 --> 00:00:46,567
There's no excuse for it.

21
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:48,888
I'm not happy at all.
I want to cry.

22
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:51,123
I think you knocked this
out of the park.

23
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,192
I don't know what the heck
you were trying to do.

24
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:55,361
In the end, only one will win

25
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:56,929
the opportunity to be
a guest lecturer

26
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,999
Make Up For Ever's academies
in New York and Paris,

27
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:03,068
the all-new 2013
Fiat 500,

28
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:06,639
and $100,000.

29
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:10,510
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

30
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:12,979
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

31
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:49,970
Sync and corrections by n17t01

32
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:57,623
It really sucks
that Jenna's not here anymore.

33
00:01:57,658 --> 00:01:58,925
You know?

34
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,393
I'm kind of emotionally
drained, you know.

35
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:03,362
After the disaster
that happened

36
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:04,897
with Jenna and I last week,

37
00:02:04,932 --> 00:02:06,532
I'm questioning everything.

38
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,767
So I need to regroup

39
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,035
and figure out
what I'm strong in

40
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,203
and have confidence again.

41
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:14,239
I wonder who's gonna be next?

42
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:26,919
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

43
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:29,689
I'd like you to meet
today's special guest judge.

44
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,524
She has an incredibly
varied portfolio,

45
00:02:31,558 --> 00:02:34,594
having worked with stars like
Ashley Greene from <i>Twilight</i>

46
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:35,828
and the cast of <i>Mad Men.</i>

47
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,463
Please welcome
the Head Makeup Artist

48
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:39,532
for Make Up For Ever,
Lijha Stewart.

49
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:42,802
Hi, guys.

50
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:44,370
It's cool that Lijha's here,

51
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:46,038
but she probably wants to see
some beauty makeup.

52
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:47,473
Not my strong point.

53
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:50,810
With recent movies like
<i>Snow White And The Huntsman,</i>

54
00:02:50,844 --> 00:02:52,512
<i>Mirror Mirror, Red Riding Hood,</i>

55
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:54,780
it seems that Hollywood
has become obsessed

56
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:55,915
with the classics.

57
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,683
But these aren't the stories

58
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,418
that you were told as a child.

59
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:02,388
Each one of them
has an iconic female character

60
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,790
that has been completely
reinvented.

61
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:08,227
That is the basis for
today's foundation challenge.

62
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,564
Reinventing an iconic
female storybook character.

63
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,801
Using the storybook character
makes it

64
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:17,770
a little more challenging

65
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:20,472
because I think most of us
are used to monsters

66
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:21,741
and grotesque creatures.

67
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,609
Why don't you tell
these guys exactly

68
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:24,810
what's at stake here today?

69
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:26,145
The winner of this challenge

70
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:28,014
will not only receive immunity,

71
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,782
but a very special prize
as well.

72
00:03:29,816 --> 00:03:31,183
To tell you more about it,

73
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:32,952
here's a message
from the creator

74
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:36,255
and the Artistic Director of
Make Up For Ever, Dany Sanz.

75
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:39,512
_

76
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:43,328
_

77
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:46,933
_

78
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,868
- I'm very excited.
- Good luck.

79
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:51,604
I can't wait to see your
amazing creation.

80
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,139
I love Make Up For Ever.

81
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:57,176
Okay, that prize is worth
thousands of dollars.

82
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,978
- I'm going for this one.
- I want this.

83
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,479
As a makeup artist,
you're always

84
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:01,881
spending money on your kit.

85
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:04,684
Having this would be
amazing for any of us.

86
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:08,087
All right.
Let's bring out your models.

87
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:11,156
Each model is holding
a classic fairy tale

88
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:13,525
featuring
an iconic female character.

89
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,063
Wayne, you get to choose first.

90
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:18,831
Little Miss Muffet.

91
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:20,700
Belle from
<i>Beauty And The Beast.</i>

92
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,468
Little Red Riding Hood.

93
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,103
- Snow White.
- Hansel and Gretel.

94
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:25,838
- Cinderella.
- Sleeping Beauty.

95
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:28,107
- Rapunzel.
- Little Bo Peep.

96
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:31,577
There's just one little detail
that I left out.

97
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:35,982
Your challenge is to take
the classic good girls

98
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,449
and turn them into bad girls.

99
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,151
- Oh, yeah.
- Sweet.

100
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,654
So, Lijha, you have any
last-minute advice for these guys?

101
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:42,722
Try and find something
in the story

102
00:04:42,756 --> 00:04:44,223
to help drive
your transformation.

103
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:46,291
All right,
Make Up For Ever has stocked

104
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:49,294
the lab with everything that
you could possibly need today.

105
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,597
You have two hours
to complete your challenge.

106
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:55,735
Good luck, guys,
because your time starts now.

107
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,503
- Whoo!
- Okay, go, get working.

108
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:58,871
All right.

109
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:01,206
Where's the red box
of pre-mades?

110
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,778
I actually run over and ravage
the generic prosthetics pile.

111
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:07,680
Move this under there

112
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,148
'cause it's about
to become a war zone.

113
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:12,317
My plan is to "Frankenstein"
the whole piece together.

114
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:14,687
She's gonna be a victim
of a werewolf attack

115
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:16,388
in mid transformation.

116
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:18,590
Okay, don't move.

117
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:22,695
I'm so excited.

118
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:24,163
Right away, I know
that I can make

119
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:26,799
my Belle character
into a badass.

120
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,634
I want to do
a lot of scratches,

121
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,236
some sun damage,
some really subtle things.

122
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,040
I get Rapunzel.

123
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:35,141
And on the shelf

124
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,242
I see Make Up For Ever's
white eyelashes.

125
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:38,443
They're very long,
they're white.

126
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,814
And that really sets
the basis for my makeup.

127
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:44,083
So, it's not
just about the hair,

128
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:46,786
but her face
will be a ghostly white.

129
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,920
I'm not going

130
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,755
to use prosthetics
in this one at all.

131
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,724
I'm going strictly beauty.

132
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:54,359
I'm going to make Gretel
a badass, yet beautiful.

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,147
_

134
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,198
All right.

135
00:05:59,232 --> 00:06:01,834
My concept is Cinderella
had her skin burned off

136
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,235
because she's been working
the cinders,

137
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:05,204
and now it's all hard embers.

138
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,841
I go immediately
to the third-degree silicone

139
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,911
and begin building it up
on top of her skin.

140
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:16,381
I have Sleeping Beauty
and I'm gonna age her

141
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,985
because she's been sleeping
a hundred years.

142
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,191
I'm gonna do the forehead
and under the eyes.

143
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:27,093
I really want that immunity.

144
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,661
I don't know much
about Little Bo Peep,

145
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:32,198
and I just think
of a sweet girl.

146
00:06:32,232 --> 00:06:35,835
My vision for this is create
the strong brow line

147
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:37,169
in a way that makes her look

148
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:40,305
a little more evil
and mysterious.

149
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,342
I picked Little Miss Muffet,

150
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:46,612
and I'm gonna make her
into a spider.

151
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:48,313
I made these out of propoxy,

152
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:49,314
and these are her fangs

153
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:51,516
that will come up
out of the face.

154
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:53,185
I find a nose piece

155
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,054
and I use the nostrils
as pieces

156
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:56,722
where the fangs come out of.

157
00:06:56,757 --> 00:07:00,425
You got ten minutes left.

158
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,963
Her heart has turned to ice.

159
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,497
And now she searches the lands

160
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,333
for beating warm hearts
of princes.

161
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:10,432
Yeah, it's a little gross.

162
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:15,407
Five minutes, guys!

163
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:24,250
That's it.
Brushes down!

164
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:25,717
- Hi, Alam.
- Hi.

165
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:28,854
My story is prince
actually came

166
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,091
and he was disappointed
that she aged.

167
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,894
He left her,
and she's hunting him.

168
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,408
I definitely think
we could've blended

169
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:37,830
the prosthetics
a little bit better.

170
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:40,732
The under-eyes, especially.
The cheeks look good though.

171
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:41,767
I wish you would have done

172
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:42,968
a little more
on the beauty aspect

173
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:46,272
and a little more
on the body and the hands.

174
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:48,941
She basically has been
attacked by the wolf

175
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:50,943
and is in mid transformation.

176
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:52,178
I think you did
a really good job

177
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:53,412
creating a character
and a story,

178
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:54,613
and I could tell exactly
what it was.

179
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,115
- Yeah.
- For a two-hour makeup,

180
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,683
- I think you did pretty good.
- Thank you.

181
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:59,084
When the spider
was coming down,

182
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,953
he actually dropped venom
in her porridge.

183
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:02,587
Years later,
she actually transformed

184
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:03,923
into a spider from the venom.

185
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:05,291
I think she's beautifully evil.

186
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:08,294
I love the fangs.
It's a very impactful element.

187
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:11,063
I do wish she had a little bit
more eye makeup on.

188
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:12,431
I really would like
to win this one.

189
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:13,765
Not only do you win immunity,

190
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,967
you're gonna win, like,
a couple grand

191
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,568
worth of products,
which is crazy.

192
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:17,703
And it's
Make Up For Ever stuff,

193
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:19,940
which their products
are excellent.

194
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:23,307
For an artist, to have a kit
that's loaded like this is huge.

195
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:24,676
All right, Lijha.

196
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:26,578
Which looks
were your favorites?

197
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,680
Eric F,

198
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:30,149
I was so impressed

199
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:32,551
by the makeshift prosthetics
that you did

200
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:34,887
as well the overall character

201
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,355
that you were able to create.

202
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,422
Thank you so much.

203
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:39,358
And, Wayne,
I really was impressed

204
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:41,426
by the fangs that you did.

205
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:43,462
I wouldn't want to cross her
in a dark alleyway.

206
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:44,529
Thank you.

207
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:45,898
Okay, Lijha.

208
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:47,967
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

209
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:51,169
The winner of
this challenge is...

210
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,539
Eric f.

211
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:55,640
Yes!

212
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:57,109
No way!

213
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:58,543
Ahh!

214
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,413
I'm really excited
not only with this immunity,

215
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:02,714
but I'm a broke artist

216
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,750
that can't afford
a nice makeup kit.

217
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,286
So this could definitely
help out my business.

218
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,754
Okay, guys.

219
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,122
I will see you tomorrow

220
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:11,556
for your next
spotlight challenge.

221
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:12,858
- Bye.
- Thank you.

222
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:13,959
Thank you, guys.

223
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:16,362
I have no idea
what we have in store.

224
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:17,462
But I got immunity.

225
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:19,999
So I can get as crazy as I want

226
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,367
- and have no fear.
- Good job, Eric.

227
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:23,289
Eric!

228
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:30,575
- Oh. Oh, wow.
- What is that?

229
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,877
- Oh, yeah.
- What is this?

230
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:33,012
This looks cool.

231
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:34,380
Walking into the lab today,

232
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:35,847
McKenzie's actually
standing there

233
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:37,482
with a bunch of monitors.

234
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,885
Makeup effects artists
are constantly searching

235
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,586
for new sources of inspiration.

236
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,956
This creative spark can
come from almost anywhere,

237
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,425
including
these abstract photographs,

238
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,860
which will serve
as an inspiration

239
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,695
for this week's
spotlight challenge.

240
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,864
Now, before I tell you more,

241
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:55,134
you're each going to need
to choose one.

242
00:09:55,168 --> 00:09:56,235
I'm nervous.

243
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,904
We have no idea
what these shapes

244
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:00,406
are going to mean to us

245
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,308
as far as our next challenge.

246
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:04,876
- Meagan, first pick.
- Ooh.

247
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,045
There's one image
that I really like.

248
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,179
It has, like, a peacock look.

249
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:10,082
A lot of colors,
and I love how it pops.

250
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,350
Alam.

251
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:13,419
I choose my picture
because it has

252
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:16,288
really fun textures
and lots of color.

253
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:19,591
It looks the sea anemone.

254
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:28,900
Now that you've each chosen
a photograph,

255
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:31,603
let's take a look
at what these really are.

256
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:37,776
Coming up...

257
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,644
All that's going
through my mind

258
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,080
is just finishing something.

259
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:42,281
They look crazy.

260
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:45,351
I'm standing on the edge
of disaster.

261
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:46,718
I absolutely loved this.

262
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:49,121
I don't know what the heck
you were trying to do.

263
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,209
Now that you've each chosen
a photograph,

264
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:55,943
let's take a look
at what these really are.

265
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:01,250
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

266
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:03,453
Oh, my--

267
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:05,521
The images you chose

268
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:09,593
where actually scanned electron
microscope photos of bugs.

269
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,260
So your spotlight challenge
this week

270
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,464
is to create an original
bug hybrid character

271
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:16,967
inspired by
your microscopic photos.

272
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,702
Now let's find out
what each of you chose.

273
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:22,038
Meagan, you chose
the sunset moth.

274
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:23,707
Oh, it's a moth.

275
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:25,875
Alam, you have grasshopper.

276
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,080
- Anthony, you picked an ant.
- Beginning of my name.

277
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:31,180
There you go.

278
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:34,718
Kris, you chose
the blue morpho butterfly.

279
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:37,754
House, you have the honeybee.

280
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:40,456
Wayne, you picked the firefly.

281
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,291
Autumn, you picked the beetle.

282
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,095
- Eric Z, you have a mosquito.
- Mosquito.

283
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,331
Eric F, you have
the desert wolf spider.

284
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:51,267
So, the judges
will be expecting

285
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,036
to see your microscopic photos

286
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,505
reflected in your makeups
this week.

287
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:58,307
So go ahead and get started.

288
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,877
We gotta start sketching.

289
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:09,819
The downfall of the butterfly

290
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,122
is that now I have to make
these giant set of wings

291
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:15,224
to watch the size
of the human head

292
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:17,127
that I'm going to be
working on.

293
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:20,764
I'm concerned that they'll
probably end up being heavy.

294
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:24,200
I picked a mosquito,
which is exciting to me.

295
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:26,202
They're scary in a way.
You know, they suck blood.

296
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:27,570
I don't think I'm gonna
be using these colors

297
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:29,338
throughout
this particular piece,

298
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,775
but I definitely want to
incorporate them somehow.

299
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:33,242
I decided to do a chest piece

300
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:35,111
and have the arms coming out

301
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:36,780
of the midsection of the torso,

302
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:39,649
but sort of curled up.

303
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:42,251
I chose this photo
because I love

304
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:45,121
all the different textures,
the colors.

305
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,389
There's a lot to play with.

306
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:48,291
But when it came up as a moth,

307
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:50,894
I'm a little apprehensive
because I've never made wings.

308
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:54,664
I'm basically sticking with
the actual image of the moth.

309
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,700
So I was thinking
of polyfoam for this part,

310
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,302
and then just
one simple face piece.

311
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,503
I'm actually scared that

312
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:02,706
it may look like
a butterfly in the end.

313
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,542
I read a description
on how hairy a moth is.

314
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,345
That's definitely gonna be
something incorporated.

315
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,620
In the five hours
that I have today,

316
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:20,489
I definitely need to nail
the face sculpture

317
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:21,758
and get that molded out.

318
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:22,859
That's priority.

319
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:24,994
My concept is a scientist

320
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,931
and his DNA mixes
with the honeybee.

321
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:30,499
So, kind of half face infected

322
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,969
- with the bubbling of the disease.
- Yeah.

323
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,538
- Half face more of a bee style.
- Yeah.

324
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:37,006
And then bursting out
of his back

325
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,275
is the formation
of the bee body.

326
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:40,844
- Right, that's really cool.
- You think?

327
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:42,126
Oh, yeah. I love it.

328
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:45,181
I have the firefly.

329
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:47,516
If you look at a firefly,
the eyes are really large.

330
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:50,686
And the head is almost
1/3 of the entire body.

331
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:52,355
And probably one of the most
important things about it

332
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,991
is having
this glowing abdomen area.

333
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:56,926
And that's something
that I'll have to figure out.

334
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,328
I'm gonna make this have
a silhouette of a firefly,

335
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:00,663
but when you get closer,

336
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:02,531
you're gonna see human elements
really come to life.

337
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:04,467
That's so freaking cool.

338
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,070
I love all that right there
underneath the nose.

339
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:08,872
And then those
big feelers come out.

340
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,774
And then the fly sucker
will come through

341
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,408
his, like, throat
and then come up.

342
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,809
- I love it.
- Thanks, man.

343
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,615
Even though I had last pick,
I'm actually very, very happy.

344
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,685
I've always really wanted to do
a cool spider hybrid creature.

345
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,387
So I'm taking a female,

346
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:29,492
and I'm having spider appendages
busting through certain areas.

347
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:32,028
Gonna really twist up
the human form.

348
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:34,230
I'm gonna do the fabrication

349
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:38,567
with PVC pipe, and, like,
a latex and foam skin.

350
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,006
What's wrong?

351
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,607
Hmm?
I'm thinking.

352
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:47,277
My bug is a grasshopper.

353
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,879
And I used to catch them
when I was a child,

354
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:52,448
and like, fry them
and eat them.

355
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,951
It sounds weird, but yeah.

356
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:58,221
It's kind of good.
It's crunchy.

357
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:01,590
I've never seen the grasshopper
this colorful.

358
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,592
It has a lot of color
that I can play with.

359
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:07,096
So I'm just really focusing
on making the texture

360
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:08,731
because that's the most
important part

361
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,167
of this challenge.
I think I'm going to do the silicone.

362
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,735
You are?

363
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:14,938
Why, for the translucency
and stuff?

364
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,355
_

365
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,854
_

366
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,680
Thank God I didn't get
a flipping butterfly.

367
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,016
I get a cool-ass beetle bug.

368
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,053
I'm gonna cover her face
in mandibles

369
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,121
and have the eyes on top
of the head

370
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,623
to make sure I get
the right profile.

371
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:35,859
I love the colors.

372
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,728
You know, with the green
palette, I really like it.

373
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:41,430
Maybe bring some Japanese
beetle purple hues

374
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:43,066
into it if I can.

375
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,568
It's really cool,
kind of gross little monster.

376
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:48,104
So hopefully, I can do something
a little bit gnarly.

377
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:50,773
I'm gonna have a lot of fun
with this one.

378
00:15:58,282 --> 00:16:00,750
Does that book have any ants
in it, do you know?

379
00:16:00,784 --> 00:16:03,052
Mine is the ant.

380
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:08,524
I have probably the simplest one
up there.

381
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,026
It's already very minimal,

382
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,932
that there's not much to add
to give it any oomph.

383
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,333
It's probably gonna be
a lot of pieces.

384
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:21,170
Back, chest, the head, the face,
the big abdomen, arms.

385
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:24,774
I just find myself adding clay
and ripping it off,

386
00:16:24,808 --> 00:16:26,709
and then going to the head
and adding clay,

387
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:27,777
ripping that off.

388
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:30,880
And nothing is really
coming together.

389
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:33,182
For the first time
in this competition,

390
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:37,820
I can't see what this
is gonna look like at the end,

391
00:16:37,854 --> 00:16:40,856
and that I think scares me
more than anything.

392
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:43,459
I already know,
two days from now,

393
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,029
I will be on the bottom.

394
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:54,425
My sculpt is * a
great exciting start.

395
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:57,180
I start sculpting my
thorax section

396
00:16:57,215 --> 00:17:00,758
which is basically a
female butt*

397
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:05,011
that is kinda morphed
into a... you know,

398
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,231
- a spider butt.
- Eric!

399
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,218
What?

400
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:11,794
- It's a thorax!
- *.

401
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,556
It's a little bizarre, but
since I do have immunity,

402
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:16,988
I figured I can kinda
go out on a limb.

403
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,460
So, just to create
an insect human hybrid

404
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,663
in less than 20 hours
over the course

405
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:27,198
of 3 days is a huge task.

406
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:31,836
But it seems like everybody is
already off to a better start.

407
00:17:31,871 --> 00:17:33,071
Very cool.

408
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:34,573
I know I don't have
any more time

409
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:35,574
to conceptualize.

410
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:37,108
I still feel lost.

411
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:38,109
And all that's going
through my mind

412
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,912
is just finishing something.

413
00:17:40,947 --> 00:17:42,346
I like this, but I love this.

414
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,715
Don't shoot yourself
in the foot.

415
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:45,016
That's what I'm thinking.

416
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,117
I'm really hoping

417
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:47,886
I can get it molded
and ready for foam

418
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,888
before the night is over.

419
00:17:49,922 --> 00:17:51,155
40 minutes left.

420
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,057
- 40?
- 40.

421
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:58,063
It's getting really crazy
in the mold room.

422
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,177
Everyone's rushing and trying
to get their piece out.

423
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,534
I get the face molded.
Done.

424
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:05,369
Plenty more to do on day two.

425
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:09,007
This is a big challenge
for all of us.

426
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,909
Time!

427
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,311
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go, guys.

428
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:15,013
This is a really huge makeup.

429
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,281
I still have to make
the chest and back piece

430
00:18:17,316 --> 00:18:22,887
with a cowl, wings, an abdomen
that glows, feet, and arms.

431
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:24,990
Tomorrow, it's gonna be crazy.

432
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:33,498
Let's go!

433
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:36,434
Day two in the lab,
I need to open my mold,

434
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:37,969
clean it out,
create my chest piece

435
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:39,137
and back piece

436
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:41,940
as well as an abdomen
and mandible.

437
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:45,309
It's just a lot of pieces
that have to be created.

438
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,685
Hey, guys.

439
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,453
Michael Westmore
and McKenzie come in.

440
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,122
And I'm definitely gonna
take advantage

441
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,323
of any suggestions he gives

442
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,259
because I'm still a little bit

443
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:02,927
knocked down
from the last challenge.

444
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:04,362
So, tell us about your moth.

445
00:19:04,396 --> 00:19:07,498
I have the face piece,
and then I have some hair done.

446
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,834
And that's gonna be
incorporated in the chest piece.

447
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,369
Now, what about your paint job?

448
00:19:11,403 --> 00:19:13,083
I'm gonna try to stick
with these colors.

449
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:15,040
Once you put the fur on though,

450
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:16,675
- it's all one color.
- Yeah, I'm spraying it brown.

451
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,242
You might even neutralize it

452
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:19,644
painting it either
a light yellow

453
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,445
or a white or something
on it first,

454
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,048
and then painting
your color over.

455
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:25,349
Because I know if you try
painting blue or green

456
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:26,851
or something over
the top of this,

457
00:19:26,886 --> 00:19:28,153
you're not gonna get true color
out of it.

458
00:19:28,187 --> 00:19:29,253
Okay.

459
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:30,689
What do you have in mind now?

460
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:33,024
I was trying to put
this texture

461
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,659
as much as I can
in the character.

462
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,761
Mm-hmm.
Colors in the costume?

463
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:39,664
These are all my colors.
It's gonna be really colorful.

464
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,066
It's very pretty,

465
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,569
but don't complicate your life
with too many colors.

466
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:47,638
Michael Westmore is worried
about my colors,

467
00:19:47,673 --> 00:19:49,640
but I think I'm gonna
go with it.

468
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,410
It's gonna be more like
a humanoid type firefly.

469
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:54,312
But from a distance,
all you see

470
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:55,580
is a silhouette of a firefly.

471
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:56,715
So, the way
I'm gonna incorporate

472
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:58,149
the texture from the photo,

473
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,584
I'm gonna make them
come out of here

474
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,019
and then whip up.

475
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:04,055
You've got a lot to do,
you know, to stay on track.

476
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,590
Yeah, I'll pull it off.

477
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:07,158
- I have the ant.
- How are you doing with this?

478
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,827
- I'm struggling a little bit.
- Why?

479
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:11,596
Not a lot of interesting
things going on in the face.

480
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,999
So I'm really trying to just
really work on the profile,

481
00:20:15,034 --> 00:20:16,634
so the silhouette
is very strong.

482
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:20,138
I'm glad to see you're making
the head larger, you know,

483
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,240
because when the individual
comes out

484
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:23,541
in front of the judges,

485
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:26,010
- they have to know what it is.
- Right.

486
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,979
After winning
the first three challenges,

487
00:20:28,013 --> 00:20:30,148
I feel like I'm under
a microscope,

488
00:20:30,182 --> 00:20:31,682
and that freaks me out
more than anything.

489
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:33,084
All right, guys.
We're heading out.

490
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,518
- But it's looking good.
- Thank you.

491
00:20:34,553 --> 00:20:36,955
- See you guys.
- Good luck.

492
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,496
How am I gonna make
these giant set of wings

493
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,165
and how am I gonna attach it
to my model?

494
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,567
I'm concerned that
they'll end up being heavy.

495
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,103
So I'm going to use a foam core

496
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:54,134
because it's a lot lighter.

497
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,743
Kris, do you want to see
what I'm doing?

498
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:00,611
Just because our characters
are so similar,

499
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,446
I want to do something
totally different.

500
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:04,515
Mine are-- are yours--
I'm doing four.

501
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:05,650
You're doing four?

502
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,451
I'm just connecting them
in one half.

503
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:08,853
So that's just makes it simple.

504
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:11,022
So instead
of making one big wing

505
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:12,323
like Kris is doing,

506
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:14,058
I'm gonna do
two separate things.

507
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:17,495
And I also textured my wings
with actual hair,

508
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:20,431
because you read about them,
it's just hair.

509
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,735
I'm doing all of my pieces
with silicone

510
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,106
because I can color them
when I pour it.

511
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,375
So it looks more translucent

512
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,254
and still has the colors in it.

513
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:42,787
My silicone looks amazing,

514
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:44,956
but it's really scary
that I have a lot to do

515
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,949
on application day.

516
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:49,527
Time's up, everybody!

517
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:52,297
I have to make the body
of the grasshopper

518
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:54,665
and the wings and the legs.

519
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,037
And I don't know
how it's gonna work.

520
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:10,781
Today's application day.

521
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:12,483
We have four hours in the lab

522
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:15,114
and one hour at the stage
for last looks.

523
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:17,621
- How's it going, man?
- Hello.

524
00:22:17,656 --> 00:22:19,224
Gonna be the bug man.

525
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,960
You'll have, like, a third leg
kind of growing out.

526
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:23,061
Here's what it's pretty much
gonna be like.

527
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:24,195
Something like that.

528
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,764
My first goal is to finish
those wings off.

529
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:28,318
I can do that
within maybe a half-hour.

530
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:30,335
Cool.

531
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:32,770
Next step
is pre-painting those pieces.

532
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:35,408
I feel pretty confident
I'm gonna get everything done.

533
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:40,245
Everybody else has
all these pieces

534
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,546
already ran in foam.

535
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:46,117
I still have to run my chest
and back in polyfoam.

536
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:49,854
As I'm putting the polyfoam in
and trying to close the mold,

537
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:53,524
the halves are not going
together properly.

538
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:56,660
I sit on this thing
and finally it clamps together.

539
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:59,163
All I can do is wait 45 minutes

540
00:22:59,198 --> 00:23:02,489
and hope I have a piece
that is actually usable.

541
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,108
I'm running out of time,

542
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:11,675
so I'm just gonna make
the wings.

543
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,613
And I still have to incorporate
the texture from the photo.

544
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:18,383
So I take some dense foam,
and then I'm gonna make it

545
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,518
look like just like
the texture.

546
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:23,121
And then I'm sticking them
on the back

547
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:25,223
where they'll be coming out
of the spine.

548
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:27,476
- Snug as a bug.
- Yeah.

549
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,229
I'm not
necessarily sitting pretty.

550
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:32,730
And no one really is
at this point.

551
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,098
I see Meagan's piece.

552
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:35,833
Meagan can't leave
the wings alone.

553
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:39,570
I keep painting these wings,
and it's tough.

554
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:42,315
I don't know where I should stop
with the paint.

555
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:47,878
Finally I'm to a point
where I can open those molds.

556
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:50,881
There's at least something here
I can work with.

557
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,451
But all I can do now
is glue those on at last looks.

558
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,453
- Turn this way, please.
- What's the time?

559
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:57,755
6 and a half minutes.

560
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:00,358
- Coming up behind you.
- You're following me.

561
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:01,960
Oh, shit!

562
00:24:01,994 --> 00:24:04,628
I'm just nervous
because they look crazy.

563
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:06,224
There's, like,
a hundred colors on them.

564
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,598
They don't look like wings.

565
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:09,667
I went overboard
with the paint.

566
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:11,195
It's time!

567
00:24:14,373 --> 00:24:17,328
I'm standing on the edge
of disaster.

568
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:19,910
Coming up...

569
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:21,779
Whatever could go wrong
is going wrong.

570
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:23,281
This is the worst feeling
in the world.

571
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:25,049
If you run out of time
and it looks like hell,

572
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,150
don't put it on.

573
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:28,853
I think you did
a beautiful job.

574
00:24:34,203 --> 00:24:35,803
- Whoa.
- We get to last looks.

575
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:37,271
And I realize
I forgot the elements

576
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:38,772
from the photo at the shop.

577
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:42,443
So, at this point
I'm freaking out.

578
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:43,844
It's, like,
whatever could go wrong

579
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:45,012
is going wrong.

580
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,347
This is the worst feeling
in the world.

581
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:48,349
I still have to apply
literally everything.

582
00:24:48,383 --> 00:24:51,552
And I'm really stressed.

583
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:53,187
30 minutes left!

584
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:56,123
I'm always,
always running out of time.

585
00:24:56,157 --> 00:24:58,992
I still have to put
the facial prosthetic on,

586
00:24:59,027 --> 00:25:01,295
and color the body.

587
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,432
And her bald cap
is tearing off.

588
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:05,942
That's not good.

589
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:08,969
I need to get
those wings going.

590
00:25:09,003 --> 00:25:10,238
Go all the way in.

591
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:12,273
I'm in a hurry,
and I don't love the wings.

592
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:14,141
Your palms are supposed
to be on it.

593
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:16,744
At this point,
everything's going downhill.

594
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:27,588
- It's time, everybody!
- Love it.

595
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,491
My character looks like hell.
I'm not happy at all.

596
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,136
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

597
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,186
Tonight, one of you will be
eliminated.

598
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:47,475
Say hello to your judges.

599
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:49,577
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio,

600
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:51,679
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

601
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:52,813
- Hello.
- Hello.

602
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,582
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist

603
00:25:54,616 --> 00:25:56,384
- Ve Neill.
- Hi, everybody.

604
00:25:56,418 --> 00:25:57,551
- Hello.
- Hi.

605
00:25:57,586 --> 00:25:59,687
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

606
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,555
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

607
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,191
This week,
your spotlight challenge was

608
00:26:03,224 --> 00:26:05,693
to create a bug creature
or a character

609
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:08,028
incorporating
details and textures

610
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:09,363
seen only under a microscope.

611
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:11,076
So, let's see
what you've come up with.

612
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:35,989
It's nice, but it's not
extraordinary.

613
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:37,458
And I think in this stage
of the game,

614
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,427
if you're not doing
something extraordinary,

615
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,081
you may wind up going home.

616
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,982
I'm pretty terrified,
because to me,

617
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,800
it still feels unfinished.

618
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:27,742
I like it.
It's not as bad as I thought.

619
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:30,378
But I'm worrying
about the edges.

620
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:49,296
I'm worried now.

621
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,498
My makeup is more of a mask,

622
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:51,699
which is something
that I told myself

623
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:53,180
I wasn't going to do.

624
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,988
It still is not something
I'm proud of.

625
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:18,025
But it is recognizable
as an ant.

626
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:42,950
Mine stands out
just for the sheer size

627
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:44,585
of the wings.

628
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:47,120
But I really don't know
where I stand.

629
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:06,674
I'm really happy
with this makeup.

630
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:09,042
And if this is the makeup
that sends me home,

631
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,661
so be it.

632
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:29,329
I think she's beautiful.

633
00:29:29,364 --> 00:29:30,731
She's got the provocative,

634
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:34,001
but I think very classy
old-school pinup style.

635
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:37,270
This might be something
the judges can appreciate.

636
00:29:59,127 --> 00:30:01,962
I want to cry.

637
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:05,833
She looks like Chewbacca
and the moth made a baby.

638
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm ready to go home.

639
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:14,775
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

640
00:30:20,582 --> 00:30:21,815
Would you look at this hand?

641
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,984
I don't understand the texture.

642
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:26,743
Hmm.
Great attention to detail.

643
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:31,191
Look how he lit up the tail.
It's really clever.

644
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:32,292
From the inside.

645
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:34,442
Open your mouth, please.

646
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,065
I like the way the thing works
when he just wiggles his chin.

647
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:39,405
- Mm-hmm.
- It's cool.

648
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:43,303
- Oh, silicone.
- Why?

649
00:30:43,337 --> 00:30:44,772
- Can you turn around?
- Turn back around.

650
00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:47,140
Those are wings, I'm assuming.

651
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,742
Makes me want to die.

652
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:51,111
It's awful.
The back is just wretched.

653
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:54,314
I'm worried because
I didn't finish my makeup.

654
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:56,221
I just want to be safe.

655
00:30:58,252 --> 00:31:00,754
We want to know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

656
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:03,857
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

657
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:07,979
- Oh, silicone.
- It's awful.

658
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:10,144
- Can you turn around?
- My goodness.

659
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:11,484
This is...
makes me wanna die.

660
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:15,355
I'm worried because
I didn't finish my makeup.

661
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,857
I just want to be safe.

662
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,013
I like that this is rough,

663
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,527
and I like all
of these wrinkles.

664
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:21,261
There's a lot going on.

665
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,831
This shape complimenting
that shape

666
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,198
is just absolutely beautiful.

667
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,401
The shapes align.

668
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:29,202
Oh, my God.

669
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:32,006
Just look this <i>Teenage</i>
<i>Mutant Ninja Turtle</i> texture.

670
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,942
- It's just ridiculous.
- He's shaking his hand.

671
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:40,414
That's cool.
Very action figure.

672
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:43,047
It's a different approach.
It's stylized.

673
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:46,219
- It's a great shape.
- Yeah.

674
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:49,623
There's some neat things
happening sculpturally too.

675
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:52,209
_

676
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:55,257
_

677
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,767
- This looks like pop art.
- Woof.

678
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,201
Right now I'm on the bottom.

679
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:03,170
So, at this point, all I can do

680
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:04,886
is just admit how bad it looks.

681
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,477
The judges have scored
your creations.

682
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,791
Let's find out
what they thought.

683
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:14,915
Meagan...

684
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,350
Kris...

685
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:19,553
Alam...

686
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:21,989
Wayne...

687
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,857
Anthony...

688
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:26,827
You were the best
and the worst this week.

689
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,598
The rest of you are safe and can
head back to the makeup room.

690
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:36,503
The judges would like to speak
with each of you now

691
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,005
to learn more about your work.

692
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,207
Meagan.

693
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,080
Tell us about your decisions

694
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:48,082
and what drove your design
this week, please.

695
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:49,182
I chose a moth.

696
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,350
And for inspiration,

697
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:52,419
I read about moths and how much
hair they had.

698
00:32:52,453 --> 00:32:55,222
So I think I went a little
too crazy with the hair, but--

699
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,190
- I've studied insects,

700
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,259
and I don't think
you were that far off

701
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,527
with the amount of fur.

702
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,831
Really, it's the colors
that are killing this.

703
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:06,033
Quite honestly, it looks
like you lobbed paint at it

704
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,234
from across the room.

705
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:09,103
It's a hodgepodge
of different colors

706
00:33:09,137 --> 00:33:12,106
smashed into whatever the wings
are made out of.

707
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,708
Very disappointed.
You've done better.

708
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,043
Looking at the picture
of the moth,

709
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,378
I see the blue,
and I see the orange in there.

710
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:19,613
But other than the fact
that you used

711
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,548
those two colors
and quite poorly,

712
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:25,218
you really didn't
follow any design.

713
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,723
Meagan, please step back.

714
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,058
Kris.

715
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:37,197
What was your inspiration
from the photo?

716
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:39,566
For the microscopic picture
is all the top of the head.

717
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,203
But the reference books that we
had never really got close up

718
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:47,174
to a butterfly's chest,
so I made it up.

719
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,144
I think you did a beautiful
job of making it up.

720
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:52,146
The colors in the chest piece
are also the colors

721
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,214
that were in
that microscopic photograph,

722
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:55,716
which is a really good choice.

723
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,384
And I just think aesthetically,

724
00:33:57,418 --> 00:33:58,418
it's very pleasing to look at.

725
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,787
I really appreciate that.

726
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,121
I absolutely loved this.

727
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:03,090
I think that the head
is a super cool shape.

728
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,358
The sculpture on the chest,

729
00:34:05,393 --> 00:34:07,460
I love that it's not
the exact anatomy.

730
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:10,330
It's putting yourself
as an artist into the makeup.

731
00:34:10,364 --> 00:34:13,000
- So, great job.
- Thank you so much.

732
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:14,453
Kris, please step back.

733
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:17,337
Alam.

734
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,807
Yeah.

735
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,012
Tell us about the inspiration
for color and texture.

736
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:29,817
I didn't know grasshopper
can be, you know, very colorful.

737
00:34:29,851 --> 00:34:32,352
But the picture
has orange and yellow

738
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:33,787
and black and purple.

739
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,555
So I wanted to use
all those colors.

740
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,825
There's just
a whole bunch of stuff

741
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,128
that destroy this design.

742
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,530
The thing that's tied together
on her back--

743
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:44,998
they are not wings.

744
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:47,201
I just ran out of time.

745
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:49,569
If you run out of time,
and it looks like hell,

746
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,705
don't put it on.

747
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,073
When you go, "I want to put
a lot of color in something,"

748
00:34:53,108 --> 00:34:54,541
you have to figure out
how those colors

749
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:56,543
are going to flow
from one to the other.

750
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:59,113
By the way,
why is that silicone?

751
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,882
Um...

752
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,450
Right.
That's a problem.

753
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:04,551
If you're going
to use silicone,

754
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:06,653
you must retain
the translucency of it.

755
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,388
That's the point to silicone.

756
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:10,624
The piece on the back,
unfortunately

757
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:12,826
you didn't paint
the inside of the piece.

758
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,527
I don't know what the heck
you were trying to do.

759
00:35:14,562 --> 00:35:18,265
I mean, it's just kind of
a mish-mosh this week, honey.

760
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:20,433
Alam, thank you.
Please step back.

761
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:28,341
Wayne, you're up.

762
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,383
Begin by explaining
what your design was.

763
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:37,785
- It's a firefly.
- Mm-hmm.

764
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:39,420
But I wanted to have
this nice silhouette

765
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:40,888
to where you can see
the big eyes

766
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:42,923
and the very long
fly-like wings,

767
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:44,477
and then have
the vacuum-formed plastic

768
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:46,260
in the back with the light.

769
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:48,262
I think you knocked this out
of the park.

770
00:35:48,296 --> 00:35:52,266
The fact that his mouth movement
is so integrated

771
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,567
into the makeup
that it facilitates

772
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:57,905
this cool move,
that's incredible.

773
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,639
And the way that you hid
the eyes

774
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:02,242
by putting them in plain sight
is ingenious.

775
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:03,410
Thank you.

776
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:05,084
The profile of his sternum
in particular

777
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:08,315
just gives him so much character
in the silhouette.

778
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:09,883
It was a really beautiful thing
that you did.

779
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:13,120
I like the color scheme.
It's very neutral.

780
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:16,389
And then you have this beautiful
green, glowing tail.

781
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,692
Can you tell me where you
integrated the photo?

782
00:36:18,726 --> 00:36:19,993
There's no excuse for it.

783
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:21,528
But I forgot the pieces
at the shop.

784
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:24,231
- Oh.
- Oh, too bad.

785
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,227
Wayne, please step back.

786
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,403
Good job.

787
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,975
Anthony.

788
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,479
So, tell me about
your creation.

789
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:40,747
He's an army ant.

790
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,183
Based on the texture
that was in the picture,

791
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:45,585
I put a little bit of the
texture in the top of the head

792
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:46,786
and a little in the back.

793
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:48,301
It just doesn't look
like an ant to me

794
00:36:48,323 --> 00:36:50,423
for some reason.

795
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,359
Do you have the antennae made
out of something

796
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:54,761
other than those foam tubes?

797
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,730
I had intended to.

798
00:36:56,764 --> 00:37:00,734
But just to get something
up here, I did this.

799
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:01,801
There are so many things
about this

800
00:37:01,836 --> 00:37:03,370
that are really bizarre to me.

801
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:08,441
Having this sash knit-sweater
thing underneath plates.

802
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:13,046
And then this tacked-on
turtle shell thing on the back.

803
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:14,214
It's really bizarre.

804
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:15,315
I'm not happy with the paint.

805
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,516
I'm not happy
with the sculpture.

806
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,018
I'm not happy
with your overall design.

807
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:19,152
Nothing's working
on this one for me.

808
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:20,587
I agree.

809
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:22,856
You shouldn't have been
so good at the beginning,

810
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:24,992
'cause now we were waiting for
you to do something fantastic

811
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:26,793
- every single time.
- On the next one.

812
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,810
If there's a next one.

813
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,252
Anthony, please step back.

814
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:38,159
It's rough.

815
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:40,352
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

816
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,342
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

817
00:37:42,377 --> 00:37:45,145
while they make
their decisions.

818
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,151
All right, guys,
let's talk about the looks

819
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,419
you liked the most tonight.

820
00:37:52,453 --> 00:37:54,321
Why don't we start with Kris?

821
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,723
The sculpture on the chest
and the head is so beautiful.

822
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,158
The proportions are great.

823
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,027
When you don't have a ton
of reference around you,

824
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:02,462
to just come up
with all those shapes,

825
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,831
that says a lot
about his skill.

826
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,105
The paint job was very pretty.

827
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:08,035
And the colors
were really gorgeous.

828
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,236
Let's move on to Wayne.

829
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,439
Wayne's firefly
is absolutely amazing.

830
00:38:12,473 --> 00:38:14,408
The way the little tail
lights up

831
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:15,508
and that whole silhouette

832
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,177
with that big sweeping
back end.

833
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,878
He spent his time
in all the right places.

834
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,713
The head is
very well proportioned

835
00:38:20,748 --> 00:38:21,714
to the rest of the body.

836
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:24,451
The genius, dare I say,

837
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,219
of putting the antennae
on his cheekbones,

838
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:28,121
knowing that those
are going to be things

839
00:38:28,156 --> 00:38:30,690
that the actor's going to drive
and animate.

840
00:38:30,724 --> 00:38:32,859
Well, we do have a problem
'cause unfortunately,

841
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,727
he did not incorporate
that close up

842
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:36,930
and did not complete
the challenge.

843
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,732
Let's move on to
the bottom looks this week.

844
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,468
Let's start with Meagan.

845
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:44,504
She is trying to take
the notes into the account.

846
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:48,041
She's still not at the level
where she needs to be,

847
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,709
and which is why
she is in the bottom.

848
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:52,045
I don't know
that I can conjure an image

849
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,780
of any makeup where
the paint is done

850
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,315
quite that badly.

851
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,017
It looks psychedelic vomit.

852
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:59,419
Let's move on to Alam.

853
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:00,687
The pink, plastic wings

854
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:02,522
with a bunched-up thing
at the top.

855
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:05,092
If you're gonna do wings,
make sure you understand

856
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:07,327
- how they at least work.
- Right.

857
00:39:07,362 --> 00:39:08,996
And the punctuation
of her makeup

858
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,530
in terms of these bad choices

859
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:14,167
- was glitter flip-flops.
- Glitter flip-flops.

860
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:17,770
- Leaves, crystal-- what?
- What the heck?

861
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,739
And she can't even describe
what it is she's doing.

862
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:22,209
Let's move on to Anthony.

863
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:23,610
It's the worst that he's done.

864
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:27,680
The chest for what it was
should have been fabricated

865
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:29,883
because he got nothing out
of all the time

866
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,251
that he spent sculpting it.

867
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,487
I'm confused about his
decision-making on this one.

868
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,155
To throw in those antennae--

869
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:36,756
- Oh, dear God.
- Oh, yeah.

870
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,857
He could have glued on a sock

871
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,192
and it would have
had the same effect.

872
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,494
It was so disappointing.

873
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,996
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

874
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,731
- Yeah, I believe we have.
- Yep.

875
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,034
Let's bring them back out then.

876
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,975
Glenn, tell us about
the top looks.

877
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,545
Kris, you had some really
great shapes

878
00:39:58,579 --> 00:39:59,979
in your design.

879
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:01,848
And it was one of the few
that we thought looked great

880
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:03,883
close up and far away.

881
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,953
And, Wayne, really loved
the chest sculpture.

882
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,788
And you did some really
clever work

883
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:11,624
with the articulation
of the face.

884
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,927
So, who is the winner
of this challenge?

885
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:16,196
Actually, we have a situation

886
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,898
which has never before
occurred.

887
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:25,752
So, who is the winner
of this challenge?

888
00:40:25,786 --> 00:40:28,021
Actually, we have a situation

889
00:40:28,055 --> 00:40:29,656
which has never before
occurred.

890
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,258
Wayne, your makeup was amazing

891
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:33,826
and it would have been
our winner,

892
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:36,829
but you didn't include
your microscopic image.

893
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,765
So that means, Kris,
you are the winner

894
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,519
of this challenge.

895
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:45,504
You created
a great cohesive makeup.

896
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:47,106
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

897
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:49,441
Wayne really won
this competition,

898
00:40:49,476 --> 00:40:50,576
but he forgot one element.

899
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,111
It did fall in my lap.

900
00:40:52,146 --> 00:40:53,512
I'm cool with that.

901
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:56,149
- Kris, congratulations.
- Thank you.

902
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:57,684
You and Wayne can head back
to the makeup room.

903
00:40:57,718 --> 00:41:00,519
Thank you.

904
00:41:03,057 --> 00:41:05,158
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

905
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:06,625
are on the bottom this week,

906
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,063
and one of you
will be eliminated.

907
00:41:10,097 --> 00:41:11,513
Please step forward.

908
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:19,505
Meagan.

909
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:22,942
The textual divide
between the body and the wings

910
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:25,277
combined with a very bad
paint job

911
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:27,613
resulted in
an overall confused makeup.

912
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:30,817
Anthony, it was clear
that you struggled

913
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:31,984
with your concept.

914
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,786
And a few pieces
of the makeup felt

915
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:36,089
as though they were
sort of tacked on.

916
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:38,758
Alam, your makeup was littered

917
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:41,027
with very strange
design choices.

918
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:44,097
And you have to learn
how to make better decisions

919
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:45,732
regarding your time management.

920
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:47,700
So, who is going home tonight?

921
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:50,332
The person
going home tonight is...

922
00:41:53,473 --> 00:41:55,574
Alam.

923
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:56,909
Oh, my God.

924
00:41:56,944 --> 00:42:00,179
Not only did we not understand
some of your choices,

925
00:42:00,214 --> 00:42:01,380
but you didn't either.

926
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:03,850
And that's a huge problem.

927
00:42:03,884 --> 00:42:07,720
Alam, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

928
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:11,124
That means, Anthony, Meagan,
you are safe this week

929
00:42:11,158 --> 00:42:14,060
and can head back
to the makeup room.

930
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:23,870
Alam, you have a memorable
and very distinct vision.

931
00:42:23,904 --> 00:42:25,537
And that's a good thing.

932
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:27,339
- We'll miss you.
- Thank you.

933
00:42:27,374 --> 00:42:29,075
Alam, it has been great
having you here with us.

934
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:31,177
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

935
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:32,779
and pack up your kit.

936
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:33,980
Thank you, guys.

937
00:42:34,014 --> 00:42:35,514
- Good luck.
- Good-bye, Alam.

938
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:37,216
- Good luck.
- It's really sad.

939
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:39,752
But I made it through
six challenges.

940
00:42:39,787 --> 00:42:43,589
- It's crazy.
- Oh, my God.

941
00:42:43,623 --> 00:42:45,491
I've learned a lot.
I've changed a lot.

942
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:47,827
I'll open the wine.

943
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:50,362
I'm glad that I started
my career here.

944
00:42:50,397 --> 00:42:52,031
I'm gonna practice and practice

945
00:42:52,065 --> 00:42:54,967
and I'm never gonna give up.

946
00:42:55,002 --> 00:42:56,488
I love this.

947
