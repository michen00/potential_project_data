00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,982
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,233
Anthony swept the competition,

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:11,102
winning both the foundation
and spotlight challenges.

4
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:13,638
- Anthony.
- Thank you so much.

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:18,476
And Troy was
the first artist sent home.

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,447
Now 13 artists remain.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,715
Tonight, they'll take on
a legendary genre.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,651
- Welcome to Comic-Con.
- Wow!

9
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:28,286
The pressure rises
as they tackle

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,988
their first
individual challenge.

11
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:33,558
- This mask is pissing me off.
- Fuck.

12
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,026
Oh, my God, what did I make?

13
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:36,294
Fuck.

14
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:40,365
- I don't know what to do. I'm
going home. - Turn around, please.

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,566
- Oh, my God.
- Blowout.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,169
What's happened to you?

17
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:45,670
It was a huge waste of time.

18
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:49,040
- I really enjoyed this piece.
- That's quite genius.

19
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,575
In the end, only one will win

20
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,310
the opportunity
to be a guest lecturer

21
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,871
at Make Up For Ever's academies
in New York and Paris,

22
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:58,717
the all new 2013 Fiat 500

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,287
and $100,000.

24
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:06,157
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic?

25
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,859
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

27
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:52,137
- Morning.
- Eric.

28
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,471
Morning.

29
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:54,472
We're all standing around
the breakfast table,

30
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:55,473
chit-chatting.

31
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:57,442
Hey, guys, check it out.

32
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:59,744
I look over in the corner,
and there's--

33
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:00,978
it looks like a letter.

34
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:03,615
"Good morning, artists,
please grab a ticket

35
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:06,351
and come join me
in San Diego for Comic-Con."

36
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,355
No way!

37
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,523
Awesome!

38
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:15,426
Comic-Con is a circus
of comic book, fantasy,

39
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:18,196
science-fiction,
horror movie geeks, man.

40
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,365
- Oh, my God.
- It's all there.

41
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,461
We're going to Comic-Con.

42
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:35,746
I've dreamt of going
to Comic-Con every day

43
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,215
since the day I was born.

44
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,150
Right here.
Here we go.

45
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:41,252
Come on.

46
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:44,155
All of us love movies
and pop culture and comic books,

47
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,324
and to be able
to go to the biggest

48
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,427
celebration of that is awesome.

49
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,836
Welcome to San Diego
and one of the world's biggest

50
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,139
pop culture conventions,
Comic-Con.

51
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:05,042
It's here that superheroes
jump off the pages

52
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:07,011
and onto the silver screen.

53
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:08,613
That's why we're here today.

54
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,281
Your spotlight challenge

55
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:13,551
is to create
an original superhero.

56
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,387
Whoo!

57
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:18,356
I know it's not easy
these days to come up with

58
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,692
a completely new
and original character,

59
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:22,727
so that's why
these guys are here.

60
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:25,396
They are two of the biggest
names in comic books

61
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:29,934
and co-publishers of
world-famous DC Entertainment.

62
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:33,204
First, we have the man who
spearheaded best-selling titles

63
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,972
like <i>Blackest Night,</i>

64
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,575
<i>Green Lantern,</i>
<i>All-Star Superman,</i>

65
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,877
and <i>All-Star Batman.</i>

66
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,979
Please welcome Dan Didio.

67
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,416
Hey, guys.

68
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,884
And next to him
is a world-renowned

69
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:49,354
comic book artist
whose work includes

70
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:52,022
<i>Justice</i> league,
<i>All-Star Batman & Robin,</i>

71
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:55,326
<i>Batman Hush,</i> and
<i>Superman For Tomorrow.</i>

72
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,695
Please say hello to Jim Lee.

73
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,564
Hey, guys.

74
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,532
I just want to scream.

75
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,735
Jim Lee's one
of my artistic heroes.

76
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,337
I'm just trying
to hold it all in.

77
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,573
What advice do you have
for these guys today?

78
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:10,040
Well, if you look
at superheroes,

79
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,410
they really reflect the era
that they come from.

80
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:13,878
Also, think about the colors.

81
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:16,046
If you look at all your main,
powerful, iconic characters,

82
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,650
they tend to have primary colors
of the color palette, right?

83
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:20,752
Red, blue, and yellow.
So start thinking about that.

84
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,887
Also, you've got to look
at the character's silhouettes.

85
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,455
Look at the powers
of the characters

86
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,057
and how do those powers relate
to the way the character looks?

87
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:29,994
I'm nervous about this,
because comics are definitely

88
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,263
a genre that
I'm not familiar with.

89
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,332
Since we heard you're gonna
be creating new characters,

90
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:36,534
we decided to bring some
of DC's top artists to you

91
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,436
and give you a hand helping
come up with the sketches

92
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,505
and the designs
for these characters.

93
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:43,641
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

94
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:46,110
I can't wait to collaborate
with DC artists.

95
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:48,313
They definitely
will know their stuff

96
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:50,348
when it comes to superheroes.

97
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:52,583
Before you guys get started
on your sketches,

98
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:54,485
Jim and Dan have
a surprise for you

99
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,986
that they'd like to share.

100
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,988
We're very pleased to announce
that the winning character

101
00:04:58,023 --> 00:05:00,157
will appear in an upcoming
DC comic book.

102
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:03,728
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

103
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,829
That's so cool.

104
00:05:04,863 --> 00:05:07,799
My daughter loves superheroes,

105
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:12,236
so I would love to do this
really great superhero for her.

106
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,740
All right, everybody,
go ahead and get started.

107
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:20,177
I'm paired with Jim Lee,

108
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:22,146
and it's just
so incredibly exciting.

109
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,348
I feel like
this is all a dream.

110
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:24,582
My father is my hero,

111
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,083
and I think in--
in my character,

112
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,753
whatever I create,
I want it to reflect families.

113
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,522
My superhero is based off
of my father,

114
00:05:31,557 --> 00:05:34,659
a hardworking man
in a biochemical factory.

115
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:36,126
What about if he has some--
like, those tubes,

116
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,429
those oxygen tubes, like-- right?
Like, kind of come out

117
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,497
to the side kind of thing?

118
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:41,198
- That would be really neat.
- Okay.

119
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,368
She's gonna say,
"By the power of Ra..."

120
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:45,202
- Okay.
- "I'm Mercury Ray."

121
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:50,107
My concept is a flashback
character from the 1970s.

122
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,643
If you're thinking
of the belt extending down,

123
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:53,711
whether this--

124
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:55,079
- I want to go down
to, like, here.

125
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:57,114
Okay.

126
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:00,951
Punk rock?

127
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,253
- Absolutely.
- Cyborg woman.

128
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,588
- Yeah.
- Sexy.

129
00:06:03,622 --> 00:06:06,156
My concept is robot girl,
a kick-ass cyborg chick.

130
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:08,959
And she will kill you.
So watch out, bad guys.

131
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,227
I'm trying to think
of a character

132
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,162
who is trying
to kind of redeem himself.

133
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:13,498
Okay.

134
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:16,033
My first instinct is
to go with a lava character.

135
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,669
Texturally, do something
shiny here, like volcanic rock.

136
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,004
- Like, you know?
- Okay.

137
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:22,840
My thinking is,
stay away from a costume

138
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,343
and go with a suit that's
actually a living part of him.

139
00:06:26,378 --> 00:06:28,446
Maybe, like, the force
comes out of his hands.

140
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,481
Yeah.

141
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,718
I'm traditionally
a horror artist.

142
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:35,085
Yeah.

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,554
But the character
I'd like to do is a '40s,

144
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:38,188
<i>Dick Tracy</i> type look.

145
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:39,256
Okay, yeah.

146
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,892
What you want
to be thinking about is,

147
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,460
what is the context
of this character?

148
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:46,631
Are they in a vintage,
'40s metropolis kind of city?

149
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,533
Something like that.

150
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,867
The character I was thinking of

151
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:51,769
is somewhat of an antihero.

152
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:54,204
My concept is Elijah,
Bringer of Plagues.

153
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,407
He's one of the sons
of one of the Horsemen

154
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:57,542
of the Apocalypse.

155
00:06:57,576 --> 00:06:58,810
Oh, okay.

156
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:00,912
He controls
all the sickness, plagues.

157
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,480
That's what he
has dominion over.

158
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:05,483
I think I'm gonna keep it
where it's very, kind of, like,

159
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:06,884
pale and white.

160
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,218
But then I'm gonna come in
with these blue washes

161
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,420
in the darker areas,

162
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:10,788
and they'll really
bring the blue into it.

163
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:11,923
- Right.
- Yeah.

164
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:14,358
My superhero's name
is Solarion.

165
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:19,229
He protects Earth,
and he's very muscle-bound.

166
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:20,731
It's time to go to the lab.

167
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,100
I have Tony's sketch,
and that is Robot Girl.

168
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:25,903
And I can't wait
to bring her to life.

169
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:27,271
Thank you, guys.

170
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,340
You guys are all awesome,
by the way.

171
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:43,020
Side by side once again, girl.

172
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:46,123
It's day one of our challenge,
and I'm really excited.

173
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:48,893
Mine is called Freedom Fighter.

174
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,028
He is derived
from the Twin Towers.

175
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:53,998
And I'm gonna have two
of the Twin Towers here

176
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:55,432
and also on the leg piece,

177
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:58,035
and he protects New York City.

178
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,772
I want to really
stick to the drawing,

179
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:04,208
and I need to just
get this sculpt out.

180
00:08:04,242 --> 00:08:06,243
That's it.

181
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,114
My character is Revolt.

182
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,783
He's kind of just
a regular, punk-rock dude,

183
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:16,186
but he has the power to shoot
electricity out of his fingers.

184
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:19,924
And he's still
very much a person.

185
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:28,465
For my superhero,
I decided to go with

186
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,668
a time traveler
from another world.

187
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:32,770
He has mental powers.

188
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,373
I want bold colors, also a lot
of shading and highlighting.

189
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:43,748
My dude's a cop.
I'm giving him a little gut.

190
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,283
Everybody else is all ripped.

191
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:52,256
- It's looking like a cat.
- Yeah, it does look like a cat.

192
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,159
Maybe it's one
of the Thundercats.

193
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,761
Get away.

194
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:59,597
This is really nerve-wracking.

195
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:03,534
I look around, and I see
a lot of strong sculpts.

196
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,270
And everyone's moving so fast
that I'm cutting corners

197
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:07,838
trying to keep up with them.

198
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:09,373
That's messing me up
big-time,

199
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,809
'cause I keep
sculpting a cat robot.

200
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,244
God, what is wrong with me?

201
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,283
The sculpt is the worst
sculpt in the room.

202
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:22,687
I don't know
what to do at this point.

203
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,555
Oh, my God, what did I make?

204
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,224
This looks like shit.

205
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:28,793
Coming up...

206
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,861
I'm having a very hard time
putting these pieces together.

207
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:32,964
They're not fitting properly.

208
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:33,998
Fuck!

209
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:38,535
Ugh, this mask
is pissing me off.

210
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,071
That's quite genius.

211
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,007
It was a huge waste
of time for you this week.

212
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,335
It's day one,
and my sculpt looks really bad.

213
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:54,336
It looks terrible.

214
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,905
I can't stand it.

215
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:00,709
I keep sculpting a cat robot,
and I want a freedom fighter.

216
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:02,711
So I'm kind of getting
frustrated at this point.

217
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,990
I thinned out my superhero's
nose a little bit,

218
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:16,258
'cause a lot
of comic book characters

219
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,160
have a very thin nose.

220
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:20,129
I'm also strengthening up
his jaw.

221
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,164
Just making him look bigger,
because I know that

222
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,333
that has to all tie in
with the muscle suit.

223
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:27,369
Yeah, that's good.

224
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,943
What's your color scheme
gonna be?

225
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,614
My superhero
is made out of big,

226
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:41,317
sharp pieces of glass.

227
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:44,086
Glasses from the building
all, like, break down

228
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,823
and flying towards to him
and makes his costume.

229
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,661
Everyone's pieces
are already so epic.

230
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,830
I'm just making a face.

231
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:57,900
I was not expecting
a individual challenge

232
00:10:57,934 --> 00:11:00,169
so early on in the competition.

233
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:03,172
I just hope I stack up
with everyone else.

234
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:08,277
My concept is gonna be
an underwater female superhero.

235
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,146
She's going to have
the whole nine yards, like,

236
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:14,917
gills and huge octopus tentacles
coming out of her head

237
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:18,820
and scales all over her body.

238
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,594
I'm still trying
to figure out my sculpt,

239
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:26,595
but it's not working.

240
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:28,163
Just try to finish it today.

241
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:29,731
No, I'm getting this done.

242
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,166
I'm asking everyone's opinion.

243
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,135
I'd say just try evening out...

244
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,870
- The corners.
- ...the points.

245
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:39,141
I want to cry right now,
but I can't let this defeat me.

246
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,480
I spent a little more time
sculpting this chest piece

247
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:47,016
than I had planned to.

248
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,319
I'm really trying to stylize
the muscle patterns

249
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:52,521
of the torso and the chest.

250
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:56,392
For me, it is the most important
piece for this character.

251
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:59,795
Anthony's sculpting
a chest and back piece.

252
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:02,597
The mold's probably
gonna weigh 200 pounds.

253
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:05,600
It's kind of crazy.

254
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,571
My character's gonna
be wearing a mask

255
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,506
that's supposed to resemble
an old plague doctor,

256
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,409
where they have the long nose.

257
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:15,210
That's where they used
to stick the incense in,

258
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,812
so they wouldn't smell
any of the death

259
00:12:16,846 --> 00:12:18,283
or anything that stunk.

260
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,170
The incense would
block all of that.

261
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:22,878
Still looking good.

262
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,422
What do you think
about the mask underneath?

263
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:27,990
I've come up
with this character

264
00:12:28,024 --> 00:12:29,391
and her name is Silversight.

265
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:33,929
She is an animal
conservationist/biologist.

266
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:35,931
I want her to be beautiful
and strong,

267
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:37,499
kind of like
Wonder Woman with wings.

268
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:40,069
I think that's gonna be cool.

269
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:41,303
It'll be, like--
like, a lot of dimension.

270
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:42,571
- Yeah, yeah.
- A lot of layers.

271
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:46,008
That's my hope.

272
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,680
I'll finish this up,
and I'll be getting ready

273
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:53,182
to mold both of these things.

274
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:55,351
After the sculpture's finished,
you need to make a mold of it.

275
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:57,052
You make a mold out
of a stone-like substance;

276
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,820
you de-mold it,
clean the clay out;

277
00:12:58,855 --> 00:13:02,091
and then you fill it
with gelatin, silicone, foam;

278
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,525
and then you push
the two pieces back together

279
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,695
and you get a nice appliance.

280
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:14,236
There we go.
It was missing a jaw.

281
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,504
Oh, yeah?

282
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:16,805
Yeah, I've been
staring at this like,

283
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,207
"what's wrong with it?"
It's the jaw.

284
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:22,478
There's a lot more to be done,
but now I'm okay.

285
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:25,914
I like the way it looks now.

286
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:34,023
As the day goes on, I started
getting worried about time.

287
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:35,624
I don't have my mask done.

288
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:37,059
And I don't want
to be in the bottom looks,

289
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:38,660
just 'cause
I was there last week.

290
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:42,731
And having two back-to-back
bottom looks is not great.

291
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,734
Time!

292
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:47,469
That's time.

293
00:13:47,504 --> 00:13:48,670
At the end of the day,

294
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,439
I feel like
I'm in a pretty good place.

295
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:53,608
I'm a little nervous that mine
is really super simple

296
00:13:53,643 --> 00:13:55,577
compared to some
other people's.

297
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:59,214
I'm just hoping that the rest
of the costume pieces

298
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:03,018
come together
and everything works out.

299
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,364
Oh, thank you.

300
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:17,332
It's day two
in the superhero challenge.

301
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,301
Today, I have to get done
the armor and the helmet,

302
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:24,039
which I know is gonna take up
a huge chunk of the day.

303
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:27,876
Oh, that's cleaning out
really nice.

304
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:35,384
I'm trying to think
outside the box on this one,

305
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:39,488
so what I want to do
is expose the human anatomy

306
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,558
using clear domes,
as well as have the lungs

307
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:43,725
actually function.

308
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,129
- Pretty cool?
- Yeah, it looks good.

309
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:53,802
Today, my primary thing
is making my wings.

310
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:58,540
So I need rods, poles, wire
to build the actual shape.

311
00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:01,910
And I need feathers
for this as well.

312
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,848
Nice, dude.

313
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,885
Alam's making these
big glass shards,

314
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,687
and it looks scary.

315
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:13,855
Those staying on?

316
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:15,890
If it doesn't,
I'm gonna kill myself.

317
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,159
I'm worried.

318
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:20,262
I have to make all these
spiky things on the back.

319
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:24,032
It's really hard, because
I don't know the materials well.

320
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,706
Oh, you fucker.

321
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:33,242
I don't know
how you did all this.

322
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:34,376
I really don't.

323
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,478
It's not done yet, man.

324
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:47,422
I'm still working on my mask

325
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:50,526
and I'm not happy
with it at all.

326
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,395
Every cut, every fold I make
just creates a new problem.

327
00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:55,564
It's frustrating,
'cause I'm wasting so much time

328
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,665
that I can't afford.

329
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,967
Ugh, this mask
is pissing me off.

330
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,269
It's just not looking right.

331
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:03,605
It's still just looking
like a block.

332
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,608
I'm not confident that it's
gonna pull everything together

333
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:08,043
like I want it.

334
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:11,313
I'm not feeling it anymore.

335
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,744
I start working on
my silicon make up.

336
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,975
The silicon I'm working with
kicks off a little faster.

337
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:21,326
That's not gonna work.

338
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:23,348
It's a complete failure.
It's too thick.

339
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:26,562
I start scrapping
silicon off like a mad man.

340
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,285
A possible elimination...

341
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,104
I ran over, uh, just trying
to help anyway that I can.

342
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,099
God, please!

343
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,068
I'm worried.

344
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,244
This is what I get for
trying to go creative.

345
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,187
Finally, I decide to
go with foam latex

346
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,994
and it turned out beautiful.

347
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,753
Awesome!

348
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,882
We're getting towards
the end of the day,

349
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,050
and I know I still need a mask.

350
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,852
This mask is pissing me off.

351
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,189
I'm looking around in the lab
when I see a spandex cowl.

352
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,724
This is gonna be the best bet.

353
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,093
I've worked with stuff like this
where you make sock masks.

354
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,329
I'm going back to my
old haunted house roots.

355
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:04,798
I feel that this is the
direction I want to go.

356
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,133
And I'm going to cut foam eyes,
put some of the detail,

357
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:09,736
and then make a nose.

358
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:14,308
How much time we got left?

359
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,776
Right now, I'm running
very behind.

360
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,011
I have to mold
the chest and back pieces.

361
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:22,382
There is that thought in my mind
that I am going too big.

362
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:29,356
My character has a mask
that he wears

363
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,124
when he becomes Revolt.

364
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:33,059
And it's supposed to look
a little homemade

365
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,594
because I want
everything to look

366
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:38,298
as if my character made it.

367
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,802
I want top looks
for every character.

368
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:44,504
This one particular,
she's very dear to my heart.

369
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,773
I think she has
a different style to her.

370
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:49,376
Instead of the traditional
comic book hero,

371
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,213
mine is leaning more
towards Japanese anime.

372
00:17:57,318 --> 00:17:59,219
The mask finally
starts to come together,

373
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:01,955
and now it's starting to
resemble an old plague doctor.

374
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:03,357
I'm actually liking
the direction

375
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,326
it's starting to take.

376
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:17,103
Time's up, everybody.
Put your stuff down.

377
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,507
There's not enough time
to finish the chest.

378
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,308
So tomorrow,
I have to open my mold,

379
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:25,979
clean out all the clay,
get a casting of my torso piece,

380
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:28,314
apply all these pieces,
paint all these pieces,

381
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:31,818
and have a finished piece
for the judges.

382
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:42,829
It's showtime.

383
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,665
It's application day,
and I only have four hours,

384
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,667
and I'm getting a little bit
nervous just because

385
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:51,170
there is a ton of stuff
that I still have to do.

386
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:54,374
I still have to finish my
tentacles and my chest pieces.

387
00:18:56,811 --> 00:18:59,012
The first thing I have
to do is open my mold,

388
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:01,648
get it cleaned out,
and fill that with foam.

389
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:08,789
Since I got a little bit
of extra time today,

390
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:11,057
I really want
to focus on a prop.

391
00:19:11,091 --> 00:19:13,159
So I decide to make
this bizarre-looking

392
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,295
blaster gun for my character,

393
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:18,632
and it's coming out sweet.

394
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:22,869
You can make
yourself comfortable.

395
00:19:22,904 --> 00:19:25,806
You're gonna be
a time traveler superhero.

396
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,541
That's her, like,
whole costume look.

397
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:29,876
My model, Jenny,
has a beautiful head of hair,

398
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,078
and getting that all
tucked in to the appliance

399
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:33,914
is really my biggest challenge.

400
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:38,051
It'll be kind of like a--
more of an anime flop mohawk.

401
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,956
I have so much to do.
I have to get the face on.

402
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,158
I've got to get the helmet on,
the chest piece on.

403
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:49,262
And I'm pre-painting
everything.

404
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:52,265
All right, sir.

405
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,700
You can go ahead
and modify this,

406
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,769
and I'll doctor it up
real quick.

407
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,437
I feel like I'm in
a pretty good place.

408
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:58,805
All my pieces are done.

409
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,306
I just have to apply them.

410
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:03,944
Some people
are still running pieces.

411
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:06,780
The application
is really tight.

412
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:08,381
I have to make
the most important element

413
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,417
of my character, which
is the chest and back piece,

414
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:13,520
but I'm having a very hard time
putting these pieces together.

415
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:16,089
They're not fitting properly.

416
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:18,358
The core is sticking out
slightly.

417
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:20,093
I'm, like, pounding
this thing to get it down,

418
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:22,395
but it's not going down.

419
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,798
Hopefully, I'll be okay.

420
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:32,338
I'm just gonna glue
these on the side.

421
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:34,508
- Are you gonna paint me here?
- Yeah.

422
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:37,276
I'm thrilled about how
everything's coming together.

423
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,647
It looks beautiful.
She looks like a phoenix.

424
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,181
And I'm feeling pretty good.

425
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:44,951
We're not going home.

426
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:53,927
Turn.

427
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,029
Everything fits him,
even the shoulder piece.

428
00:20:56,063 --> 00:21:00,033
I actually rigged
lights through it.

429
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:09,409
I'm struggling with
the back piece right now.

430
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:11,077
No.

431
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:14,714
It doesn't want to stay on.

432
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:18,652
Maybe I'm using,
like, wrong glue.

433
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,925
It's not strong enough.

434
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,593
Oh.

435
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:30,096
I think the back piece
might be too heavy.

436
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,699
Kind of worrying.

437
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,103
I'll be right back.

438
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:41,908
I run to go check on the mold
and pry it open.

439
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:43,910
I'm having a hard time
because of the suction

440
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:47,681
that's inside that mold.

441
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:49,816
Fuck!

442
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,250
I end up smashing
one of my fingers.

443
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:53,553
Fuck!

444
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:57,657
I'm not able to open
this mold by myself,

445
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,325
and everybody's so engrossed.

446
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,963
I don't want to take them away
with what they have to do.

447
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:04,397
Fuck it.

448
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:05,732
I'm not gonna have a chest
piece for this character,

449
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,200
and it's time to go
with plan B.

450
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:09,970
One hour, guys!

451
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:18,177
I do not feel good
about this situation,

452
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,214
'cause the whole concept
of calling him the core

453
00:22:21,248 --> 00:22:23,249
really relies on his chest.

454
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:26,385
And now I have to have this
character standing up there

455
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,822
with an incomplete makeup.

456
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:31,190
Time!

457
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:36,963
Coming up.

458
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:39,499
I'm freaking out now.

459
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:42,068
I just don't know
what to say about this.

460
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:43,603
And I really dug that.

461
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:46,873
It is just not good enough.

462
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,205
Last looks.
We have one hour.

463
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,274
The only thing remaining now
is just finishing

464
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,243
her face makeup.

465
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,912
Oh, dang it.

466
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:03,581
My superhero came
into the makeup room

467
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,350
with the back piece
on his hand.

468
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,119
I don't know what to do.

469
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,687
It's supposed
to stick on his back.

470
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:14,259
I'm freaking out now.

471
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,027
We're gonna do tape again.
I'm sorry.

472
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,096
The velcro came off
the arm pieces,

473
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,031
so I have to duct tape it.

474
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,568
I had a little trouble
around the sides,

475
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,937
but I believe
I've left myself enough time

476
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,839
to get everything complete.

477
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,074
15 minutes, everybody.

478
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,406
I'm dying about
that chest piece, man!

479
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,379
When you walk, not try to move.

480
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,520
Time!

481
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,404
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

482
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,874
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

483
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,043
Say hello to your judges.

484
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:08,379
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effect Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

485
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,081
- Good evening.
- Hi, Glenn.

486
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,750
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

487
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,719
- Good evening, everybody.
- Good evening.

488
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,020
Hi.

489
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,822
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

490
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,858
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

491
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,826
This week, your spotlight
challenge was to create

492
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,794
an original superhero.

493
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,497
And we have a big prize
on the line.

494
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,566
The winner's character
will be featured

495
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,170
in an upcoming DC comic.

496
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,106
First up
is Michael's superhero.

497
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,095
Just seeing it up there,
it's my baby.

498
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:00,598
That's my boy.
I'm really proud.

499
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,721
I'm a little worried.

500
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,223
I know this is
a makeup competition,

501
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:26,791
but this being
a superhero challenge,

502
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,092
I probably should have spent

503
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:31,095
a little more time
on the costume.

504
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,580
I'm pretty scared
at this moment,

505
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,416
just because it's, once again,

506
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:54,852
not a finished paint job.

507
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,939
I'm extremely nervous
and just wishing that

508
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:18,509
the judges could have seen it
complete with the chest piece.

509
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,097
I feel awful.
It's a disaster.

510
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:42,166
I feel like I'm definitely
in bottom looks.

511
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,722
She's sexy.
A little bit gory.

512
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,758
I think it's impressive.

513
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,239
Totally looks like a superhero.

514
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,741
Her panties are on the outside.
She got a cape.

515
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,010
Man, she's looking
like something DC

516
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,180
could really use right now.

517
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,229
I love the superhero image
that I made.

518
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,365
No one knows
it's not completed,

519
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,768
because they're not
seeing my mistakes.

520
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,715
I just love how the lights
are hitting her.

521
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,284
And it's really shining

522
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,152
and throwing
this wet look over her.

523
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,073
She looks powerful and awesome.

524
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,309
And her colors
are just so amazing.

525
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,911
I think she looks great.

526
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:55,366
I know that he's not really
Glenn's kind of style.

527
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,636
I just hope that they like him.

528
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,786
I'm feeling pretty good,

529
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,989
and it's a character that
I would love to see

530
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:22,760
walking around on the pages
of DC comics.

531
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,582
He comes out in full character,

532
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,618
and I'm loving it.

533
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:54,325
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look.

534
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,099
Does this come off?
Or can you push it up?

535
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,767
I'm a little worried
when they lifted up the mask

536
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,069
'cause he's sweating
under there,

537
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,704
so I know that paint
is starting to run on his face.

538
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,339
The one thing
I was wondering about,

539
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,908
the squareness of this
and the fact that it was

540
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,276
in front of a Mayan temple.

541
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,979
More bird God,
less plague doctor.

542
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,251
Can you lean down
so we can see the very top?

543
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,920
I wonder why that's green
and yellow up there.

544
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,956
It's a cool idea to go with
this snake-head-y thing

545
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,694
on top of the lava
and the cracks in the paint job.

546
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:33,397
Good God almighty.
Can you just lift your chin up?

547
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,300
Dude, just walk away from him.

548
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,469
There's something sort of cool
about all of these steps

549
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,271
in this neck piece
and the lighting.

550
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,472
Other than that,
I just don't know

551
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,442
what else to say about this.

552
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:47,712
As sloppy as everything is,

553
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,715
it feels most superhero
of them all.

554
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,491
Can you turn around for us?

555
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,527
Please don't make him
turn around.

556
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,265
- Oh, my God.
- Blowout.

557
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,169
There was a big,
giant hole on his back

558
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,005
and there's big,
giant hole in my heart.

559
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,040
I'm going home.

560
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:21,517
What do you think
of tonight's designs?

561
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:24,194
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff

562
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:29,673
Uh-oh.

563
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:30,808
- Oh, my God.
- Blowout.

564
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:32,142
What's happened to you?

565
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:35,045
There was a big,
giant hole on his back.

566
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,847
I'm going home.

567
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:43,788
Okay.

568
00:31:43,822 --> 00:31:45,756
This is cool.

569
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,392
Yeah. Yeah.

570
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:55,766
The judges have scored
your creations.

571
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:57,067
Let's find out
what they thought.

572
00:31:57,101 --> 00:32:01,906
Katie, House, Eric F,

573
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:07,445
Meagan, Anthony, Michael.

574
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:11,549
You were the best
and the worst this week.

575
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,116
That means
the rest of you are safe

576
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:17,354
and can head back
to the makeup room.

577
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:19,790
All right, the judges would like
to speak with each of you

578
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:21,224
to learn more about your work.

579
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:24,562
House, you're up first.

580
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:30,267
Please begin by telling us
the backstory of the character.

581
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:31,401
This is Robot Girl.

582
00:32:31,436 --> 00:32:33,236
She was a pro fighter
in the future.

583
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:35,539
And she left the lab
to strike revenge

584
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:36,974
on those who wronged her.

585
00:32:37,008 --> 00:32:40,478
I think this is extremely
unconventional.

586
00:32:40,512 --> 00:32:44,448
And it's risky to do that,
and I think you succeeded.

587
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:47,150
I actually liked it
a lot better close up

588
00:32:47,185 --> 00:32:49,920
than I did from far away,
because I realized that

589
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:51,455
it wasn't really bloody.

590
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,358
It's just the under-skin
of what we see.

591
00:32:54,392 --> 00:32:55,526
What I'm seeing
is something that's

592
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,895
more horror than superhero.

593
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:00,998
To me, it reads
a little more science-fiction,

594
00:33:01,032 --> 00:33:02,733
Japanese hero,

595
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,636
and this really speaks to me.

596
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,573
House, thank you very much.
If you'll please step back.

597
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:14,578
Meagan, you're up.

598
00:33:14,613 --> 00:33:17,515
Okay, Meagan, what's your
backstory on your superhero?

599
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:20,918
I basically wanted
to make him out of the metal

600
00:33:20,952 --> 00:33:22,586
from the Twin Towers.

601
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:24,722
Is that what these pieces
on his arms are?

602
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:28,258
Yeah, it was glued down,
but it fell off, so...

603
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:31,529
They look like TV controls
with gaffer's tape around them.

604
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:32,897
Okay.

605
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,365
I'm really concerned
about your sculpting efforts

606
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,767
on this face piece

607
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:40,303
because it's really
terribly, terribly rough.

608
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:43,340
You could've sculpted planes
and hard angles and stuff

609
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:44,842
and put rivets in it.

610
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:47,077
That said,
the neck thing is cool.

611
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:51,015
- I see what you were going for,
it just didn't work out. - Okay.

612
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:55,019
Meagan, thank you very much.
Please step back.

613
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:57,387
Eric F.

614
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:02,159
Explain the concept
behind this.

615
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:04,127
Detective Dick Gritty
was left for dead

616
00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:05,495
by the evil crime syndicate.

617
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,231
His body was brought back
from the brink of death

618
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:11,602
to seek vengeance on the people
that did him wrong.

619
00:34:11,636 --> 00:34:13,804
It's such
an entertaining piece.

620
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,407
And how tight it is underneath
that acrylic chest plate,

621
00:34:17,442 --> 00:34:20,410
in terms of your
anatomical prowess.

622
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:22,980
I'm really, really
pleased about that.

623
00:34:23,014 --> 00:34:26,249
When he walked out,
I immediately felt like

624
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:29,887
I was in a 1940s movie.

625
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:31,589
And I really dug that.

626
00:34:31,623 --> 00:34:34,892
- Thank you guys so much.
- Eric, please step back.

627
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:39,329
Michael.

628
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,168
Tell us about the backstory
of your character, if you would.

629
00:34:45,203 --> 00:34:47,071
His name's Elijah,
Bringer Of Plagues.

630
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:48,906
He sucks in any type of plague,

631
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,440
and he would spew it
out of his mouth,

632
00:34:50,475 --> 00:34:52,910
inject it back into a villain,
destroying him that way.

633
00:34:52,944 --> 00:34:56,446
Am I to assume that
the shape of the mask

634
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,916
is based on a traditional
plague doctor?

635
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,317
Yes.

636
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,285
Unfortunately, I don't think
you were very successful

637
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,923
in achieving that look
with that mask.

638
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:07,725
This was the third version
of the mask,

639
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:09,526
and it wasn't
the best of ideas.

640
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,194
It's a simple shape,
and you could have

641
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:13,130
made it so cool.

642
00:35:13,164 --> 00:35:14,297
When I look at this, I wonder,

643
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:16,233
"what the hell
did he do the whole time?"

644
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,535
There is nothing there
but a costume and some rags

645
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:20,738
and a goofy little mask
with a snout on it.

646
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:24,742
I think it was a huge waste
of time for you this week.

647
00:35:24,776 --> 00:35:28,145
Michael, please step back.

648
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:30,814
Anthony.

649
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,218
Tell us about your guy,

650
00:35:35,253 --> 00:35:36,820
and I want to hear
his backstory.

651
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:38,388
He's from the Earth's core,

652
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:40,724
and he eliminates all the people
who are destroying the planet.

653
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,093
He initially
had a full chest piece

654
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:44,962
- and a back piece.
- Uh-huh.

655
00:35:44,996 --> 00:35:46,463
But I was having a hard time
getting it out of the mold

656
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:49,366
and decided to abandon it
and go to plan B.

657
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,902
We've had several
characters with this theme,

658
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,738
this cracking
lava-type theme.

659
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:57,808
Yours is the first one
that's been successful.

660
00:35:57,842 --> 00:35:59,209
I really like this guy.

661
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:02,445
He actually, for me, is like
a full-blown-looking superhero.

662
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,217
I think you turned lemons
to lemonade with the problem

663
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:09,519
that happened with your
front piece and back piece

664
00:36:09,554 --> 00:36:13,824
and ironically created
a strong silhouette.

665
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:16,827
The sculpture on the head
is quite amazing

666
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:21,131
because it's partially
a makeup, partially a cowl.

667
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,700
That's quite genius.

668
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:26,303
I absolutely adore the way
the colors come up the arms,

669
00:36:26,337 --> 00:36:29,039
and then you follow this
exact same scheme on the face.

670
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,775
That puts it all together.
Well done.

671
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,077
Thanks so much.

672
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:36,780
Anthony, thank you very much.
Please step back.

673
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:38,816
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

674
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,784
Katie.

675
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:48,491
Katie, explain the concept
of Revolt.

676
00:36:48,526 --> 00:36:51,228
I wanted to create
a vigilante, homemade hero.

677
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:52,662
Punk-rock superman.

678
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:53,731
Would you mind
taking the mask off

679
00:36:53,765 --> 00:36:57,500
so we can see
the sculpt underneath?

680
00:36:57,535 --> 00:37:01,338
I fear that you're not

681
00:37:01,372 --> 00:37:06,176
as well-versed at anatomy
as you need to be.

682
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:09,012
There are some very arbitrary
shapes that are happening.

683
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:11,815
They don't make him look
more heroic or more menacing.

684
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,052
They make him
look more deformed.

685
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:19,656
That juggalo tiki mask
that he's got to cover his face

686
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,925
looks like it belongs
at a Halloween frat party.

687
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,929
It is just not good enough.

688
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:28,999
Katie, please step back.

689
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:33,036
All right, the judges have
heard what you have to say.

690
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:34,371
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

691
00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:37,207
while they make
their decisions.

692
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:42,146
So why don't we start
with the looks

693
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,181
that you liked the most.

694
00:37:44,215 --> 00:37:45,348
How about we start
with Anthony.

695
00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:47,417
The gradation of the paint
really saved it.

696
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:48,485
Yeah, excellent.

697
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,887
I love the way
the black just--

698
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,955
it looks like
the perfect cowl mask.

699
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,258
But it's all integrated
into the makeup.

700
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:57,795
That center split
with the color going down

701
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:58,996
was another graphic piece

702
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,430
that just made it
a bit more unique.

703
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:02,666
Let's move on to House.
What are your thoughts?

704
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,335
He did all of these
super-cool metallic tones,

705
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:08,705
and it took it away from
the blood and gore and viscera

706
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:10,974
and more into
the cybernetic human.

707
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:13,510
All that golden metallic
gave it a really beautiful,

708
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:16,379
cohesive, exposed
muscle tissue look,

709
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:18,182
and it was kind of cool.

710
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:20,317
Let's move on to Eric.

711
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:23,921
It's a big success to me,
mainly because it compels

712
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:26,290
the audience to say,

713
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:28,225
"what the hell
happened to this guy?"

714
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:29,559
Yeah.

715
00:38:29,593 --> 00:38:31,161
And that is probably
the single most important thing

716
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:32,996
in designing a superhero.

717
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:34,531
And the fact that
he was smart enough

718
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,034
to have him come out
with the scarf and the hat

719
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,802
- and do that whole '40s thing.
- Excellent.

720
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:40,570
Okay, let's move on
to the looks

721
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:42,339
you did not like so much.

722
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:43,841
Michael.

723
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,575
I didn't agree with the fact
that he's a superhero.

724
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:48,678
It is unacceptable to present
a fabricated mask

725
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:50,814
as the main piece
of your character.

726
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:52,415
It isn't even a full makeup.

727
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,917
Nothing about it succeeds.

728
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,352
All right,
let's move on to Meagan.

729
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:57,721
I am so disappointed in that.

730
00:38:57,755 --> 00:38:59,289
When you see
sculpting like that,

731
00:38:59,324 --> 00:39:03,727
I have grave concern for what
we can expect to see out of her

732
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,062
in the coming weeks.

733
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:06,296
The tape--

734
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:07,898
she actually
presented something with--

735
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:10,033
- Duct taped arms.
- And it wasn't thematic.

736
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:12,402
All right, Katie.
What are your thoughts there?

737
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,304
- The outer mask was wretched.
- It's frightening.

738
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,006
I can't believe
she sculpted that.

739
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,976
She needs to learn how
to appropriate her time

740
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,479
into things that are going
to make sense and be seen.

741
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:24,814
Judges, have you made
your decisions?

742
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:26,984
- Yes, we have.
- Yeah, we have.

743
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:29,052
Let's bring them
back out tut then.

744
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:38,996
All right, Glenn,

745
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,331
why don't you tell us
about the top looks tonight.

746
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:45,835
Anthony. Some really nice,
classic superhero elements

747
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,137
to your character.

748
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:49,306
And you did a really splendid,
graduated paint job

749
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,341
on the makeup itself.

750
00:39:51,376 --> 00:39:52,475
House.

751
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,444
We thought that your infusion

752
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,413
of the Japanese aesthetic
into the makeup

753
00:39:56,447 --> 00:39:58,315
was incredibly successful.

754
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:00,217
And Eric.

755
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:01,919
You really went for it
this week,

756
00:40:01,953 --> 00:40:06,223
and it paid off in what was
a very, very complete character.

757
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:07,991
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner

758
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:10,794
of this challenge
and the DC comics prize?

759
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:14,464
Tonight's winner is...

760
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,965
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner

761
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,102
of this challenge
and the DC comics prize?

762
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:27,539
Tonight's winner is...

763
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:30,708
Anthony.

764
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:33,378
Oh, my God.

765
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:34,879
You did a lot of things
right tonight,

766
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:36,714
but we were particularly
impressed with the sculpture

767
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:38,150
of your character's head.

768
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:39,484
Very, very strong work.

769
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:41,786
Thank you, guys.
It really means so much.

770
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,788
Anthony, congratulations.

771
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:46,824
Your superhero will be featured
in a DC comic.

772
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:48,026
Awesome.

773
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,761
To be in a DC comic
with a character

774
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:52,430
that I designed myself
is just surreal.

775
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:54,132
I can't wait to see it.

776
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:55,333
Thank you very much.

777
00:40:55,368 --> 00:40:56,535
You can head back
to the makeup room.

778
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:58,270
Thanks, guys.

779
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:01,939
House and Eric,
you are also safe.

780
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:03,675
Please head back
to the makeup room.

781
00:41:03,709 --> 00:41:05,477
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

782
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:07,845
Good job.

783
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,148
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

784
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:11,583
are on the bottom this week.

785
00:41:11,617 --> 00:41:15,053
One of you will be eliminated.

786
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:18,256
Please step to the center.

787
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:23,928
This is scary.

788
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:26,764
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

789
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:30,702
Michael, you really
squandered your time,

790
00:41:30,736 --> 00:41:32,237
and as a result,
we didn't really

791
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:34,706
see your concept
in the final piece.

792
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,243
Meagan, your facial sculpt
did not seem like

793
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:40,978
it belonged with the rest
of your character.

794
00:41:41,013 --> 00:41:43,114
Katie, you spent a lot of time

795
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:45,783
working on things that
just made your character

796
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:47,619
look haphazard.

797
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:49,221
So who's going home tonight?

798
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:52,190
The person going home
tonight is...

799
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:58,096
Michael.

800
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:03,435
You made so many
bad decisions tonight,

801
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:04,902
and ultimately,

802
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:08,440
you just didn't give us
any makeup to look at.

803
00:42:08,474 --> 00:42:10,742
Michael, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

804
00:42:10,776 --> 00:42:12,043
The rest of you are safe

805
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:14,412
and can head back
to the makeup room.

806
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:19,951
You're obviously
full of creativity.

807
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:23,388
I, for one, would love to see
what else you come up with.

808
00:42:23,422 --> 00:42:26,124
Michael, it has been great
having you here with us.

809
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:28,025
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

810
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,428
and pack up your kit.

811
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:33,331
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

812
00:42:37,136 --> 00:42:39,237
I bid you all
a farewell, adieu.

813
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:41,439
- No.
- Oh, oh, no!

814
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,174
This experience
is a milestone in my career.

815
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,744
I feel more confident
in what my abilities are.

816
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:47,245
Aw!

817
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,881
I'm very optimistic.

818
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,650
There's so manings to do now.

819
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:54,586
I get to go home,
practice, and hone skills.

820
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,215
My future's not written.
