2
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:09,502
Kris's terrifying werewolf
brought him to victory.

3
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:10,636
- Wow.
- Whoa.

4
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:11,771
I'm in shock.

5
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:14,002
And Autumn was sent home.

6
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:18,778
Now seven artists remain.

7
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:20,246
They'll face
a harrowing challenge

8
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,281
with a terrifying twist.

9
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:22,782
- Oh!
- Aah!

10
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,084
This is gonna be awesome.

11
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:25,118
And I've also left
a little surprise for you

12
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:27,487
back at the lab.

13
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:29,655
That will push them
to the limit.

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,024
Whoa!

15
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:32,459
It's something that
we have never seen before.

16
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:33,960
You can't be in the bottom
this week.

17
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:36,229
I'm very, very worried that
I may be going home on this one.

18
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:38,131
Fuck.

19
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:39,899
The hands are atrocious.

20
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,202
Some sculptural flourishes
which are quite impressive.

21
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:45,105
You have got to
do better than this.

22
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:46,339
I don't want
to go home.

23
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,074
In the end,
only one will win

24
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,842
the opportunity
to be a guest lecturer

25
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:53,446
at Make Up For Ever's academies
in New York and Paris,

26
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:57,950
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,
and $100,000.

27
00:00:59,786 --> 00:01:02,852
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic?

28
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,966

00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:50,836
Last night was the most
stressful night of my life.

31
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:52,105
Dude, I can imagine.

32
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:54,640
In the last challenge
I had to stand up for myself

33
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:56,842
because Autumn tried
to throw me under the bus.

34
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:57,944
She's a good artist,

35
00:01:57,978 --> 00:02:00,680
but she just needs
to change her attitude.

36
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:02,415
It meant the world that
I knew you guys, you know,

37
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,683
were behind me
on that one.

38
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:04,951
100%.

39
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,852
Guys, listen.

40
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:08,020
No negativity.

41
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,790
If I can survive
two team challenges with Autumn,

42
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:13,159
then I can survive
just about anything.

43
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:16,529
- Time to go, guys.
- Let's do it. Yeah.

44
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,210
We walk down this path
towards the beach

45
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:32,479
and we're at the ocean.

46
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:34,514
It is such a gorgeous scene.

47
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:37,484
The waves hitting the rocks,
ocean breeze,

48
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:41,521
and there's McKenzie.

49
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:43,789
Welcome to Leo Carillo
State Park.

50
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:46,859
This beautiful coastline
and amazing sea caves

51
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:48,328
have served as
a filming location

52
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:51,831
for movies like <i>Inception,</i>
<i>The Usual Suspects,</i>

53
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:54,100
and <i>Journey To</i>
<i>The Center Of The Earth.</i>

54
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:55,568
Our planet
is a vast place

55
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,637
and much of it
remains a mystery.

56
00:02:57,671 --> 00:02:59,539
Each year,
new plants and animals

57
00:02:59,573 --> 00:03:02,342
are being identified
that seem out of this world.

58
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:05,678
Our undiscovered species
are the basis

59
00:03:05,712 --> 00:03:07,680
for this week's
spotlight challenge.

60
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:10,183
To create a new species
that might live

61
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,484
in any of Earth's ecosystems.

62
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,153
- Yeah.
- Yes.

63
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:14,420
Awesome.

64
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,821
We're making
an undiscovered species

65
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:17,923
that could be from the water,
from the mountains,

66
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,325
from the caves,

67
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,660
something that
we've never seen before.

68
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:22,262
So I'm immediately very excited.

69
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,397
Oh, but wait,
there's more.

70
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,233
In films like
<i>Avatar</i> and <i>The Abyss,</i>

71
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:30,102
Hollywood harnessed one
of nature's biggest secrets.

72
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:33,306
Bioluminescence,
the ability to emit light.

73
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:34,940
Okay

74
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,876
Biolumi-- whatever,
I don't even know what that is.

75
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,414
Your final makeup
must contain two unique looks.

76
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:44,384
One under normal light and
a second that becomes visible

77
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:46,686
only in ultraviolet light.

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,921
- Oh!
- Yes. That's awesome.

79
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:50,190
This challenge
is going to be tough

80
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:53,125
because you have to consider
two separate paint jobs.

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,427
So it's a little scary.

82
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,895
This is gonna be awesome.

83
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:58,331
We can have that UV light,
really pop that second image

84
00:03:58,365 --> 00:03:59,432
of our makeups.

85
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:01,334
It's gonna
be really interesting.

86
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:02,669
I'm gonna leave you here
to sketch

87
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:05,037
in this unique and beautiful
place for inspiration.

88
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:07,440
Oh, and I've also left
a little surprise for you

89
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:08,474
back at the lab.

90
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,109
I'll see you tomorrow.

91
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,418
As I'm starting to sketch
it's hard for me not to think

92
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:20,587
of the ocean,
because we're right there.

93
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,556
So my concept
comes to me immediately.

94
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:25,758
I'm working on
a prehistoric creature,

95
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:26,992
a fish-woman,

96
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:29,262
sort of the link between
humanity and the aquatic.

97
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:32,365
I want her very sexy,
and once the luminescence hits,

98
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,553
I think it will take on
a new level of beauty.

99
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,806
I am working on a fish person
that's been watching

100
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,443
the human race for a while
and now it's time

101
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:45,745
to start making contact.

102
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:48,648
That's my story
and I'm sticking to it.

103
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:52,252
He's an underwater creature.

104
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:53,953
I want it to be
like he's a warrior.

105
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:56,656
And I want the bioluminescence
hidden but also flowing

106
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,492
with the stripings
on his chest.

107
00:05:03,364 --> 00:05:05,565
What I'm going with
is an aquatic theme.

108
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,401
I'm sketching out
a crab humanoid character,

109
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:10,303
and I'm still playing with
how I'm going to incorporate

110
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:11,404
the bioluminescence.

111
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,273
Plus it's gonna
have a full head sculpt

112
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:15,841
and probably
something on the chest.

113
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:19,675
Come on, guys.

114
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,716
We're all very excited
to be heading to the lab

115
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:25,368
to see what's in there.

116
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,193
Ah-hoo.

117
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:37,029
We walk in, we see
this huge jungle scene.

118
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:39,458
And in front of it
we see this button.

119
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,467
I really want
to push the button.

120
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:43,002
Touch.

121
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,570
We're all waiting to see
who's gonna be the first person

122
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:45,605
to get the guts
to press it

123
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,973
and I just decide,
"what the hell?"

124
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,878
- Whoa! No!
- Double elimination!

125
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:54,146
Oh, shit.

126
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,481
This is messed up.

127
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:58,518
We see the dreaded
"double elimination this week."

128
00:05:58,552 --> 00:05:59,519
I don't want to go home.

129
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:00,953
Wow.

130
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,923
The stakes are extremely high
and two people are going home.

131
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:08,093
Everybody is freaking out
but we have to just get to work.

132
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,097
We have five hours
in the lab

133
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:14,734
and today is just
about sculpting.

134
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:17,437
I really want
the body form sculpted

135
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:20,440
because she has lots of gills
all around her head

136
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,507
and her spine.

137
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:23,309
This challenge
gives me anxiety.

138
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:26,212
Undiscovered species,
beautiful paint job,

139
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:30,717
bioluminescent paint job,
double elimination.

140
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,519
Trouble.

141
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:36,088
How's it going, girlie?

142
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:37,857
I don't know,
I keep changing it.

143
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:40,926
I'm thinking a bat creature,
but plant.

144
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:43,696
It could be some kind of seaweed
but I don't know.

145
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:46,399
I'm going to have to continue
to work on my concept.

146
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,168
It's gonna have,
like, plant life up here.

147
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,537
- I like it.
- No, you don't.

148
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:54,874
Well, it's getting there.
It's getting there.

149
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:00,480
- This is my inspiration.
- That's sick.

150
00:07:00,514 --> 00:07:01,881
You can see everything
inside of it.

151
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:04,550
I'd like to do
an amphibian girl.

152
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,719
I'm going to do
an underlying face piece

153
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,988
and a silicone overlap piece.

154
00:07:09,022 --> 00:07:11,123
So when the black lights
kick on,

155
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:15,661
you can see the bone structure
and organs illuminate

156
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:16,796
through the silicone,

157
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,064
like you would see
in a jellyfish.

158
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,735
I'm trying to do something
so big, so crazy

159
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,506
and so out there,
but for me it's worth the risk.

160
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:37,082
While I'm sculpting,
I'm sweating and I feel like

161
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:38,484
I'm dehydrated.

162
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,852
It's kind of weird.

163
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:42,955
And it's getting hard for me
to focus on my work.

164
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:44,924
I would love to lie
on the ground right now,

165
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:48,093
but unfortunately
I have a lot of work to do.

166
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,563
Are you making a squid,
Anthony?

167
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:54,300
No. It's, like, an amphibious
deep-sea creature.

168
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:56,335
I'm working on the face
and I'm gonna give it,

169
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:58,671
like, a really cool
paint job in daylight

170
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,606
and then it's gonna
have something that goes

171
00:08:00,641 --> 00:08:03,643
a lot further
for the bioluminescence.

172
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:08,748
Once again,
another kick-ass sculpture.

173
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:09,949
Not too bad.

174
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,751
The crab is gonna
have these mandibles

175
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,018
that the crab eats with.

176
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:14,954
He does move his jaw,
they do have a little bit

177
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:16,288
of movement in them
so that way they're not,

178
00:08:16,323 --> 00:08:17,723
like, a static piece.

179
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:21,131
Dude's got crabs.

180
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:23,863
You've actually
got a face in there?

181
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:25,431
Yeah, there's, like,
a face that was in the rocks

182
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,767
that I wanted to translate
into a makeup.

183
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,269
I want to let loose
for this challenge.

184
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:32,972
So my creature is
a cavern-dwelling tough guy.

185
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:35,908
He's a mix between
an amphibian and a reptile.

186
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,242
That's cool, man.

187
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:38,377
I sort of played around
with it but I want

188
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:40,212
to see how I can get it
to fit onto a makeup

189
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:42,949
the best I can,
you know?

190
00:08:48,956 --> 00:08:53,092
I really don't feel good.
I feel very nauseous.

191
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,730
I feel like I'm gonna
throw up right now.

192
00:08:57,764 --> 00:08:59,231
- What?
- Why? You all right?

193
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:00,967
- Like, I feel hot.
- You feel hot?

194
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,401
I feel like
I have a fever.

195
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:05,605
I have to continue to sculpt,
but it's incredibly hard

196
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,340
and this challenge
is a double-elimination.

197
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,511
If I don't get anything done,
the outcome's not gonna be good.

198
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:19,519
The room starts spinning
and my head is, like, burning up

199
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:20,820
and I'm, like, hot.

200
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:24,590
I feel nauseous
and I have to throw up.

201
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,527
As I come back to my desk,
Megan's not there.

202
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:31,130
So immediately
I know something's wrong.

203
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:33,499
I'm so dizzy.
I'm completely dizzy.

204
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:36,536
I'm scared
I'm going to go home.

205
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,537
Coming up...

206
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:38,838
Oh, man.

207
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:41,541
I don't know if
I'm gonna pull this off.

208
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,075
Dude, I'm a fucking mess.

209
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:45,210
As much as my head wants
to be in this competition,

210
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,546
I can't be.

211
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,514
I'm terribly disappointed.
I have to be honest.

212
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,184
It's day one
and I feel awful.

213
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:58,785
The room starts spinning.

214
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,420
I really want to focus
but I can't,

215
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:03,858
and I know if I don't get
anything done, I'm going home.

216
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:06,727
I'm really scared.

217
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:08,329
I'm not feeling good.

218
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:18,138
I'm worried for Meagan, 'cause
this is a double elimination.

219
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:19,706
You can't be in the bottom
this week.

220
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,977
This is the worst time
for me to be really sick.

221
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:25,212
As much as my head wants
to be in this competition,

222
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:27,948
I can't be.

223
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:30,117
Dude, I'm a fucking mess.

224
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,785
I have to go to the hospital
and I'm terrified

225
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:35,189
I'm not coming back
to the lab.

226
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,127
- Ooh, that looks cool.
- Thanks, buddy.

227
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:42,930
I start doing some
finishing details on the face.

228
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:45,399
I really want to keep
this makeup simple,

229
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:47,701
especially because
of the double elimination.

230
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:49,937
It changes
the game altogether.

231
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:54,775
This is definitely
not the time to go too big.

232
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:58,913
I want to incorporate
the starfish into the center

233
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,347
of her chest.

234
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,883
And I want to work into
the design orange and red.

235
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:05,519
So it won't just be
so much green and yellow

236
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,421
luminescent paint.

237
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:09,156
How much time do we have?

238
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,393
We got 35 minutes.

239
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:17,798
So by the end of day one,
I still have

240
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:19,866
a lot more work to do.
It's just stressful,

241
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:22,236
especially coming off
the last two weeks

242
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,171
of being in the bottom.

243
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,173
Time's up, everybody!

244
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,276
Let's go!

245
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:30,510
All that's going
through my mind is,

246
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:31,878
"you better not be
in the bottom this time,

247
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:35,182
'cause if you are,
you're going home."

248
00:11:42,324 --> 00:11:43,657
Let's do it.

249
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,459
I'm, like, the delinquent.

250
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:48,195
It's day two and
I'm back in the lab.

251
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,164
Turns out
I had food poisoning.

252
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:52,732
Yesterday was
a complete waste of day.

253
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,769
So my goal today is to get
the face sculpted and molded.

254
00:11:55,803 --> 00:11:58,172
But I still have
to figure out the concept.

255
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:01,741
I'm not feeling 100%.
I would say I'm 40%.

256
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:04,885
Oh, thanks, man.

257
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:10,117
Right away I know
I have to start

258
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:11,585
blocking out
the cowl piece.

259
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:13,420
That's one of the biggest pieces
I have to get done.

260
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:15,389
As I'm sculpting
I'm always thinking about

261
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:16,623
how I'm going
to paint this piece

262
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:18,092
to really bring
this sculpture to life.

263
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:20,327
And it's kind of scary to me,
'cause I'm always

264
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:21,628
pushing things
to the last minute

265
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:24,631
and that can't happen
in this challenge.

266
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:31,105
I have to get the cowl
and the chest done today,

267
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,772
so I'm going to work on them
at the same time

268
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,708
so I can mold them
at the same time.

269
00:12:34,742 --> 00:12:38,445
I decide to run a latex polyfoam
of my face sculpture

270
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,780
so that I know what it
looks like in three dimensions.

271
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:42,782
I can use it to sculpt
the rest of my cowl

272
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:46,320
so that I know
it lines up properly.

273
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,694
Hey, guys.

274
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,096
Michael Westmore
and McKenzie come up

275
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:58,098
to do their walkabout
through the shop.

276
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:00,600
It's gonna be interesting
to see what they have to say

277
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:01,801
about our makeups.

278
00:13:01,836 --> 00:13:02,903
- Hey, House.
- Hello, guys.

279
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:04,071
So tell us
about your creature.

280
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:05,906
Well, we're basing it
out of the water.

281
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,607
Kind of a fish-human hybrid.

282
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:09,309
You know, it's really
important with the paint

283
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:12,712
to have some direction
as opposed to just spotting it.

284
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:13,980
That's right.

285
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,182
'Cause, I mean,
whatever you do

286
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:17,651
with your non-iridescent paint,
you know,

287
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,154
should be highlighted
so it pops the same thing out.

288
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:21,621
This is a painting challenge.

289
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:22,956
All right, so tell us
about your creation.

290
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,192
Actually where I got
a lot of the shapes

291
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,194
for my character
were looking at the rocks.

292
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,529
How are you going to end
the back of this?

293
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,164
Um, actually
I'm not too sure yet.

294
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:31,165
Okay.

295
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,166
- I'm still--
- Working on it?

296
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,233
Yup.

297
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:34,535
- I would keep the back simple.
- Okay.

298
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,336
Just so you don't
waste time.

299
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:38,305
My creature, he kind
of comes from the waters

300
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,606
of the rainforest.

301
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,408
He's a mixture between
an amphibious creature

302
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:42,876
and also like a squid.

303
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,279
My goal is for tomorrow
just to really sell it

304
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:46,447
in the body painting.

305
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:47,714
The painting is going
to be very important.

306
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,684
When they switch lights,
it emphasizes what you see

307
00:13:50,718 --> 00:13:51,851
without the light.

308
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:53,153
- Right.
- Yeah.

309
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:54,388
I saw this thing
on the beach.

310
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:56,957
It looked like it was
from another planet.

311
00:13:56,991 --> 00:13:58,825
So I wanted to
incorporate that on this

312
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:00,760
so at first it will
just look like rocks.

313
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:02,262
- Like he's a cave person.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

314
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:04,264
And then when the lights go on
it will turn into that.

315
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:05,765
- Oh, nice.
- Mm-hmm.

316
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,201
The ecosystem
that it comes from

317
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:10,070
is the mangroves
of, like, swamp areas.

318
00:14:10,105 --> 00:14:11,738
So he's gonna
have crab elements.

319
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:12,739
Very nice.

320
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:13,873
How are you planning on

321
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,276
picking up
the highlights and shadows?

322
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:17,978
Uh, I'll probably
do some washes.

323
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,613
And then on the very edge,
I'll probably hit it

324
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,548
with the luminescent paints.

325
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,284
The initial paint job
is so very important.

326
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:27,354
And then your luminescent one,
just to make everything pop.

327
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:28,355
- Right.
- You know?

328
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,789
- I'm going for ocean.
- Okay.

329
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:32,692
My inspiration
is translucency.

330
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,794
So what I did here
was I had actually

331
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:37,731
sculpted out some inner organ
and bone structure.

332
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:39,866
Are you going to put silicone
over your latex piece?

333
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,169
Yeah, so that when you see
all the bone structure

334
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,571
illuminate through the silicone.

335
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:46,573
- I'm going with ocean.
- Okay.

336
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:49,610
And I'm doing
a female fish-being.

337
00:14:49,644 --> 00:14:50,810
I want to use silicone
this time,

338
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,879
just to kind of give it
more of that fish qualit

339
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:54,014
- right.
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:55,149
So we can see into it.

341
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,716
- Is this gonna be luminescent?
- Oh, yes.

342
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:58,318
- Where it will pop out itself?
- Oh, yes.

343
00:14:58,353 --> 00:14:59,486
Great.

344
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:00,687
Okay, everybody,
we're heading out.

345
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:01,921
It's looking great.
Good luck tomorrow.

346
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,223
- Thanks, you guys.
- Bye.

347
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:05,208
Bye-bye.

348
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,001
The chest sculpture
is complete.

349
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,704
And, it being
a full chest and back,

350
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:19,739
it's gonna take some time
to make this mold.

351
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:23,677
My goal is to try to get this
completed by the end of the day.

352
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:30,850
By the middle of day two,
I'm really rushing on the hands.

353
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,919
They're not as stylized
as I would like.

354
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,222
I just don't think
the sculptures look that great.

355
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:36,723
But I'm running out of time,

356
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:39,125
so all I can do
is hope for the best.

357
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:44,798
I'm looking around the room.

358
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:49,069
I'm noticing there's
some really great pieces.

359
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:51,838
- Pulled right out.
- Look at that! Whoo!

360
00:15:51,872 --> 00:15:54,174
I'm starting to worry
about my creature,

361
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:57,077
considering mine is
so much bigger and crazier.

362
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,847
I love this whole making molds
at the last minute.

363
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:03,917
I don't know if
I'm gonna pull this off.

364
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:05,719
But I start
the molding process

365
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:08,755
and it is taking
longer than expected.

366
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:10,424
There's still
so much to do.

367
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:14,994
Time's running out and it's
double elimination this week.

368
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,097
I'm worried about
potentially going home.

369
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,599
Oh, shit.

370
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,122
The black light room
is actually working.

371
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:23,870
Would you take that in?
Let's test it.

372
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:26,733
Mr. Westmore and McKenzie
are really exited to see the

373
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,030
face piece that I did
in the black light room.

374
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,417
Your head-band is glowing.

375
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:33,830
You, girl, you
have white teeth.

376
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:36,735
McKenzie looks like
* girl.

377
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:38,489
Thanks a lot!

378
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:42,479
You gotta have fun, or, you know,
why are you doing this.

379
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,755
♪ I looking like ♪,
lets get out of here.

380
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,844
Guys, it's really fun
in there, you gotta go!

381
00:16:53,047 --> 00:16:55,448
I find myself here
every time.

382
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,951
It's day two,
we've got one hour left,

383
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,486
and I'm running really behind.

384
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,423
I still need
to finish my molds

385
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,427
and all I can do is
forge ahead, guns a-blarin'.

386
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,069
You know,
I could add some more of these

387
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,336
in here
where they're painted.

388
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:19,906
For the sculpt,
I want to make a Venus flytrap.

389
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,409
So I figured that
I can make the teeth

390
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,844
coming out this way.

391
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:27,881
So I'm going to take nails
and make them into teeth

392
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,282
and then pull them out
before I mold it.

393
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,417
On top of that,
I'm going to create the leaf

394
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,754
so it looks like the actual face
is more of a plant.

395
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:35,755
Pretty cool.

396
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,890
I'm exhausted.

397
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:39,159
I look like shit.
I feel like shit.

398
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:40,727
But I am not a quitter.

399
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,938
There is a slew
of different UV paints.

400
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:54,574
So I grab some
and go to the black light room,

401
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:55,575
and it's glowing.

402
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:56,876
I'm gonna use this.

403
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,079
This will look cool when
they kick on the black lights.

404
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:00,914
I want to put
some more yellow in there.

405
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,987
- Does that look lame?
- That'll be cool.

406
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:09,255
For my character,

407
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,157
I am playing on the idea
of making his hands,

408
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,360
feet, parts of the top
of his head and his back, red

409
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,396
to bring the color pattern
throughout the entire body

410
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,399
as well as to play off
of different amphibians,

411
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,136
like poison dart frogs
who have red extremities.

412
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,739
Oh, that looks cool, man.

413
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,140
I'm just trying to,
like, see how it would layer.

414
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,908
Yeah.

415
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,183
All right.

416
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:39,652
The end of day two,
I've got all my molds done,

417
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,122
but unfortunately I really
did not get a chance

418
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:44,624
to test out the paints.

419
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:46,760
Time's up, guys.
Let's go!

420
00:18:46,794 --> 00:18:49,362
I think the trickiest part
is to be able to pull off

421
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,698
the two paint jobs
that are required.

422
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:56,469
So I hope it works.

423
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,151
Oh, man!

424
00:19:11,185 --> 00:19:13,219
I'm really upset
this morning.

425
00:19:13,254 --> 00:19:15,354
I have four hours
to get this makeup on

426
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:18,758
and my foam piece
has huge steam pockets.

427
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,260
Oh, shit.

428
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:23,263
Steam pockets is when
you're baking your foam rubber--

429
00:19:23,297 --> 00:19:27,400
if there's too much moisture
still accumulated in the molds,

430
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,903
it leaves
really deep, ugly pits.

431
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,772
This right here is easily
an hour out of my day

432
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:33,773
to try to repair.

433
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:38,511
This was not in my schedule
for this morning.

434
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:46,920
- How are you doing?
- Great, man. How are you?

435
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:50,290
- You're gonna be translucent.
- Ooh.

436
00:19:50,324 --> 00:19:52,358
Application day
is going well.

437
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,460
The pieces are
going together great.

438
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:55,795
I'm having fun applying,
you know?

439
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,163
I like applying makeups.

440
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:58,364
I just want to show them
what I can do.

441
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,632
So I'm going
to take my time.

442
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,801
I'm going to make this makeup
look as good

443
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:04,103
as I can make it look.

444
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,079
The first thing I see
is that my face looks fine.

445
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:16,549
But I've sculpted
such large gills and fins on her

446
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,584
that they don't quite turn out.

447
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,919
Most of them are
trapped in the mold

448
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:22,455
and I'm digging them out
and reconstructing them

449
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,790
with cotton and latex.

450
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:28,261
I'm starting to sweat a bit
because fixing all the gills

451
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,929
is eating
into my work time,

452
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,597
it's eating
into my painting time,

453
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:34,700
and it's double elimination.
Every minute counts.

454
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:43,809
After I have
the chest piece applied,

455
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:48,014
I begin to stencil her back,
her arms, her legs.

456
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:50,683
And I know by just
turning the stencil

457
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,086
it'll break up
the whole stenciling process,

458
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,620
so it doesn't
look like I'm using it

459
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:58,224
in the same pattern everywhere.

460
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,597
Looking around the room,
everyone has, like,

461
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:07,200
four pieces, three pieces,

462
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,936
and my creature is going
to have one piece.

463
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,871
It's not a good feeling,
and I know that,

464
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,240
if I don't get enough done,
I'm going home.

465
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,376
If I could just
cover the chest area

466
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,046
with even latex,
a little cotton, or sand,

467
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,517
maybe it will translate
that it's a beach plant.

468
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,853
Even if the look isn't the best,
I just want a completed look.

469
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,531
Timing on this challenge
is everything.

470
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,533
Now close your eyes.
Keep your mouth closed.

471
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:43,236
So this is probably
around the last 20 minutes

472
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,038
and I'm basically
just taking him

473
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:46,239
into the black light room,

474
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,474
and doing a little bit
of spattering on him.

475
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,810
I use some yellows
and greens and whites.

476
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:53,012
And basically
spatter it up the chest.

477
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:56,282
As well as put
some strong yellow dots

478
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:59,052
coming out from the center.

479
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:01,187
I've got basically
the brunt of my painting done,

480
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:02,755
but there's still
a lot more painting to do.

481
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,858
15 minutes, everybody.

482
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,099
Everyone has paint on them.

483
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:15,534
They have almost
all their pieces on,

484
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,203
and it's, like,
here we go again,

485
00:22:17,237 --> 00:22:19,072
falling back
in those same footsteps

486
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:20,539
the judges always
tell me not to.

487
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:26,879
That's time, guys!

488
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,647
I'm really stressing out.

489
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,350
It's a challenge that
I'm very familiar with.

490
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:33,219
So to fall behind on this one,

491
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:35,888
I'm kind of letting
myself down in a way.

492
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,127
Coming up...

493
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,528
I may be going home
on this one.

494
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:43,902
Fuck.

495
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,899
You have to understand more
about these choices.

496
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,934
I could see that on Pandora.

497
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,409
Go, go, go, go.

498
00:22:55,443 --> 00:22:58,445
Walking into last looks,
one of the first things I do

499
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,013
is start painting the legs.

500
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,782
Can you turn back
around for me? Thanks.

501
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,084
We're about
to get crazy now.

502
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,320
I have so much to do.

503
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:10,023
I'm gluing latex to her,
I'm stretching the veins,

504
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:13,427
I have her blow-drying,
'cause I'm gluing veins on.

505
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:17,030
All I can do is just work
like a madman to get this done.

506
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:24,438
I'm in the UV room
checking my luminescent paint.

507
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm probably not
utilizing them in the best way,

508
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,042
but whatever happens,
happens.

509
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,244
Ten minutes, everyone!

510
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,146
At this point
I don't even have

511
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,181
any bioluminescence
paint on at all.

512
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:36,450
I'm putting it
in my airbrush

513
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,718
and I'm just
outlining the black.

514
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:42,756
I'm very, very worried that
I may be going home on this one.

515
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,532
Time, guys!

516
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:53,300
Fuck.

517
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,313
Welcome to
the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

518
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:11,051
Tonight, two of you
will be eliminated.

519
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:12,586
Say hello to your judges.

520
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,489
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

521
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:17,724
- Good evening.
- Evening.

522
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:20,194
Three time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

523
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:21,195
Hi, guys.

524
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:22,362
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:24:22,397 --> 00:24:24,464
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

526
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:25,632
Hello, everyone.

527
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:26,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

528
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,635
And joining
our panel this week...

529
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,037
he's an Oscar-winning producer
whose work includes

530
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:33,773
the two highest-grossing movies
of all time,

531
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:36,142
<i>Titanic</i> and <i>Avatar.</i>

532
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:39,946
Please give a warm welcome
to John Landau.

533
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,316
Howdy.

534
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,951
He's probably one of
the most successful producers

535
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,253
in movie history.

536
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:48,322
And if he doesn't
know these creatures,

537
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,623
nobody does.

538
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:51,258
John, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

539
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,559
It's a pleasure to be here.

540
00:24:52,594 --> 00:24:55,462
I'm very excited to
see what we have in store.

541
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,531
This week, your spotlight
challenge was to create

542
00:24:57,565 --> 00:25:01,501
a new species that could exist
in one of Earth's ecosystems.

543
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:04,438
But it also had to
have two very distinct looks.

544
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:06,440
One in normal light

545
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:09,175
and another visible
only under ultraviolet light.

546
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,212
So let's see
what you come up with.

547
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,569
The glow is stopping
at the top of her head

548
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,237
and a lot of the colors
that I added

549
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:39,773
just got masked over
with regular paint.

550
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:42,376
And I feel I let myself down
on this one.

551
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,132
My character comes out and
I'm noticing all of the flaws.

552
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,503
There's some part of me that
feels like I didn't do enough.

553
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:34,695
It looks good,
especially from a distance.

554
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:38,264
He's bold, but I'm thinking
he's bold in a good way.

555
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:03,357
Black light kicks on,
and I'm okay with it.

556
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:06,960
I'm not 100% confident,
but it is what it is.

557
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:33,820
I'm worried that they're not
going to understand the concept.

558
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:37,957
I really don't
have a backstory.

559
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:04,284
Even though I didn't get
to take it where I wanted to,

560
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:05,919
I still think
it looks really cool.

561
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,687
You can see the fins
and everything,

562
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,489
so I'm really
excited about it.

563
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:11,257
So at this point
I can just hope for the best.

564
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,852
My black light effects
work great.

565
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:42,055
It's gonna help compensate
for the fact that

566
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:44,424
my ambient lighting paint's
not so hot.

567
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:53,500
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

568
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,283
Yeah.

569
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:11,551
Now is all of this
black light?

570
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:13,353
Is that why the color
is so different?

571
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,621
No, I don't think so.

572
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,155
I think all we saw on this guy
is just splotches.

573
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,591
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's just splotches.

574
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,459
The judges have gone in
for their closer looks,

575
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:21,495
and it's making me
very, very nervous.

576
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,530
And this being a double
elimination does not help.

577
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:26,366
The paint is rubbing off
of the foam right there.

578
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,701
There are some
pieces up there

579
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:29,469
that have a more
complete look than mine

580
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:32,739
and that may
do me in this time.

581
00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:37,936
Now is all
of this black light?

582
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,338
Is that why the color
is so different?

583
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:40,872
No, I don't think so.

584
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:42,374
I think all we saw on this guy
is just splotches.

585
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:43,642
Yeah, just the splotches.

586
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:45,710
The judges have gone in
for their closer looks

587
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:47,146
and I'm very, very nervous.

588
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,315
This being a double elimination
does not help.

589
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,084
This is all really cool.

590
00:29:52,118 --> 00:29:54,386
Yeah, it has
so much more detail.

591
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:55,987
There's a lot of frickin' work
in that thing.

592
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:59,758
Pretty complicated paint job.

593
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:02,227
I think this one's
really, really inventive,

594
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:06,532
the sculpture elements
happening with this.

595
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:09,468
Interesting things
happening through here.

596
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:11,303
These leaves sculpted in.

597
00:30:11,337 --> 00:30:14,873
You're on your own
on that one, man.

598
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:16,141
- This is cool.
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:18,477
- Even better close up.
- Yeah.

600
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:20,679
Really nice job.

601
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:22,714
Perhaps we have an artist
who said the challenge

602
00:30:22,748 --> 00:30:25,184
is all about the change
to the bioluminescent version

603
00:30:25,218 --> 00:30:28,253
of this thing,
and that's a risky decision.

604
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,693
The judges would now
like to speak with each of you

605
00:30:34,727 --> 00:30:36,295
to learn more
about your work.

606
00:30:36,329 --> 00:30:38,997
Kris, you're up first.

607
00:30:43,736 --> 00:30:46,338
Kris, can you
explain your design?

608
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:47,806
She's a humanoid
from the deep.

609
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,809
I used a silicone prosthetic
for the face,

610
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:52,311
a foam latex chest,

611
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:53,945
everything else
is pretty much paint.

612
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,782
It feels like a stylized
sort of '60s, '70s approach

613
00:30:57,817 --> 00:31:00,852
to the makeup,
and I think that's brilliant.

614
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:02,954
To take a stylized version
that would allow you to work

615
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:05,790
in broad strokes was
a really intelligent way

616
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:07,226
about approaching this.

617
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,761
I think that there's
some really adventurous forms

618
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:11,896
that you're applying
to the body,

619
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:15,601
particularly in the belly
and just around the chest.

620
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:17,736
There are some
pretty cool things going on.

621
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,404
I think this looks much better
under the black light

622
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,340
than it does this way.

623
00:31:21,374 --> 00:31:25,177
I don't like the leaf treatment
of the lower region.

624
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,146
I think you would have been
much better off just leaving her

625
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,148
really sleek looking.

626
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:30,682
When you're
designing characters,

627
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:32,117
they need to have expression.

628
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:34,520
And I think that's
a tough mouth design

629
00:31:34,554 --> 00:31:38,790
to get to really convey
any of that emotion.

630
00:31:38,824 --> 00:31:41,826
- Kris, please step back.
- Thank you.

631
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:46,431
House, please step forward.

632
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:52,937
House, tell me
about your concept.

633
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:56,007
I was thinking of an ancient
race of fish-human people,

634
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:59,077
and I wanted something familiar,
yet beautiful.

635
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:01,146
She's definitely
familiar looking.

636
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:03,848
Beautiful? I would not
say she's beautiful.

637
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:06,218
I'm not too thrilled
with the way she appears

638
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:07,619
under the black light,

639
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:11,423
and the hands are
absolutely atrocious.

640
00:32:11,457 --> 00:32:13,992
The graphics around the chest,
on the arms,

641
00:32:14,026 --> 00:32:17,529
they don't feel even
like it's organized chaos.

642
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:18,664
You have to understand

643
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:21,266
a little bit more
about these choices.

644
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,767
I really don't like
the colors.

645
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:25,504
It doesn't have
the purposeful asymmetry

646
00:32:25,538 --> 00:32:29,241
of what mother nature
does in a fish.

647
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:33,044
House, please step back.

648
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,880
Anthony, you're up.

649
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:41,420
All right, Anthony,
tell us about your concept.

650
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,154
He's kind of
an amphibious creature

651
00:32:43,189 --> 00:32:45,890
and the bioluminescence
of the character

652
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:48,460
is attributed to age and rank.

653
00:32:48,494 --> 00:32:51,096
There's some really
beautiful things here.

654
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,698
There's a lot
of asymmetry with it,

655
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:55,033
but it's okay
because it feels natural.

656
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:57,636
- It's a beautiful looking piece.
- Thank you.

657
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,305
I love that you tied
the extremities together.

658
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,906
Not just, you know,
the feet and the hands,

659
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:03,041
but also the top of the head,

660
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:05,444
and I could see that
on Pandora.

661
00:33:05,478 --> 00:33:06,878
Good job, all in all.

662
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:10,048
I love the fact that when
the bioluminescence comes up,

663
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:11,350
it's green.

664
00:33:11,384 --> 00:33:13,552
It was just so cool.
It was completely unexpected.

665
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:15,687
And I thought that was
really beautifully done.

666
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:17,623
You did an amazing job.

667
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:21,092
- Anthony, please step back.
- Thanks, guys.

668
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:24,095
- Meagan.
- Thanks.

669
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:31,236
So, Meagan, tell me about
the concept behind this design.

670
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:34,373
I wanted it to look
like a Venus flytrap,

671
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:35,907
but inside a cave.

672
00:33:35,941 --> 00:33:37,876
I had no idea,
when I saw the character,

673
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,279
what the concept was.

674
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:42,514
Instead of being organic,
I think you were

675
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:44,949
trying to mix, you know,
too many things

676
00:33:44,984 --> 00:33:47,619
and for me,
unfortunately, this missed.

677
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:50,355
What I don't understand is,
if he's a Venus flytrap

678
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,624
and you have
these leaf elements,

679
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:55,460
why they aren't delineated
with a different color of paint

680
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:58,897
so that you can
at least see what you did.

681
00:33:58,931 --> 00:34:00,565
How do you feel
about your work this week?

682
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,168
I was actually sick
the first day

683
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:05,870
and I'm okay with it
because it's completed.

684
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,807
I think I would swallow that
a little bit better

685
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,141
if we had something
really great,

686
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:12,377
even if it was something small
that was really great.

687
00:34:12,412 --> 00:34:16,080
So I'm terribly disappointed.
I have to be honest.

688
00:34:16,115 --> 00:34:19,117
- Meagan, please step back.
- Thank you.

689
00:34:20,186 --> 00:34:22,854
Wayne.

690
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:28,059
Wayne, tell us about
what you were thinking

691
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:29,127
when you put this together.

692
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:31,896
I wanted to go
with a crab theme.

693
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,732
I had more that
I wanted to do to it

694
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:38,537
with the big vacuform claws,
but I had to conserve my time.

695
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:40,539
There's a lot
about what you've done

696
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:42,774
that I absolutely love.

697
00:34:42,809 --> 00:34:45,176
Significant improvements
over some of the stuff

698
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:46,712
that you've done
in the past.

699
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:47,813
I think that
you're presenting

700
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:50,615
a really solid
piece of work here.

701
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,584
You really didn't
make the black light half

702
00:34:52,618 --> 00:34:54,820
of the challenge
come to life for me,

703
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:57,922
but I have to give you the kudos
to the sculpture on the face.

704
00:34:57,957 --> 00:34:59,691
It's just absolutely gorgeous.

705
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:01,226
Thank you.

706
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,495
So I think this is a piece
that works better

707
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:05,196
when you're close up to it
than when you're far away.

708
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:07,532
But I think the detail
that you got right in the face

709
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:08,633
was a great job.

710
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:12,270
- Thank you.
- Wayne, please step back.

711
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:14,973
Eric Z.

712
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:21,346
Eric, tell me
about your concept.

713
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:22,614
He's a tough guy,
he's a brawler,

714
00:35:22,648 --> 00:35:23,915
and he's a cave dweller.

715
00:35:23,949 --> 00:35:26,351
He lives on the beach,
in the caverns and in the caves.

716
00:35:26,386 --> 00:35:30,088
For me, he just looks
like a big cookie monster.

717
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:32,791
What happened with
your bioluminescence paint job?

718
00:35:32,825 --> 00:35:35,560
I had some designs on his face
and on the back of his head,

719
00:35:35,595 --> 00:35:38,530
so I decided to go back in
with the regular makeup

720
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:40,432
and, like, enhance some things
and that covered up

721
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:43,034
some of the bioluminescence
that I had done on the face.

722
00:35:43,068 --> 00:35:46,104
You have got to
do better than this.

723
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:47,739
If you brought this out
as a character

724
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:49,207
for us to consider
putting on film,

725
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:51,976
I'd say, "absolutely not."

726
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:56,047
I look at this and
I don't see any originality.

727
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:57,148
Mm-hmm.

728
00:35:57,182 --> 00:35:59,451
I'm sorry,
it just did not work.

729
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:02,854
Eric, please step back.

730
00:36:07,126 --> 00:36:10,194
Eric F.

731
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:14,900
You got a lot
of explaining to do.

732
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:16,735
- What's this all about?
- It's unfinished.

733
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:18,269
I was going to go with

734
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,405
a translucent
jellyfish type approach,

735
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,074
and I ran short on time.

736
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:26,277
I think it's a really,
really bold concept.

737
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:28,279
It's a great idea.

738
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:32,651
But she does look best
with the bioluminescence.

739
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:34,252
When you went
to the bioluminescence,

740
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:35,887
I felt like we were
getting to see the bones

741
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:37,055
and the inner structure.

742
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:38,156
Yeah, that's--

743
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,758
Yet the ribs
weren't bioluminescent.

744
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,193
It would have all brought it
much better together for me

745
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:44,729
had you been able,
you know, to do that.

746
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:48,099
I love the way her legs look
when she lights up

747
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:49,734
under the black light.

748
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,736
I thought she looked fabulous.
So there you go.

749
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:53,371
Thank you, Ve.

750
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:56,641
Eric, please step back.

751
00:37:00,613 --> 00:37:02,547
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

752
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:03,782
If you would please
head back to the makeup room

753
00:37:03,816 --> 00:37:05,911
while they make their decisions.

754
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:10,221
All right, guys,
why don't we start

755
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:12,023
with the looks you like
the most this week?

756
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:13,224
Let's begin with Anthony.

757
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:14,526
So good.

758
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,628
It was a creature
without bioluminescence

759
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:18,497
that transformed
with the bioluminescence.

760
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:19,831
He did a great job.

761
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:22,166
Of everyone up there,
he's the only one who did that.

762
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,535
It was genius.

763
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:25,003
All right,
let's move on to Wayne.

764
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:30,141
He's got a really, really
mature artistic sensibility

765
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:32,343
when it comes
to sculpture and form.

766
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:35,179
Often times people design and
it looks good from one angle,

767
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,548
but here you were able
to turn his head

768
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,182
and you saw
little details coming out

769
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,585
and it all played together.

770
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,020
I don't think
I've ever seen

771
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:44,389
a chest sculpted that way.

772
00:37:44,423 --> 00:37:45,857
That's impressive to me.

773
00:37:45,892 --> 00:37:48,126
All right, let's move on
to the bottom looks of the week.

774
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,293
Let's start with House.

775
00:37:49,328 --> 00:37:50,929
Been there, done that
a little bit, you know?

776
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:52,263
Yeah.

777
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:53,732
I feel that something
didn't pop out as original.

778
00:37:53,766 --> 00:37:56,701
You want familiar touchstones,

779
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:59,103
but the overall impression
can't be familiar.

780
00:37:59,138 --> 00:38:01,406
And the paint job
is so bad.

781
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,010
It's bad paint
over coarse sculpting.

782
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:06,778
All right,
let's move on to Meagan,

783
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:09,414
who as you know
was very, very sick.

784
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:12,383
I get that, but I don't know
that it would have made

785
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:13,952
a huge difference,
to be honest.

786
00:38:13,986 --> 00:38:15,386
I think the concept
wasn't bad.

787
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:16,655
She did not have an idea.

788
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:18,523
When she tried
to articulate what it was--

789
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:19,791
you have a Venus flytrap

790
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:21,492
and it's opening this way
on a face.

791
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:23,562
Let's move on to Eric Z.

792
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:25,129
I don't know
what he was thinking of.

793
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:28,299
He said he's a rabble-rouser
or whatever-- it's, like, really?

794
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:30,902
What was he rousing, you know?
A bunch of bakers?

795
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:33,237
There seemed
to be no thought

796
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:35,607
to the specific design
of the head.

797
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:37,742
- Mm-hmm.
- It was strange.

798
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:39,210
And the bioluminescent makeup

799
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:40,511
looked like child's
finger-painting.

800
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:41,646
Yeah.

801
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,182
Okay, judges, have you
made your decisions?

802
00:38:44,216 --> 00:38:45,183
- I think so.
- Yup.

803
00:38:45,217 --> 00:38:46,184
- Yeah.
- We have.

804
00:38:46,218 --> 00:38:49,253
Let's bring them back out.

805
00:38:57,262 --> 00:38:59,698
Glenn, tell us about
the top looks tonight.

806
00:38:59,732 --> 00:39:03,534
Anthony, your sculpting
this week was phenomenal.

807
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:05,036
And the amount
of conceptual work

808
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,572
that you did from the beginning
was truly impressive.

809
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:10,575
Wayne, some of the moments
in your sculpting this week

810
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,077
really stood out.

811
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:14,145
It's an extremely
unique piece of work.

812
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,314
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

813
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:20,619
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

814
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:27,244
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

815
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:31,281
The winner of
tonight's challenge is...

816
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,154
Anthony.

817
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:41,625
Your creature was a standout
in both lighting conditions.

818
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,260
Very, very strong work.

819
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:45,295
Thank you guys so much.
Thank you.

820
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,930
It's so humbling again to win,

821
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:49,299
especially when one of
the guest judges is John Landau.

822
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:50,667
It's one of those geek moments
that, you know,

823
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:51,668
I'll never forget.

824
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:53,503
Anthony, congratulations.

825
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:55,706
You and Wayne can head
back to the makeup room.

826
00:39:57,642 --> 00:40:01,245
Kris and Eric F,
you are also safe.

827
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:02,946
Please head back
to the makeup room.

828
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,815
Thank you again.

829
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,651
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

830
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:09,519
are on the bottom this week,
and two of you

831
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:11,555
will be eliminated.

832
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:14,591
Please step forward.

833
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:21,565
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

834
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,067
House, there were
some fundamental flaws

835
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:26,637
with both function and form
in your makeup this week.

836
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:29,606
The finished product
was kind of rough.

837
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:31,174
Meagan, we realize

838
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:33,343
that you had some physical
struggles this week,

839
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:35,011
but the finished makeup
was devoid

840
00:40:35,045 --> 00:40:37,781
of any recognizable design.

841
00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:40,784
Eric, we didn't see
any really original ideas

842
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:41,885
in your makeup.

843
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:43,520
It just didn't work.

844
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,189
So who is the first person
going home tonight?

845
00:40:46,223 --> 00:40:48,258
The first person
going home tonight is...

846
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:53,497
Meagan.

847
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:56,366
You really struggled with
your time management this week

848
00:40:56,401 --> 00:41:00,136
and unfortunately you
just weren't able to recover.

849
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:02,773
You know, Meagan, one thing
I have to give you credit for

850
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:06,276
is yours was really
the only land-based design.

851
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:08,312
And I think that was
really great and bold,

852
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:10,514
and take that
forward with you.

853
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:11,881
Thank you.

854
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,651
Meagan, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

855
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:17,020
It has been great
having you here with us.

856
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:18,388
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

857
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:20,890
and pack up your kit.

858
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:22,892
Thank you so much.

859
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,994
I wish I did
a cleaner makeup.

860
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:28,198
Even if it was one piece,
made sure that piece

861
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,099
looked amazing.

862
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:32,602
That is my biggest,
biggest regret.

863
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:34,871
- Oh, stop.
- I'm gonna miss you.

864
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:40,043
Glenn, who is the second
person going home tonight?

865
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:42,379
The second person
going home tonight is...

866
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:49,353
Eric Z.

867
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:53,089
We had major issues on nearly
every level with your creature.

868
00:41:53,123 --> 00:41:56,693
I'm afraid that you just
lost your way this week.

869
00:41:56,728 --> 00:42:00,330
Eric, I'm sorry but
you have been eliminated.

870
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:02,298
That means, House,
you are safe this week

871
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,601
and can head back
to the makeup room.

872
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,073
See you, bud.

873
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:10,540
Eric, I think you've done
some really great things

874
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:12,008
on this show.

875
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:14,444
And I'm absolutely certain that
you will grow in the future.

876
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:15,979
Thank you so much, Glenn.

877
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:18,482
Eric, it's been great
having you here with us.

878
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:19,716
Would you please head back
to the makeup room

879
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,451
and pack up your kit?

880
00:42:21,486 --> 00:42:22,952
Thank you, guys, so much.

881
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:23,953
- Good luck.
- See you, Eric.

882
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:25,255
Thank you.

883
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:26,989
I'm really bummed out
that I got eliminated.

884
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,141
There's a big part of me that
knows that I have more to offer.

885
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:31,894
I'm going back
to Texas, y'all.

886
00:42:31,895 --> 00:42:33,669
- Aw, man!
- Oh, my God!

887
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,755
- We all love each other, yo.
- We do.

888
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:36,733
Big one.

889
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,751
This experience
was a roller coaster,

890
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:40,790
but if you're not
gonna challenge yourself,

891
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,098
what's the point?

892
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:45,378
I know that I am
capable of doing so much more

893
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:48,442
and I'm so lucky
to have had this experience.
