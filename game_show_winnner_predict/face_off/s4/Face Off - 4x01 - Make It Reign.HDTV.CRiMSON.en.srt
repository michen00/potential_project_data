1
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:13,636
This is a search for the next
great name in movie magic.

2
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,906
<i>Face Off</i> is back
for our biggest season ever.

3
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:26,081
14 talented makeup artists
will take the ultimate plunge

4
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:28,651
in a competition
unlike any other.

5
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:30,319
That's just freakin' crazy.

6
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:32,388
They'll face
breathtaking challenges.

7
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:36,125
Your challenge is to create
a Goblin King.

8
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,927
But wait, there's more.

9
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,695
She has some kind
of crazy twist.

10
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,463
- Bioluminescence.
- Wow.

11
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:44,033
- Create a werewolf.
- This is gonna be awesome.

12
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:46,802
- An original giant character.
- Oh, my God.

13
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:49,071
- They went big.
- It's freaking cold.

14
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:51,674
- Unbelievable deadlines.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

15
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,475
Fuck.

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,177
- I can't do this shit.
- Take it off.

17
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,478
- Just take it off.
- I'm sorry.

18
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:58,280
Oh, my God.
It's a disaster.

19
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:01,884
Some of the most talented
artists in <i>Face Off</i> history.

20
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:04,353
I'm really blown away.

21
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:05,821
Along the way they'll come
face to face

22
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,456
with industry titans.

23
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,458
You guys really pulled it off.

24
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,193
It's a great silhouette
and a great first impression.

25
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,429
But to come out on top,
they'll have to impress

26
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:15,564
our award-winning panel
of judges--

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,300
Ve Neill, three-time
Oscar-winning makeup artist

28
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:20,436
whose work includes
<i>Beetlejuice,</i>

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,538
<i>The Hunger Games</i>
<i>Catching Fire,</i> and <i>The Host.</i>

30
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:23,839
I think you did a great job.

31
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:26,108
Glenn Hetrick,
cutting edge makeup artist

32
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:28,744
on <i>CSI New York, The Hunger</i>
<i>Games Catching Fire,</i>

33
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:30,312
and costume
designer for Lady Gaga.

34
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:32,214
I'm pretty thrilled
with this to be honest with you.

35
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:36,785
And Neville Page, creature and
concept designer on <i>Star Trek,</i>

36
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,188
<i>Green Lantern,</i> and <i>Tron Legacy.</i>

37
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:40,322
It's fantastic.

38
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,891
In the end, only one will win
the opportunity

39
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,961
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

40
00:01:45,996 --> 00:01:47,630
in New York and Paris,

41
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:53,068
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,
and $100,000.

42
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:57,406
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

43
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:01,577
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

44
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,589
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,589
Our contestants
have just arrived in Los Angeles

46
00:02:47,624 --> 00:02:49,224
and are on their way
to meet me here

47
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,462
on the beautiful <i>Queen Mary</i>
for their first challenge.

48
00:02:56,633 --> 00:03:00,669
My name is Alam, and I'm
originally from South Korea.

49
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:04,339
I recently graduated
makeup effects school.

50
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:07,910
I know the other artists may
have more experience, but I know

51
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,913
I have a lot of creativity,
and I'm passionate.

52
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,185
My name is Michael.

53
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,420
My brother is Matt Valentine
from season two.

54
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:20,089
Being here means
I finally broke the barrier

55
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:22,725
so people will see
I have talent on my own.

56
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,859
I'm my own person.

57
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,194
I want to make a name
for myself

58
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:28,330
and get out of his shadow.

59
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:31,300
I'm Wayne.
I'm a self-taught artist.

60
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:34,403
I was awarded the Dick Smith
scholarship legends of makeup.

61
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:38,006
It was a $10,000 scholarship
for cinema makeup school.

62
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,609
Winning <i>Face Off</i>
would be huge to me.

63
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:43,212
It would make my dreams come
true, because I would like

64
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:44,513
to have
my own special effects shop

65
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:46,248
within about five years or so.

66
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:47,783
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, I'm Alex. How are you?

67
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:49,351
- I'm Wayne. Nice to meet you.
- Wayne, nice to meet you.

68
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:50,986
I've been working
in special effects

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,187
for approximately
ten years now.

70
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:53,789
My husband and I have a company,

71
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:58,193
and we've done everything
from music videos to TV shows.

72
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,728
Isn't this place,
like, haunted?

73
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:01,864
I think so.

74
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,034
Hi. Meagan.

75
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,169
I do beauty.
I do high fashion effects.

76
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,571
I also do hair.

77
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:13,108
My ultimate goal
in the effects world is to get

78
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:14,743
to the status of Ve Neill.

79
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,078
I hope you don't get mad
when I win.

80
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,680
No, I'm joking.

81
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,386
My name is Eric Fox,
and I make monsters.

82
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,723
I've worked in indie films
for over 16 years.

83
00:04:27,757 --> 00:04:29,892
Specialize in horror.

84
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:33,629
Specialize in everything that
normal people don't wanna touch.

85
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,430
When I walk away
with that 100 grand,

86
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,366
I can actually be able
to provide for my kids,

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,169
my wife, the way that I should.

88
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:41,870
Got another one.

89
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:44,473
Hi.
Katie.

90
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:46,708
I currently freelance
as a makeup artist.

91
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:49,812
I grew up
in a small coastal town,

92
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:52,114
and I was
kind of like a little rebel.

93
00:04:52,148 --> 00:04:54,650
My dad was an artist.

94
00:04:54,684 --> 00:04:56,819
He passed away due to cancer.

95
00:04:56,853 --> 00:04:59,655
I get a lot of my creativity
from him,

96
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,356
so to think,
if he could see me here,

97
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,759
he would be totally blown away.

98
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:04,960
- Anthony.
- I'm Autumn.

99
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:06,995
As all the contestants
are walking in,

100
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,300
I notice right away
that we are all different.

101
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:14,736
I mean, we obviously have, like,
jocks here with the goth kids.

102
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,439
This is definitely
an interesting group of people.

103
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:18,874
Look who's here!

104
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,510
- Oh!
- Whoo!

105
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:23,545
McKenzie comes walking in,
and everybody goes...

106
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,613
- Hey.
- Oh.

107
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:25,781
Hey, everyone.

108
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:28,884
Welcome aboard the beautiful
<i>Queen Mary</i>

109
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:31,019
and another season of <i>Face Off.</i>

110
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,858
Is this really starting?

111
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:37,659
Somebody, just pinch me
right now.

112
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:40,996
Once upon a time, this was
the grandest ocean liner

113
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,099
in the world,
carrying Hollywood royalty

114
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,636
and true royals
like Queen Elizabeth.

115
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,440
That brings us to your first
foundation challenge.

116
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:54,810
From <i>Shakespeare In Love</i>
to <i>Alice In Wonderland</i>

117
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:57,279
to <i>Cleopatra,</i>
Hollywood films are filled

118
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:01,516
with an incredible array
of memorable queen characters.

119
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:05,921
So your foundation challenge is
to select one of these crowns

120
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:09,224
and use it to inspire
an original queen character

121
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,126
that shows us who you are
as an artist.

122
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,364
I'm going back and forth from
McKenzie to the crown I want.

123
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,666
Because this is the very first chance
to showcase

124
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,568
what I can bring
to this competition.

125
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:22,037
The stakes are huge here,
guys, because the winner

126
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:24,973
will earn immunity
and cannot be eliminated

127
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:27,242
from this week's
spotlight challenge.

128
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:28,944
Hell, yeah.

129
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:31,313
I want to win immunity so bad,

130
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:32,881
because, at the end of the day,
who wants to be safe?

131
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,216
Everyone does.

132
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,519
Before I begin,
I'd like to introduce you

133
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:40,255
to your judge
for today's challenge.

134
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,393
He is an Oscar
and nine-time Emmy award-winning

135
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:45,794
makeup artist.

136
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:49,831
Please say hello to my dad,
Michael Westmore.

137
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:54,569
Holy crap.

138
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:56,972
This guy is a definite pioneer

139
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,807
in the makeup effects industry.

140
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,043
I am so excited.

141
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:02,611
Thank you so much
for being here.

142
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,980
- Pleasure.
- What you guys don't know

143
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:09,451
is he's not only your judge
for this foundation challenge,

144
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:12,888
he's also going to be
your mentor for the season.

145
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,589
Oh, yeah!

146
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:15,624
- Wow.
- That is cool.

147
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:17,159
- So cool.
- He'll be coming

148
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:19,194
by the lab each week
to give you advice

149
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:20,829
and share his years
of experience

150
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:23,265
to help you make
the best creations possible.

151
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:27,436
The one and only wonderful
Michael Westmore.

152
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,705
That definitely
takes my breath away.

153
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:32,174
Being mentored by Michael
Westmore will be amazing.

154
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,277
I'm gonna have the creative
insight that he's had

155
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:36,778
for all these years.

156
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:39,448
I'm looking forward to it too.

157
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:40,849
What are you going
to be looking for

158
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:42,351
from these guys today
in their makeups?

159
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:44,987
Well, the makeup and the crown

160
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:48,724
must complement each other
and tell a story.

161
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:50,459
I want to see the both of them
really working together.

162
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,894
All right, let's bring out
your models.

163
00:07:56,766 --> 00:07:58,533
You have a huge selection
of wardrobe and accessories

164
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:00,235
to help create your characters.

165
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:02,304
And you've got two hours
to complete your makeups.

166
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:08,143
On my go, grab a crown
and get started.

167
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:11,013
Not yet, not yet!

168
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:14,149
Your time starts now!

169
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:16,818
Damn you.

170
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,854
Wow, that sucks.

171
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:20,122
I really wanted the black one.

172
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,624
- It's crazy.
- Everybody wanted that one.

173
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:24,893
It's insanity.

174
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:32,100
My first pick actually
had got taken by Alex,

175
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:34,403
but I'm really happy
with the crown that I got

176
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:36,638
'cause it's basically my style.

177
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:41,276
So my queen's actually gonna be
the queen of lost souls.

178
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,712
Normally when you think queen,
you think beauty,

179
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:48,116
and with this I kinda want
to go for the opposite.

180
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,022
My name's Autumn.

181
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:56,224
I'm a part-time
special effects artist

182
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,260
and full-time
stay-at-home mom.

183
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:01,096
I've been working
on independent films,

184
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,666
doing lots of blood and guts
and death and dismemberments.

185
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,967
And I would like
to work on things

186
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:08,170
that my child
could be proud of,

187
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:11,573
instead of hiding what
I'm doing in the basement.

188
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,442
All right, relax.

189
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:14,643
Breathe.
Okay.

190
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,511
Okay, look up for me.

191
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:18,647
My name is Troy.
I do beauty makeup.

192
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:21,016
From my perspective
in the black community,

193
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,185
makeup is not gangster.

194
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:25,153
Where I'm from,
there's not a whole lot

195
00:09:25,188 --> 00:09:26,421
going on in this industry.

196
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,090
So, as far as I'm concerned,

197
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:29,591
it's my last chance.

198
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,027
All right, let's get
a little bit of this.

199
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:35,363
She's a warrior princess
whose father was murdered,

200
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:36,565
so she revenges his death.

201
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,133
And I'm actually using
a chip brush

202
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,701
to kind of splatter
the makeup onto the skin

203
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:42,904
so it looks more broken up
like a real blood pattern would.

204
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:49,511
- How about the queen of scars?
- Ooh.

205
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,512
My name's Kris.

206
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,280
For the last 15 years,

207
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:55,951
I've been teaching and working
at makeup effects houses,

208
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:57,719
gaining all this knowledge
and experience.

209
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:59,554
Ultimately, being in this
competition,

210
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,158
I just would love to make
my family and kids proud of me.

211
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,600
My name is Eric Zapata.

212
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:13,802
I am the youngest contestant
here.

213
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,370
My friends that I met in film
school,

214
00:10:15,404 --> 00:10:18,073
we decided to open up
our own film production company,

215
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,809
and we do all aspects of film,

216
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:22,310
whether if it's a commercial
or music video.

217
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,913
Glue your ear.

218
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:26,314
I picked this crown over here.

219
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,884
I wanted to pick something
that was a little more real

220
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:30,519
and organic,
so right now I'm just pasting

221
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,754
those prosthetic ears,
and then grease paint

222
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:34,923
so I can go back over them
later on

223
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:36,658
and bring it back
more to her skin tone.

224
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:43,031
I picked this crown
with the feathers on it.

225
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:46,468
And it immediately makes me
think of a warrior queen.

226
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:49,771
That to me is
a personification of myself,

227
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:53,475
because in 2008 I was diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

228
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:57,546
And during that my husband left
and I lost my job,

229
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,614
but I came out of it
a stronger woman.

230
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,083
And for the first time
in my life,

231
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:04,786
I'm finally doing
what makes me happy.

232
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,091
Do you want it
on top of your nose?

233
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:15,297
Guys, we have one hour left!

234
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:20,969
Okay.
My name's Anthony.

235
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,537
I own my own effects company.

236
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:25,840
When I was 16, I created
my first foam latex mask.

237
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,443
I was tired of all the stuff
you saw in the Halloween stores

238
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:29,611
and knew I could do better.

239
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,012
I'm a very competitive person.

240
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,048
I think this will definitely
take me to the next level.

241
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:35,483
I'm trying to create some kind
of an alien queen creature.

242
00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:37,419
She's gonna have a bunny nose.

243
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:39,621
Why not?
We'll see where it goes.

244
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,795
I've worn more makeups
on myself

245
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,163
than I've done on other people.

246
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:49,197
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

247
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:50,532
My name is David Greathouse.

248
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:52,267
Everyone calls me House.

249
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,835
I had a fascination
with monsters

250
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:55,403
probably since the age
of three,

251
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:57,872
so I've spent my whole life
in haunted houses

252
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,207
and low-budget films.

253
00:11:59,242 --> 00:12:01,276
I've scared thousands of people,
thousands.

254
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,879
I chose the golden crown,
and I'm taking influence

255
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:05,947
from the <i>Queen Mary</i> ship,

256
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:07,148
and there's lots of gold
around us,

257
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:09,517
so she's the queen of currency.

258
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:17,859
My queen, she's evil.

259
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,060
She lives, like, in the woods,

260
00:12:19,095 --> 00:12:21,529
kind of like a Halloween kind
of evil queen.

261
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:25,367
And she has, like, all these
injuries in her face and stuff

262
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:26,468
because, like,
she's been through a lot of,

263
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:28,937
like, bar fights.

264
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,239
Man, she wasted
that damn crown.

265
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,543
Five minutes left.

266
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,957
All right, everybody,
time is up!

267
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:51,092
Brushes down.

268
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,628
- Hi, Troy.
- Hello.

269
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,063
Hi, Troy, Mike Westmore.

270
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:56,831
So explain your concept to us.

271
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,001
I wanted to go more
for a warrior type princess.

272
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:02,604
I also wanted
to use my beauty skills

273
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:04,773
as well as my effects skills.

274
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:06,341
It's a nice, subtle
beauty makeup,

275
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:10,512
but you selected a crown
that is so ornate

276
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:13,782
that, to me, it calls out
for more fantasy.

277
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:16,918
- Gotcha.
- I kinda grew up in, like,

278
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:18,486
unicorns and rainbows,
and so I think

279
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:21,056
this really reflects
my kind of style.

280
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,858
I saw that crown and immediately
thought ice queen.

281
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:26,194
And this whole room
and all these costumes,

282
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:28,296
it reminded me of, like,
a masquerade kind of party.

283
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,800
Well, I think, by saying
masquerade, it totally justifies

284
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,134
- what you did around the eyes.
- Yeah.

285
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,969
- Nice job.
- Great, thank you so much.

286
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:36,471
She's the queen of scars,

287
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:39,974
and, instead of blood,
there's magical glitter.

288
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:41,343
Mm-hm.
It doesn't look like a scar.

289
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:44,479
It looks
like a slash of glitter.

290
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:46,381
Give it some third dimension,

291
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:49,451
so that it isn't just laying
on the surface of the skin.

292
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:52,554
Whoa.

293
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:54,422
This is the queen
of absent souls.

294
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:56,591
- I believe it.
- Basically, I didn't get

295
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,859
- a prosthetic--
- You put it all together.

296
00:13:57,893 --> 00:13:59,794
Yeah. This is just pieced--
random pieces to--

297
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,496
I'm a very outside-the-box
thinker.

298
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,331
- I try to...
- Yes, you are.

299
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,033
...go big.

300
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:08,503
I think you've been able to
put together the whole package.

301
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:09,604
Thank you so much.

302
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:11,005
She's a princess,

303
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,141
and her mother was cast
into the underworld,

304
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:15,076
so now she's heir
to the throne.

305
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:16,578
I was trying to keep her
really young,

306
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,747
tried to focus a lot of
the attention on the eyes.

307
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,048
I'm not thrilled
with the makeup,

308
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:21,483
'cause I think
you missed the concept

309
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:23,918
of trying to bring
the crown you selected

310
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:26,020
into her face to be able
to tell a whole story.

311
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:29,057
The paint across her face
is worn like a badge of honor.

312
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:30,158
I really like that.

313
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:32,060
I think
it's a very creative thought.

314
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:34,028
And how does this
represent you as an artist?

315
00:14:34,063 --> 00:14:35,597
I've been through a lot of
trials and tribulations

316
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:38,533
in my life, so I love to create
my inner strength

317
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:41,369
and put it into a makeup.

318
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:42,570
Well, I think you did that.

319
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:44,372
I think you were very successful
in doing it.

320
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:45,673
I love playing with color.

321
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,243
I'm a painter,
so that's kinda why I tried

322
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:50,612
bringing as much color into her
as much as possible.

323
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,847
I think you've done
such a good job

324
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,649
this could actually shoot
on film.

325
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:55,917
Oh, thank you.

326
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:57,919
I am so humbled and taken back

327
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,789
and almost geeked out to the
fact that he said what he said.

328
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:02,524
But looking around and just
seeing for the first time

329
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:05,994
what everybody's capable of
and trying

330
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:09,497
to measure up how mine
compares with everybody else,

331
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:11,232
some of them
are really beautiful.

332
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:13,234
I feel a little intimidated.

333
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:18,273
All right, so who created
our top looks of the day?

334
00:15:18,307 --> 00:15:19,541
Eric F.

335
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:22,811
It was a very creative,
out-of-the-box makeup

336
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:25,780
that showed us
who you really are as an artist.

337
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:28,450
- Thank you so much.
- Anthony...

338
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:31,953
your makeup was the total
package from head to toe.

339
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,555
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

340
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,759
Jenna, your makeup utilized
your personal strength.

341
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,994
It was very subtle
and well applied.

342
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,696
That's a real honor.
Thank you.

343
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,901
Okay, dad, who is the winner
of this foundation challenge?

344
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:49,304
The winner is...

345
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,109
Coming up...

346
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:56,845
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

347
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,446
This is looking like sabotage.

348
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:00,715
I'm really blown away.

349
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:09,350
Okay, dad, who is the winner

350
00:16:09,384 --> 00:16:11,685
of our first
foundation challenge?

351
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,188
The winner is...

352
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,959
Anthony.

353
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:20,127
Thank you so much.

354
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,996
Thank you.

355
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,597
Whoo!
Good job.

356
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:25,733
Yours was the only piece
I think

357
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,768
that could be put on film
and literally work.

358
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:29,303
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

359
00:16:29,337 --> 00:16:30,971
I can't believe it.

360
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,172
I'm coming out of the gates
with immunity.

361
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,574
Just means that I'm not
gonna get kicked off

362
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:37,011
this next challenge,
and that is huge.

363
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:39,913
All right, why don't you guys
go check out your new house?

364
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:42,950
I'll see you tomorrow for
your first spotlight challenge.

365
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:45,619
Thank you.

366
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,763
- Oh, my God. This is awesome.
- Wow!

367
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,498
- This is cute.
- Sweet.

368
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:58,732
Oh, my God.

369
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,167
Wow, this is where
we're gonna live?

370
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:04,171
I'm super stoked.

371
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:05,773
- Wow.
- Bigger room here.

372
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,308
- Awesome.
- Whoo!

373
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:10,477
- Check at the view.
- The house is super cool.

374
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:12,413
Now I wanna see the rest.

375
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,448
There's just a room
that's got pictures

376
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:16,283
of all the past contestants.

377
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,952
And just knowing
that you're gonna be

378
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:22,022
one of them
on that wall one day.

379
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,060
It's beautiful, 'cause it's
on top of this big mountain,

380
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:28,896
and you have
this beautiful view.

381
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,398
- The winner has to toast it.
- All right, guys.

382
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,967
- This is gonna be an adventure.
- Here, here.

383
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:34,968
- Cheers!
- To <i>Face Off,</i> guys.

384
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:38,038
To <i>Face Off.</i>

385
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,911
The morning
of the spotlight challenge,

386
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:45,079
we're walking down the street,

387
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:48,282
and we see
this beautiful cathedral.

388
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:50,884
Amazing, amazing architecture.

389
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,121
And I'm so excited.

390
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,590
I'm thinking,
what could the challenge be?

391
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,596
Wow.

392
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,172
Welcome
to St. John's Cathedral.

393
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:16,243
This masterpiece
was built in 1925

394
00:18:16,277 --> 00:18:19,113
and is one of
the most recognizable examples

395
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:22,649
of gothic-style architecture
in the city of Los Angeles.

396
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,385
It's gorgeous.

397
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,687
Now, not only are cathedrals
a place of worship,

398
00:18:26,721 --> 00:18:28,722
but they have
also historically been

399
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,492
the place
where royalty are crowned.

400
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:34,161
Your first spotlight challenge

401
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:36,530
will start
right where we left off.

402
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:38,432
You've already created a queen.

403
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,067
Now it's time
to make your king.

404
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,936
However,
this is no ordinary king.

405
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:44,605
You'll be making a mythical
creature featured in films

406
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:47,875
like <i>The Hobbit, Labyrinth,</i>

407
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,878
and even
the <i>Harry Potter</i> series.

408
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:55,516
Your spotlight challenge
is to create a Goblin King.

409
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,017
Yes.

410
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,986
Many things are running
through my mind.

411
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,155
Goblins are obviously
very scary creatures,

412
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:02,756
so I'm really getting excited.

413
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,459
But what would a king be
without his kingdom?

414
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:09,230
The ancient world
shown on this map

415
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,900
has been divided
into geographic regions.

416
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:15,569
Your Goblin Kings
must be physically influenced

417
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:16,971
by the lands that they rule.

418
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:21,041
You're going to be working
in teams of two.

419
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,778
Your teams have already been
randomly selected, and they are...

420
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,915
Jenna and Eric F.

421
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:31,485
Me and Jenna were top looks
in the foundation challenge,

422
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,087
so I know we're gonna nail this.

423
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:35,155
Michael and Troy.

424
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,491
Alex and Wayne.

425
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,293
Alam and Kris.

426
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:42,896
Anthony and Meagan.

427
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,165
In my mind it's, like, really
great that I'm working with him,

428
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,533
because he is
an amazing painter,

429
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:49,069
but at the same time
he has immunity.

430
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,438
Katie and House.

431
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,807
Eric Z and Autumn.

432
00:19:53,842 --> 00:19:57,144
Will you please go ahead
and stand next to your teammate?

433
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,615
Team one, you're up first.

434
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,386
- Desert.
- Team two.

435
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,389
Ooh.

436
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,391
- Volcanic.
- Alex and Wayne.

437
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:13,027
Swamp.

438
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:15,663
- Alam and Kris.
- Our choice is the forest.

439
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:16,964
Anthony and Meagan.

440
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:22,202
- Definitely the mountains.
- Arctic.

441
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:24,672
Jungle.

442
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:26,073
And before you leave here
today, I want you

443
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,175
to take some inspiration
from this incredible cathedral

444
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:30,644
and get started
on your sketches.

445
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,012
When you're done,
head back to the lab,

446
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,281
select your models,
and get to work.

447
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,417
Good luck.

448
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,755
I think he needs a staff.

449
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,324
He needs a staff and his tunic
will be like his cape.

450
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:44,725
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Yeah, yeah.

451
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,560
That'd be awesome.
Me and Troy sit down to sketch,

452
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:48,929
because the first step
in creating any makeup

453
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:51,565
is to get a good, solid design.

454
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,435
We need dark black around the
eyes and black inside the eyes.

455
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:55,502
That'd be creepy.

456
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:59,139
Our concept
is a volcanic dark king

457
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,974
who doesn't have a kingdom,

458
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,977
so what he does is
takes over other kingdoms.

459
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,047
That looks pretty cool, maybe
for some armor or something?

460
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:13,087
Right now we're just working
on overall visual concept.

461
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:15,589
We're going
for a very dry, emaciated look.

462
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:18,192
Lots of sand textures.

463
00:21:18,226 --> 00:21:20,260
- Very heavy cracking--
- Cracking.

464
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,064
We are doing
the mountain Goblin King.

465
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,466
There's so much you can do
with mountains.

466
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,900
There's such an aesthetic
about it.

467
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,203
And I'm thinking
about how his heart

468
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:31,638
is made out of stone
and he's so evil

469
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:33,240
that it's just consuming him

470
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:35,542
and turning him completely
into stone from the inside out.

471
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:38,512
Our Goblin King is the forest.

472
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:43,550
He's going to be a wood texture
with a pine tree beard.

473
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,652
Kris really know
what he's doing.

474
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:48,288
He's been around, like,
long time,

475
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:53,727
and he comes up with this really
good tree-looking face.

476
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:58,232
So, like, why don't
we do branches for a crown

477
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,500
and wood arms?

478
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:00,601
Love your sketch.

479
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,603
I wish I could draw like that.

480
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,972
What rules the swamp
is usually alligators

481
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,740
- and crocodiles--
- Exactly.

482
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,410
We're both from Florida,
so I think right off the bat

483
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:10,944
that we knew what we wanted.

484
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:13,847
He's gonna be this gator king
of the swamp,

485
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:15,682
so he's gonna have
a lot of, like, scale

486
00:22:15,717 --> 00:22:18,519
and a lot of texture to him.

487
00:22:18,553 --> 00:22:20,053
Like, even if we did, like,
some type of fin

488
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,490
- that was webbed around it.
- I like that.

489
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,125
All right, guys, that's time.

490
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,327
Let's rock this.

491
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:30,564
We leave the cathedral, and we
can't wait to get to the lab.

492
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:38,272
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

493
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,240
Wow.

494
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,410
Walking into the lab, I feel
like a kid in a candy store.

495
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,813
- They have everything here.
- I'm stoked.

496
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,749
- I love Make Up For Ever.
- Yeah.

497
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:50,684
Lifecasts.

498
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:55,055
The lifecast is a stone copy
of the model's face,

499
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:57,724
and first thing we have to do
is choose our models.

500
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,495
We're doing a wood creature,
so we pick Maleek

501
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,265
because he has
a nice dark skin tone like wood.

502
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,503
Our concept of a Goblin King
is to make him out of wood,

503
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:12,272
very tribal,
kind of like a tiki warrior.

504
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:16,376
Nice to meet you, Tim.

505
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,914
We only have five hours.

506
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:24,751
I'm gonna start laying the
foundation of wed clay on this.

507
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:26,954
The next step
to creating a prosthetic

508
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:30,324
is putting clay on a cast
of the model's face.

509
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:34,027
Do you think this should
all be one piece or two pieces?

510
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:35,729
- One piece.
- One piece, okay.

511
00:23:35,763 --> 00:23:38,332
Our plan of attack
is sculpt the face,

512
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:41,068
sculpt the chest today.

513
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:45,772
We'll need razor blades
to start shaving down icicles.

514
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:46,907
Yeah, yeah.
The concept that we're going for

515
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,208
is that he's
kind of this, like,

516
00:23:48,243 --> 00:23:51,178
decaying king
of this ice kingdom.

517
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:54,381
The first thing I start doing
is start hacking away

518
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:55,649
at all these foam tubes

519
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,751
that we're going to turn
into the icicle hands.

520
00:23:57,785 --> 00:24:02,789
And house begins sculpting
the face, and he's really fast.

521
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:04,958
Immediately I'm sculpting it
in mind

522
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:07,694
for it being a silicone
appliance, because it needs

523
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:11,064
the icy translucency
that silicone provides.

524
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,035
I'm gonna get started.

525
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:16,036
Okay.

526
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,773
Fuck, dude.

527
00:24:19,807 --> 00:24:23,477
- Damn, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

528
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:24,778
He drops it.

529
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:26,580
There's not, like,
three casts back there

530
00:24:26,614 --> 00:24:27,614
that we can work on.

531
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:28,849
This is the only one.

532
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:31,351
Fuck.
Oh, my God.

533
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,519
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

534
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,555
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Okay, I can fix this.

535
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,457
It's all good.

536
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:40,961
Anthony has immunity,
and he broke our form.

537
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:42,496
That sucks.

538
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,199
And it could be my ass
that's going home.

539
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,046
I'm sculpting the chest,

540
00:24:50,203 --> 00:24:51,878
and we're adding
some nice pecs,

541
00:24:52,003 --> 00:24:53,888
which I was having some
difficulty with...

542
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,992
What I wanted was a full front
picture of somebody's body,

543
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,615
that's what I wanted.

544
00:24:58,724 --> 00:24:59,796
Where is Beefcake, man?

545
00:24:59,894 --> 00:25:02,558
- Yeah. - He's, you know,
take out his shirt for a sec.

546
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,676
Beefcake is Wayne.

547
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,059
I believe he was
a football player.

548
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:14,906
He is very muscular...
He is like your dream beefcake.

549
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,450
That's one studly dude.

550
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,411
I'm gonna get started.

551
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:24,848
- Fuck, dude.
- Damn.

552
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:29,286
So we only get this one cast,
and Anthony drops it.

553
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,754
- Such an ass.
- I just totally

554
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:31,922
did not mean that.

555
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:33,890
And it's the nose
that he broke.

556
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:35,659
This is so bad.

557
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:36,827
It's good.
I can fix this.

558
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:37,828
He's gonna have to handle it.

559
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,529
I can't--
I have to walk away.

560
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:41,898
I can't believe he dropped it.

561
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:43,734
- Fuck.
- What happened?

562
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:45,535
He dropped his life--
the lifecast.

563
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,038
It's 'cause he has immunity.
I told Meagan that would happen.

564
00:25:48,072 --> 00:25:50,374
All I'm thinking is
this is looking like sabotage.

565
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:52,042
Fuck.

566
00:25:52,076 --> 00:25:53,777
In this moment, I can't panic.

567
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,646
I can't think
about anything else

568
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,849
other than fixing this nose.

569
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:01,485
So I immediately glue
that big chunk to his nose,

570
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,255
and I start sculpting the other
side with palmer's epoxy

571
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,857
which hardens in about five
minutes to match his form

572
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:08,558
the best that I possibly can.

573
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,327
- That looks good, Anthony.
- Thank you.

574
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,728
Told you I'll fix it.

575
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:14,831
I fixed it, but it sets us back
about a half hour.

576
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:17,501
It means that I have to go
and sculpt that much faster

577
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:20,137
to get this face done.

578
00:26:24,008 --> 00:26:26,176
That's looking good, man.

579
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:31,181
I know I wanna sculpt the face.

580
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,750
I have Eric start
sculpting out the arms.

581
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:35,786
- This is just the wrong angle--
- Right, right, right.

582
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,621
Look, the muscles,
they go this way.

583
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,289
I'm struggling a little bit

584
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:42,259
because I feel like I'm a little
underestimated by my partner.

585
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:44,428
Yeah, you actually can cut
that whole piece off right here.

586
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:45,796
That's gonna be way thick.

587
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,964
Eric is wonderful to work with.

588
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,267
He has no pride.
He's completely humble.

589
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:53,770
- You're such a good boy.
- What am I, some dog here?

590
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:55,772
It's going very well.

591
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:01,211
I think we're the first ones
to be making our molds.

592
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,980
- Yep.
- After your sculpture is done,

593
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:05,382
you make a mold.

594
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,050
You take
a cement-like substance,

595
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,585
brush it onto your sculpture.

596
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:12,422
Once the substance hardens,
you can clean out the clay

597
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:16,526
and then fill it with your foam
latex, silicone, or latex.

598
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:21,098
That's what happens when you
put two bad asses together.

599
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:23,266
Hell, yeah.

600
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:27,771
That's freakin' incredible.

601
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:29,206
Just all that, like, dude,
look at that.

602
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,207
Thanks, man, that means a lot.

603
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,476
In the time that you did it.

604
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,211
The day's almost over,

605
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:36,580
and right now
everything's going really well.

606
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,348
Looking around the room, like,
yeah, a lot of people

607
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:41,418
have a lot of, like,
hands and feet stuff going on,

608
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,420
but our sculpture
is definitely full of detail

609
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,922
that they don't have.

610
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:03,306
Time's up everybody!

611
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:05,108
It is extremely intimidating

612
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,543
that Eric and Jenna
are the only team

613
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:08,678
that have their molds
ready to go.

614
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:10,914
It seems like it will take
a team of four or five people

615
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:12,215
to do the work
that they're doing,

616
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,651
and there's just two of them.

617
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:28,965
Yes.

618
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,335
So it's day two in the lab,
and we have a lot to do.

619
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,537
It looks so freakin' cool.

620
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,771
- Like my six-pack?
- Yeah.

621
00:28:34,806 --> 00:28:35,939
I've been working out.

622
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:37,040
Eric starts working
on the skull

623
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:40,143
that's gonna go on the crown,

624
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:44,981
and I start sculpting
in wed clay the skin.

625
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:48,318
Our plan of attack, since we
have so much skin to cover,

626
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,388
we can pour up large sheets
that we can wrap

627
00:28:51,422 --> 00:28:53,590
around the actor
to give the full body

628
00:28:53,624 --> 00:28:57,227
that really cool sandy, cracked
desert floor look.

629
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:59,062
Yeah!
That looks great.

630
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:01,131
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

631
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:11,842
What if we made the crown...

632
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,543
like a volcano?

633
00:29:13,578 --> 00:29:14,711
Our king needs a crown.

634
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:18,849
You can't be a king
without a crown.

635
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,217
And I assume--
what's a volcano?

636
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,785
Volcanoes are pointy-shaped,

637
00:29:21,819 --> 00:29:23,386
so from there
I try to figure out,

638
00:29:23,421 --> 00:29:25,889
how am I going to make
this crown?

639
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:32,395
I'm gonna get some silicone.

640
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,698
This is a risk doing this makeup
out of silicone.

641
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,966
The weight of the silicone

642
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,300
might be too much
for the makeup.

643
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:39,369
Foam latex is the tried
and true material.

644
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,604
Silicone, when done right,

645
00:29:40,638 --> 00:29:44,274
can be stunningly beautiful,
but do it wrong,

646
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:47,110
and you may not have
another chance at it.

647
00:29:47,144 --> 00:29:48,945
Hey, guys!
We're here to do a walk-through

648
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,214
and let you get
some tips and advice.

649
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:53,216
All right.

650
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:55,685
Having Michael Westmore
as a mentor is awesome.

651
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,655
It gives me confidence knowing
that I'm going to have someone

652
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:00,924
like him guiding me
through this process.

653
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:03,727
We're doing a headpiece,
a chest piece,

654
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,729
and an arm as well--

655
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:07,564
- And a face.
- It's going to look

656
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,633
like there's a mountain
coming out of his heart.

657
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,802
- Some rocks forming.
- You've got a great direction.

658
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,404
One thing that's gonna be
very important here

659
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,739
is your paint job.

660
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,707
Do a little sample
before you jump into something.

661
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,342
You don't realize it
until you really take a rock

662
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:20,677
and you look at it
and you realize

663
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:23,513
how many colors are really
in there, light and dark.

664
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:25,181
- Thank you.
- This is the Goblin King

665
00:30:25,216 --> 00:30:29,686
of the Arctic,
and this is a shot of his face.

666
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,021
His face will be in silicone.

667
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:32,923
Are you planning
on coloring it a certain way?

668
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,958
Yeah.
Whites and blues underneath.

669
00:30:34,992 --> 00:30:36,126
A lot of intrinsic painting.

670
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,795
Ice has so much depth
and luminosity to it.

671
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:41,064
- You might try a little thing--
- Like mixing it just right in.

672
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:43,667
With glitter or if you have
something small

673
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:46,136
like a fish scale.

674
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,570
We are going

675
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:50,974
almost
like a tiki jungle warrior.

676
00:30:51,008 --> 00:30:53,276
We have him
all carved out of wood.

677
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:56,012
I have knots for ears
that go up into points

678
00:30:56,047 --> 00:30:57,814
that are almost like a crown.

679
00:30:57,848 --> 00:31:00,083
It looks great here in clay
but once it gets painted,

680
00:31:00,117 --> 00:31:02,719
all of a sudden,
it could flatten out.

681
00:31:02,753 --> 00:31:05,922
Any texture we don't achieve
with the sculpture, we should go

682
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:07,590
- in with paint and just--
- Yes.

683
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,792
Try to create as much depth
as possible with paint.

684
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:09,826
Yeah, yeah.

685
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,594
A brush
that has nice long furrow on it.

686
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,363
Okay.

687
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:15,598
We're incorporating elements
that you would find

688
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:16,599
in the desert such
as, like, tumbleweeds--

689
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:17,600
- Animal bones.

690
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:19,502
What are you gonna use
for a crown?

691
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:21,738
For a crown we're actually
using part of the tumbleweeds,

692
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:23,273
and, when it's tied in,
it'll have, like,

693
00:31:23,307 --> 00:31:25,608
a really cool, like,
gold crown effect.

694
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:28,378
- Excellent.
- He's pretty much wood,

695
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:31,147
and we're gonna build
a stick crown for him.

696
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,649
Wow, very nice.

697
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,185
When they walk, though,
these are going to flatten.

698
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:37,253
I'm sure they'll probably move
and bend a little bit.

699
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,556
It would help putting a wire
coat hanger down on a few of 'em

700
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,491
maybe, 'cause a few of 'em

701
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,892
might just help the rest of 'em
as a bridge.

702
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,527
That's a good idea.

703
00:31:44,562 --> 00:31:46,930
He's a king with no kingdom
who also hunts other kings.

704
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:48,765
- Oh.
- He's conquering

705
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,266
the other kings
in this challenge in a way.

706
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:51,534
It's almost a crown,
but it's like a big volcanic--

707
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:52,769
volcano on his head.

708
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,004
And then possibly give him
a shield as well.

709
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:55,705
You've picked a character
where you have

710
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,374
a lot of detailing
that you have to work on.

711
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,776
Yeah, we wanted
to kinda keep it pretty simple

712
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,078
as far as how many pieces
we actually had to apply.

713
00:32:02,113 --> 00:32:03,380
- Mm-hmm.
- So we can concentrate

714
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:05,148
the rest of that time
on the actual paint.

715
00:32:05,182 --> 00:32:06,182
Good.

716
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:07,884
- Wow.
- Oh, wow.

717
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:10,854
I love the protrusions
that you've carried through

718
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,590
from the back here
into the mold here,

719
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:15,525
the alligator theme
and the alligator skull.

720
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,893
Color-wise,
you gonna bring any...

721
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:19,562
- We're going...
- Greens into that?

722
00:32:19,597 --> 00:32:20,864
Very reptilian.
Yeah, we're going-- the greens.

723
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:22,265
- Real alligator.
- Yeah.

724
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:24,000
And, you know, I think
it's a good idea too.

725
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,435
- Yeah.
- As much painting

726
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:28,171
as you can do,
it's gonna be important.

727
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:31,307
What are your thoughts overall
with everybody, first off?

728
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:33,243
Overall, I think
everybody's doing a great job,

729
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:36,046
- although I have a favorite.
- Mm?

730
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,380
With the alligator makeup.

731
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,215
They're doing a beautiful job
doing it.

732
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,984
I'm concerned
about how they complete

733
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:42,886
their detailing
and their painting.

734
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,020
Okay, is there anybody

735
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:46,356
that you are definitely
concerned about?

736
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,824
- Mostly is the Arctic.
- Really?

737
00:32:47,858 --> 00:32:49,993
Yeah, any time you get
into ice and snow,

738
00:32:50,027 --> 00:32:52,062
you could run into problems.

739
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,797
It has to have a sheen to it.

740
00:32:53,831 --> 00:32:56,499
It has to sell a different--
a whole different texture.

741
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:58,334
That's interesting.

742
00:32:58,369 --> 00:32:59,803
Then we have jungle.

743
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,538
Wood always concerns me,

744
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:05,742
because it really has
to look like wood,

745
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,945
or it doesn't.

746
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:11,381
So their problem again is
going to be in the paint job.

747
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:12,682
- Mm.
- To be able to sell

748
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:15,351
the idea
that it is a piece of wood,

749
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,220
not just
a brown fantasy character.

750
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:21,691
All right, guys,
it's looking great!

751
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:24,260
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Thank you.

752
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,729
Bye.

753
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,704
It's moving.

754
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:36,439
It's time to open the mold.

755
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:39,242
All the way out.
I wanna take it real slow.

756
00:33:39,276 --> 00:33:41,344
And I notice
that it's kind of sticky.

757
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:43,546
- Hold it there.
- Uh-huh.

758
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:50,153
I'm holding the head cast,
and he's pulling the negative.

759
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:54,124
I'm really nervous.
Not sure what's going to happen.

760
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,626
Finally, the whole thing
just kind of comes off,

761
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,430
and it's this gorgeous ice blue
silicone prosthetic,

762
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:03,066
and it turned out exactly
the way that we wanted it,

763
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,334
and I'm like, "thank God."

764
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:06,369
- We have a piece.
- Yes.

765
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:13,243
I want to do a latex bald cap,
and there aren't any.

766
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:15,712
How the hell am I gonna
build my own friggin'--

767
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:17,247
So I use the mannequin head.

768
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:19,415
I'm, like, I'll just build
a latex bald cap.

769
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,085
I'm painting it on--
Fuck.

770
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:24,587
It's running off.

771
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:26,356
I'm frustrated.
I just walk away.

772
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,758
They don't have
fucking latex bald caps.

773
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:31,561
- Make one.
- I'm tr-- can't.

774
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:33,663
Autumn has a meltdown
about the bald caps,

775
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,799
and I need her to come down
from that very quickly

776
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,169
so that we can
get what we need done.

777
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,437
It won't fucking set up
on the fucking mannequin.

778
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:43,139
I'm, like, furious over it.

779
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,507
Right now, let's worry
about getting these open

780
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,142
- and cleaned up.
- Yeah, exactly.

781
00:34:46,177 --> 00:34:48,411
'Cause I don't know how we're
gonna put the crown on, though.

782
00:34:48,445 --> 00:34:53,082
Autumn's freaking out, and
Eric Z's cool as a cucumber.

783
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:55,185
Somebody on the team has to be
the voice of reason.

784
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,288
That's my partner!

785
00:34:58,322 --> 00:35:00,023
All right, so we need

786
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,491
to start painting these babies,
don't we?

787
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:04,194
We got our latex port up.

788
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,029
We're ready
to start base coating.

789
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:08,431
Jenna!

790
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:13,703
So I look up, and I'm tripping
out because it's just too dark.

791
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,706
This isn't the color
that we originally planned on.

792
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,141
Jenna!

793
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:19,709
That's really dark.

794
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,311
I'm just getting
some more depth inhere.

795
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,879
We have less than half an hour.

796
00:35:22,913 --> 00:35:25,315
After all this hard work,
I'm worried

797
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:28,551
this could be
a complete disaster.

798
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:36,981
So day two is almost over,

799
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:38,716
and I start painting
our skin pieces,

800
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,084
make 'em a little darker,

801
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:42,786
and then I hear
Eric go, "Jenna!"

802
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,355
Jenna!

803
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:47,725
I run over to the booth,
and I'm kinda panicked.

804
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:49,860
- That's really dark.
- I know.

805
00:35:49,895 --> 00:35:51,795
I'm just getting some more depth
in there.

806
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,131
In my opinion it's not too dark,
'cause I know we have

807
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,201
to go darker to get
the look we're wanting

808
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:59,203
and the definition
in the cracks.

809
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:00,604
It looks like our undertones.

810
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,206
I'm worried at this point.

811
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,908
We have less than half an hour.

812
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:09,246
- All we can do is forge ahead.
- It'll be okay.

813
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:13,217
Yeah.
I see it working.

814
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:23,327
I think the basecoatark
was a good idea.

815
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:24,461
Yeah, no, it was great.

816
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:26,063
You know,
after final inspection,

817
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:27,498
you know what,
she got it right.

818
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:29,500
- I'm stoked.
- I was worried, though,

819
00:36:29,534 --> 00:36:31,201
'cause you had this look
on your face like, "uh-oh.

820
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:32,369
Not what I wanted to do."

821
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,205
Jenna has some great points,
you know.

822
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,942
It needed to be a lot darker
so, when we brushed

823
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:41,111
the lighter color over, it's
just gonna pop a little bit more

824
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:42,446
and add a lot more contrast.

825
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,581
- This is all teamwork right here.
- Yeah.

826
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:47,384
Hey, brushes down, guys.

827
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,887
It is time to go home.

828
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,555
Our hands stick together.

829
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:54,625
Tomorrow is huge.

830
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,593
We might have
all of our pieces done,

831
00:36:56,628 --> 00:37:00,798
but, if we don't get it applied,
I don't know.

832
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:03,400
At this point,
it's anybody's game.

833
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,876
Wow, that was a long day,
wasn't it?

834
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:17,815
When we get back to the house,
everybody's feeling tired.

835
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,883
Michael and I sit down
and have a conversation

836
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:22,019
so we both are
on the same page.

837
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:24,688
Painting is gonna be
the main, main focus tomorrow.

838
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:26,991
I think we're sitting
pretty good, I think.

839
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,259
- I think so too.
- Troy tells me he's noticing

840
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:31,695
all the other artists
have so much going on.

841
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,863
And that's
what we didn't wanna do.

842
00:37:32,897 --> 00:37:34,231
We didn't wanna have
so much going on

843
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:35,432
that we have no time for it.

844
00:37:35,467 --> 00:37:37,968
Everybody else has,
like, a million pieces.

845
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,503
You're gonna run out of time
to paint them.

846
00:37:39,537 --> 00:37:40,871
- Yeah.
- I think a few people

847
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,139
might be in over their heads.

848
00:37:42,173 --> 00:37:43,741
I definitely think
we've got an advantage.

849
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,342
I feel like, you know,
that my brother's given me

850
00:37:45,377 --> 00:37:47,211
this knowledge,
and I'm gonna use it.

851
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:49,246
I trained side-by-side
with my brother,

852
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,082
and I gotta take any advantage
I can in this competition.

853
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:53,484
All right, man.
We're gonna do it.

854
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,886
- Yeah.
- I'm nervous.

855
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,221
I think right now
everyone's stressing

856
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,489
more than they have to.

857
00:37:58,523 --> 00:37:59,890
We have, like, a lot of,

858
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:02,192
like, applying and stuff,
and we're debating

859
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,028
whether or not to just apply

860
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:08,465
the actual face
in the one hour last looks.

861
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,535
Personally, like, me and
Anthony are gonna do that last.

862
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:14,071
Everyone seems really
confident and everything,

863
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:15,606
but I just wanna be, like,
"don't you guys realize

864
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,308
"that someone's gonna get kicked
off, and it could be you,

865
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,110
it could be me,
it could be anyone?"

866
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:21,578
So to leave after three days

867
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:23,781
would be probably
the worst thing ever.

868
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,294
- Nice.
- Oh, yeah, it's thick.

869
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:38,962
So it's application day.

870
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:43,667
We have four hours in the lab,
and we still have a lot to do.

871
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:46,303
Like, Wayne wants
to now fabricate these cuffs,

872
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:49,206
but now I'm starting
to get nervous

873
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,644
that we might run out of time
with this.

874
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:55,779
Hi, nice to meet you.

875
00:38:55,814 --> 00:38:57,948
- I'm Alex.
- We're literally gonna just

876
00:38:57,982 --> 00:38:59,249
have you sit there
for the moment,

877
00:38:59,284 --> 00:39:00,717
'cause we're gonna start
pre-painting stuff.

878
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:01,952
Right now we need to paint.

879
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:03,787
We need to make sure
everything's pre-painted

880
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:07,424
before it gets on him
because I really don't want him

881
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:10,394
sitting in the makeup
longer than he needs to.

882
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:12,896
It's nice.

883
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:17,768
Kris and I have a lot to do.

884
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:19,436
We have to make a crown.

885
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:20,637
We have to make the staff.

886
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:23,273
So, ah, I'm panicked.

887
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:34,318
I needed to get my shield done.

888
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:38,388
I need to get my staff done,
the crown done, and the costume.

889
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:40,290
- How you coming along, Troy?
- Good.

890
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:42,025
Putting-- laying down the wire,
and I'm gonna spray orange

891
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,895
all over it,
and should be pretty quick.

892
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:47,297
Troy's still over there
painting the face and chest.

893
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:50,601
He's a little more relaxed
than I feel that he should be.

894
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:52,769
And now I'm starting to sweat,
because Troy

895
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:55,038
still hasn't
picked up the pace.

896
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:01,011
- It's like one super edge.
- Yeah.

897
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,280
I'm not happy with
the application around the lips.

898
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:05,082
Some of the edges on it
are a little thick,

899
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:06,850
so I'm having a bit
of difficulty.

900
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:09,853
Let's see
where that other piece fits

901
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:12,022
before we start gluing it.

902
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:13,590
We are still applying the piece
when I'm looking around,

903
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,792
and I see everybody has paint,
and we're the only people

904
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:17,194
that don't have paint
on our model yet.

905
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:18,829
- That's good.
- We need to put

906
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:21,765
some kind of paint on this guy
before we leave.

907
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,433
I do the hands
and the feet now, right?

908
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:25,435
Yeah, yeah.

909
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,971
'Cause I wanna do
so much detail on him,

910
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:29,806
you know what I'm saying?

911
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:32,142
We're planning on painting
a lot of wood grain in

912
00:40:32,177 --> 00:40:34,178
and hoping we have time

913
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:35,812
to really pop out the detail
on this.

914
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:37,981
Dude, an hour's
like nothing, man.

915
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:39,716
That's kinda scaring me now.

916
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:42,486
I'm a little nervous
because we don't have time

917
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,421
for what we have planned.

918
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,424
Troy, within 30 minutes
we can start getting this

919
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,425
on him, you think?

920
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,661
Yeah, I think so.

921
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:02,472
Um, volcano guy right over
there with the 39 minutes left,

922
00:41:02,507 --> 00:41:04,541
and he's got a chest on.

923
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:09,813
We're almost done
with the four hours at the lab,

924
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:12,950
so going into last looks
really all we need to do

925
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:16,119
is touch up around the edges,
finish painting his actual body,

926
00:41:16,154 --> 00:41:17,688
try to get our contacts in,

927
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:19,890
also working
on distressing the teeth.

928
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:22,726
That's a lot to do, but I am
feeling like we can get it done.

929
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:30,067
Everybody, we got two minutes!

930
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,507
Right now I'm feeling
kind of nervous

931
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,544
because we still don't have
any paint on our model.

932
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,080
That's time!
Grab your stuff, let's go.

933
00:41:43,114 --> 00:41:45,082
We're gonna have
to rely on last looks

934
00:41:45,116 --> 00:41:47,184
to really pull this together.

935
00:41:47,218 --> 00:41:49,853
I mean, we're fast, but I
don't know if we're that fast.

936
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:53,799
Coming up...

937
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:56,159
- You did an exceptional job.
- Oh, my God.

938
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:57,461
I really loved it.

939
00:41:57,495 --> 00:42:00,731
What you just said,
that is not okay.

940
00:42:06,301 --> 00:42:09,036
We only have an hour in last
looks to pull this together.

941
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:11,873
As long as we can get the paint
on there quickly,

942
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:15,042
I think we'll be okay.

943
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:16,778
I'm gonna worry
about the mouth and the eyes.

944
00:42:16,812 --> 00:42:19,080
We are trying to get the mouth
to stay down,

945
00:42:19,114 --> 00:42:20,948
and it's not working.

946
00:42:20,983 --> 00:42:23,918
The area around the mouth
looks like a horror show,

947
00:42:23,952 --> 00:42:26,521
- and not the good way.
- That's not gonna stay on.

948
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:27,955
Putting on the crown
is a nightmare.

949
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,290
Oh, lord.

950
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:30,558
The last thing
Michael and I want

951
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:32,260
is for the model
to walk on stage

952
00:42:32,294 --> 00:42:34,996
and his crown and wig fall off.

953
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,466
After this wing, will you mix
the base colors?

954
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,567
Yeah.

955
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,235
- Yeah, I'm gonna mix the colors.
- Sweet.

956
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,037
Wayne's moving
down the back piece,

957
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,907
but, dude,
we gotta get painting.

958
00:42:48,076 --> 00:42:49,944
At this point,
I just think we have to get

959
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:52,480
some kind of color on him.

960
00:42:52,514 --> 00:42:54,081
I don't know how much time
we have left.

961
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:55,283
Is there a clock?

962
00:42:55,317 --> 00:42:59,487
It's a mad race,
and time is going so fast.

963
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:01,189
Five minutes.

964
00:43:01,223 --> 00:43:04,492
Way faster than anything
I had ever imagined.

965
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:13,367
Time's up!

966
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:17,038
- That's it.
- I'm sweating bullets.

967
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:20,341
This is really not the product
that I wanted to show.

968
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:34,388
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

969
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:37,325
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

970
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,860
Say hello to your judges--

971
00:43:38,894 --> 00:43:42,630
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick...

972
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:43,631
Good evening.

973
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,399
- Hello.
- Hi.

974
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,502
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

975
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:49,770
Well, gang,
welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

976
00:43:49,805 --> 00:43:51,005
Thank you.

977
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:53,774
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page...

978
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:55,910
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

979
00:43:55,944 --> 00:43:57,979
And joining our panel
this week,

980
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,214
he is an iconic actor,

981
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:02,817
starring in some of Hollywood's
biggest franchises

982
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:05,253
including
the <i>Indiana Jones</i> films

983
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:08,122
and <i>The Lord Of The Rings</i>
trilogy.

984
00:44:08,156 --> 00:44:11,993
Please give a warm welcome
to John Rhys-Davies.

985
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:18,132
To you.

986
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,301
John, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

987
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:21,903
Thanks for having me.

988
00:44:21,937 --> 00:44:23,604
I loved him
in <i>Raiders Of The Lost Ark.</i>

989
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:25,940
He's worked on several films

990
00:44:25,974 --> 00:44:27,975
where he's worn
prosthetic makeup.

991
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:29,877
It's really awesome
that he's our guest judge.

992
00:44:29,912 --> 00:44:32,380
So, guys, this week
your spotlight challenge

993
00:44:32,414 --> 00:44:35,816
was to create a Goblin King
physically influenced

994
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,386
by the land
that he reigns over.

995
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,154
Let's see
what you've come up with.

996
00:44:59,174 --> 00:45:02,209
I could see the detail from
where I'm standing so I'm happy.

997
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:05,079
It looks beautiful on stage.

998
00:45:05,113 --> 00:45:06,347
I love it.

999
00:45:06,381 --> 00:45:09,417
I love our makeup.

1000
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:29,503
I'm excited.
This thing looks scary.

1001
00:45:29,538 --> 00:45:32,773
No matter what the judges say,
I'm happy with my work.

1002
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:57,465
Maybe we could
actually wing this and win it,

1003
00:45:57,499 --> 00:45:59,567
because it looks
pretty cool under these lights.

1004
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,358
I'm just really nervous
that the hat's gonna fall off.

1005
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:26,994
That would be
such an embarrassment.

1006
00:46:27,029 --> 00:46:28,863
I'm nervous.
I'm really nervous.

1007
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:50,718
I wanna win this challenge.

1008
00:46:50,752 --> 00:46:52,853
I think he stands out.

1009
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:54,321
I think he's shimmery,
he's icy,

1010
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,357
and I think we have
a good chance of winning.

1011
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:22,349
I am terrified
at this point to see

1012
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:24,852
what the judges are gonna say.

1013
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:26,420
Hopefully it's good.
I don't know.

1014
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:50,911
There are a couple areas
on the inside of the arm

1015
00:47:50,946 --> 00:47:53,080
where you can see
a little bit of skin.

1016
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:56,717
I'm hoping the judges
won't notice.

1017
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,322
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

1018
00:48:07,896 --> 00:48:10,264
Can you try to emote
through the makeup for me?

1019
00:48:10,298 --> 00:48:11,565
Scrunch your face up.

1020
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,334
I want to see how you read
through it.

1021
00:48:13,368 --> 00:48:14,769
It looks really thick,
but it's not.

1022
00:48:14,803 --> 00:48:16,670
- Oh, look.
- He's got a bug.

1023
00:48:16,705 --> 00:48:18,639
He's got a bug.

1024
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:20,574
Some of the other characters
have such a big presence.

1025
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,042
Our character
might have a little more

1026
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:23,477
of a simplistic look,
and I'm not sure

1027
00:48:23,512 --> 00:48:25,446
that that's what the judges
are looking for.

1028
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,450
- Did they look at the shoulders?
- A little bit.

1029
00:48:29,484 --> 00:48:30,918
This is cool.

1030
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:32,553
I like the way
they did all this.

1031
00:48:32,587 --> 00:48:33,988
That's even,
like, gold wire on that.

1032
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:36,657
- What nice detail.
- Very impressive.

1033
00:48:36,691 --> 00:48:39,727
Yeah, things look great
from far away in the dark,

1034
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:42,296
but, once you're up close
poking at it,

1035
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,899
that's a whole different story.

1036
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:47,668
It's a fine sort of
lizard-like effect, isn't it?

1037
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:49,570
Yeah.

1038
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:51,772
There is some nice little
stippling and stuff.

1039
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:53,073
It just doesn't read

1040
00:48:53,108 --> 00:48:54,842
because I have not seen
a gator this color,

1041
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:56,410
have you?

1042
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,917
I feel pretty confident.

1043
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:06,921
I think we have
a very strong concept.

1044
00:49:06,955 --> 00:49:08,622
Why is he all covered up?

1045
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:10,224
I don't understand
how this face is supposed

1046
00:49:10,258 --> 00:49:12,593
to transition into this.

1047
00:49:12,627 --> 00:49:14,128
This looks like a hat.

1048
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:17,331
It's the top of a volcano,
and that's his crown.

1049
00:49:17,365 --> 00:49:19,700
I notice Glenn's
just picking this thing apart.

1050
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:22,236
I'm utterly confused by this.

1051
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:23,704
I'm terrified.
I'm not shaking,

1052
00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:25,739
but on the inside
I'm screaming.

1053
00:49:31,046 --> 00:49:34,014
If you're on Twitter,
use #FaceOff to tell us

1054
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:36,450
what you think
about tonight's designs.

1055
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:42,001
I don't understand
how this face is supposed

1056
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:43,936
to transition into this.

1057
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,171
- This looks like a hat.
- I noticed Glenn's

1058
00:49:46,206 --> 00:49:48,640
just picking this thing apart,
and I'm terrified.

1059
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:53,012
I'm not shaking,
but on the inside I'm screaming.

1060
00:49:53,046 --> 00:49:55,247
- Do you have any teeth in?
- Yes.

1061
00:49:55,281 --> 00:49:56,248
Oh, you didn't see those
before.

1062
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:57,883
- Very good.
- That's creepy.

1063
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,022
Oh, good.

1064
00:50:00,286 --> 00:50:02,921
The way that that head
goes up into it,

1065
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:03,922
it's much better up close.

1066
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:07,860
Could you bend your head a bit?

1067
00:50:07,894 --> 00:50:10,662
Don't strain your knees,
my boy.

1068
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:12,965
You'll need them
over the next 70 years.

1069
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:15,334
If anything happens with
this creature, it falls on me.

1070
00:50:15,368 --> 00:50:17,903
I'm the one going home.

1071
00:50:17,937 --> 00:50:20,773
- God, that's a lot of work.
- Yeah, no kidding.

1072
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:24,843
I wanna see what this looks
like if the grass wasn't there.

1073
00:50:24,878 --> 00:50:27,813
I'm really interested in seeing
what that structure looks like

1074
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:30,149
if they hadn't made
this decision.

1075
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:32,117
Stressing out,
it's not gonna help me,

1076
00:50:32,152 --> 00:50:34,653
so I'm trying to be happy.

1077
00:50:34,687 --> 00:50:38,757
And I am happy because it's
crazy that I'm already here.

1078
00:50:42,062 --> 00:50:46,398
John, you were exposed to some
pretty amazing fantasy kings

1079
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:48,834
as part
of <i>The Lord Of The Rings</i> films.

1080
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:50,803
How do you think
things turned out tonight?

1081
00:50:50,837 --> 00:50:52,604
Extraordinary.
Just extraordinary.

1082
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,208
Far beyond what
I was expecting to see.

1083
00:50:56,242 --> 00:50:59,044
The judges have scored
your creations.

1084
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:01,447
Let's find out
what they thought.

1085
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:06,085
Kris and Alam,
Katie and House...

1086
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,956
congratulations,
because you are safe

1087
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,658
and can head back
to the makeup room.

1088
00:51:12,692 --> 00:51:13,826
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1089
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,961
Thank you.

1090
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:19,765
So the rest of you
were the best

1091
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:21,200
and the worst of the week.

1092
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:24,603
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

1093
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:26,171
to learn more about your work.

1094
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:29,708
Anthony and Meagan,
please step forward.

1095
00:51:31,744 --> 00:51:35,247
Before I begin, I want
to say to all of you,

1096
00:51:35,281 --> 00:51:36,615
I'm really blown away.

1097
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:39,651
The work is
just exceedingly high.

1098
00:51:39,686 --> 00:51:41,787
So well done to all of you
this week, I mean that.

1099
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:44,656
So to start, please tell me
who was responsible

1100
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:47,025
for which aspects
of this makeup.

1101
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,827
I handled the sculpting
of the head, the face,

1102
00:51:48,862 --> 00:51:51,096
the staff,
and Meagan did the--

1103
00:51:51,131 --> 00:51:52,598
- Shoulders.
- Shoulders.

1104
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:53,899
The chest piece
that's kinda hidden.

1105
00:51:53,933 --> 00:51:56,435
And we applied and painted
together.

1106
00:51:56,469 --> 00:51:58,837
From far away,
I had serious concerns

1107
00:51:58,872 --> 00:52:02,174
about the tonality
of the makeup.

1108
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,776
The paint job up close,
very happy with.

1109
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:08,647
And I love that there's
some subtle shifts in tonality

1110
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:12,184
on the half of face
that's more human-esque.

1111
00:52:12,218 --> 00:52:13,986
I'm extremely impressed
with this piece.

1112
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,287
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1113
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:19,091
The ability to sculpt
natural things such as rock,

1114
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,359
it's difficult thing
to pull off.

1115
00:52:20,393 --> 00:52:22,327
You did an exceptional job.

1116
00:52:22,362 --> 00:52:24,596
The painting of it
is executed so well,

1117
00:52:24,631 --> 00:52:26,698
it looks like the real stuff.

1118
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:28,300
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1119
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:29,635
I thought
this was just wonderful.

1120
00:52:29,669 --> 00:52:32,638
I love the geology.
I think the execution is good.

1121
00:52:32,672 --> 00:52:34,740
I would be very happy
to wear that makeup.

1122
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:36,742
I think it's--
well, no, let me rephrase this.

1123
00:52:36,776 --> 00:52:40,379
No, no, never will I
wear a prosthetic makeup again,

1124
00:52:40,413 --> 00:52:42,814
but--
but were I young and mad,

1125
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:45,384
I'd be happy
to be seen in that.

1126
00:52:45,418 --> 00:52:48,187
Thank you so much.
That really means a lot.

1127
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:50,355
Anthony, Meagan,
thank you very much.

1128
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,823
- Will you please step back?
- Thank you.

1129
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:53,992
Thank you, guys.

1130
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:56,028
Thank you.

1131
00:52:56,062 --> 00:53:00,566
Michael and Troy, will you
please step forward?

1132
00:53:02,936 --> 00:53:06,838
Tell us what is going on
with this character

1133
00:53:06,873 --> 00:53:08,674
and whose idea was what.

1134
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,042
He's a volcano. You know,
a volcano's generally ugly.

1135
00:53:10,076 --> 00:53:11,143
They erupt.

1136
00:53:11,177 --> 00:53:12,811
They leave destruction
in their path.

1137
00:53:12,845 --> 00:53:14,279
I did all of the fabrication

1138
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:16,148
as far as the costuming
and the top,

1139
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:18,317
and then I sculpted the chest
piece and the shoulder.

1140
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:20,219
I handled
most of the paint work.

1141
00:53:20,253 --> 00:53:23,555
I also sculpted the face,
also painted the chest piece.

1142
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:26,124
All right, can you open up the
coat so we can see the chest?

1143
00:53:28,094 --> 00:53:29,828
I've gotta tell you something,
sorry to say

1144
00:53:29,862 --> 00:53:31,897
you covered up the best part
of your makeup.

1145
00:53:31,931 --> 00:53:36,168
I think the face is just a big
charred, scratchy-looking thing,

1146
00:53:36,202 --> 00:53:39,471
and this headpiece
is like a clown hat.

1147
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:41,106
I don't think you did
so well on this, guys.

1148
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,476
You have a very specific
aesthetic happening

1149
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:48,313
just in silhouette
that feels more like a witch.

1150
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:50,549
I like the staff, actually.

1151
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:52,985
It's pretty cool-looking.

1152
00:53:53,019 --> 00:53:56,822
It clearly is the product of
two guys dividing their labors,

1153
00:53:56,856 --> 00:53:58,523
working apart,
and then bringing them together

1154
00:53:58,558 --> 00:54:00,092
and going, "whoops."

1155
00:54:00,126 --> 00:54:03,695
It's black and gray
with a little bit of mishmash

1156
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,464
of yellows and crimsons.

1157
00:54:05,498 --> 00:54:07,666
It doesn't work.

1158
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,535
Michael and Troy,
please step back.

1159
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:17,209
Eric F and Jenna.

1160
00:54:20,346 --> 00:54:23,815
First I wanna ask you,
on a scale of one to ten,

1161
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,817
how you think you did
in this challenge.

1162
00:54:25,852 --> 00:54:29,388
- We probably did an eight.
- I would say an eight as well.

1163
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:31,723
Just because it was
the very first challenge.

1164
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:33,792
We are just learning the shop.

1165
00:54:33,826 --> 00:54:35,927
That's great, because I think
that that's very accurate.

1166
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:38,463
There's some exceptional details
in the sculpture.

1167
00:54:38,498 --> 00:54:40,999
I really like the sort
of hieroglyph.

1168
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:44,503
It very simply harkens
towards an Egyptian theme.

1169
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:46,772
It ties in well
with the desert.

1170
00:54:46,806 --> 00:54:49,308
What I see going on
with the eyes sculpturally,

1171
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:51,743
definitely asymmetrical.

1172
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:55,447
There is a very fine line
between crooked

1173
00:54:55,481 --> 00:54:56,782
and purposely asymmetrical.

1174
00:54:56,816 --> 00:54:59,051
Interesting, unique,
cool to look at.

1175
00:54:59,085 --> 00:55:01,820
When he walked out
and I saw the head,

1176
00:55:01,854 --> 00:55:04,122
I'm thinking, "oh, my God."
I really loved it.

1177
00:55:04,157 --> 00:55:06,658
And then when I got up close
and I saw a lot more

1178
00:55:06,693 --> 00:55:08,627
of the details, I liked the fact
that you've tied

1179
00:55:08,661 --> 00:55:11,697
all of those details together
with that gold wire,

1180
00:55:11,731 --> 00:55:14,066
and your gold paint,
the gold nipple ring.

1181
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,735
All those details
really finished it off for me.

1182
00:55:16,769 --> 00:55:22,240
It really is a very
comprehensive work of design.

1183
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:25,977
The lack of water
in that parched skeletal desert

1184
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:28,714
comes through wonderfully.

1185
00:55:28,748 --> 00:55:31,750
Eric, Jenna, can you
please step back?

1186
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,255
Oh, my God.

1187
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:41,893
Wayne and Alex.

1188
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,564
What was the original idea
behind this?

1189
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:46,798
We're both from Florida.

1190
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,967
We picked the swamp,
so we wanted to come up

1191
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:50,168
with the gator theme

1192
00:55:50,203 --> 00:55:51,837
just because it's
the king of the swamps.

1193
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:53,739
Is that face a gator color?

1194
00:55:53,773 --> 00:55:55,807
I'm not overly familiar
with your gators.

1195
00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:57,342
The last thing
we wanted to do was put

1196
00:55:57,377 --> 00:56:01,146
a nice cream-colored dry brush
over the front of the face,

1197
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,014
but we really
just ran out of time.

1198
00:56:03,049 --> 00:56:05,717
What you just said,
that is not okay.

1199
00:56:05,752 --> 00:56:09,588
I'm perplexed
by how you could have

1200
00:56:09,622 --> 00:56:11,990
such a fundamentally
sound concept

1201
00:56:12,024 --> 00:56:14,092
and have succeeded so well
sculpturally.

1202
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:17,229
Not leaving yourself
enough time to paint it

1203
00:56:17,263 --> 00:56:18,964
was a horrible decision.

1204
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:22,734
Who did what in your character?

1205
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:26,071
I sculpted the face,
the belt piece,

1206
00:56:26,105 --> 00:56:28,473
and then the little transfers
that we did on the feet,

1207
00:56:28,508 --> 00:56:29,808
and then the transfer that went

1208
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:31,610
down the back of the head
with the scaling.

1209
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:35,847
And I sculpted the cowl
and made, basically,

1210
00:56:35,882 --> 00:56:37,282
the chest piece.

1211
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:39,384
First of all, your chest piece

1212
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:41,153
looks like
a psychedelic washboard.

1213
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:44,189
Your proportions
are completely off.

1214
00:56:44,223 --> 00:56:46,024
His head is so big.

1215
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:47,526
If you were gonna put a head
on him this big,

1216
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,394
you should have built
his shoulders out

1217
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:53,131
so that he was very robust.

1218
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:56,301
The sculpt of the head,
it's such a good design.

1219
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:57,969
How much time did you
give yourself for paint?

1220
00:56:58,004 --> 00:56:59,371
It's probably 40 minutes.

1221
00:56:59,405 --> 00:57:01,740
- 40 minutes?
- Oh, man, guys.

1222
00:57:01,774 --> 00:57:04,443
You must in future
balance your time better

1223
00:57:04,477 --> 00:57:05,877
so that you don't give yourself

1224
00:57:05,912 --> 00:57:10,182
so little time
to add that polish.

1225
00:57:10,216 --> 00:57:12,317
Wayne, Alex, could you
please step back?

1226
00:57:15,455 --> 00:57:18,523
Eric and Autumn.

1227
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:23,462
Please start off
by explaining your concept.

1228
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:24,729
We didn't really get to pick.

1229
00:57:24,764 --> 00:57:26,565
We were the last
to get a decision,

1230
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:28,166
so we got stuck with jungle.

1231
00:57:28,201 --> 00:57:30,101
I came up with the concept,

1232
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:32,704
and Eric sketched it out
beautifully,

1233
00:57:32,738 --> 00:57:36,241
and I based the sculpture
off of his drawing.

1234
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:37,609
I'm really happy
with this thing.

1235
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:40,545
I think that you did
a great job.

1236
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,813
Who did the arms?

1237
00:57:41,848 --> 00:57:44,349
- I did.
- I think it's really cool

1238
00:57:44,383 --> 00:57:46,751
that you actually incorporated
what appears to be

1239
00:57:46,786 --> 00:57:49,921
sort of a musculature,
but you did it so that it looks

1240
00:57:49,956 --> 00:57:52,924
like it's in a tree form,
which is really great-looking.

1241
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:57,262
Choosing to do knots for ears,

1242
00:57:57,296 --> 00:58:00,432
another great choice
of figuring out a feature

1243
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:03,835
on the tree that's going to work
for the metaphor of ears.

1244
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,670
That is a fantastic head.

1245
00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:08,039
Eric and Autumn,
thank you very much.

1246
00:58:08,074 --> 00:58:09,207
- Thank you.
- Please step back.

1247
00:58:09,242 --> 00:58:11,042
Thank you.

1248
00:58:13,279 --> 00:58:14,779
Okay, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

1249
00:58:14,814 --> 00:58:16,915
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

1250
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:19,951
while they make their decisions.

1251
00:58:24,624 --> 00:58:28,226
So let's talk about the looks
that you liked the most.

1252
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:30,529
Why don't we start
with Anthony and Meagan?

1253
00:58:30,563 --> 00:58:32,564
The makeup itself
was exceptional.

1254
00:58:32,598 --> 00:58:35,867
The transition and the colors on
the more human side of the face

1255
00:58:35,902 --> 00:58:37,402
were really thrilling to me.

1256
00:58:37,436 --> 00:58:38,837
I was impressed with the fact
that they sculpted

1257
00:58:38,871 --> 00:58:40,939
the rock and had it
look like rock.

1258
00:58:40,973 --> 00:58:42,941
- Looked like rock.
- Organically accurate.

1259
00:58:42,975 --> 00:58:44,409
Yes, it was.
Yeah, that's hard.

1260
00:58:44,443 --> 00:58:45,744
I think it was terrific.

1261
00:58:45,778 --> 00:58:49,548
All right, let's move on
to Eric F and Jenna.

1262
00:58:49,582 --> 00:58:50,949
It's one of my favorite makeups

1263
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:52,651
because there was
a lot of attention to detail.

1264
00:58:52,685 --> 00:58:55,487
Right down to the little gold
wire that they used to tie

1265
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:57,222
all the different things
together.

1266
00:58:57,256 --> 00:58:58,657
That's really
a testament to the fact

1267
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:00,592
that their teamwork
was exceptional.

1268
00:59:00,626 --> 00:59:02,327
What I liked about it

1269
00:59:02,361 --> 00:59:05,196
was that you could tell
the features from a distance.

1270
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:08,800
You know, they really had used
contrast and shade

1271
00:59:08,834 --> 00:59:11,269
to make the features stand out.

1272
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:14,639
Okay, let's move on to
Eric Z and Autumn.

1273
00:59:14,674 --> 00:59:16,875
I loved this piece.
I loved the head sculpt.

1274
00:59:16,909 --> 00:59:19,210
I loved the design of the head.

1275
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:21,646
I thought it was such a
beautifully executed piece.

1276
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:25,984
The tree form, sculpturally,
follows the deltoid down

1277
00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:29,454
into the tricep and the bicep,
and that's really brilliant.

1278
00:59:29,488 --> 00:59:31,389
All right, let's move on
to some of the looks

1279
00:59:31,424 --> 00:59:32,824
you liked the least.

1280
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:34,793
Why don't we start
with Michael and Troy?

1281
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:39,631
Everything that they chose
was a mistake right down

1282
00:59:39,665 --> 00:59:41,900
to the best thing they did
being covered up.

1283
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:43,969
Even the chest sculpture
wasn't very good--

1284
00:59:44,003 --> 00:59:45,003
No.

1285
00:59:45,037 --> 00:59:46,538
But it was better
than the face.

1286
00:59:46,572 --> 00:59:47,872
It is literally just lines

1287
00:59:47,907 --> 00:59:51,142
carved on the shape
of the actor's lifecast

1288
00:59:51,177 --> 00:59:53,545
with red underneath
and black on top.

1289
00:59:53,579 --> 00:59:55,981
All right, let's move on
to Wayne and Alex.

1290
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:58,450
Out of all of the times
we've asked the question,

1291
00:59:58,484 --> 01:00:00,485
"who did what?",
this seems to be

1292
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:03,989
the single most
inequitable division of labor

1293
01:00:04,023 --> 01:00:05,890
I've heard of yet.

1294
01:00:05,925 --> 01:00:08,793
- She barely did anything.
- That's scary for her.

1295
01:00:08,828 --> 01:00:10,895
Well, I think
we all loved the sculpture,

1296
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,530
but there was
so many other things

1297
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:14,132
that were screwed up on it.

1298
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:16,835
I can't even believe that they
didn't get at least a base coat

1299
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:18,770
on it before they got here.

1300
01:00:18,804 --> 01:00:19,971
If they would have left
themselves some time to paint,

1301
01:00:20,006 --> 01:00:21,272
they could have been on top.

1302
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:24,042
All right, judges, have you
made your decisions?

1303
01:00:24,076 --> 01:00:26,244
- Yes, we have.
- Think so.

1304
01:00:26,278 --> 01:00:29,314
Let's bring 'em back out.

1305
01:00:35,788 --> 01:00:38,390
All right, Glenn, why don't you
tell us about the top teams?

1306
01:00:38,424 --> 01:00:41,259
Our top teams tonight
are Anthony and Meagan.

1307
01:00:41,293 --> 01:00:44,663
We thought that you did
a really great job

1308
01:00:44,697 --> 01:00:47,065
sculpting the rock textures
on your makeup,

1309
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,401
and we really loved the way

1310
01:00:49,435 --> 01:00:52,170
that you handled
the transition onto the head.

1311
01:00:52,204 --> 01:00:54,172
Eric F and Jenna.

1312
01:00:54,206 --> 01:00:56,608
We really appreciated
some of the finer details

1313
01:00:56,642 --> 01:00:58,076
that you brought
to your makeup.

1314
01:00:58,110 --> 01:00:59,577
And you certainly created

1315
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:02,447
one of the most complete
overall looks this evening.

1316
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:04,382
Autumn and Eric Z.

1317
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:07,619
We're very fond
of your tiki face design,

1318
01:01:07,653 --> 01:01:09,587
and we really like
the tree textures

1319
01:01:09,622 --> 01:01:11,489
that you sculpted for the arms.

1320
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:14,025
Okay, which team came out
on top?

1321
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,429
Our top team tonight is...

1322
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:25,373
Okay, which team
came out on top?

1323
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:27,608
Our top team tonight is...

1324
01:01:31,913 --> 01:01:33,447
Anthony and Meagan.

1325
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:35,850
Oh, my God.

1326
01:01:37,252 --> 01:01:39,286
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you. Oh, my God.

1327
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,189
We thought that this was the
best makeup out there tonight.

1328
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:44,458
We especially loved
the right side

1329
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:46,327
of the face and the profile.

1330
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:48,896
- Well done.
- Anthony and Meagan, great job,

1331
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:51,365
but we can only have
one winner.

1332
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,301
- Glenn?
- The winner tonight is...

1333
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,140
Anthony.

1334
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,675
Thank you so much.

1335
01:02:03,712 --> 01:02:06,547
Ultimately, we felt
that the sculpt on the face

1336
01:02:06,581 --> 01:02:08,616
and the paint job is what made
this makeup a success.

1337
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:11,685
Thank you.
It really-- I can't believe it.

1338
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:12,920
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1339
01:02:12,954 --> 01:02:14,088
Winning
the foundation challenge

1340
01:02:14,122 --> 01:02:16,257
and then winning
the spotlight challenge,

1341
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:21,028
I just feel so incredibly
awesome at this moment.

1342
01:02:21,062 --> 01:02:22,763
Anthony, congratulations.

1343
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:24,565
You and Meagan can head back
to the makeup room.

1344
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,168
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1345
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,304
Eric F and Jenna,
Eric Z and Autumn,

1346
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:32,406
you guys are also safe
this week.

1347
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:33,641
Please head back
to the makeup room.

1348
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:36,143
Thank you.

1349
01:02:39,514 --> 01:02:41,449
Unfortunately that means
the rest of you

1350
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:43,217
are on the bottom this week,

1351
01:02:43,251 --> 01:02:45,886
and one of you
will be eliminated.

1352
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:50,057
Please step forward.

1353
01:02:54,863 --> 01:02:56,263
Michael and Troy.

1354
01:02:56,298 --> 01:02:59,533
There's some good ideas
in the design of your makeup.

1355
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:02,369
You just weren't able
to execute them.

1356
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,605
Wayne and Alex.

1357
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:08,309
You had a really, really nice
sculpture, but you screwed it up

1358
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:12,146
with a horrible paint job
and some egregious fabrication

1359
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,547
and wardrobe decisions.

1360
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:16,484
All right,
so who is going home tonight?

1361
01:03:16,518 --> 01:03:19,587
The person
going home tonight is...

1362
01:03:21,723 --> 01:03:23,824
Troy.

1363
01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:26,827
Unfortunately, even though a lot
of things weren't right

1364
01:03:26,862 --> 01:03:28,596
with the design tonight,
we felt

1365
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,564
that the biggest letdown
was the facial sculpt.

1366
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:35,936
Troy, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

1367
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:37,538
The rest of you are safe.

1368
01:03:37,572 --> 01:03:41,175
You can head
back to the makeup room.

1369
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:44,378
I just want you to know

1370
01:03:44,412 --> 01:03:47,414
that this one experience
does not define you.

1371
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,483
So I'm hoping that
we do get a chance to see

1372
01:03:49,518 --> 01:03:50,651
some of your work
down the road.

1373
01:03:50,685 --> 01:03:51,952
Thank you very much.

1374
01:03:51,987 --> 01:03:54,121
Troy, it's been great
having you here with us.

1375
01:03:54,155 --> 01:03:55,990
Can you please head
back to the makeup room

1376
01:03:56,024 --> 01:03:57,191
and pack up your kit?

1377
01:03:57,225 --> 01:03:59,059
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1378
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:02,963
Good luck, Troy.

1379
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:04,565
This competition is no joke.

1380
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:07,868
You have to be
on your A-plus game,

1381
01:04:07,903 --> 01:04:09,370
especially with the artists
that are here.

1382
01:04:09,404 --> 01:04:10,871
Going home, guys.

1383
01:04:10,906 --> 01:04:14,141
Oh, man! Dude!

1384
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:15,676
Oh, you can't go!

1385
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,511
I tried my hardest.
I did the best I could.

1386
01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:18,946
I worked my butt off.

1387
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,282
So I can't say
I have any regrets.

1388
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:23,050
I know I have a lot to learn.

1389
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:25,452
It's just more motivation
for me to get better.
