00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:04,068
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:10,106
The artists created
confectionary delights.

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:13,076
Kris's candy corn demon
broke Anthony's winning streak.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,845
Thank you so much.

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:17,149
And Alex was sent home.

6
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:21,052
Now, ten artists remain.

7
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,119
Tonight,

8
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:24,687
they'll face
a gargantuan challenge

9
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:27,357
and be judged
by a movie industry titan.

10
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,424
Bryan Singer.

11
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,160
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:32,295
- In the lab...
- I hope this works.

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,297
The pressure
reaches an all-time high.

14
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:35,899
I can't do this by myself.

15
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,840
This is crazy.

16
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:40,436
If we don't pull it off,

17
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,906
it's the biggest failure,
literally.

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,475
From the ankles up,
it's fabulous.

19
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:46,476
I think it's the biggest makeup

20
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,810
we've ever seen on the show.

21
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,545
It's a hot mess,
and it's embarrassing.

22
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,314
It's hard to critique
because I don't want

23
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:52,349
to kick you while you're down.

24
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:53,716
I'm incredibly impressed.

25
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:55,785
I'm-- actually,
I'm actually blown away.

26
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:58,355
In the end, only one will win
the opportunity

27
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,957
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

28
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:02,959
in New York and Paris,

29
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:07,730
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,
and $100,000.

30
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:11,902
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,416
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

32
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,352
Sync and corrections by n17t01

33
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:57,981
Good morning.

34
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,417
I think we're all relieved
that someone else won

35
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,551
besides Anthony.

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,287
His winning streak is broken.

37
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:06,789
It's definitely
a confidence booster for me

38
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:09,059
and for everyone,
but I think we're at a point now

39
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:10,293
where we really
have to take chances.

40
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:13,529
So into the van
and onto the next challenge.

41
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:15,531
It's very important to me
not to be in bottom looks again,

42
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,300
so to be noticed
for having top looks

43
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:20,403
or to win would be really,
really nice.

44
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:29,012
We wind up at Magic Mountain.

45
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:31,214
This place is so cool.

46
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,816
We're all running around,

47
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:36,052
acting like children.
We're at an amusement park,

48
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:37,887
so of course,
we're gonna have fun.

49
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:40,656
We're checking out
all the cool sites,

50
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:43,960
and then, we see
this giant redwood tree,

51
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:47,200
and just past the tree
stands McKenzie.

52
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:50,400
Welcome
to Six Flags Magic Mountain.

53
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:53,769
This has been a popular location
for dozens of films

54
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,738
and features
more roller coasters

55
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:58,508
than any other theme park
on the planet,

56
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,044
but I bet you're wondering
why the heck you're here today.

57
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:03,079
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

58
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:04,247
Well, I take it you did notice

59
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:06,316
the giant redwood tree
right behind me.

60
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,484
- Yup.
- Good.

61
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:09,419
Because that's why you're here.

62
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,088
You're all headed
to the land of giants.

63
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:14,424
Ah, knew it.

64
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,059
This week's challenge
is giants.

65
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:18,861
That's kind of a monster,
and that's kind of cool.

66
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:22,088
The adventurous tale
of <i>Jack The Giant Killer</i>

67
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:24,089
recalls Jack, a farmer's son

68
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:26,736
who rid the land
of all evil giants.

69
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,006
That is the basis for
this week's spotlight challenge.

70
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,842
To create
an original giant character

71
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:35,978
that Jack might have slain
on his adventures.

72
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:39,416
I have never made a giant
before, and I'm thinking

73
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,984
it's gonna be a lot of work.

74
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,854
Now, I'd like to introduce you
to the director and producer

75
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:47,524
of award-winning
and extremely popular films,

76
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:52,828
including <i>The Usual Suspects,</i>
<i>X-Men, Valkyrie,</i>

77
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:56,799
and of course, the upcoming
<i>Jack The Giant Slayer.</i>

78
00:03:56,833 --> 00:04:00,570
He's also producer and director
of the TV show <i>House.</i>

79
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,872
Please welcome Bryan Singer.

80
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:05,741
Wow!

81
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:06,809
I'm starstruck.

82
00:04:06,843 --> 00:04:09,345
It's Bryan Singer,
which is insane.

83
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,181
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:12,449
I'm a huge Bryan Singer fan.

85
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:13,683
He's awesome.

86
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:14,684
How are you?

87
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:15,818
Thank you so much
for being here.

88
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,087
Oh, my pleasure.
Thanks for having me.

89
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:18,521
As a producer who has brought

90
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:20,623
such amazing characters
to life,

91
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:22,192
such as Keyser Soze,

92
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:23,259
Magneto,

93
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:24,394
Wolverine,

94
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:27,029
what makes a compelling
character on-screen?

95
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:28,764
Well, I think
it's when you find a way

96
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,800
to translate
the actor's personality,

97
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,035
whoever's playing the role,

98
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,670
and infuse that
into the character.

99
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:35,671
I think whenever you do that,

100
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:37,073
you believe it more.

101
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,309
Now, there's something
that we haven't told you

102
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:41,811
about Jack's adventures
in the original tale.

103
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:44,180
Jack encounters several giants.

104
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,015
And some of them
have multiple heads.

105
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,017
With that in mind,

106
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:52,122
your giants must have
at least two heads.

107
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:53,189
- Nice.
- Okay.

108
00:04:53,224 --> 00:04:55,024
Creating a giant with one head

109
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:56,859
is difficult enough.

110
00:04:56,893 --> 00:05:00,163
Creating it
with two or three or more

111
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:03,533
is going to be
extremely difficult.

112
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,569
This is a team challenge.

113
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:09,205
Your randomly selected teams
of two are...

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,842
Alam and Eric Z.

115
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:14,043
Kris and Eric F.

116
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:17,313
- Oh!
- Oh, that's an awesome team.

117
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:19,249
Meagan and Jenna.

118
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,351
I know Meagan's worried
about the tumor in my hand,

119
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:24,154
which causes my fingers
to be completely numb,

120
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:26,156
so I know it's going
to be rough.

121
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,259
Wayne and House.

122
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:30,627
Autumn and Anthony.

123
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,428
Anthony's
a four-time winner,

124
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:33,896
so I don't even have to worry.

125
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,534
I feel like I'm on friggin'
vacation this challenge.

126
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:39,135
Now, please stand
with your new teammate.

127
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,172
- Awesome.
- Ah, that's great.

128
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:44,207
By the way, Bryan is also
going to be joining us

129
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:46,509
on our reveal stage
to see your makeups.

130
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:47,877
This is rad!

131
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:50,713
It's an honor to be able
to, uh, you know,

132
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:52,582
try to show off for this guy.

133
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:53,883
Bryan, what are you
going to be looking for

134
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:54,984
in their final creations?

135
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,052
Obviously, something original,

136
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:57,787
something
we've never seen before,

137
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:59,622
but also something
that brings out a bit

138
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,857
of the personality
in the models that they choose,

139
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:03,959
so we really feel
the characters come to life.

140
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:05,695
Okay, I want you guys
to stay here

141
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,163
for just a little bit

142
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:08,198
and get started
on your designs.

143
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:09,465
When you're done, I want you

144
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,601
to head back to the lab,
choose your models,

145
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:12,835
and get started.

146
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:15,004
Good luck.
See you tomorrow.

147
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,840
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

148
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:22,845
Let the actor
show through, right?

149
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,547
Right.
And that's the dwarf's head.

150
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,115
Yeah, this is
the actor's real head.

151
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:27,584
Oh, yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

152
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:28,585
Okay.

153
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,885
Eric is the mastermind.

154
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,953
I put my complete faith in him.

155
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:34,657
Our concept is
to take our big guy,

156
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,326
and turn him into Jack,

157
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,128
and have two giants
towering over him.

158
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:40,230
It feels really good

159
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:42,898
that Kris is willing
to take the risk.

160
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:46,250
If we can pull this off, it's
going to be something great.

161
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:49,071
Eye movement?

162
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:50,540
House comes up with a concept
right off the bat.

163
00:06:50,574 --> 00:06:52,342
He's fired up about it.

164
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:53,676
Three heads

165
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:55,044
because I'm thinking everybody's
doing two heads.

166
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:56,346
Two heads are easy.

167
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,848
Actor's wearing makeup,
dummy head, dummy head,

168
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:00,783
and he's operating
both of them, la la la.

169
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,318
We're seeing the redwood tree,

170
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:03,886
and our giant lives
out in the woods,

171
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,255
so let's incorporate that.

172
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,123
The feet are going
to be giant roots,

173
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:09,626
and he's going to have
tree limbs popping off.

174
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,093
I really think
those kind of details

175
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:14,530
help create
a more iconic character.

176
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:15,865
I mean, it could be
any kind of giant.

177
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,234
It could be a bird giant,
it could be a horse giant.

178
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:19,335
You know?

179
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,337
I think we need
to keep things minimal.

180
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:24,240
I know that Jenna wants
to do huge things,

181
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:25,742
and she wants to go
out of the box.

182
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,009
You know, make this a fake arm,

183
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:30,212
and the other one a puppet,
so that mouth will move.

184
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:32,248
She wants to do these puppets
with the head,

185
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:34,350
but I don't think
we're capable of doing that.

186
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,587
What if we build up
from the shoulder?

187
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:39,756
His face is here, and there's
just a fake one above him.

188
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,393
We figured out that we can do
a head on top of a head.

189
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:48,164
It will look like our giant
has taken in a human being

190
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:51,367
and has transformed it
into the cartoon world.

191
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:54,837
That's time.
Let's rock this.

192
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:04,113
So we get back to the lab,

193
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:05,415
and it's time
to choose our models,

194
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:06,949
different models
than what we've used before.

195
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:08,318
They're actually
really big guys.

196
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:11,954
They're all, like,
6'6", 6'5", 6'4".

197
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,292
I'm trying to stay away
from every idea

198
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:18,594
that I think everybody else
is going to gravitate towards.

199
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,364
So our concept is
to have this contorted giant

200
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,432
with a twisted body,

201
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,233
heads kind of growing
out of him

202
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,502
as if they were
genetic mutations.

203
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:30,540
I start blocking in the chest
and the back pieces.

204
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:32,342
Autumn starts working
on the face.

205
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:34,143
Let's make sure we get
some good movement in the mouth.

206
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,512
Everything I do
has movement in the mouth.

207
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,013
I'm a little concerned

208
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:40,149
because I know Autumn
is a strong player,

209
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:41,718
and I feel
I'm a strong player too.

210
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,018
But I don't want his head
to be flat

211
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:44,620
'cause I already
got shitted on for that.

212
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,522
So when you put
two leaders together,

213
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,350
they clash.

214
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:52,294
I think
we can go more stronger,

215
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:53,529
like, on the chin.

216
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:54,530
Okay.

217
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:55,732
The concept for our giant is,

218
00:08:55,766 --> 00:08:57,433
he slays other giants,

219
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,336
and as punishment,
he's chopped off their heads

220
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:01,838
and attached them to his feet.

221
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:03,172
We're also playing
with the idea that,

222
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:04,607
when your feet are tired,
you complain,

223
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:06,075
and that these heads
on the feet

224
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:07,209
will always be complaining

225
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:08,478
and talking back to the giant.

226
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:10,012
Do you like the way
this is coming, by the way?

227
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:11,381
Mm-hmm, I like it.

228
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:12,948
It's awesome
having Alam as a partner.

229
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,217
She doesn't get stressed out,
which is awesome,

230
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,921
and she always has
really fun, fresh, new ideas.

231
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:23,158
We only have
a limited amount of time

232
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,194
to create this giant makeup.

233
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:26,462
Let's get this thing sculpted,

234
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,930
priority number one.

235
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,065
So both of us do something
that we've never done before.

236
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,668
We're working
on the sculpture together.

237
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,404
We're not splitting up chores,

238
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,138
rather,
we're combining our styles

239
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:38,841
to create this makeup
as quickly as possible.

240
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:41,151
Symmetry is going
to be key on this.

241
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:44,947
Like, taper the sculpt
like that.

242
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:46,115
Yeah, and out.

243
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,484
So that as it goes on,
it just, like, bloop.

244
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,586
I'm feeling really good,
at this point,

245
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:51,788
working with Meagan.

246
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:52,988
I think we're communicating
really well.

247
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,457
I'm having a lot of issues
with my hand,

248
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,125
but I keep trying
to put it out of my mind.

249
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,259
I don't want it
to take up my time.

250
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:59,174
I need to focus
on what I'm doing.

251
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:04,066
So we get six hours today
at the lab.

252
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,235
We start cutting up
pieces of styrofoam

253
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,003
for our two giant heads,

254
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,605
just to get a rough shape,

255
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,074
and then we'll take
some ultracal and some hemp,

256
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:15,511
coat those over to get
about an inch thickness.

257
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:18,489
And once they're all set up,
we're ready to sculpt.

258
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,985
Point the nose that way.

259
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,020
- That way?
- Yeah, to keep the flow.

260
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:27,457
I thought it would
be crooked than this way, like--

261
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:28,691
You know, in any makeup,

262
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:30,960
the face is always
the most important element,

263
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:34,296
and this is the first time
that I'm stepping back

264
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,998
and letting somebody else
do the face

265
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:37,934
so that I can tackle
the chest and the back.

266
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:40,369
To give up that responsibility
is a little nerve-racking.

267
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:43,305
Kris and I want to execute

268
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,908
the biggest character
as possible,

269
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,276
so I grab a piece of chalk,

270
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,980
and I'm using the lab floor
as a giant doodle pad

271
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:53,315
to get our concept
and proportion chart done.

272
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,186
Now I can physically see
the amount of area

273
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,654
that needs to get covered.

274
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,756
Look how big that thing is.

275
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,157
Fox is a madman.

276
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:04,360
Gonna be 10 foot tall!

277
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,161
- That's 10 foot tall?
- 10 foot, yes.

278
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:07,897
How tall--
the dude's, like, 6'4"?

279
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:09,398
Yeah.
Right there, that's his head.

280
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:10,566
To create this giant,

281
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,134
I know that Eric wants
to push the envelope

282
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:13,569
as much as possible,

283
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:15,170
and I have
a lot of respect for that.

284
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,640
Looking at the sheer size
of their giant,

285
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:18,875
right away, I'm thinking,

286
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:20,342
"what is that mold
going to look like?"

287
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:22,077
Are they going to be able
to get it off the piece

288
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,246
and clean it out
and cast it in time?

289
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,650
- This is crazy.
- They said make a giant.

290
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:29,785
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

291
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,187
Laid out,
our giant is a lot bigger

292
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:34,390
than I thought
it was going to be.

293
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:35,525
I'm getting worried.

294
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,259
Will we finish this project?

295
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:40,763
I know we don't have
a lot of time to pull this off,

296
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:43,132
so every minute
has to be accounted for.

297
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,901
If we don't pull it off,

298
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:47,202
it's going to be
the biggest failure

299
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:48,337
in <i>Face Off</i> history.

300
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:51,273
Literally.

301
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:53,009
Coming up...

302
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,209
I can't do this shit.

303
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:55,277
Please don't give up right now.

304
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,278
It's not looking good.

305
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:59,715
Man, we are burnt.

306
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,451
There's a stunning lack
of originality

307
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:03,786
in this design.

308
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,189
Well, this is certainly
the most ambitious effort.

309
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:13,018
The dude's, like, 6'4"?

310
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,353
Yeah.
Right there, that's his head.

311
00:12:14,387 --> 00:12:15,755
That's massive, dude.

312
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:18,257
Laid out,
our giant is a lot bigger

313
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,524
than I thought
it was going to be.

314
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,127
Hold those corners real quick?

315
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,529
I never worked
on a giant monster before,

316
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:25,664
but I trust Eric.

317
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:26,832
He wanted to make
the biggest monster,

318
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,779
so we're doing it.

319
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,703
I'm going to the bathroom.

320
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,239
Please touch it while I'm gone.

321
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:34,807
Oh, please touch it.

322
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,175
With a teammate like Autumn,

323
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,244
I think the way
to approach this is

324
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:39,444
to let her think
she has more control

325
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,512
than she really does.

326
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,314
I'm afraid, if I push too much,

327
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:44,250
then her personality's
going to get bigger

328
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:46,752
and may not be able
to be contained.

329
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:50,589
I, like, go and potty,
come back to something new.

330
00:12:50,623 --> 00:12:54,459
You said touch it.

331
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:56,162
These guys are doing three.

332
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:57,763
Anthony's doing three.

333
00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,465
The feet are three,
technically.

334
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,701
By the end of the day,
I'm looking around the shop,

335
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:04,136
and it seems like
almost everyone is

336
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,971
doing some kind
of three-headed creature.

337
00:13:06,006 --> 00:13:07,006
- Let's do two.
- Let's do that.

338
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,207
- Bring it down a little bit.
- Yeah.

339
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:10,342
So we decide
to loop off one of the heads

340
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,011
and just make it
a two-headed giant.

341
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,545
It saves some work
for the actor,

342
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,282
and it saves some work for us.

343
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,824
Time's up, guys.

344
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:29,228
I think our sculpts
look beautiful,

345
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:31,831
and I'm especially proud
of my face sculpt.

346
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:35,767
I just hope Anthony doesn't
get credit for all of it.

347
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:45,044
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

348
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:46,145
Day two begins.

349
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:47,913
We have a lot of work to do.

350
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:50,282
We have a chest to make,

351
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:52,151
a side shoulder piece,

352
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:54,153
we have to make a pair
of tree feet,

353
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:55,721
and we have to make a head

354
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:58,991
that our model can puppeteer.

355
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:03,095
We already done one head
and almost done two,

356
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:04,429
and we need one more.

357
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:08,585
So now I'm trying to sculpt
the left foot.

358
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,337
For our concept,
we're incorporating

359
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:12,604
a lot of tree elements,

360
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:13,873
and on the chest,
I'm incorporating

361
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:16,408
an oak tree-type texture
of bark,

362
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:18,911
so it's organic-looking.

363
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,580
Hey, guys.
We're here for our walk-through.

364
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,682
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, hey!

365
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:24,816
Ready?

366
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:25,817
Michael Westmore--
he is

367
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:26,952
my mentor for the season,

368
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:28,053
and I really couldn't ask

369
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:29,121
for anything better than that

370
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:30,923
because it really
gives us a chance

371
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,491
to shape things
before it's too late.

372
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,726
We just kick-started these.
Obviously very root.

373
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:37,029
Almost like the tree root
itself-- the feet.

374
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:39,598
And the redwood was actually
the big inspiration for us.

375
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:41,666
Glad to see you've got
a lot of deep grooving to it

376
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:43,302
'cause the root
actually grows like this.

377
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:44,336
- Yeah.
- I want you to promise me

378
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,604
you're not gonna make it muddy.

379
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:47,373
Keep your browns
and your greens separate,

380
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:49,174
because they start
getting together,

381
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:50,242
and you lose
all your wonderful sculpture.

382
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:51,410
That's right.

383
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:53,678
We decided to focus
on a little more simple

384
00:14:53,713 --> 00:14:55,414
and really concentrate
on the paint job.

385
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:58,350
Be careful of it because you
really have a lot of edges here.

386
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:00,319
And as the competition's
getting stronger,

387
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:02,521
getting rid of edges is gonna be
very, very important.

388
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:05,457
We have a plan for that.
Vines coming out of his mouth.

389
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:06,558
Smart thinking.

390
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:07,960
I love the idea
of the cleft lip.

391
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:10,229
You get this on,
really glue those lips down,

392
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:11,563
- so they don't flap on you.
- Yeah.

393
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:13,065
- It's gonna be neat.
- Yeah. Thanks.

394
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:14,266
Painting is gonna be important.

395
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:15,534
What are you thinking about,
color-wise?

396
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,436
We want to do some blue washes

397
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,405
and have some parts of him
have loss of pigment.

398
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:21,540
I think it's a good idea,
because you go dark,

399
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:23,809
you're gonna start losing
your detail.

400
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:26,812
Mr. Westmore loved the idea
of doing the blue color scheme.

401
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:29,881
And if there's one challenge
I'm going to go all out,

402
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,684
do some crazy colors,
it should be the giant.

403
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:35,187
We're go turn Jack
into a little dwarf.

404
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:37,189
He's a little guy
with a complex.

405
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:39,091
And the heads are
gonna be... puppets.

406
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,726
Okay...

407
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:43,963
Eric, I know last week,
you had some problems

408
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:47,433
completing everything,
so is anything happening here

409
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:49,301
that's going to come up
and bite you again,

410
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:51,303
or you really have it
thought out this time?

411
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,404
Really have it thought out.

412
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:53,805
We're tackling
all the sculptures.

413
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,941
We're kinda putting both
of our ideas into everything.

414
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,443
So we're just
splitting everything

415
00:15:57,477 --> 00:15:58,577
right down the middle.

416
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,346
You know, this all
has to be molded today.

417
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,681
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

418
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:05,250
Mr. Westmore's concern is,
will we have time

419
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:06,651
to complete our giant makeup?

420
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:10,422
I won't lie.
I'm a little nervous too.

421
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:11,756
All right, everybody,
we're heading out,

422
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:15,861
- but it's looking good.
- Thank you.

423
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,533
When the sculpture is finished,

424
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,068
it's time to make a mold.

425
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:24,970
Wayne and I are
molding like crazy.

426
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,206
We're molding everything
together at once.

427
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,609
There's a lot to do,
and we're doing it.

428
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:33,312
Jenna is molding
in the spray booth,

429
00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:34,913
and you just don't mold
in the spray booth.

430
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,349
You use that
for spraying stuff.

431
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:39,184
- Jenna!
- What?

432
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,387
I just wanna get this
properly done.

433
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,455
Do you wanna clean this,
and I'll do that?

434
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,656
Okay, go.

435
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,291
I'm starting to feel
a little frustrated

436
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,759
at this point
because I feel like

437
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:49,194
I'm not getting the opportunity

438
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:50,996
to do things the way
I would do them.

439
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,498
That's the trouble
with working with a partner

440
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:54,866
because we each have our
different way of doing things.

441
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,301
No, Jenna, no.

442
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:58,870
She does things one way,
I do things another way.

443
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,939
And sometimes it doesn't matter
how you do them,

444
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:02,474
just as long as you get
the end result

445
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:03,675
that you wanna get.

446
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:05,511
What did she do?

447
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:08,047
Jenna, you took the cowl
off of it?

448
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:09,048
I didn't take it off.

449
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:10,282
We gotta build it back up,

450
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:12,284
otherwise it's not
gonna go on his head.

451
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:13,652
I'm panicking.
There's no cowl here,

452
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:15,720
so there's no way for it
to stay on the actor.

453
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:17,923
So we have to block this out
really quick.

454
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,758
No, no, no, no.
That's fine, that's fine.

455
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,160
It's this, under here.

456
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:23,995
I can tell Meagan
doubts my ability to do things,

457
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,797
and I know she does not
wanna go home.

458
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:27,933
But I do wish that she
had a little more faith in me,

459
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:29,701
that I do know
how to do some things.

460
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:32,304
I hope this works.

461
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:35,040
Here we go.

462
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:37,443
Anytime you got a mold
this big to do,

463
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:40,312
it works a lot better
if you can do it as a team.

464
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:43,248
This thing is like
trying to plaster a hot tub.

465
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:46,751
I mean, it is massive.

466
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,987
- It's Bigfoot.
- Bigfoot!

467
00:17:49,021 --> 00:17:51,323
Ooh, nice.

468
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:52,824
We've got an hour and a half.

469
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,194
Okay.

470
00:17:57,363 --> 00:17:58,730
Did you put pry points?

471
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:01,433
There's one down here,
and there's one down here.

472
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,302
Jenna's responsibility
was to just

473
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:04,970
make that big mold,

474
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:06,871
and I can't open it.

475
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,373
There's not good pry points.

476
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:12,177
This is completely fucked.

477
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:14,279
I'm very frustrated
with our situation.

478
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:15,514
It's not looking good.

479
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:16,881
We're cracking it in,

480
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,850
and if it breaks, it breaks.

481
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,885
I'm trying to just get it done,

482
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,446
but it's a disaster.

483
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:31,521
We gotta get this mold open,

484
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:32,822
and I'm very concerned.

485
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:34,491
- Where's it stuck?
- Where is it stuck?

486
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:35,959
- Oh, right here.
- Where?

487
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:37,093
Right here?

488
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:38,395
I'm watching these poor girls

489
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,265
rolling around the floor,
struggling with a mold.

490
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:42,699
I can't take it no more.

491
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:44,468
I'm gonna have to step in

492
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,570
and help 'em get this mold out.

493
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,038
Watch out, move.

494
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:50,574
Thank you.

495
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:52,142
So we got the mold open,

496
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:55,412
but there's still a lot
of cleaning we have to do.

497
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,613
The time's ticking, man.

498
00:18:56,648 --> 00:18:59,383
It's stressing me out.

499
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:10,360
- It's not on there.
- Oh, my God.

500
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:12,896
Once I finally
got the mold cleaned out,

501
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,799
I put it together, and it
doesn't close, there's a gap.

502
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,368
Which means if the mold
doesn't close properly,

503
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:21,305
then anything you fill in there
will leak or not cure.

504
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:25,375
So Jenna and I are running
high-risk right now.

505
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:30,079
Time's up!

506
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:33,283
Man, we are burnt.

507
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,686
We got our heads foamed,
but we still got

508
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,088
a hand to mold
on application day.

509
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,368
We'll get it done--
I hope.

510
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,535
All right.

511
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,438
It's application day.

512
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:57,407
We have four hours to complete
our giant makeup.

513
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,309
We know we have
a lot of work to do.

514
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,878
We're in the mold room,
pulling pieces out of mold,

515
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,413
running polyfoam.

516
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:07,016
I'm a little concerned.
I'm a worrywart anyway.

517
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,487
This whole thing came out.

518
00:20:10,521 --> 00:20:13,189
Our piece is, like,
all messed up.

519
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:16,092
The whole edge
is completely ripped.

520
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,562
The nose piece has, like,
a bunch of lumps.

521
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,697
The seams are huge.

522
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:22,899
It looks really in bad shape.

523
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,167
It's still wet.

524
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:26,336
The foam piece is not cured
all the way,

525
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,372
so it's collapsing on itself.

526
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:29,973
I think
in the finished product,

527
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:32,342
we can either cover it
or hide it somehow.

528
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:34,077
I'm still optimistic
at this point

529
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:36,913
that something will work.

530
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,114
Ooh.

531
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:39,716
Yeah, it's ugly.

532
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:42,386
There are a few bad tears
in the prosthetic,

533
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,756
but I feel really confident
that Autumn and I are gonna

534
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,257
be able to pull this off.

535
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,525
We'll make that scarring.

536
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:56,933
We have a whole new set
of models.

537
00:20:56,967 --> 00:21:00,270
They're all giant men,
6'3"-plus, bodybuilders.

538
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:01,438
How you doing, buddy?

539
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:02,672
And we're gonna
make a cool giant.

540
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:04,073
Slip your hand up in here,

541
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:05,074
and it's basically a puppet
like this.

542
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:06,443
Okay.

543
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,845
We're worried about
piecing everything together,

544
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,247
painting,
and then fitting it on him.

545
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,517
There's a lot to do
besides a makeup application.

546
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:15,218
When you're walking,
big, giant steps.

547
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,486
- Like--
- Like, big steps.

548
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,688
Yeah, there you go.
That's it.

549
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:20,339
All right, that's perfect.

550
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:24,227
Keep pulling.

551
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:25,862
We open up the molds,

552
00:21:25,897 --> 00:21:28,064
and we see
a perfectly ran foot.

553
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:29,966
We got our feet,
and we're ready to go.

554
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,664
We're so excited.

555
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,973
You wanna blow foam
in that real fast?

556
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,709
- Yeah, hittin' it right now.
- Awesome!

557
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:41,778
We're in the mold room
still fabricating things.

558
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:43,413
Our model has been
sitting for a while

559
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,915
before we even get a chance
to go over

560
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:46,583
and say hello to him.

561
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:50,987
The clock's ticking.

562
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:53,323
I hope I didn't get me and Kris

563
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:56,259
in over our heads
with this wacky scheme.

564
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:02,833
Just start working
on a wardrobe.

565
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:05,034
I'm gonna start working
on the wardrobe, I got to.

566
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:07,170
Anthony
is pre-painting everything

567
00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:08,839
'cause he is Mr. Illustrator.

568
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:11,475
And I will be
building the costumes

569
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:13,276
because he is scared shitless

570
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,378
of the sewing machine.

571
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:17,241
I need scissors.

572
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,262
Do you want me
to start mixing paint up

573
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,763
and getting, I'm gonna start
spraying the feet?

574
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:29,593
I'm feeling pretty good.
House is feeling pretty good.

575
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:30,827
We just can't wait
to see this thing

576
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:32,377
all just come together.

577
00:22:37,702 --> 00:22:38,969
Is it gonna fall?

578
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:41,972
We go to put the cowl
on our actor...

579
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:43,239
It's not gonna stay up.

580
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:44,908
And it's not gonna work.

581
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:47,744
The whole inside of it
is gummy,

582
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,614
and I'd rather
put it somewhere else.

583
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:52,048
What I suggest
is we cut it open

584
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:53,917
and put it
coming through his shirt.

585
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:55,385
It looks really bad.

586
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:57,487
Like, it looks bad.

587
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:59,022
Cut it straight down the middle

588
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:01,024
so that we have
the front face of it.

589
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:03,994
I know Meagan
is furious with me

590
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:06,362
and aggravated with me
and frustrated with me.

591
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:08,197
You just gonna
put that wig on him?

592
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:09,833
- No.
- No?

593
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:12,536
Jenna's really--
she--

594
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,370
I could tell, mentally,
she's worn down.

595
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:17,206
Safety pin the head
to the cheesecloth.

596
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:18,708
- To this?
- Yeah.

597
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,243
And we'll wrap it
around his body.

598
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:23,547
Fuck, I can't do this shit.

599
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:25,381
Jenna, please don't give up
right now.

600
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,883
Please.

601
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:28,418
I can't feel my fucking hand.

602
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:29,953
I know that,
but please--

603
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:32,221
I-I can't do this
by myself.

604
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,290
Meagan's getting
kinda frustrated.

605
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:37,226
The time's ticking away,
and it's very stressful

606
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:39,596
when things start to go wrong.

607
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,631
You know, I just hope
they get this thing knocked out.

608
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,132
What time is it?

609
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,334
Five minutes.

610
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:48,337
Oh.

611
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:50,406
Lookin' handsome.

612
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:52,154
Scissors, scissors, scissors.

613
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,114
It's okay.
It's gonna work out.

614
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:06,823
That's time.

615
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:08,191
It's a disaster.

616
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:11,061
I feel like, regardless
if it's on me or her,

617
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:12,996
it's crumbling.
It's coming down.

618
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,632
And I just wanna get it
to a good place,

619
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,735
so it's not embarrassing.

620
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:21,037
Coming up...

621
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:22,472
We don't have much to do,

622
00:24:22,506 --> 00:24:24,908
other than assemble a giant.

623
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:26,643
Honestly, it didn't
go the way you wanted.

624
00:24:26,677 --> 00:24:28,144
It does look like hell.

625
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:31,214
Well, this is certainly
the most ambitious effort.

626
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,204
Last looks is always intense.

627
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:41,405
The last looks
on this challenge,

628
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,841
maybe the most intense.

629
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:43,942
Can you open the mouth?

630
00:24:43,976 --> 00:24:45,109
Lower? Higher?

631
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:46,523
Uh, higher.

632
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:51,049
We don't have much to do,

633
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,384
other than assemble a giant.

634
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:55,820
I'm a little freaked out
about this.

635
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:57,755
- All righty.
- We didn't have any clothes.

636
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,623
We had to make that
all last-minute.

637
00:24:59,658 --> 00:25:01,625
I start frantically
cutting up leather

638
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,344
and gluing it on.

639
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:05,964
Just kinda keep your hands
like that.

640
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:07,365
I don't want to let Alam down.

641
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:08,399
I wanna get this thing done.

642
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:09,700
I have to have a finished piece

643
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:11,053
up there for the both of us.

644
00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:13,571
Hey, guys, we got
30 more minutes left.

645
00:25:13,605 --> 00:25:14,873
Thank you.

646
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:17,141
Everything that possibly
could go wrong is going wrong.

647
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:18,676
We're sinking,
but we're trying.

648
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,979
Cut a hole
that will go over this.

649
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:23,081
Meagan has an idea
of how it needs to work.

650
00:25:23,115 --> 00:25:24,515
- Do you understand what I mean?
- No, I don't.

651
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:27,018
She's thinking, I'm sure,
"what, is she stupid?"

652
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:29,453
His face is all jacked up.
Just take it off.

653
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:30,721
We can't just
send him out there

654
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:32,190
with one head,
he's gotta have two.

655
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:34,621
If you think it needs
to get off, then take it off.

656
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:40,798
It's time, guys!
Put your brushes down.

657
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,200
I'm gonna cry.

658
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:46,004
Look at that, fucking
awesome, man!

659
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:47,238
His other shoe's not on.

660
00:25:47,273 --> 00:25:49,340
It's a hot mess,
and it's embarrassing.

661
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:53,311
And I am scared I'm going home.

662
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,937
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

663
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,045
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

664
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:09,027
Say hello to your judges.

665
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:10,661
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio

666
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,430
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

667
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:13,664
Evening.

668
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:15,466
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

669
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,936
A very big hello to you
this evening.

670
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,103
Hello.

671
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:21,205
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

672
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,241
A giant hello to you
this evening.

673
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:25,910
Oh, copycat.

674
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:27,378
And with us again tonight
is writer,

675
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:30,048
producer, and director
Bryan Singer.

676
00:26:30,082 --> 00:26:31,382
Hey.

677
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,785
Thanks.

678
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,154
Bryan, thank you so much
for being here.

679
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:37,621
Glad to be here.

680
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:39,157
This week
your spotlight challenge

681
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:41,292
was to create a giant character

682
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:44,162
with at least two heads
that Jack might have slain

683
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:47,332
on his adventures in the book
<i>Jack The Giant Killer.</i>

684
00:26:47,366 --> 00:26:49,200
Let's see
what you've all come up with.

685
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:11,622
I like our giant.

686
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:14,625
He's the character
that Alam and I wanted to make.

687
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,195
On elimination day,
all that you can really ask for

688
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:19,289
is that you're happy
with your character.

689
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:47,158
This thing is impressive.

690
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:49,427
It's filling up half the stage.

691
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:52,930
And the looks
on the judges' faces is amazing.

692
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:13,784
I don't even wanna look at it.

693
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:15,520
And I'm thinking,
"I'm going home.

694
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:17,562
There's no way I'm gonna
make it through this."

695
00:28:36,575 --> 00:28:37,675
I'm ready to win this one,

696
00:28:37,709 --> 00:28:38,943
at least be in top looks.

697
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,378
I mean, we have
really clean makeup.

698
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:41,579
It looks really nice.

699
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:43,047
This is probably
the most excited I've been

700
00:28:43,082 --> 00:28:44,172
since I've been here.

701
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:05,336
You know,
it is very nerve-racking

702
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,605
seeing, not only the judges,
sitting there,

703
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:09,640
but also Bryan Singer looking

704
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:12,412
with a magnifying glass
over our work.

705
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:20,586
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

706
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,059
Wow, that's bizarre.

707
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:31,229
It's just
such a strange choice.

708
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:33,531
Our giant doesn't have
as great of a presence

709
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,533
compared to the others,
and that worries me.

710
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,101
What the hell happened to you?

711
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,942
Tall, looks like polyfoam.

712
00:29:44,976 --> 00:29:46,511
This is so great.

713
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:47,945
Look, he's stabbing his hand.

714
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:49,480
Oh, neat.

715
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:52,049
This is so fun.

716
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,553
It feels so great.

717
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:58,889
We pulled off
a last-minute miracle.

718
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:02,493
This thing is so huge,
so impressive,

719
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:03,727
but funny.

720
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,496
Your mouth doesn't move
in the makeup?

721
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:08,799
Open your mouth
as was you can, please.

722
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,201
Oh, they're just really stiff.

723
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:12,102
- Yeah.
- Interesting choices here,

724
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:16,474
form-wise,
that I just don't understand.

725
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:18,075
Is that edge coming up
down there?

726
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,210
Yeah, it is.

727
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:21,412
I am so embarrassed
that's onstage.

728
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:24,248
There's no doubt
one of us is going home.

729
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,130
Oh, my God.

730
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:31,422
Watch our new web series
<i>Face Off Redemption</i> tonight

731
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,658
to see this season's
eliminated contestants

732
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:36,760
compete to win a spot
on our next season of <i>Face Off.</i>

733
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:43,270
Interesting choices here form-wise,
that I just don't understand.

734
00:30:43,444 --> 00:30:45,933
I'm so embarrassed
that that's on stage.

735
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:48,578
There's no doubt
one of us is going home.

736
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,814
Some neat broad strokes
happening.

737
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,149
I like the way they did this.

738
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,750
- This is clever.
- And it works.

739
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,852
I like there's a wood knot
in the palm.

740
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,041
Oh, yeah, that's great.

741
00:30:58,194 --> 00:31:00,824
That's really cool.
I love that.

742
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,393
I love it.
It's really cool up close.

743
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,328
Yeah, and the wetness
of the tongue and the eyeball.

744
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,595
Yeah, it's really good.

745
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,497
- He's the saddest giant.
- He really is.

746
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,268
Like, he's encumbered
by these other characters.

747
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,470
Let's see the back.
Please show me.

748
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,139
Oh, this head's good too.

749
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,207
- Wow, man.
- These are good.

750
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,416
Bryan, you gave
some great advice

751
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,683
to these guys the other day.

752
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,085
So how do you think they did?

753
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,253
I'm incredibly impressed.
I'm--

754
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,654
actually,
I'm absolutely blown away.

755
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:31,922
Great.

756
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,391
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

757
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,393
to learn more about your work.

758
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:39,930
Wayne and House,
please step forward.

759
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:47,071
Guys, tell me
about the concept.

760
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:49,673
Well, it's two heads,
and we wanted the actor

761
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,708
to be the puppeteer
of the second head,

762
00:31:51,742 --> 00:31:53,677
as well as using
the redwood tree

763
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:54,945
as an inspiration.

764
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,214
Overall, I like this a lot.

765
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,284
I think that I'm struggling
a bit with the proportions.

766
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,585
He's gotten so wide this way,

767
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,454
that's it's managed
to make him shorter.

768
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,688
Shorter, yes.

769
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,957
I love the color
that you chose to paint him

770
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,126
because it's not, like,
a typical bark color.

771
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,494
He looks like a stone statue

772
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,397
that has great animal qualities
to it as well.

773
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,398
It's very successful.

774
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,866
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

775
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,036
There's some really great
sculpting going on,

776
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,937
particularly in the body,
with the bark.

777
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,772
I admire the fact
that yours is the only one

778
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,041
that the two heads can interact

779
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,876
and have personality
and be more

780
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,312
than just a giant
that happens to have two heads.

781
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,813
I thought it was
a really awesome piece.

782
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,515
- I really liked it.
- Thank you.

783
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,208
Thank you very much.
Please step back.

784
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,386
Autumn and Anthony.

785
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,928
So tell me the story
behind your giant.

786
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:46,230
He's kind of a backseat driver.

787
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,265
So the one in the back
is the one

788
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,935
whispering in his ear
to control the beast.

789
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:54,204
From far away,
I wasn't that impressed.

790
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:58,342
But when I got up close,
I really liked this a lot.

791
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,477
How long did it take you
to do the three-eye paint job?

792
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,346
I'd probably say
about five minutes apiece.

793
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,680
- Really?
- Yeah.

794
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:05,449
- That's quite impressive.
- Thank you so much.

795
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,751
What sporting goods store
did he get those gloves?

796
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:14,324
No, but the overwhelming
entirety of it obscures them.

797
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,493
I only noticed that
upon close examination.

798
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:17,961
But great work, really awesome.

799
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,396
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, guys.

800
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,213
Anthony, Autumn,
please step back.

801
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,811
Alam and Eric Z.

802
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,875
Start by explaining
your concept.

803
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,444
We took
a folktale approach to it.

804
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,811
The idea is he has this axe,

805
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:36,746
and he slays other giants,

806
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:39,383
and he attached these two
giants' heads to his feet.

807
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,185
They're forever tortured
as they walk.

808
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,287
They complain, like,
complaining, tired feet.

809
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,355
The head-on-feet thing is

810
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,125
such an absolutely
dreadful decision

811
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,296
that I'm having a hard time
even looking at anything else.

812
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,064
And it's disappointing.

813
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,033
It's too bad those heads
weren't somewhere else,

814
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,803
because from the ankles up,
he's fabulous.

815
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,838
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

816
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:04,541
It's hard to get up
to looking at his makeup

817
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:07,444
because the feet
are so wretched.

818
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:09,513
They look too playful,
so it kills it.

819
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,916
- Okay.
- Eric, Alam, please step back.

820
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,825
- Thank you, thanks.
- Thank you so much, buddy.

821
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,405
Kris and Eric F.

822
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,868
Well, this is certainly
the most ambitious effort.

823
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:33,437
What's the whole concept?

824
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,904
The little guy
taking on the world, basically.

825
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,640
I think this would
definitely be a makeup

826
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,342
that my kids would like to see.

827
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,144
I really admire the fact
that you've taken

828
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,614
the tallest model
of all the actors up there

829
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:45,682
and yet made him
into the smallest person.

830
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,451
- That was really clever.
- Thank you.

831
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,121
You guys should definitely
be impressed with yourselves

832
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:53,423
in terms of how much work
you've pulled off.

833
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,758
I think it's the biggest makeup

834
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,092
we've ever seen on this show.

835
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,662
- Yes!
- That was one of our goals.

836
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,230
So--

837
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,133
Who came up with the idea

838
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:06,102
to have this giant
holding the actor?

839
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,138
Eric masterminded
the whole thing.

840
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,907
You not only pulled it off,

841
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,309
but it's a great idea.

842
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,810
Thank you so much.

843
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:14,944
Means the world.

844
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,112
Eric, kris,
thank you very much.

845
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,314
Please step back.

846
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,782
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

847
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,038
You're awesome.

848
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:23,520
Success, man, success.

849
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,816
Meagan and Jenna, you're up.

850
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:37,133
Tell us about the concept.
What inspired this giant?

851
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,935
The idea behind him was

852
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:42,172
that Jack was just
an ordinary guy,

853
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,874
and this giant started
to take over his body.

854
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,376
This was originally
supposed to be up here.

855
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,478
- It was a cowl.
- Yeah, it was--

856
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,979
But it was a mess.

857
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:53,250
Who was responsible
for what aspect of this?

858
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:56,286
We both pretty much
took the load I would say.

859
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,388
It was definitely
a stressful grouping.

860
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,657
It was.
It became--

861
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,493
this breaks my heart
to say this.

862
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:07,297
It became very evident that,
with my hands like this,

863
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,099
I can't sculpt
the way I need to,

864
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,934
the way I want to.

865
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,937
And I feel terrible

866
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,207
about hindering
someone else's performance

867
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:18,742
because they're trying
to make up

868
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,144
for my lack of ability
to do it.

869
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,580
You know, it's hard to critique

870
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,449
because I don't wanna kick you
while you're down.

871
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,617
I mean, there's not
a lot of good.

872
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,051
It didn't go
the way you wanted.

873
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:32,989
And that is the net result
of what we get to look at.

874
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:36,426
There's a stunning lack
of originality in this design.

875
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,262
Whatever it was that forced you

876
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:43,066
to take the head off,
it was a horrible decision.

877
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,269
Meagan, Jenna,
please step back.

878
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,554
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

879
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,675
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

880
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,244
Okay, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

881
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,779
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

882
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,800
while they make
their decisions.

883
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:02,319
All right, guys,
so why don't we talk

884
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,888
about the looks that
you liked the most tonight?

885
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,790
Why don't we start
with Wayne and House?

886
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,092
I like the idea
that it was the one

887
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,627
interactive giant,
the two heads.

888
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,362
I think the sculpting on it
was so beautiful,

889
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,230
and the paint job was terrific.

890
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,599
I really like it a lot.

891
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,802
All right, let's move on
to Anthony and Autumn.

892
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,604
The paint job was spectacular.

893
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,872
For the amount of time
and the amount of sculpting

894
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,442
that they did, my God,
they did an amazing job.

895
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,043
It was
an interesting reveal too,

896
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,612
the fact that first you see
a head there,

897
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,813
and you're like,
"what?"

898
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,081
And then turns around--
suddenly, "oh!"

899
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,651
And then faces us again
and pulls back the outfit,

900
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,952
and you can see more
of the, you know, structure.

901
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:36,953
Yeah, that was amazing.

902
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,087
- The chest was beautiful.
- Yeah.

903
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,890
Let's move on
to Kris and Eric F.

904
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,192
That silhouette,
when it first came out

905
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,193
and the lights went on,
and you see

906
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,295
this little, tiny person
being held,

907
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,930
such a great concept.

908
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,466
I think that was really
a clever thing that they did.

909
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,469
It was a very clever way
to get some fun and humor

910
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,705
into a challenge that's
very difficult to do that.

911
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,707
Let's move on to the looks

912
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,375
you didn't like so much
this week.

913
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,143
Let's start
with Meagan and Jenna.

914
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,179
It was so bad.
It was inexcusable.

915
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,649
There was nothing
on that makeup that was good.

916
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,084
There's so many problems
right from the start

917
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:10,019
with this makeup,
it really didn't have

918
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,187
a chance to succeed.

919
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,223
And I know
that Jenna's hands are hurting,

920
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,759
and that is very unfortunate.

921
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,696
All right, guys, let's move on
to Alam and Eric Z.

922
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,966
It's so overly obvious
how poor the concept was

923
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,835
of having feet grab onto heads

924
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,135
and walk around with them.

925
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,937
There was no point
along the way

926
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,073
that they went,
"aah, this totally sucking.

927
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,541
Let's try something else."

928
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,343
I would've taken the heads off,

929
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:36,079
closed the eyes,
strapped them to a chain

930
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,314
to each one of my ankles,
and pulled them around.

931
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,583
Yeah, that's a way to treat it.

932
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,150
- That would've been my remedy.
- Yeah.

933
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,453
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

934
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,454
- Yep.
- Yeah.

935
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,455
- Yeah.
- I think so.

936
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,629
Let's bring 'em back out.

937
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,701
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks tonight.

938
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,404
Wayne and House,
it was really cool

939
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,372
how you brought tree bark
into your design.

940
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,574
And the puppeteering aspect
was also

941
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,309
a really nice touch.

942
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:09,345
Anthony and Autumn,
your sympathetic character

943
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,181
was very successful,
and we loved the paint job.

944
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:16,953
Kris and Eric F,
it was a massive amount of work.

945
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,123
The profile was
extremely interesting as well.

946
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:22,091
Okay, which team
came out on top?

947
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,177
The top team tonight is...

948
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,238
Okay, which team
came out on top?

949
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:34,070
The top team tonight is...

950
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,712
Kris and Eric F.

951
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:46,219
You guys took on
so much this week,

952
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:48,354
and you delivered
some serious wow factor.

953
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:49,755
Congratulations.

954
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,658
- Thank you so much, guys.
- That's fantastic.

955
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:55,295
Eric F and Kris,
great job, guys.

956
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:57,297
But we can only have
one winner.

957
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:58,298
Glenn?

958
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:01,434
The winner is...

959
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,136
- Eric F.
- Yeah!

960
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,338
- Ahh.
- Whoo!

961
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:07,006
Thank you.

962
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,207
Aww.

963
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,343
In the end, it came down
to concept for us.

964
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:12,611
And as kris put it,
that was all Eric.

965
00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:14,981
To hear my name as the winner,

966
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:16,182
it is amazing

967
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:19,585
because I've worked
so hard for this.

968
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:20,719
Thank you, guys.

969
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,089
- Eric!
- Good job.

970
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,924
Eric F, congratulations.

971
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,725
You and Kris can head back
to the makeup room.

972
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,745
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

973
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,799
Wayne and House,
Anthony and Autumn,

974
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:34,033
you guys are also safe.

975
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:35,434
Please head back
to the makeup room.

976
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,358
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

977
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,941
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

978
00:40:41,976 --> 00:40:43,342
are on the bottom this week,

979
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:45,812
and one of you
will be eliminated.

980
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:47,093
Please step forward.

981
00:40:51,986 --> 00:40:53,686
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

982
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,956
Meagan and Jenna,
this makeup was a problem

983
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:58,491
from its inception.

984
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,895
And honestly, your technical
and application issues

985
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:03,763
just compounded everything.

986
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:07,100
Alam and Eric Z,
there were some issues

987
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:09,102
with the head in the feet.

988
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,937
It just felt like a cheat.

989
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,972
So who's going home tonight?

990
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:15,019
The person
leaving tonight is...

991
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:23,850
Jenna.

992
00:41:23,884 --> 00:41:26,019
Unfortunately,
there just wasn't anything

993
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:29,388
about your work this week
that's indicative of the fact

994
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:30,957
that you're going to be able
to continue getting better

995
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,027
while you're here on the show.

996
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:36,495
Jenna, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

997
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,164
The rest of you are safe

998
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,565
and can head back
to the makeup room.

999
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,016
Thank you, judges.

1000
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,139
Jenna, we're so sorry

1001
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,506
that you've been struggling
with these injuries.

1002
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,876
And we really hope you have
a speedy recovery, honey.

1003
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,677
And please don't
let this get you down.

1004
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,479
I think this is the best thing,

1005
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:55,448
as much as it breaks my heart.

1006
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:57,283
Jenna, it has truly been great

1007
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:58,451
having you here with us.

1008
00:41:58,485 --> 00:42:00,386
Please head back
to the makeup room

1009
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,520
and pack up your kit.

1010
00:42:01,555 --> 00:42:02,621
Thank you all very much.

1011
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:04,006
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

1012
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:09,362
I'm going home, guys.

1013
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:12,031
This has been the greatest
experience of my life,

1014
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:14,400
and I'm just sorry
that it has to end here.

1015
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:15,835
I just wish
I could've shown the world

1016
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,164
what I can really do.

1017
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:20,373
If I could get my hands fixed

1018
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:22,909
and get back to where I was,
I'd give anything

1019
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:24,896
for a second chance
in this competition.
