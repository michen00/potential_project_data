00:00:01,407 --> 00:00:03,851
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:10,735
The artists went
to hell and back.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,271
Anthony won his fourth challenge
in a row...

4
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:14,573
Thank you, guys.

5
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:18,481
And Katie was sent home.

6
00:00:18,516 --> 00:00:22,054
Now, 11 artists remain,

7
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,558
and tonight, they'll tackle
the sweetest challenge yet.

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,496
Oh, my God,
there's candy everywhere.

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,374
- This is awesome.
- Wow.

10
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:34,413
But some will * on their
confectionery creations.

11
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:36,773
I'm feeling pretty screwed
at this point.

12
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,712
My actor is stuck to the floor.

13
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:42,281
What the hell was I thinking?

14
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:44,150
I can't let this crap
send me home.

15
00:00:44,184 --> 00:00:45,885
Fuck.

16
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:47,119
Your makeup didn't work out.

17
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:49,822
This is such a great concept.

18
00:00:49,856 --> 00:00:51,458
I am so proud.

19
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:55,362
There was absolutely no candy
anywhere in this makeup.

20
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:58,099
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

21
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,636
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

22
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,671
in New York and Paris,

23
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:05,341
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,

24
00:01:05,376 --> 00:01:08,846
and $100,000.

25
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,716
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

26
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,985
Welcome to <i>Face Off!</i>

27
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:52,067
Sync and corrections by n17t01

28
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,565
I feel sad.
I miss Katie.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
Yeah, me too.

30
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:01,436
I'm sure she's upset because
she had to work with somebody

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,439
who could not perform
to their full potential.

32
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,940
It's difficult
to have Katie gone

33
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,443
because I feel
directly responsible.

34
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:09,579
All I can do is just try
to put it out of my mind.

35
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:12,381
- Let's rest that wrist up.
- Yeah. Yeah.

36
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,284
It did
'cause I seriously thought

37
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:17,786
we were top looks going in.

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,422
I'm starting to think maybe
the judges expect more of me.

39
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:23,992
Well, I was surprised that me
and Eric were where we were.

40
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:25,728
We thought
that we would be safe,

41
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,762
but to be in the top looks
was very exciting,

42
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,831
but I don't think
I deserve to be there.

43
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,399
So I'm gonna try to do better,

44
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:34,468
and I'm really excited to see
what's gonna happen next.

45
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:42,808
So I walk into The Federal bar,
it's an old 1920s building,

46
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:46,944
and I'm thinking that we're
probably gonna do 1920s makeup.

47
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:51,014
Welcome to The Federal bar.

48
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,218
Built in 1926, it was the site
of the first ever

49
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:58,254
Los Angeles
beard and moustache competition,

50
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,722
which is the inspiration

51
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:03,659
for today's
foundation challenge.

52
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:06,061
Now, here to tell you more about
these outrageous competitions

53
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,030
is the founder and president

54
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:11,333
of the Los Angeles
Beard and Moustache Club

55
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,835
and National Beard champion.

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,204
Please welcome John Myatt.

57
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:18,340
Howdy, y'all.

58
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,842
I've only laid
about two or three beards

59
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:24,045
in my whole life,
so I am a little worried.

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,647
Can you tell our contestants
just a little bit more

61
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,048
about this quickly
growing sport?

62
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,784
The best way to describe a
beard and moustache competition

63
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,954
is a mix between a male
beauty pageant and a dog show.

64
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,458
Your challenge today
will have you hand-laying

65
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:40,461
your own outrageous
facial hair.

66
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,229
Let's bring out your models.

67
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,799
Of course!

68
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,668
They're not men.

69
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:51,605
Your foundation challenge is
to take these beautiful models

70
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,241
and transform them into
a bearded lady from the circus.

71
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,876
Oh, that's awesome.

72
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,745
The winner
of today's foundation challenge

73
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,347
will receive immunity
and cannot be eliminated

74
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:05,483
from this week's
spotlight challenge.

75
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,319
We have provided you with all
kinds of hair as well as racks

76
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,121
of circus-themed wardrobe
to finish off your looks.

77
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,656
John, any last-minute tips
for these guys?

78
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,124
One big thing I notice
in fake facial hair

79
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,125
is it doesn't really match
the face or jawline,

80
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:19,026
so I'd keep a lookout for that.

81
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,394
Your models have been
randomly assigned,

82
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,662
and you have two hours
to complete your looks.

83
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:28,066
Get ready
because your time starts now.

84
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,438
There's this huge wall
with all these different hairs.

85
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:36,405
I'm really excited to see
what we can come up with.

86
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:43,811
I find this beautiful
saloon girl's dress.

87
00:04:43,845 --> 00:04:46,613
In my mind, I start making
my model into a bearded lady,

88
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:48,982
leprechaun burlesque dancer.

89
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:50,784
I need immunity this week.

90
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:53,986
I need a little bit more time
to figure out how to use my hand

91
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,322
'cause I don't want to go home.

92
00:04:57,354 --> 00:05:00,691
When you're laying hair,
it's all in application.

93
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,258
You can't hide the edges,

94
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,526
so I want to go
completely natural.

95
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,894
I don't do facial hair.

96
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:09,195
I personally can't even
manage my own hair.

97
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:11,697
I'm just gonna put some glue
on their face

98
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:15,167
and start sticking hair
into it.

99
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,403
If you're a bearded lady,

100
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:21,804
you're gonna do
some wacky stuff,

101
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,572
so, yeah,
you go and bleach your beard

102
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,274
and dye it a little pink.

103
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:27,774
You don't need much
to lay a beard.

104
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:31,176
You just really need a hackle
to separate the hairs.

105
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,244
A hackle is
a dangerous tool to use.

106
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,879
It's like a really sharp comb.

107
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm hitting my knuckle, like,
four or five times on there,

108
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:37,881
and you tend to bleed
a little bit.

109
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:41,451
Ten minutes, everybody.

110
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:48,356
I'm noticing that everyone
is going crazy over the top.

111
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,891
They're picking
different colors.

112
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:53,093
Some of them are using braids,
and I'm a little concerned

113
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:57,497
with how conservative
I've approached it.

114
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:00,032
Time's up, everybody.
Brushes down.

115
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:01,233
- Hi, Alex.
- Hi, McKenzie.

116
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:03,134
How are you?
So explain your concept to us.

117
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:04,735
It's like a modern circus.

118
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,036
I like the pink faded into it,

119
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,755
and the curls are very nice,
but...

120
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:09,207
?

121
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,373
- Yeah.
- So I would've tried

122
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:11,974
to clean up the loops
a little more.

123
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,076
A little symmetrical,
but it's good.

124
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,344
I went with an Irish
burlesque carnival feel.

125
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,545
I love this.

126
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,980
Yeah, it matches
the wig very well.

127
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:20,481
- Laid a bit weird on the cheek.
- Yeah.

128
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:21,749
It's a little high,
but for the most part,

129
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:23,017
no, the curls are nice.

130
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:25,287
My bearded lady is
a little more masculine.

131
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,488
You know, it's well laid.

132
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,357
Like, the cheek line
follows the face

133
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:29,692
where facial hair
will really grow.

134
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:30,860
Thank you.

135
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:32,395
A hard part
about believable moustaches

136
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,731
is the thickness
right under the nose.

137
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:36,800
So I think if you maybe had
thickened up here a little bit,

138
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:40,003
it would have been
a little more believable.

139
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,484
All right, John, how do you
think they did overall today?

140
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,019
- Overall, pretty good.
- All right.

141
00:06:54,053 --> 00:06:56,120
Well, who were some of
your favorite looks today then?

142
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,355
Eric Z.

143
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,357
The color, the blending
of the hair that matched.

144
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,192
It was very nice,
and it was just laid very well,

145
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,360
looked very natural.

146
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:03,895
My second one, Alex.

147
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:05,329
I like the white and just
the light slight accent

148
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:06,764
of the color,

149
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,098
and I know curls are
a very hard thing to do,

150
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,567
really nice.

151
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:12,003
Okay, John, who is the winner
of today's challenge?

152
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:17,207
The winner of today's
challenge is...

153
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,712
Eric Z.

154
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:23,114
- Great job!
- Yay!

155
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,416
- It looked realistic.
- It really did.

156
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,550
It looked like a bearded lady.

157
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:26,718
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

158
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,387
You have won immunity
in the next challenge

159
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:31,290
- and cannot be eliminated.
- Awesome.

160
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:32,925
All right, well,
this was a lot of fun,

161
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,028
so I will see you all for
your next spotlight challenge.

162
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,229
- Bye.
- Thank you.

163
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:39,666
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye.

164
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,873
Uh-oh.

165
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:48,140
Oh, my God!

166
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:51,344
There's candy everywhere
in the lab.

167
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:53,013
I feel like jumping in there
and just swimming around it.

168
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:55,448
So what do you think
of the place?

169
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:56,783
- Wow!
- It's candy land.

170
00:07:56,817 --> 00:08:00,320
- That's beautiful.
- Looks yummy.

171
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,289
In films like <i>Charlie</i>
<i>And The Chocolate Factory,</i>

172
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:03,991
characters who overindulge

173
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,094
eventually fuse
with their favorite treats.

174
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:10,531
That is the inspiration for this
week's spotlight challenge--

175
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:15,404
to create an original
candy creature or character.

176
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,873
It's gonna be really fun.

177
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,409
It's gonna need
a lot of creativity,

178
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:21,110
and that's what I like.

179
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:22,645
To make your looks
even sweeter,

180
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,782
you must incorporate
some of the candies and treats

181
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:27,985
into your makeups.

182
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,020
I've done
candy-themed model shoots.

183
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:32,156
It's portfolio work.

184
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,124
It's not where my heart is.

185
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,663
All right, guys, go pick
your models and get started.

186
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:40,765
As soon as we pick our models,
we all grab a bag,

187
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,367
go get our candy,
and just fill it up.

188
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,836
It was like
trick-or-treating.

189
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,239
The first candies that catch
my eye are the candy corn.

190
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,175
I got to eat one of those.
Mm.

191
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,813
So I want to incorporate
the candy corn and licorice

192
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,247
as the main candies.

193
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,817
My concept is kind of like
"night of the living candy."

194
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:00,353
Kids eat all the candy
on Halloween,

195
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:04,892
and now, it's the candy's turn
to eat the children.

196
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:07,829
First thing I think of
is the lollipops and swirls

197
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:11,134
and incorporating them into
some kind of a colonial wig,

198
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,737
and thus,
colonel candy was born.

199
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,005
What are you doing?

200
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,239
I think I want to do,
like, a witch,

201
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:17,741
like,
a candy-witch-type thing.

202
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:20,243
I'm gonna play with the idea
that Hansel and Gretel witch

203
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,047
will lure children in with candy
and entice them,

204
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,984
and then, you know,
use it to destroy them.

205
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:30,122
I think I'm gonna make all
the costumes out of the candy.

206
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:33,225
I'm gonna make really,
really big eyes and give her,

207
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,830
like, pointy, perfect nose,
something cartoon-ish.

208
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,001
I'm gonna take a really gross
approach to this.

209
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,003
My design is going to be

210
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:48,038
the Incredible Melting
Gummy Glutton.

211
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:51,607
Big, obese,
couch-potato-type look

212
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:54,910
dissolving
into a big gummy mess.

213
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,744
Wah.

214
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,713
That's bad.

215
00:09:58,747 --> 00:10:00,715
I named my character
Sweet Tooth Susie.

216
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:04,319
Her sweet tooth is this belly
that's just gnashing teeth.

217
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,986
- I love your stomach idea.
- Yeah.

218
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:08,088
Just insanity.

219
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:11,158
I have three pieces that need
to be sculpted, molded,

220
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,095
and run foam latex into it.

221
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:21,000
The only candy I could see
to make a character out of

222
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:23,102
is a gummy bear,

223
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:28,340
so my concept is the gummy bear
that's half eaten and undead.

224
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:33,240
But it's harder than I expected,
turning this into a bear face.

225
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,410
I'm not feeling good
about this challenge.

226
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,351
I'm getting a little frustrated

227
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,286
'cause it's taking
way too much time,

228
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,056
and I can't let this crappy
gummy bear send me home.

229
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:47,958
It looks like shit.

230
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:49,126
Coming up...

231
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,461
I cannot get the mold apart.

232
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,164
I'm feeling pretty screwed
at this point.

233
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,266
There's an appalling lack
of makeup.

234
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:59,436
This is a great concept.

235
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:03,265
I'm *, getting his head to look like

236
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,633
a freaking bear head, man.

237
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,268
- It's just--
- Yeah, bears are tough.

238
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:07,402
I'm not feeling good

239
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:10,372
about the candy challenge
at all.

240
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,907
It looks like shit.

241
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,709
I am tired of looking at it.

242
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:18,012
I'm tired of thinking about it,
and it's killing me.

243
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:22,416
I just want to do
whatever I can do to be safe.

244
00:11:26,522 --> 00:11:28,089
What's that, like, a ballerina?

245
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:29,490
Sugar Plum Fairy.

246
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:31,025
I grew up on dance.

247
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,070
I love the ballet,
and I'm gonna go that route

248
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:37,868
because I'm very strong
at beauty and pretty things.

249
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,905
What are you gonna do
with the candy?

250
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,907
So I'm thinking about putting,
like, horns in here,

251
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:47,774
trying to incorporate some
of these, like, crystal things.

252
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,710
My concept is
it's a sugar rock candy troll,

253
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,411
so he's gonna have
sugar rock candies

254
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,413
coming through his chest
and through his face.

255
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,181
- Looks radical.
- Thanks.

256
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,083
- Jenna, how are you feeling?
- My hand is totally numb.

257
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,551
I'm just not even thinking
about it.

258
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:01,952
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,222
I'm not gonna let it get
the best of me this time again.

260
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:06,490
Hey, guys!

261
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:10,125
I'm back with my dad
to do the walkthrough.

262
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,428
Having a little difficult time
getting him to look like a bear

263
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:15,496
- out of a human face.
- You know what you need to do?

264
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,898
Your nostrils
are more like a cat.

265
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:21,001
A bear actually has a hook
in his nostril as it come--

266
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:22,002
Yeah, I was trying
to get it--

267
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,603
The hook comes around this way

268
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:25,371
'cause a bear's head comes right
straight down into that nose.

269
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:27,039
- I see, I see.
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:28,340
I gotcha.

271
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,675
Yeah, I've been waiting
for you all day.

272
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,244
I was hoping you'd come today.

273
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,578
So basically,
it's a little pageant girl

274
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:37,447
that ate too much candy...

275
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,720
and she became the rock candy,
and she's a little crazy.

276
00:12:40,755 --> 00:12:43,791
I wasn't sure if I
should add more candies to it.

277
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:45,259
I mean,
that's what the challenge is.

278
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:46,426
Yeah.

279
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,694
So I would take advantage
of the candy.

280
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:49,095
Otherwise you're gonna wind up

281
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,763
just a face with a couple
of little things here and there.

282
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:52,497
Now, how are you doing
time-wise?

283
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:53,966
I think, so far, so good.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,467
I want to get these molded
today, so--

285
00:12:55,502 --> 00:12:56,801
- Everything?
- Yeah.

286
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,336
- That's aggressive.
- Yeah.

287
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,637
You know, you're at a point
now where it's--

288
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:00,972
everything is rough,

289
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,940
so you need to leave yourself
enough time to...

290
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,108
Certainly.

291
00:13:04,142 --> 00:13:05,175
- ...smooth it out.
- Yeah.

292
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,510
Tell us
what you have going here.

293
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:09,078
Okay.
She's a sinister tooth fairy.

294
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,747
She gives candy to the kids
to rot their teeth.

295
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,783
Try to think of something else
to do with the nose.

296
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:16,019
Either give yourself a little
bit more of a bump here...

297
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,422
- A bump.
- ...or extend it down.

298
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:19,756
'Cause this from a distance

299
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,392
is almost going to read
like a regular nose.

300
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,160
- Regular nose, right, okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:25,897
I like your sculpture.
It has a nice flow to it.

302
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,531
What are you planning on doing
with the mouth?

303
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:29,067
All I'm gonna do is--

304
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,102
this arm's actually gonna be
sculpted in with a chess piece.

305
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:32,437
Right.

306
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:34,406
So the actor's real arm
could be underneath

307
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,441
to operate
the tongue moving around,

308
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,811
so it's not
just a big, rubber head.

309
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:41,313
All right, everybody,
good luck tomorrow.

310
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:44,516
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

311
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,184
After hearing
from Mr. Westmore,

312
00:13:46,219 --> 00:13:48,220
I don't feel so nervous.

313
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:50,122
And I know it still looks
like a kitty cat,

314
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:52,425
but I have to keep going.

315
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,795
I can't waste all this time
sculpting just the face.

316
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:02,869
So I finished
with my sculpting,

317
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:07,173
and I'm ready to mold
my facial prosthetic.

318
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:10,543
I chose silicone because I want
to color the silicone,

319
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:12,812
so I don't have to think
about airbrushing it

320
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:14,480
on a vacation day.

321
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,883
This is my second time
pouring silicone.

322
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:18,452
Every day here, I'm learning,

323
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:21,021
and I feel
that I'm getting better.

324
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:26,793
I think I'm gonna be
silicone master.

325
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:29,562
I finished the face mold,
and now,

326
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:31,464
I want to incorporate licorice
into the chest,

327
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:34,533
and I pressed the candy
into the clay,

328
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,168
so that way,
I know where it goes

329
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:38,504
when the foam latex
is complete.

330
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:40,840
It's kind of like a map.

331
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,876
End of day one,
I'm sitting pretty good.

332
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,582
I've molded my face sculpture,
I've molded my head sculpture.

333
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:49,550
But I'm looking around, and
everyone's hustling, bustling,

334
00:14:49,585 --> 00:14:51,052
trying to finish their pieces.

335
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:52,520
And I'm kind of
in a relaxed mode, man.

336
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:53,988
- Nice, man.
- Have a good day.

337
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,923
That's time.
Tools down.

338
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,533
Good job, buddy.

339
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:09,869
- Coming in.
- All right.

340
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,041
You're getting
really nice edges.

341
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:14,209
Thanks.

342
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,343
Day two.
It's another ten-hour day.

343
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:16,612
I still have quite a bit to do,

344
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,314
but I'm gonna get busy.

345
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:21,551
I'm sculpting the arms
and blocking out the feet

346
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:23,431
and getting ready for texture.

347
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:28,925
Overnight, I thought of adding
another element to my character,

348
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,927
which is going to be
this gingerbread house

349
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,407
that's morphing
out of her back.

350
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:35,932
It's something
that the hag would use

351
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:38,603
to lure children
into their homes.

352
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:45,674
My plan for the day is
to get this headpiece finished

353
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:47,043
and ready for foam.

354
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,044
And because this wig piece
is one

355
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,246
of the main elements
of this makeup,

356
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,683
I'm spending
quite a bit of time on it.

357
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,318
Are you gonna put licorice
in that or--

358
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:57,087
No, I'm-- I think I'm gonna
color it like cotton candy.

359
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,189
I have to finish

360
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,592
all my sculpting
for all my pieces

361
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,127
that are gonna go
all over her body.

362
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,929
I think I'm gonna go
with silicone

363
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,597
just for it being
a little bit more flexible

364
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,599
and moving more natural
with the face.

365
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,468
But it's definitely a risk
because I don't have

366
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,453
much experience
at all applying it.

367
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,177
I already have the face,
and I'm working on the costumes.

368
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,080
I'm making a top
out of the burlap,

369
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,282
so I can put the candies on it.

370
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,491
- This looks awesome.
- Thank you.

371
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,456
I'm actually having
quite a bit of difficulty

372
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,025
with my grip strength
in my hand.

373
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,388
What the hell?

374
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,464
I'm really frustrated

375
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,843
because I cannot get
the mold apart.

376
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,337
Why aren't you coming out?

377
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:46,573
And then my mannequin rips off.

378
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:51,365
I'm feeling pretty screwed
at this point.

379
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:57,349
I don't-- I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

380
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:03,743
Why aren't you coming out?

381
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:05,479
It's the second day
of our candy challenge,

382
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:08,448
and this issue with my hands
is really compounding things.

383
00:17:08,482 --> 00:17:11,317
I went to pry it off,
and the whole core broke.

384
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:12,852
I'm feeling pretty screwed
at this point

385
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:17,990
because you have to have a core
for that foam to form around.

386
00:17:18,024 --> 00:17:21,794
But I'm not a quitter.
I don't like to give up.

387
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,398
So I start looking around trying
to find the exact same mannequin

388
00:17:25,432 --> 00:17:27,867
that I can actually use
as a core

389
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,702
because I have to try
to get it run in foam today.

390
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:31,170
It's gonna work,

391
00:17:31,204 --> 00:17:33,572
but prying the previous
mannequin out of this mold

392
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:35,407
wasted lots of valuable time,

393
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,776
but I'm trying not to think
about it at all,

394
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:40,445
trying to power through it.

395
00:17:40,479 --> 00:17:45,116
I'm able to get my foam latex
face and head molded,

396
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,953
and I start pre-painting.

397
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:49,488
So I'm a little bit
ahead of the game.

398
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:51,223
I need to pre-paint them

399
00:17:51,257 --> 00:17:55,461
because I'm adding candy
into the head.

400
00:17:58,031 --> 00:18:00,466
Finally finished
molding my wig piece

401
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,801
and the rest of day two,

402
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,537
I'm basically trying to get
all the elements I need

403
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,005
for the costume.

404
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:08,708
Start building the applets
by taking the lollipops

405
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:12,245
and gluing licorice
all the way around it.

406
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,452
We have a little less
than an hour left,

407
00:18:18,486 --> 00:18:21,054
but I only have one half
of my body molded.

408
00:18:22,556 --> 00:18:23,723
This fat suit turns out

409
00:18:23,757 --> 00:18:29,729
to be
a 250-pound mold,

410
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,498
and I have a lot of work
ahead of me

411
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:34,033
to get this completed.

412
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,101
All right!

413
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,474
Hoo-ha!

414
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:46,210
It's the end of day two,

415
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:48,811
and I'm actually pretty happy
with my character.

416
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:51,113
Everybody, time's up.

417
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:53,515
I've already glued
all the candy in the face.

418
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,883
I already have it
pre-painted,

419
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:58,889
so I think I'm ready
for tomorrow.

420
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:09,933
It's application day.

421
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,101
We got four hours in the shop,

422
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,137
one hour at last looks
at the stage,

423
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:15,349
so I'm gonna have to hustle.

424
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:19,911
Going into an application day
with immunity

425
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:21,380
is a completely
different feeling.

426
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:23,248
If there is ever a time

427
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:24,917
where I'm gonna take my time
on something

428
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:26,252
that I want to see
done correctly,

429
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:28,584
it's gonna be the application.

430
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,998
Oh, boy.

431
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:37,566
Hello!

432
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,134
- How's it going, man?
- Good. Thanks.

433
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,302
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

434
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,037
Can you try this on?

435
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,572
You're gonna be Colonel Candy.

436
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:47,376
This leg's gonna be out,
and this leg will be tucked in.

437
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,148
First, I glue on
her belly appliance,

438
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:53,650
which works fabulously.

439
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:55,385
All right, let's try this on,
see what you think.

440
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,320
I glue on her face appliance.

441
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,922
This thing is literally
coming to life,

442
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:01,725
and it's grotesque.
I love it.

443
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:07,364
I'm just starting to glue down
my silicone piece to my model.

444
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:10,934
This is not sticking right,
and it just keeps on lifting up.

445
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:11,935
I'm a little bit nervous

446
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,604
since I worked with a material

447
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:16,173
that I don't normally
work with.

448
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:18,908
I just have no time
to lose today.

449
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:21,411
How does that feel?

450
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:23,813
I have to paint my model green,

451
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,950
and the head still looks
a little catlike to me,

452
00:20:26,984 --> 00:20:30,787
but it looks a little better
than I thought it would look.

453
00:20:30,821 --> 00:20:32,689
All right, buddy.

454
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,092
This-- oh, it does come up
really nice and hot.

455
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:38,228
Oh, thank God.

456
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:44,234
I'm melting bag after bag
of gummy products

457
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,104
to start coating my model with.

458
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:48,472
Alex, look at the blob.

459
00:20:48,506 --> 00:20:50,874
I know!
Isn't that crazy?

460
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:52,476
I'm starting to get nervous.

461
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,978
I'm going really subtle,

462
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:55,946
and that might be
the wrong thing to do,

463
00:20:55,981 --> 00:21:00,950
so I'm really worried about
what the judges are gonna think.

464
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:02,480
I start painting,

465
00:21:02,514 --> 00:21:05,482
and I'm having some issues
controlling my airbrush.

466
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,551
I'm pushing the trigger harder
than I think I should,

467
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:10,187
but with my fingers being numb,
I can't tell until it comes out.

468
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:13,622
And then I realize,
oh, no, it's too much.

469
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:15,891
This is not
my favorite challenge.

470
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:18,093
There's a lot of bright,
vivid colors in candy, which--

471
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:20,429
I don't use a lot of those
in my makeups.

472
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:21,763
So I really don't know

473
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:24,032
what my color palette's
gonna be at this point.

474
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,368
I'm just trying to make the best
of it and get the pieces done,

475
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,571
get the candy in there,
and then see what happens.

476
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:30,260
Close.

477
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:35,043
Turn your head slightly
that way.

478
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:37,746
I really want it to read
as a lollipop.

479
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,882
I think incorporating glitter
and also sprinkles,

480
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,486
it might give it
a fun, playful look.

481
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,457
You're gonna be smelling
like gummies.

482
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:52,627
I'm making the biggest mess
of melted gummy bears

483
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:55,163
and dumping gelatins
on my blob.

484
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:56,726
It's so fun.

485
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,403
Eric's makeup is just
a pile of mess.

486
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:02,971
It's disgusting.

487
00:22:03,005 --> 00:22:05,179
It's just gross.

488
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:09,210
What's the time?

489
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,400
Seven minutes.

490
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,541
Ahhh.

491
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:19,753
At this point, I can't even
look at what other people

492
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:22,856
are doing around the lab
because I am

493
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,558
definitely in trouble here
with this makeup.

494
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,077
So I'm just concentrating
on what's on my plate.

495
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:30,930
Time.

496
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:33,066
I am absolutely terrified.

497
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,569
I should have gone
with more wacky

498
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:37,571
instead of such a subtle look.

499
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,741
But I can't really throw
in the towel

500
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,611
because I don't want
to go home.

501
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:44,212
Coming up...

502
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:47,717
My actor is stuck to the floor.

503
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:50,454
There was absolutely no candy
in this makeup.

504
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:53,725
It's just so wrought
with technical issues.

505
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:56,227
This is one of
the best depictions of gluttony

506
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:57,829
I've ever seen.

507
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,778
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

508
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:06,047
We have an hour for last looks,

509
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:07,516
and I've got to get
the mouth glued down,

510
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,600
and I've got to start
incorporating the rock candy.

511
00:23:13,253 --> 00:23:16,122
I know I need to incorporate
more of the rock candy

512
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:17,656
coming out of her skin,

513
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:19,958
but I'm really nervous
because I don't know

514
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:22,250
if I'm gonna make it
prominent enough.

515
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,031
With all the melted down
gummy bears,

516
00:23:27,065 --> 00:23:31,435
my actor is literally
stuck to the floor,

517
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:35,238
and I only got ten minutes
to get this solved.

518
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:46,347
Brushes down, guys.
That's time.

519
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:50,049
I'm really embarrassed
to have this go out onstage.

520
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,185
I'm not feeling very good
at this point at all.

521
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:03,695
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

522
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:07,265
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

523
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,733
First,
say hello to your judges--

524
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:12,071
owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

525
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:14,006
- Good evening.
- Hey, Glenn.

526
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,742
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

527
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,977
Hello,
you sa-weet things, you.

528
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:22,682
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

529
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:23,683
Hello, everyone.

530
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,151
- Hello.
- Hi.

531
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:27,020
And joining our panel
this week,

532
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:28,789
he's an incredibly
talented artist

533
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:32,326
whose work often features
a confectionery utopia

534
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,096
and has been showcased
in galleries all over the world.

535
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,332
He's also been a frequent
Katy Perry collaborator

536
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,833
and was the artistic director

537
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:42,936
for her sweets-themed
<i>California Gurls</i> video.

538
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:45,072
Please welcome Will Cotton.

539
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,643
Thank you so much
for being here.

540
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:50,312
Thank you.
I'm so excited to be here,

541
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:52,548
and I can't wait to see
what you guys do.

542
00:24:52,582 --> 00:24:55,551
Will Cotton is art director
for Katy Perry.

543
00:24:55,585 --> 00:24:57,519
My creature looks
like Katy Perry,

544
00:24:57,554 --> 00:24:59,088
and they got Will Cotton?

545
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,189
He's awesome.

546
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:01,991
So this week,
your spotlight challenge

547
00:25:02,025 --> 00:25:05,395
was to create
a candy character or creature

548
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,331
incorporating actual treats
into your makeups.

549
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,066
So let's see
what you've come up with.

550
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:35,439
It's grotesque and yet
hilarious at the same time.

551
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:36,774
Everyone's cracking up

552
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:38,643
watching this belly come to life

553
00:25:38,677 --> 00:25:41,246
so I'm feeling pretty
positive about it.

554
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:02,536
I'm hating the stupid wig.

555
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:05,606
What the hell was I thinking?

556
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:26,563
I hate it.

557
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:27,764
She looks grey.

558
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:30,133
All the colors
just turned muddy.

559
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:49,888
I wish I had
just a little more time

560
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:51,490
to incorporate more candy,

561
00:26:51,524 --> 00:26:52,956
and I wish I would have
pushed myself a little harder

562
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,960
to be more creative
with the candy elements

563
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:57,062
in my character.

564
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,851
I wish I had made
different creative choices.

565
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:21,923
Everyone has so much candy
on theirs,

566
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:25,827
and I'm definitely the person
with the least amount of candy.

567
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:46,984
I feel pretty confident
in my makeup,

568
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:50,689
and hopefully,
I'll be in the top.

569
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:16,340
Reba's a lollipop character,
and I think she looks cute.

570
00:28:36,027 --> 00:28:38,061
It's a little more playful
than the other designs,

571
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,429
but I like that.

572
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:41,498
It looks like he walked
out of some cartoon

573
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:44,668
and into the real world.

574
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:10,426
I feel good about this makeup
'cause he looks creepy.

575
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:11,760
He's missing hands,

576
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:14,896
so that's the only thing
I'm worried about.

577
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:38,853
My character looks pretty.

578
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:42,089
She looks like she just popped
up from, like, candy world.

579
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:10,450
This creature is everything
I hoped it would be and more.

580
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:15,020
I am feeling so proud
of this creation.

581
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:22,528
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

582
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:30,603
It's just amazing.

583
00:30:30,637 --> 00:30:33,506
- Oh, my God.
- Do you belly dance?

584
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,775
I like the fact that he used--
all these are different colors.

585
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:39,578
I didn't even realize it
till we got up close.

586
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:41,999
- Wow.
- It's a bit of a mess.

587
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,891
Now, this is a curiosity.

588
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:56,262
The top of my fairy's head
is starting to collapse.

589
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:58,430
The whole thing looks
like a mask to me.

590
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:00,599
I don't have a good paint job.

591
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:03,735
I don't have enough candy
incorporated into my makeup.

592
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,939
I'm going home.

593
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,467
The whole thing looks
like a mask to me.

594
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,870
The top of my fairy's head
is starting to collapse.

595
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:15,638
And the wrinkles
have no weight,

596
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,590
- they're just gouges again.
- Yeah.

597
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:22,378
Look at this beautiful little
diorama happening back here.

598
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,947
That in itself is
a really powerful image.

599
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,451
This edge
is absolutely aberrant.

600
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:29,986
- It's off.
- Yeah.

601
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,251
I can put my finger
underneath it.

602
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,427
It looks like he embedded
this candy in cookie dough.

603
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:39,165
That's, like, out of the park.

604
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,734
- Is it silicone?
- Looks like it.

605
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,685
I love its translucency.

606
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:49,573
Wow.

607
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,841
Careful.
Might bite you.

608
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,143
He tried a lot of things here.

609
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,512
I mean, I'll definitely
give him that.

610
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:55,347
There's some beautiful work
on the back.

611
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:57,133
All right.

612
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,557
Will, how do you think
they did tonight?

613
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:07,260
It's so much more demonic than
I would have ever anticipated.

614
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:11,397
But really incredible work.

615
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,500
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations.

616
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:15,168
Let's find out
what they thought.

617
00:32:15,203 --> 00:32:17,705
Eric Z,

618
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:19,907
Meagan,

619
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,775
Anthony,

620
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,345
Wayne,

621
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:27,248
Eric F,

622
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:30,317
you are all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

623
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:31,419
Thank you.

624
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:34,789
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

625
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:37,558
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

626
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:40,294
The judges will now speak
with each of you

627
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:41,762
to learn more about your work.

628
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:44,732
Alam, please step forward.

629
00:32:48,304 --> 00:32:49,837
Tell us about your creation.

630
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:51,940
She's the Princess
of the Candy World,

631
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:55,543
and I got inspired
from Asian animation.

632
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:59,280
The lifeless approach to the

633
00:32:59,315 --> 00:33:01,149
face gives it a toy quality

634
00:33:01,183 --> 00:33:03,051
that I think merges very nicely

635
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:06,454
with the aesthetic
of this challenge.

636
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:09,358
Alam, I think you did a great
job of integrating the candy.

637
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:11,793
- It's very sweet.
- Thank you.

638
00:33:11,828 --> 00:33:14,396
The costuming piece
is really smart

639
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:17,132
how you built
these different layers

640
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:18,600
and components
out of the candy.

641
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:19,901
She's a cohesive package.

642
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:21,836
I like this.

643
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,304
Alam, I love
the reference to anime.

644
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:24,506
I think it's a great piece.

645
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,443
- Thank you.
- Alam, thank you very much.

646
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:32,347
Jenna.

647
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:37,486
Okay, Jenna, would you tell us

648
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,987
a little bit
about your character?

649
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:41,724
She tries to get
the children to eat candy

650
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:44,794
so that their teeth will rot
so that she can have them.

651
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:46,729
I understand that you have
that rock candy crown,

652
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:49,098
but there was
absolutely no candy

653
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:52,468
anywhere in this makeup.

654
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:53,736
It doesn't really feel like

655
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:55,605
you've accomplished
the challenge for me.

656
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:59,809
Your sculpting just looks
like big gouges and cuts.

657
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:02,078
It really makes me think
of the Hansel and Gretel witch

658
00:34:02,113 --> 00:34:05,815
because she uses this attractive
item to bring the children

659
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:07,350
in this gingerbread house,

660
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:10,287
and that's the part that's
missing from this character.

661
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:12,889
She's missing
that effective lure.

662
00:34:12,924 --> 00:34:15,926
Jenna, thank you.

663
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,730
Alex, you're up.

664
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:25,269
Tell us about the concept.

665
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,504
This is a character
that ate too much candy

666
00:34:27,538 --> 00:34:29,806
at the pageant
and then became the candy.

667
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:31,275
So it was coming out
of the skin,

668
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,643
and she became evil,

669
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:33,944
and she goes after
and kills the other kids

670
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,004
'cause she wants their candy.

671
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:37,205
In regard *
make up application.

672
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:41,954
You've got some troubles
going on there.

673
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:43,388
There's
an appalling lack of makeup

674
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:45,357
for the amount of time
that you have.

675
00:34:45,392 --> 00:34:46,959
I just don't know what you did.

676
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:49,695
It's not even glued down.
How did that happen?

677
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,995
She wasn't in it that long.

678
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:52,332
Well, this is the first time

679
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:53,900
I actually applied
a silicone appliance.

680
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,435
But you have to seal
the edges on silicone.

681
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:59,306
You can't just, like, stick it
down and hope for the best.

682
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,710
Alex, thank you.
Please step back.

683
00:35:03,744 --> 00:35:07,614
Kris, you're next.

684
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:10,951
Hi, Kris.

685
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,386
Well, first off, let me hear
about your concept.

686
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,390
I came up with a character
that is night of Halloween

687
00:35:16,425 --> 00:35:17,892
where the candy comes alive,

688
00:35:17,926 --> 00:35:19,193
and so the kids
eating the candy--

689
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:21,095
- he would eat the kids.
- I love that.

690
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,231
To me, it feels
anatomically believable.

691
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:25,534
There is something
about the way

692
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,136
the candy corns grow out
of the face.

693
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,505
- I love it.
- Thank you.

694
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:31,540
Most of all, I love
his candy corn fingernails...

695
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:34,610
And his lovely
candy corn teeth...

696
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:36,813
Which are very disturbing.

697
00:35:36,847 --> 00:35:38,848
- Thank you.
- This is a lot of work.

698
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:42,285
Head-to-toe has been addressed,
and I love the concept of using

699
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:46,189
the licorice on the chest
as pectoral muscle definition.

700
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:47,257
It's a great piece.

701
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,925
Thank you very much.

702
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,695
- Kris, please step back.
- Thanks a lot.

703
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,565
House.

704
00:35:56,635 --> 00:35:59,404
Please tell me the concept
behind your candy character.

705
00:35:59,438 --> 00:36:00,905
The belly was the first thing
that came to me.

706
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,207
A large stomach that she kept
feeding with candy,

707
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,543
and it had a voracious appetite
of its own.

708
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:07,278
Did you know
that she is a belly dancer?

709
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:09,648
- No, I did not.
- Can you do that some more?

710
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:11,516
- That's awesome.
- Oh, my God.

711
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:15,987
This conceptually
is a really great piece.

712
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:17,721
The mouth
is a show-stopper.

713
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:20,090
The gullet's a great shape,

714
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:23,994
but the worst part of this is
body paint that abruptly stops.

715
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:27,130
But this one is such
a great concept.

716
00:36:27,165 --> 00:36:29,065
I just love it for that.

717
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,868
House, this is one of
the best depictions of gluttony

718
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:33,270
I've ever seen.

719
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:35,272
- It blows me away.
- Thank you.

720
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:37,174
House, thank you very much.
Please step back.

721
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,444
Thank you.

722
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:43,714
Autumn, please step forward.

723
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:47,752
Yow.

724
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:49,954
Autumn, explain to us
your concept.

725
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:52,923
He's a gummy bear, and he's
the one everybody picks out,

726
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:54,825
so he's going sour.

727
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:56,493
Most of the things
that you tried to do

728
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:58,796
didn't work out for you.

729
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,898
You're in trouble when
my favorite part of your makeup

730
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:02,466
is the wardrobe.

731
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:03,868
I think your idea
of the little hands

732
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,704
with the gumdrops is very cute,
and you matched his feet.

733
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:08,339
That's all great.

734
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:12,210
He does, however, look more
like a cat than a bear.

735
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:14,346
There's no transition
whatsoever

736
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,648
between piece of rubber
and skin.

737
00:37:16,683 --> 00:37:22,254
It's just so wrought
with so many technical issues.

738
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:26,625
Autumn, please step back.

739
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:28,660
Okay, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

740
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:29,928
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

741
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:33,265
while they make
their decisions.

742
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,269
All right, guys,

743
00:37:36,303 --> 00:37:38,671
why don't we start with some
of the looks you like the most?

744
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:40,140
Alam.

745
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,275
I absolutely adore
the combination of the candy

746
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,645
with the lifeless doll face
that she put on the thing.

747
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,414
This was the only character
here for me tonight

748
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:50,183
that I would actually want
to put in a painting.

749
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:51,517
Let's move on to Kris.

750
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:54,453
He works from far away
as just a demon...

751
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:55,588
Yeah.

752
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:56,889
And then when you get close up,

753
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:59,292
it has all the notes of
the candy, which is a challenge.

754
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:01,828
I think it's probably
the most well done makeup.

755
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,830
- Yeah.
- Let's move on to House.

756
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,700
The concept is so bold,

757
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:09,069
and that's what I personally
love in a character design.

758
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,138
I felt like I was seeing
a new character

759
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:13,039
that I'll probably
never forget.

760
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:16,375
Let's move on
to the bottom looks.

761
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,177
Let's start with Alex.

762
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:20,246
We can go on all day
about the technical problems

763
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,348
because there's
no shortage of them,

764
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:23,783
but it starts with the idea.

765
00:38:23,817 --> 00:38:27,053
Yeah, I understood the notion
of eating so much candy,

766
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:28,688
and it's starting
to work its way out,

767
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:31,758
but why did it have to be themed
in a pageant?

768
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,160
Okay, let's move on to Jenna.

769
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:36,629
She's making a lot of mistakes
sort of week after week.

770
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:39,732
It's almost something
that had a cool idea behind it

771
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:42,201
that could have been awesome,
but it's not getting there.

772
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:44,570
I feel bad for her
that her hands are messed up,

773
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:45,838
but she still doesn't have

774
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:47,339
the ability
to make smart decisions,

775
00:38:47,373 --> 00:38:49,474
and that doesn't have anything
to do with her hands.

776
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:51,109
Let's move on to Autumn.

777
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:53,211
- A gummy bear gone bad.
- Mm-hmm.

778
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:55,346
I'm sorry,
but a gummy bear head

779
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,148
- is not a very tough sculpture.
- Yeah.

780
00:38:58,183 --> 00:38:59,149
And if you're struggling
with that,

781
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,784
what else have you got?

782
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:02,919
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

783
00:39:02,954 --> 00:39:04,254
Yes, we have.

784
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:08,057
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

785
00:39:13,063 --> 00:39:16,566
Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

786
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,302
Alam, you had
a really cool, artificial,

787
00:39:19,336 --> 00:39:21,471
toy-like nature
to your makeup,

788
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,005
and you did a really good job

789
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,540
bringing the candy
into that design.

790
00:39:24,574 --> 00:39:27,743
Kris, really interesting
design choices,

791
00:39:27,777 --> 00:39:29,645
and you also made a lot
of great decisions

792
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,314
in the way that you integrated
the candy into your makeup.

793
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:33,748
House.

794
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,851
Extremely strong concept,

795
00:39:35,885 --> 00:39:37,252
and we really appreciate
what you did

796
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,054
with your character's profile.

797
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:41,523
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

798
00:39:41,557 --> 00:39:45,494
Tonight's winner is--

799
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:51,107
- Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

800
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:55,478
Tonight's winner is...

801
00:39:55,513 --> 00:39:59,315
Kris.

802
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,485
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

803
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,754
Your use of candy,
the different textures,

804
00:40:03,788 --> 00:40:04,822
the sculpture--

805
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:06,257
everything worked well
for you tonight.

806
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:07,492
Fantastic.
Thank you so much.

807
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:08,793
Well done.

808
00:40:08,828 --> 00:40:10,662
I am in complete shock.

809
00:40:10,697 --> 00:40:12,431
Finally, I stopped
Anthony's winning streak.

810
00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:14,232
It's truly a good feeling.

811
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:16,001
Kris, congratulations.

812
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:17,269
You can head
back to the makeup room.

813
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:19,004
Thank you.

814
00:40:19,038 --> 00:40:22,307
Alam and House,
you are also safe this week

815
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:23,774
and can head back
to the makeup room.

816
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:27,544
Thank you.

817
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:29,578
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

818
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:31,380
were on the bottom this week,

819
00:40:31,414 --> 00:40:33,815
and one of you
will be eliminated.

820
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,544
Please step forward.

821
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,791
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

822
00:40:44,826 --> 00:40:48,561
Alex, we had a really
hard time understanding exactly

823
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:51,663
what it was that you spent
all of your time on this week.

824
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:54,765
Jenna, candy really
didn't integrate

825
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,900
into your makeup at all.

826
00:40:56,934 --> 00:41:00,702
Autumn, your second-guessing
was very evident

827
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,070
in your final makeup.

828
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:04,405
So who is going home tonight?

829
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,409
The person
going home tonight is...

830
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,647
Alex.

831
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:19,886
If you're going
to only show us one piece,

832
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,321
it needs to be perfect,
and this wasn't.

833
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:24,522
I absolutely agree.

834
00:41:24,557 --> 00:41:27,091
Alex, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

835
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,393
That means the rest of you
are safe this week

836
00:41:29,427 --> 00:41:33,996
and can head back
to the makeup room.

837
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:35,130
You have talent.

838
00:41:35,165 --> 00:41:37,399
It's obvious,
so I wish you luck.

839
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,100
I appreciate the chance I got

840
00:41:39,135 --> 00:41:41,136
to actually show you
a little bit of my craft.

841
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,971
It's been really great
having you here with us.

842
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:44,706
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

843
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:46,108
and pack up your kit.

844
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:49,445
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

845
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,113
This has been a wild ride,

846
00:41:51,148 --> 00:41:56,619
and I definitely think
I made friends till the end.

847
00:41:56,653 --> 00:41:58,387
Third time's the charm.

848
00:41:58,422 --> 00:41:59,822
- What?
- What?

849
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:03,526
I knew this was gonna be tough
competition coming out here,

850
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,162
but I am so not ready
to go home.

851
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:09,800
Even though I am not proud
of the note that I'm leaving,

852
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:13,070
you haven't seen everything
from me yet.

853
00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:15,039
I'll definitely be around.
