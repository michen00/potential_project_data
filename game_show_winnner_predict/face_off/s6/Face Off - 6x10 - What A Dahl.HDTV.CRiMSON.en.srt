1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:01,891
It's a black hole
of original thought.

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:03,025
It's an awesome makeup.

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,962
It's kind of
like bondage Rambo.

4
00:00:05,996 --> 00:00:07,697
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:10,399
Daran's multiple-faced victim
brought him his third win...

6
00:00:10,434 --> 00:00:11,534
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

7
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:15,371
...and Corinne was sent home.

8
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,173
Now, seven artists remain.

9
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:19,976
Tonight they dive into a world
of whimsical beasts.

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,445
- Never-seen-before characters.
- Cool.

11
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,281
I'm ready to embrace anything
that's on the immature side.

12
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:27,817
But some struggle to bring
their creations to life.

13
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:29,252
If you have the time,
do a cowl.

14
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:31,420
- It could only help you.
- That's fucking risky, dude.

15
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:32,688
Everything we do is risky.

16
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,323
I think your character needs
a little more power to it.

17
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:35,625
I keep looking at it

18
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,660
and I'm like,
"Oh, shit, he's right."

19
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:41,297
Head to toe, you've
really done a beautiful job.

20
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,431
It doesn't
feel like a predator.

21
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,432
It feels more like it would

22
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:44,967
be subject to gang beatings.

23
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,636
In the end, only one will win

24
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,971
a VIP trip
from Kryolan Professional Makeup

25
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,208
to one of their
85 international locations,

26
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:55,111
a brand-new
2014 Fiat 500,

27
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,013
and $100,000.

28
00:00:57,047 --> 00:01:00,049
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

29
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,187
<i>Face Off!</i>

30
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:08,224
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

32
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:52,134
I can't believe
that you and Corinne

33
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,469
were on the bottom.

34
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:55,438
I didn't want
either one of you guys goin'.

35
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,973
Being on the bottom
for the first time

36
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,274
and just seeing the red lights,

37
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,276
it was weird and not a position

38
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,344
I want to be in again.

39
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:02,845
Corinne's an awesome artist,

40
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,714
and I thought
I was gonna go home.

41
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,749
It was very frightening,
and it's not a place

42
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:07,850
I want to be at again.

43
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:09,318
There's less than half of us.

44
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,987
- We started with 15 people.
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:13,222
This far in a competition
means you have to dig deep

46
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:17,193
because any little mistake
can send you home.

47
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,666
What do we got now?

48
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,368
- Hm, Kidspace.
- Kidspace.

49
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,635
I love kids.

50
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,838
We're walkin' up
to the Kidspace Museum.

51
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:30,206
Ooh.
What is this?

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,074
There's all sorts
of cool learning contraptions.

53
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,075
- Nice.
- Oh, cool.

54
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,344
Oh.
Oh, there she is.

55
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:39,015
There's McKenzie standin'
next to a giant box of crayons.

56
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,616
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,385
And I'm ready
to embrace anything

58
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,687
that's on the immature side.

59
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,757
Welcome to Kidspace Museum
in Pasadena,

60
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,459
it's a place for children
to explore their creativity

61
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,561
and learn
in a fun, hands-on way.

62
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:55,398
I brought you here because
like your next challenge,

63
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:58,367
it was designed
to inspire the imagination.

64
00:02:58,402 --> 00:02:59,668
Good.

65
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,904
Today, we'll be entering
the whimsical world

66
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,773
- of children's books...
- Ooh.

67
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,074
Which have been
the source of some

68
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,476
of Hollywood's most
successful films,

69
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,645
like<i> Charlie</i>
<i>And The Chocolate Factory,</i>

70
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,414
<i>The Fantastic Mr. Fox,</i>

71
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,416
and<i> James And The Giant Peach.</i>

72
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,284
Oh, nice.

73
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:16,786
All of these
sprang from the mind

74
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,755
of best-selling
children's author Roald Dahl.

75
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,524
- Wow, nice.
- Oh.

76
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:24,093
It touches me in a way
'cause I've opened my creativity

77
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,529
so much reading
Roald Dahl's books as a kid.

78
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:28,030
We are lucky enough
to have someone

79
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:31,400
here with us today
who's very close to the source.

80
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:33,836
Please welcome author,
screenwriter,

81
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,073
and Roald Dahl's daughter,
Lucy Dahl.

82
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,075
- Cool.
- Amazing.

83
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,376
It's really an honor
to have a daughter

84
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,711
of the guy
that we all loved as a kid.

85
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,280
- Lucy, hello.
- Hi.

86
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:45,448
Thank you so much
for being here with us.

87
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:46,882
Thank you for having me.

88
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:48,584
Well, this year
is the 50th anniversary

89
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:50,719
of<i> Charlie</i>
<i>And The Chocolate Factory.</i>

90
00:03:50,754 --> 00:03:51,821
Yes.

91
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:53,289
Why do you think
this has resonated

92
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:55,057
so profoundly with people?

93
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:57,326
Chocolate.

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,928
Being able to go into a world

95
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:00,229
that you don't really think

96
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:01,764
that you can ever
normally go into,

97
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:05,301
like a chocolate factory
with chocolate rivers.

98
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:06,735
Actually,
one of my first memories

99
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,170
was going into
the real chocolate room

100
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:11,340
in the first film,
which was amazing.

101
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:12,575
Oh, awesome.

102
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,410
While we will
never forget characters

103
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:16,378
like Willy Wonka,
Miss Trunchbull,

104
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:19,415
and the Oompa Loompas,
not all of Dahl's creations

105
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,917
have come to life
on the silver screen.

106
00:04:21,952 --> 00:04:24,620
The Oompa Loompa-eating
Whangdoodle,

107
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:28,824
Hornswogglers, Vermicious Knids,
and Snozzwangers

108
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:31,861
have fascinated
my father's fan base for years,

109
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,529
but they've never
been seen on-screen.

110
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:35,631
He only described them
as living

111
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:37,399
in the thickest of jungles

112
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:40,603
and the most dangerous beasts
in the world.

113
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:43,305
Each crayon
in this box contains

114
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,342
the name of one
of these unseen beasts.

115
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:49,645
Your spotlight challenge
is to select one of them

116
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,247
and use its name to inspire

117
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,849
a wild and whimsical beast
that would feel

118
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:56,585
right at home
in the world of Roald Dahl.

119
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,786
Oh, yes.

120
00:04:57,821 --> 00:04:58,787
- Nice.
- All right.

121
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,289
Graham, you're up first.

122
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,529
Snozzwanger.

123
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,397
Hornswogglers.

124
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,466
Vermicious Knids?

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,968
Vermicious Knids.

126
00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:15,271
Hornswogglers.

127
00:05:15,305 --> 00:05:18,407
Whangdoodle.

128
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:22,711
We're both Whangdoodles.

129
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,113
And I'm very happy to report

130
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:25,714
that Lucy will be joining us

131
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:28,117
on the reveal stage this week.

132
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,885
What should these guys
keep in mind

133
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,986
while working on their designs?

134
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,422
Exaggeration of the truth.

135
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,257
If you're nice,
you're really nice.

136
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,992
If you're horrible,
you're really horrible.

137
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:39,828
If you're spoiled,
you're really spoiled.

138
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:41,530
Just imagine what would eat
an Oompa Loompa.

139
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:44,867
All right, guys,
you have the extraordinary

140
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:47,036
opportunity to give fans
all over the world

141
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,940
a first glimpse of these
never-seen-before characters.

142
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:52,141
I'm going to leave you here

143
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:53,409
while you work on your designs.

144
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:54,743
When you're done,
you can head back

145
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:56,212
to the lab and get started.

146
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,613
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

147
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:00,115
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

148
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:02,718
Ooh.

149
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:05,020
This place is awesome.
I feel like a little kid.

150
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,489
There's all
these really cool bugs

151
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:09,325
and oversized game pieces.

152
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,327
It's crazy.

153
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,695
Working on this Whangdoodle

154
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,163
definitely brings out
the child in me

155
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:16,432
because<i> Willy Wonka</i>
<i>And The Chocolate Factory</i>

156
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:18,133
was one of
my favorite movies growing up.

157
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,402
For years, I wondered what
these creatures looked like.

158
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,570
And now, I'm actually
gettin' the chance

159
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:22,571
to design one of 'em.

160
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:24,340
I'm thinkin' Whangdoodles

161
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:27,009
has got to have some kind
of split personality.

162
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:28,577
Very yin and yang.

163
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,379
Whang would be
the serious side.

164
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:32,147
Hard-edged, straight lines.

165
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,250
And the Doodle
has to be the silly side,

166
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:35,784
swirly lines and circles.

167
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,886
If he catches an Oompa Loompa
and they sing a song

168
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,321
that he likes,
he'll let 'em go,

169
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:42,124
and if they don't,
he'll eat 'em.

170
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,997
Designing this character
is a real honor

171
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:50,366
because nobody
has seen these guys before.

172
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,268
There's no images of this,
no reference,

173
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:54,670
and I'm nervous because
I want to do it justice.

174
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:57,172
So I start
drawing a rabbit creature,

175
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,774
but it has this horrific mouth

176
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:01,310
with teeth
coming out of his chest.

177
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:04,413
He lures the Oompa Loompas in
and then eats 'em up.

178
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:12,488
Snozz sounded like "Schnoz,"

179
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:14,456
so I thought big elephant nose

180
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:17,293
and a huge,
scary monster mouth.

181
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,795
It lays traps
filled with Snozzberries

182
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,797
for the Oompa Loompas,
and then uses

183
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:24,833
its huge nose
to sniff them out.

184
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,305
The first thing
that comes to me

185
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,307
is a Venus flytrap.

186
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,008
I'm thinking
this little creature

187
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,343
that's like--

188
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,111
It's a very whimsical plant.

189
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,881
It's gonna be brightly colored
with a lot of teeth,

190
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,482
and it pops out of the forest

191
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,818
to eat these little orange men.

192
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,489
I got Whangdoodle.

193
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:49,591
Doodle, noodle,

194
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:52,836
worms, insect, and then bam.

195
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,100
These giant earth worm things

196
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,202
that would come out
and snatch the Oompa Loompas

197
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:58,670
and suck 'em back in.

198
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,038
I can't wait to get in the lab.

199
00:08:00,073 --> 00:08:01,673
- I gotta make this thing.
- All right, guys.

200
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,874
Let's go back to the lab.

201
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,844
So soon?

202
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,850
We get to the lab.
We have six hours.

203
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:14,453
First, we choose our model.

204
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:17,489
I start sculpting
my Hornswoggler's face.

205
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,658
So at first,
he's not gonna look scary.

206
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:21,960
He's just cute and silly.

207
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,929
He's gonna have
really big horns in the back

208
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,864
and big eyes on the side,

209
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:28,667
and a big smile with big teeth.

210
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,902
But if he sees an Oompa Loompa,

211
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:34,906
he becomes this vicious,
evil monster eater.

212
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:41,446
I'm not actually used to doin'
whimsical-type characters,

213
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,682
sometimes when I get in a little bit
of a jam or get stuck,

214
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:45,250
I just scribble
on a piece of paper

215
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:48,353
and try to get images
out of whatever I'm scribblin'.

216
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:51,189
Since it's a Hornswoggler,
it needs to have horns

217
00:08:51,224 --> 00:08:53,291
and a big mouth so it
can eat the Oompa Loompas.

218
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:55,994
For some reason, it's comin' out
lizard-y or froggy,

219
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,464
and I know kids love both,
so I'm gonna go with it.

220
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,504
I'm lookin'
at my Snozzwanger design,

221
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,773
and I'm thinking,
this thing is so silly-looking.

222
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:10,909
It'll probably be the weirdest
makeup that I've ever done.

223
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:12,911
The way that
this prosthetic is designed,

224
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:15,447
the nose is
actually on the forehead,

225
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,649
so it needs
to have an armature inside

226
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,651
to help the clay
to stay where I want it.

227
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,153
And the armature
has to be removable

228
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,155
so that I can cut off
the end of the nose,

229
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:25,023
remove that,
and then mold that separately.

230
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,491
So the model will be looking

231
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,727
through the nostrils
of the nose.

232
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,429
I would like
to win this challenge

233
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:33,198
to show the judges,
"Hey, like, you kept me around.

234
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:36,301
I'll show you somethin' else
that's really cool."

235
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,239
I'm sculpting my Whangdoodle,

236
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:43,675
and I'm tryin' to think of
how I'm gonna make these teeth.

237
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,045
So I end up grabbing 32 claws

238
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,214
that we have in the lab,
and I'm poppin' 'em in.

239
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,383
I'm like, "All right.
This is awesome."

240
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,751
These look cool.

241
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:54,853
So I'm sculpting
this Vermicious Knid,

242
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,855
and I'm realizing
as I'm doing it

243
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,056
that it's just not working.

244
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,258
I'm just kind of
pushing around clay.

245
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:04,362
I'm just not sure what
I want on this Loompa-eater,

246
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:09,594
so I wipe out what I have and start
sculpting more of a flytrap this way

247
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:11,963
with leaves behind it.

248
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:14,065
Hopefully, this works.

249
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:17,768
Hey, guys.
We're here to check on you.

250
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:18,769
- Hello.
- How are ya?

251
00:10:18,804 --> 00:10:19,971
Hey.

252
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:21,372
And so, he's gonna
have some big eyes

253
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:23,140
over here on the side,
and then I've got

254
00:10:23,175 --> 00:10:24,675
some horns that are gonna
go up the center.

255
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,676
I think you're catchin' it.

256
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,677
- I really do.
- Am I on track?

257
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:28,479
This character
could be salivating

258
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:29,680
thinking of Oompa Loompas.

259
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:32,016
Put a little K-Y jelly
or something in there

260
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,852
to really juicy-up
that lip and even--

261
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:37,588
- Keep Ve from touchin' it?
- Yeah.

262
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:40,124
I'm not sure what I want to do
with the mouth yet.

263
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:41,659
I would do somethin'--
like something round.

264
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:42,894
Like, so if you were lookin'--
actually looking

265
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:44,595
into a flower,
'cause then that could all

266
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,565
- be painted one color...
- Right.

267
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,533
...and-- and washed
over the top of it.

268
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:50,801
So when you look into there,

269
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:53,070
you're looking
into the inside of a flower.

270
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,272
Okay.

271
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:57,508
I'm thinking
of yellowish-orange tones.

272
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:58,709
If it's comin' up
out of the ground,

273
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,845
you shoot it
with a little water first,

274
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,581
hit it with brown hairspray,
and it just starts to drip,

275
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:04,782
'cause then it would look like

276
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:05,950
he's comin' up
out of the ground--

277
00:11:05,984 --> 00:11:06,951
and he's been wet,
and dirty, and--

278
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:07,985
Perfect.

279
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,487
Whang is more
like the serious side,

280
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,055
and Doodle is
more of the silly side.

281
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:12,290
What are you doing for color?

282
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:14,091
I want to play
on a day and night theme,

283
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:16,460
this side be brighter
and then this side darker.

284
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:18,629
- And a really good transition.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

285
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:20,364
Paint be-- be--
between the two.

286
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,832
I didn't want
to do a cowl separate,

287
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,135
and a chest, and a back,
so it's gonna be a whole suit.

288
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,971
With something this big,
you can let your imagination

289
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:28,506
go wild on a skin texture,

290
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,475
either with polka dot
or striped even,

291
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,845
because that becomes part
of this fantasy camouflage.

292
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,947
Is this gonna
be able to move at all?

293
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:37,481
Or is this
gonna stay stationary?

294
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,150
This part
is gonna move up and down,

295
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:40,418
so that'll be kind of neat.

296
00:11:40,452 --> 00:11:41,519
Clever idea too, coming off

297
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:42,954
the top of the head with it.

298
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,389
It's calling out for scoring
from the inside here,

299
00:11:45,424 --> 00:11:47,892
and just cutting through it,
not pulling any out,

300
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,494
so it will kind of accordion.

301
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:51,796
Oh, that's a good idea.
I like that.

302
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,830
Great.

303
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,332
He's gonna be kind of friendly,

304
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:55,866
like, "How are you?
I'm beautiful," you know?

305
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,802
And all of a sudden, like--

306
00:11:57,836 --> 00:12:00,071
For what the challenge is,
I think your character

307
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:02,106
needs a little more power
to it.

308
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,175
You know, whimsical
can't be subtle.

309
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:06,010
You need to exaggerate

310
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:08,012
as opposed to making it
too human-like.

311
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,281
Mr. Westmore
says I need to go

312
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,750
with something bigger than life,
something exaggerated.

313
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:14,051
I keep looking at it,

314
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:15,920
and I'm like,
"Oh, shit, he's right."

315
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:17,221
I gotta come up with something.

316
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:20,057
Otherwise, I'm gonna
be in big trouble.

317
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,126
- Coming up...
- Go, daddy, go.

318
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,861
If I don't finish this,
I'm not gonna have anything.

319
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:24,996
Fuck.

320
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,898
There is this much clay
in the top of the mold.

321
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,266
Damn, you did a great job.

322
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:31,969
It's almost freaky
how you channeled my father.

323
00:12:32,004 --> 00:12:35,406
You're better
than what I see here.

324
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,475
Your character needs
a little more power to it.

325
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,344
It's day one
of our Roald Dahl challenge.

326
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:46,912
Mr. Westmore
thinks my sculpture

327
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:49,014
doesn't feel big enough
for a character like this.

328
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:50,583
Whimsical can't be subtle.

329
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:51,851
You need to exaggerate

330
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,786
as opposed to making it
too human-like.

331
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,154
I agree with Mr. Westmore.

332
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,890
I need to go with something
that is bigger than life,

333
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,892
so I have to resculpt
this whole thing.

334
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,260
But I gotta speed this up

335
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:03,662
'cause I don't have
much time to finish this.

336
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:04,830
All right, guys.
Have fun with this.

337
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:05,831
- All right.
- See you soon.

338
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:08,634
Thank you, guys.

339
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,771
For my Snozzwanger,

340
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,073
I have to do two molds

341
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:16,408
because the nose
curves in such a way

342
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:18,777
that I wouldn't
be able to clean it out.

343
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,112
So I remove most of it,

344
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:22,882
and I'll mold
that separately in silicone.

345
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,186
I know the judges
are gonna hate it

346
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,889
because it has
no anatomical function.

347
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,558
It's just this wacky,
childlike monster,

348
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:33,759
but I think it looks so cool

349
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:35,928
that you can't help
but like it.

350
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:39,932
That's gonna be creepy as hell.

351
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:42,434
The only thing I'm
worried about is the profile.

352
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:43,669
If I just leave it like this,

353
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:45,104
it's just
gonna look unfinished.

354
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:46,739
I mean, if you have
the time, do a cowl

355
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:47,907
'cause it could only help you.

356
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:49,642
No, that's fucking risky, dude.

357
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,943
Everything we do is risky.

358
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,045
Just gotta make sure
you do it and you do it good.

359
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:55,548
I'm feeling a little bit uneasy

360
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:57,016
because I'm not doing a lot.

361
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,852
So tomorrow,
I'll sculpt the cowl.

362
00:13:59,886 --> 00:14:03,055
And hopefully,
I'll have a good piece.

363
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,494
You should
have two static arms.

364
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:10,262
Maybe I'll put
like five on there.

365
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:11,864
I'm really
trying to go all out,

366
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:13,866
having this character
really act like a worm

367
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,068
and kind of doing
all these crazy movements.

368
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:19,338
So I'm sculpting two arms
just to give it more motion

369
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,006
and the sense
of something that can come up

370
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,008
and snatch something
and bring it back.

371
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:24,610
It's comin' along.

372
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,078
That's time, guys.

373
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:27,880
I definitely wish that things

374
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:29,582
would have gone
a little bit faster today...

375
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:30,883
<i>Opa.</i>

376
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,785
...but I've
nailed down my concept,

377
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,588
and I'm ready
to go forward on it.

378
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,633
It's day two,
we got 9 1/2 hours.

379
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,668
And for my Snozzwanger,

380
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,103
the cowl needs to be real big

381
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:53,472
'cause it's
this huge elephant head

382
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,542
with giant ears,
fat rolls around its neck,

383
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,178
and the eyes are gonna
be coming off of the head.

384
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:00,546
Yeah, big, goofy ears, right?

385
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,451
Yeah, dude.

386
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:08,320
Today, I need
to focus on these giant worms

387
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:09,955
coming off this cowl piece.

388
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,624
And they need
to be lightweight,

389
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:13,592
so instead
of sculpting out of clay,

390
00:15:13,627 --> 00:15:17,463
I feed little foam rings
onto a wire and I bend it.

391
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:19,598
I'm like, "This is it.
This is the shape I need."

392
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:24,470
That is so cool.

393
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:26,839
Even though I still
need to sculpt the cowl,

394
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:29,174
I'm worried,
because Lucy Dahl said

395
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,376
that in her father's books,

396
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,811
everything is
an exaggeration of the truth.

397
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:34,780
So I'm adding some more leaves,

398
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,515
adding all of my detail.

399
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:39,518
I think it's an opportunity
to sculpt something crazy

400
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,520
and take a lot of risks.

401
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:43,422
And I'm also taking quills

402
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:44,957
into the middle of the face

403
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,793
to create Venus flytrap teeth

404
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:50,095
so it can eat an Oompa Loompa.

405
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,097
Overall, I'm really excited
with the way

406
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:55,367
that this is turning out.

407
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,671
I'm making this Hornswoggler,

408
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:00,839
and I would like to add,
like, some really big horns

409
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:03,075
in the back
because he's a killer monster

410
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:04,343
that lives in the jungle.

411
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:07,046
So I cut L200, and I just start

412
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,756
placing some pieces
on the bodysuit

413
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:13,485
and it looks like
a vicious, evil monster eater.

414
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,920
I hope the judges will see that

415
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,956
just from Roald Dahl's world.

416
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:23,729
Today, I'm sculpting the chest.

417
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:26,031
The chest piece
is very important

418
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,867
because if it doesn't
have that horrific mouth

419
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:30,936
that is gonna
eat the Oompa Loompas,

420
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,538
it's just the face of a bunny.

421
00:16:32,572 --> 00:16:34,173
And a bunny
eating the Oompa Loompas

422
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:35,174
is not whimsical or scary.

423
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,408
It's just a bunny.

424
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,510
Time is flying,
and I'm not getting this done.

425
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:39,678
I want to make
more detail on the cowl,

426
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:42,181
but I have to let it go
and just go mold it

427
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,083
because otherwise
I won't finish this.

428
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,852
Let's go.

429
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:50,089
I'm trying to give myself

430
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:53,158
at least four hours
to mold my bodysuit.

431
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,327
I'm really pushing
the limits on this a lot

432
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:56,528
because it's big, so I'm taking

433
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:58,931
a lot of risks doing this,

434
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,799
but I think
it's gonna come out great.

435
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,034
I have
a lot of confidence in me.

436
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:05,170
I think I can
do this mold very good.

437
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,545
So on this Hornswoggler,
I'll be fabricatin' a cowl.

438
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,347
And I think I'm gonna
go with some blue feathers

439
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,216
just to add a little
more whimsical to it.

440
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,818
I'll try to lay these things
to where it looks like hair.

441
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,687
I've never tried
the feather trick before,

442
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:22,788
and I'm--
I'm really diggin' it.

443
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:24,223
All I can do is hope the judges

444
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:28,727
like my idea
for feathered hair.

445
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:30,696
I decided to fabricate my torso

446
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,765
because I know
I can do it a lot faster

447
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,968
than sculpting,
molding, running it in foam.

448
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:38,337
I start blocking out
the shape I need.

449
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:40,773
And then I begin
cutting out pieces of L200,

450
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:44,209
pieces of upholstery foam,
shapes that match with the face.

451
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:45,911
The left side
is the Doodle side,

452
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:47,312
right side
being the Whang side.

453
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:49,782
So I make sure I work that
into the torso as well.

454
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,186
- You crazy, dude.
- I'm crazy!

455
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,455
I'm really pushing
the limits on this mold.

456
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:57,823
It's so big
that I actually have

457
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,559
to get on a step stool
to get the top part.

458
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,294
But somehow, I get it done.

459
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:05,664
And now, I need
to open and clean it out.

460
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:08,867
This mold is 200 pounds.

461
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:10,169
All right.

462
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:12,504
I don't know how
I'm gonna open this by myself.

463
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,572
Go, daddy, go!

464
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,674
If I make one little mistake,

465
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,476
it can actually
ruin the whole mold.

466
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,477
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

467
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,578
That man is crazy.

468
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:23,982
I just hope
that this doesn't break.

469
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:26,151
I'm starting to
get really nervous.

470
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:29,354
I cannot lift this.

471
00:18:29,389 --> 00:18:32,291
The mold is too heavy,
and it's starting to crack.

472
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,193
Fuck.
If the mold cracks,

473
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:36,862
I'm not gonna
have anything for tomorrow.

474
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:43,841
It is day two
for this Roald Dahl challenge

475
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,610
making this Oompa Loompa
monster eater.

476
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:48,285
_

477
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,114
This mold is 200 pounds.

478
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:51,949
I still have
to open it and clean it

479
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:55,186
or I'm not gonna have anything.

480
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,823
Mr. Rashaad?
Can you help me one last time?

481
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:01,726
One, two, three.

482
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,761
So we put this on the floor,

483
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:06,063
and start like trying
to crack it and open it

484
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,499
and just hope
that this doesn't break.

485
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:10,901
There you go.

486
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,136
Thank God for Rashaad.

487
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,637
Now I have to clean it out

488
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:14,705
before the end of the day.

489
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,674
You and your big molds, man.

490
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:22,780
I have all my pieces,
and I'm like,

491
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,516
"All right, let me
just start painting everything."

492
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:31,355
I remember Mr. Westmore's advice
on taking brown hairspray

493
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,691
to create this muddying,
dripping effect.

494
00:19:33,725 --> 00:19:36,494
Mr. Westmore was right.
It looks like-- like muddy dirt.

495
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:38,362
- He's always right.
- Yay.

496
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:40,331
It just drips,
and it looks amazing.

497
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:41,565
It looks like wet mud.

498
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,167
- Give me that.
- Don't break my shit.

499
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:44,435
I'm not gonna break it, Tyler.

500
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:45,619
It needs to go
through a stress test.

501
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:46,805
Get it going.

502
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:51,309
- It works.
- It's pretty creepy.

503
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:58,617
The paint job on this
is very important.

504
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,051
I'm going with black and white

505
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:02,153
because they're good colors
to put against each other.

506
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:04,189
This is the Whang,
and this is the Doodle side.

507
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,391
- Ooh, nice.
- He catches Oompa Loompas.

508
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,593
And if they don't
sing a song that he likes,

509
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,462
he eats them.

510
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:11,796
This is
a two-tone paint job,

511
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:14,332
but you can't
just have black and white.

512
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,768
All the colors
in between have to show as well.

513
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,837
Oh, yes.

514
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,641
I've just sculpted this cowl

515
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:25,310
faster than I've sculpted
anything in my entire life,

516
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:28,346
and it's not terrible.

517
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:29,548
But now, I have to mold it

518
00:20:29,582 --> 00:20:33,585
and clean it out
before the end of the day.

519
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:38,290
- Time?
- 21 minutes.

520
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,891
If I don't get this cowl done,

521
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,160
I'm gonna have
to run it in poly foam,

522
00:20:42,194 --> 00:20:44,195
which is not
a very good option.

523
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:51,369
All right, guys.
It's time!

524
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:53,772
Fuck.

525
00:20:53,806 --> 00:20:57,542
Time is called,
and there is still

526
00:20:57,577 --> 00:21:00,879
this much clay
stuck in the top of the mold.

527
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:02,781
Shit.

528
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,050
I'm not happy with the situation
that I've put myself in.

529
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,352
I have a lot to do tomorrow,

530
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:10,255
and I think my only
saving grace right now

531
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:12,057
would be a good face piece.

532
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:22,634
- Whoo!
- Mm, mm, mm.

533
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:23,768
All right.
Okay.

534
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,737
It's application day.

535
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:27,539
We have four hours in the lab.

536
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:29,574
The first thing
I do is make sure

537
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:32,844
all of my pieces
are free of seams,

538
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,346
fix anything
that needs to be patched.

539
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,847
Get on down.

540
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:38,783
This is the difference between
great makeup or goin' home.

541
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:41,820
I can do this.

542
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:44,823
After I clean the mold,

543
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:46,358
the first thing
that I need to do

544
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:50,428
is create a latex skin
in my cowl mold.

545
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:53,531
And then,
I will pour poly foam into it.

546
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:56,434
I just need everything to work.

547
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,440
Hey, what's up, bro?

548
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,509
- What's goin' on?
- There you are.

549
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:05,844
Thank you.

550
00:22:10,316 --> 00:22:11,483
A little patching to do.

551
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:12,817
I look at my bodysuit,

552
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:15,253
and there's a lot
of seaming and patching to do.

553
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,789
And that takes
a huge chunk of your time,

554
00:22:17,823 --> 00:22:20,992
so I hope
I can get everything done.

555
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:22,360
What we've got here is a bunch

556
00:22:22,395 --> 00:22:25,730
of monsters from Loompaland.

557
00:22:25,765 --> 00:22:26,965
I'm workin' on the safari hat

558
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:28,566
because I need
these eyes to come up

559
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:30,468
out of the brill of the hat,

560
00:22:30,503 --> 00:22:33,538
and I dremel out
some nice-sized holes.

561
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:35,940
And then I give the hat, like,
a little bit of wear and tear

562
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:38,243
just so it looks like
it's been through the jungle.

563
00:22:38,277 --> 00:22:41,413
Sweet.

564
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,016
What's great
about this spandex cowl

565
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:46,518
is that I did
coat it with latex.

566
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:47,719
So now, it's pretty much
like a ball cap.

567
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:49,154
This is great.
It's like a wig.

568
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:51,456
Yeah, it's like a giant,
custom-made wig for this.

569
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,024
This competition
is getting stiff,

570
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:54,592
so I think these little details

571
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:57,996
and these little tricks
are extremely important.

572
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,031
Holy shit.

573
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:05,470
I go to check on my mold,

574
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:08,940
and I see that the poly foam

575
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:12,377
has not cured at all.

576
00:23:12,411 --> 00:23:13,812
This is pretty bad.

577
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:17,148
At this point, I've wasted
2 1/2 hours on this cowl.

578
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:18,550
I can't try it again.

579
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,885
I don't have time.

580
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,220
I gotta let it go.

581
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,655
All right,
I'm gonna wash my hands,

582
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,890
and then we're gonna start.

583
00:23:25,925 --> 00:23:28,460
I immediately
start applying the face.

584
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:30,795
I've decided
to completely scrap the cowl.

585
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,832
I'm gonna pull the hood up
and glue moss around it,

586
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:37,836
and I just start painting
as quickly as possible.

587
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:48,613
Perfect.

588
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,515
At this point,
I'm applying everything,

589
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:52,183
but I'm still taking
a lot of time

590
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:54,419
to seam
and patch all those sides,

591
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:55,954
so I'm getting
a little bit worried

592
00:23:55,988 --> 00:23:58,790
because I'm not gonna have
enough time to paint everything.

593
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:04,329
Ten minutes, guys!

594
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,068
I'm moving as fast as I can.

595
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:12,470
I don't know if I'm gonna
have time to finish everything.

596
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:14,072
But at this point,
there's no turning back.

597
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:16,508
I made the decision
to make this bodysuit,

598
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,877
so I have to keep painting.

599
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,719
That's time, everybody.
Brushes down.

600
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:29,053
I need to keep focused

601
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:31,589
and try to do as much
as I can in last looks.

602
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:35,994
If I don't get this done,
this is gonna send me home.

603
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:37,295
Coming up...

604
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:38,663
Nice.

605
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:40,965
I made a full bodysuit,
but it looks like a chicken.

606
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,568
I hope this isn't
a complete mess.

607
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:45,303
You knocked it
out of the park, well done.

608
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:46,437
I feel like it would be subject

609
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,206
to gang beatings
by the Oompa Loompas

610
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,009
rather than being
able to hunt them.

611
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:56,898
Whoo-hoo.

612
00:24:56,932 --> 00:24:59,134
- I'm gonna go over here.
- So we get to last looks.

613
00:24:59,168 --> 00:25:02,737
We have one hour to finish
our Oompa Loompa monster eaters.

614
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:04,239
I still need to add the eyes,

615
00:25:04,273 --> 00:25:05,607
I still need to add the horns

616
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:08,243
and finish my paint job.

617
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:12,247
Speed makeup.

618
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:13,581
I'm goin' from one arm.

619
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:15,917
Then I do a leg,
and it's really comin' together.

620
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:17,185
This is probably the most fun

621
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:19,693
that I've had painting
one of these creatures.

622
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,496
Nice.

623
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:26,800
I love it.
It's like a dance routine.

624
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,403
I start
gluing in all of the quills

625
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:32,706
inside of the Venus flytrap
to add detail

626
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,508
so I don't
have a complete mess.

627
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:39,213
- Time?
- That's ten more minutes, guys.

628
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:42,149
Holy cow.
That's scary.

629
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:47,087
That's it, everybody.
Time's up.

630
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:48,822
Brushes down.

631
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:50,357
Boo.

632
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:51,658
Bummer, man.

633
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:54,094
It might not
be enough this time.

634
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:05,939
Welcome to
the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

635
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:09,343
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

636
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:12,412
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

637
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,716
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

638
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,351
- Good evening.
- Hey, Glenn.

639
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:19,886
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

640
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:21,421
Hi, fabulous makeup artists.

641
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:22,589
Hello, Ve.

642
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,131
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

643
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:27,252
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.

644
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,828
And joining us again tonight

645
00:26:28,863 --> 00:26:32,932
is author, screenwriter,
and Roald Dahl's daughter,

646
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,133
- Lucy Dahl.
- Hi, Lucy.

647
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:36,669
Great to have you back.

648
00:26:36,704 --> 00:26:39,172
Thank you.
It's a pleasure to be back.

649
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,875
All right, this week,
your spotlight challenge

650
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:44,110
was to select
one of the unseen creatures

651
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,079
from the world of Roald Dahl

652
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:48,047
and use its name to inspire

653
00:26:48,082 --> 00:26:50,350
a wild and whimsical beast.

654
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:52,352
So let's take
a look at your creations

655
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:53,720
while the audience
at home tweets

656
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:56,956
about their favorites
using #FaceOff.

657
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:21,614
Pretty excited about this.

658
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:23,049
I just hope
it's whimsical enough

659
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,418
and scary enough
for the judges to like it.

660
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:46,940
Oh, my gosh, this looks great.

661
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:48,207
It has a lot of movement,

662
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:51,277
and it really does look
like an Oompa Loompa-killer.

663
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,366
It's not what I wanted.

664
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,234
It's not what I envisioned.

665
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:17,370
It just fell apart.

666
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,393
I'm looking
at this Snozzwanger,

667
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,028
and it looks so awesome.

668
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:45,031
I couldn't be more happy
with this character.

669
00:29:04,752 --> 00:29:05,818
I'm loving the character.

670
00:29:05,853 --> 00:29:07,620
I love the way he looks,
the way he moves.

671
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:09,255
If I go home,
I'm happy about it

672
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,359
because this is a great makeup.

673
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,980
It doesn't look evil.

674
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:35,982
He just looks like a chicken.

675
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:37,984
I'm actually really worried
at this point.

676
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:00,673
He looks amazing in profile.

677
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,308
He looks amazing
from the front.

678
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:06,446
I'm-- I'm excited.
I'm happy.

679
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,585
Judges, why don't
you take a closer look

680
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,655
at these Oompa Loompa-eating
beasts?

681
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:22,929
Nice eyebrows.

682
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:24,530
I like the blue feathers too.

683
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:26,599
The horns are a good idea.

684
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:28,301
I wish
they were different sizes,

685
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:30,436
like this one
being a bit smaller.

686
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:36,676
Oh, that's
beautiful right there.

687
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,212
Very expressive
for something that thick.

688
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:40,713
How's that Oompa Loompa
tasting?

689
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:42,181
- Delicious.
- Yeah.

690
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,584
Great answer.
Thank you.

691
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,356
There's not
much here, is there?

692
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,958
What is that supposed to be?

693
00:30:51,992 --> 00:30:54,160
It's a bit
like a sea urchin's face.

694
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:56,462
It's so minimal
compared to the scope

695
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:58,464
of what other people have done.

696
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,800
I do like the paint work
that's going on there.

697
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:04,771
Thank you.

698
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,539
Can you wiggle
your head around?

699
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:11,177
Look, he's got
Oompa Loompa skulls,

700
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,945
and what's in there?

701
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,047
Snozzberry Oompa bait.

702
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,082
- Oh.
- Genius.

703
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,521
It's the skinned bunny.

704
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:23,689
This transition
from these grays into the pink

705
00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:25,291
is a really cool idea.

706
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,526
Give us some expression.

707
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,461
Oh, very nice.

708
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:32,231
Thank you.

709
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,499
Oh, boy.

710
00:31:33,534 --> 00:31:35,635
Talk about biting off
more than you could chew.

711
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:37,370
It's the lack of precision.

712
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:39,071
I'm not satisfied
with this makeup,

713
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,573
and I know I'm gonna
be in bottom looks.

714
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:45,178
I really think the judges
are gonna send me home.

715
00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:47,747
Who made
your favorite whimsical beast?

716
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,783
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

717
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:55,489
It feels like
he's just poking around at ideas

718
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:58,292
for lack of anything
solid in terms of direction.

719
00:31:58,326 --> 00:32:01,162
I made a full bodysuit,
but it looks like a chicken.

720
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:04,231
This just feels
like a waste of time.

721
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:06,100
There's nothing
there as a design.

722
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,836
- I'm baffled.
- Thank you.

723
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:12,740
Let's see your hands here.

724
00:32:12,774 --> 00:32:15,843
That looks like that could
slit an Oompa Loompa's throat.

725
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:18,879
To address all
of these forms in the time?

726
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:20,281
Really, really difficult.

727
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,649
Definitely a lot of hard work.

728
00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:24,218
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

729
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:32,893
Lucy, you asked these guys

730
00:32:32,928 --> 00:32:35,796
to really use
their imagination this week.

731
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:36,931
How'd they do?

732
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:39,800
I think you did
an extraordinary job.

733
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,369
I'm blown away by your talent.

734
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:43,604
Thank you.

735
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:45,973
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

736
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,608
Let's find out
what they thought.

737
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:50,745
Rashaad...

738
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,013
Daran...

739
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:56,183
George...

740
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:58,586
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

741
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,287
and can head back
to the makeup room.

742
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:04,825
Thank you.

743
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,362
The rest of you are the best
and the worst this week.

744
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:10,231
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

745
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:11,766
to learn more about your work.

746
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,400
Tyler, please step up.

747
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:16,437
All right.

748
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:22,576
Here he comes.

749
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:24,111
Tell us
about your thought process

750
00:33:24,146 --> 00:33:26,180
and how it fits
into this week's challenge.

751
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:27,982
I had the Whangdoodle,
and my concept

752
00:33:28,016 --> 00:33:30,851
is this earthworm,
cockroach-type beast

753
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,486
that lives under the jungle.

754
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:34,021
And when Oompa Loompas come by,

755
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,890
it grabs 'em and snatches 'em.

756
00:33:35,924 --> 00:33:37,925
This is
a very successful makeup.

757
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,794
Thank you.

758
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:41,929
What I like the most about it,

759
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:44,965
your color denotes
an evil character.

760
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,035
And then you were
cautiously playful

761
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,637
and cartoonish with it.

762
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,238
That's a lot of good decisions

763
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:53,174
that resulted
in a really impressive makeup.

764
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,275
Thank you.

765
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:56,010
He's scary right down

766
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:58,579
to the little touch of
Oompa Loompa hair in his mouth.

767
00:33:58,613 --> 00:33:59,780
Yes.

768
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:01,682
It's very successful,
and on top of that,

769
00:34:01,716 --> 00:34:04,409
- your paint job is just beautiful.
- Thank you.

770
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:06,878
The character is so complete

771
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,415
from an aesthetic quality
and from a performance quality.

772
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,749
You've really done
a beautiful job this week.

773
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:13,117
Thank you.

774
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,453
I really felt that's
a monster in Loompaland,

775
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:17,422
and my dad would love that.

776
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,457
- That's great.
- Tyler, thank you very much.

777
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:23,394
Hey, man, thank you.

778
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:28,466
Niko, please step up.

779
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,172
Where did you
get your inspiration

780
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,740
for your Hornswoggler?

781
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,175
I wanted to make it silly,

782
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,311
and wacky, and funny,
but he can turn himself

783
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:41,713
really evil if you tempt him.

784
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,314
It seems to me like you wasted

785
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,984
a whole bunch of time
trying to create this body

786
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:49,187
for absolutely no reason
at all.

787
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:51,956
I think your time management
went someplace funny this week,

788
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:54,459
honey, 'cause I-I don't
really see the point

789
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,694
to have built these whole arms,

790
00:34:56,729 --> 00:34:59,330
which just didn't work for you.

791
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:02,767
How you're applying it,
how you're sculpting the chest,

792
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,303
the belly,
there's so little here.

793
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,571
Yeah.
All right.

794
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,241
Its goofy,
static gaze makes it feel

795
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,410
like it would be
subject to gang beatings

796
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,978
by the Oompa Loompas
rather than being able

797
00:35:14,013 --> 00:35:17,181
to successfully hunt them,
and the paint job has

798
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:22,320
all the finesse of an easter
egg coloring gone awry.

799
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:26,424
- Niko, please step back.
- Thank you.

800
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,932
Chloe.

801
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,137
So tell us about your concept.

802
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,272
I have a Vermicious Knid.

803
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:44,108
I thought
of these little plants

804
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,177
that the Oompa Loompas
are curious about,

805
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,579
and they have
this beauty to 'em,

806
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,113
but they just snatch 'em up.

807
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,315
I did the cowl this morning,

808
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,016
spent most of the morning
trying to run it,

809
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:53,985
and I couldn't make it work.

810
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:58,556
I know that you're better
than what I see here,

811
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,391
but what we're left with

812
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:02,560
does feel hurried
and incomplete.

813
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,028
That's why I spent so much time

814
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:05,496
trying to get the cowl.

815
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:07,699
Oh, it breaks my heart
when stuff like that happens.

816
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,234
I can't imagine
how disappointing

817
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,669
that must have been for you,

818
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:14,372
but I want you to know
that an Oompa Loompa would--

819
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,574
would step on it, and that
would be the end of him.

820
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:20,211
If you would have highlighted
and shadowed everything,

821
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,513
and-- and showed me
some of the layers,

822
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:25,550
it would pop out,
but you camouflaged the work

823
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:29,220
behind the moss,
and muddled the colors.

824
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,556
Chloe, thank you.
If you'd please step back.

825
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,158
Thank you.

826
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:42,533
Graham, please step up.

827
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:48,539
Graham, can you please tell us

828
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:51,376
about the concept
of your Snozzwanger?

829
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,545
Immediately, in the name,
I thought schnoz,

830
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,215
but I imagined
this sort of safari hunter

831
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,584
who hunts and traps
Oompa Loompas.

832
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,052
It's almost freaky to me

833
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:04,322
how you channeled my father
in this.

834
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:07,058
I wish my dad was here
because he would be delighted.

835
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,626
You knocked it out of the park.

836
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,061
- Well done.
- That means a lot.

837
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,462
Thank you.

838
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:13,698
The way that you've managed
to capture the essence

839
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,233
of the challenge makes me think

840
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:16,334
that we made the right decision

841
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,436
in saving you a few weeks ago.

842
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,171
- Thank you.
- On top of that,

843
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,839
the fact that you used
bits and pieces

844
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:23,207
to give the character a history

845
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,509
was a brilliant decision.

846
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:25,510
Thank you.

847
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,345
He's scary, and bizarre,

848
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:28,913
and he's like
a kid's nightmare.

849
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,948
Your mouth is like the opening

850
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,451
of one of those fun houses

851
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,953
where you go in
through the thing--

852
00:37:35,988 --> 00:37:37,055
You get scared to death.

853
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,623
Thank you.

854
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,124
Graham, please step back.

855
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,228
Great job.

856
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,866
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

857
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:50,568
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

858
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,370
while they deliberate.

859
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,972
Thank you.

860
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:01,145
All right, judges,
let's talk about

861
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,181
the looks
we like the most tonight.

862
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:04,482
Let's start with Tyler.

863
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,918
Head to toe,
it was really stellar.

864
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,520
On top of looking cool,
it worked really cool.

865
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,223
It came out
and performed excessively well

866
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,491
through a very thick piece,

867
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,792
which is not
the easiest thing to do.

868
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:17,028
And the Oompa Loompa hair,
he was very obedient

869
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,031
with his challenge,
so that's what won me over.

870
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,833
All right,
let's move on to Graham.

871
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:23,701
Looked like it could
eat the Oompa Loompas,

872
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:24,902
and it was playful,

873
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:26,771
and it really
fit the challenge.

874
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,872
I do like the fact

875
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,074
that it is childlike
and it is whimsy.

876
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:32,643
He was obviously
a big fan of my father's book

877
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:35,079
'cause he knew
about Snozzberry bait.

878
00:38:35,114 --> 00:38:36,514
Now you see someone
who really knows

879
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,182
the source material
takes advantage of it.

880
00:38:38,217 --> 00:38:39,217
I love that.

881
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:40,218
All right, let's talk about

882
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:42,053
the looks we like the least.

883
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,188
Let's start with Niko.

884
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:46,958
He saw how badly
these body appliances came out,

885
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,126
and he just kept goin' with it?

886
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,327
That's just dreadful.

887
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,896
He didn't know
when to say "When" and stop.

888
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,464
And this deep in the game,

889
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:57,034
very concerned about bad
decision-making on that level.

890
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,470
He was leaning
towards an alien,

891
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,005
more like an ET.

892
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,241
To me, that doesn't belong
in a jungle.

893
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:06,177
All right,
let's talk about Chloe.

894
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:08,846
It lacked
a sense of familiarity.

895
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:12,517
It was so unique
as a design choice

896
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,886
that I didn't understand
what I was supposed

897
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,454
to think that that was.

898
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:19,257
Design-wise, it still
looks like the prostitute cousin

899
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,226
of Madame Marjory Trash Heap
from<i> Fraggle Rock.</i>

900
00:39:22,261 --> 00:39:24,428
Like, it's not
a working concept.

901
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,764
I can't imagine how
devastating that must have been

902
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,933
for her to have
every single thing she did

903
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,434
completely flop this week.

904
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:33,037
Okay, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

905
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,907
- Yes.
- Let's bring them back out.

906
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:45,650
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

907
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:48,719
Tyler, your sculpting
and paint job

908
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,088
were both right on,
and we were impressed

909
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,791
with the overall high level
of execution.

910
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:56,561
Graham,
this was a great example

911
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:59,130
of embracing the childlike
and whimsical nature

912
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,364
of this challenge.

913
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,867
It is great to see you
back on top tonight.

914
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,102
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

915
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:08,105
Tonight's winner is...

916
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:14,980
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

917
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:16,815
Tonight's winner is...

918
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,854
Tyler.

919
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:26,492
We were wowed by this beast.

920
00:40:26,526 --> 00:40:28,494
It was so well done,

921
00:40:28,528 --> 00:40:30,763
it almost seemed like you had
a day more than everyone else.

922
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:31,864
Thank you so much.

923
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:33,766
Holy cow.
This is amazing.

924
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,734
That means
a third win on a makeup

925
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,336
that I absolutely love,
so I want

926
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,738
to keep pushin' myself
to the finale.

927
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,674
Tyler, congratulations.

928
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,143
You and Graham can head back
to the makeup room.

929
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,144
Thank you.

930
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:48,214
Thank you.

931
00:40:51,117 --> 00:40:53,986
Unfortunately,
that means the two of you

932
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,921
are on the bottom this week,

933
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:58,190
and one of you
will be eliminated.

934
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:02,561
Please step forward.

935
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:09,835
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

936
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:12,805
Niko, your concept
felt unfinished,

937
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,474
and your decision
to spend so much time

938
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:16,942
on the body instead of the head

939
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:19,378
was detrimental
to your character overall.

940
00:41:19,412 --> 00:41:22,381
Chloe, we appreciate
that you intended

941
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:24,250
something more
with this creature,

942
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:26,785
but what little makeup
that you did manage

943
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,722
to put in front of us
was rough and unfinished.

944
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:31,490
So who is going home tonight?

945
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:34,393
The person going home
tonight is...

946
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,266
Chloe.

947
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,067
We know you're talented,

948
00:41:42,102 --> 00:41:45,738
but the other artists put out
some great work this week,

949
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:49,208
and what you gave us
just wasn't enough.

950
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:51,777
That means Niko,
you are safe this week

951
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:53,646
and can head back
to the makeup room.

952
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,521
Chloe, all the best of luck.

953
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:03,989
You'll do really well.

954
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:06,025
You're a really good
makeup artist.

955
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:08,294
- Thank you.
- Chloe, I am so sorry,

956
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:10,362
but you have been eliminated.

957
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:12,464
It's really been great
having you here with us.

958
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:14,700
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

959
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:15,968
and pack up your kit.

960
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:17,569
Thank you
for all the opportunities.

961
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:21,774
It's been amazing.

962
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:24,510
Good luck, Chloe.

963
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:25,878
I know I have talent.

964
00:42:25,912 --> 00:42:27,913
Today just wasn't my day.

965
00:42:32,352 --> 00:42:33,952
- Aw, man.
- Oh.

966
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:37,489
I live and breathe makeup.

967
00:42:37,524 --> 00:42:40,092
Just it wasn't enough.

968
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:41,226
You're a good artist,

969
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:42,961
and this is not
the end of the road for you.

970
00:42:42,996 --> 00:42:45,664
I'm proud of myself.

971
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:48,500
I have no words to explain

972
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:51,236
how inspired I've been

973
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:54,820
by the people that
I've been surrounded with.

974
00:42:54,854 --> 00:42:58,190
This has been
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
