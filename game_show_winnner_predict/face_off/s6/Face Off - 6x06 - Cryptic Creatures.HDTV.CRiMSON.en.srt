1
00:00:00,231 --> 00:00:01,864
This is a beautiful piece.

2
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:03,065
I've never seen
anything like it before.

3
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,001
I dig it a lot.
It's creepy-licious.

4
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:07,837
Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:10,940
Niko's menacing minotaur
brought him his first win...

6
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:13,776
- Thank you.
- And Tanner was sent home.

7
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:16,946
Now ten artists remain,

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,848
and tonight they will enter
the mysterious world

9
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:19,949
of the unknown.

10
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:21,717
Bring that cryptid to life.

11
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:24,153
We're like, "Oh, my gosh!"

12
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:26,622
But some teams
fail to see eye to eye.

13
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:28,891
Bring this crown
right down into the spine area.

14
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:30,526
How long is this gonna go on?

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,727
I'm not your assistant, Daran.

16
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:33,562
I'm not sure
that it looks like a dog.

17
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:35,598
For the first time
in this competition,

18
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:37,900
I'm really worried.

19
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,402
I really want to see
Captain Kirk fight this thing.

20
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,671
You made all that ridiculous
come together.

21
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:43,873
It's a beautiful piece.

22
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:46,142
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

23
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:47,576
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

24
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,813
to one of their 85
international locations...

25
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:53,916
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500...

26
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,951
and $100,000.

27
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:58,821
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

28
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:03,959
<i>Face off!</i>

29
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:06,829
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

31
00:01:48,505 --> 00:01:50,206
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,373
I'm really,
really proud of you.

33
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:53,108
I want Niko to enjoy his win

34
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:55,177
and not worry
that I'm on the bottom.

35
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,745
It's at that point
in the competition

36
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,647
where you make one mistake
and you're out.

37
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:01,183
Parts of me think that
I should have been sent home.

38
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:02,852
But I want to prove
to the judges

39
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:05,554
and to all my competitors
that I can create something

40
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:07,223
that's gonna
take their breath away.

41
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:09,525
I'm happy that
I still have Cat here.

42
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,327
I like you both here.

43
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:12,461
Thanks, mama.

44
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,230
Yeah, I know.

45
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:22,938
Uh-oh.
What is this?

46
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:24,306
We're trying to figure out
where we're at

47
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,008
or what this challenge
could possibly be,

48
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:27,309
but nobody has any idea.

49
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:28,978
I see McKenzie.

50
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,045
Is that Howard Berger?

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,580
I'd recognize
that beard anywhere.

52
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:32,915
Howard Berger--

53
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,084
he's a respected,
award-winning makeup artist

54
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,620
and a huge inspiration.

55
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:38,621
Hey, guys.

56
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:39,855
- Hey.
- Hi.

57
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,892
Welcome to your
next foundation challenge.

58
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,260
Nice.

59
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,394
Before I tell you about it,

60
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:47,630
let me introduce you
to your judge today.

61
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:50,766
He's one of the most prolific
makeup artists of all time,

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,436
with a laundry list of
amazing credits, like <i>Kill Bill,</i>

63
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:57,273
<i>Oz The Great And Powerful,</i>
<i>Breaking Bad,</i>

64
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,674
and <i>The Chronicles Of Narnia</i>

65
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,976
<i>The Lion, The Witch,</i>
<i>And The Wardrobe.</i>

66
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:03,946
Please give a warm welcome
to Oscar-, Bafta-,

67
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,116
and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist Howard Berger.

68
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:11,720
Howard Berger
is a huge idol of mine.

69
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:12,855
I am so excited.

70
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:13,540
Thank you.

71
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:15,190
Howard, it is an honor
to have you here today.

72
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:17,726
It's my honor, and it's great
to be here with all of them.

73
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,262
All right, so fantasy films
are filled with stories

74
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:23,966
of mythical characters,
like elves, gnomes, and dwarves.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,270
But there is none
more intimidating than the orc.

76
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,005
- Whoa.
- Nice.

77
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,541
Yes! Orcs!
We love orcs.

78
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:35,311
They have human features,
but they're scary and grotesque.

79
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:38,580
All right, Howard, what is it
that makes orcs so terrifying?

80
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:41,650
Orcs are aggressive.
They're brutal warriors.

81
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,352
But what makes them
really scary

82
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:47,556
is they never, ever
travel alone.

83
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,224
Wait a minute.
What does that mean?

84
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,593
- Of course.
- What is that?

85
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:54,596
That's a lot of people.

86
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,732
This horde comes down
the mountain,

87
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:59,201
and we're like,
"Oh, my gosh."

88
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:03,772
We have to do
all of these people.

89
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,607
Oh, man.

90
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:08,610
All right, so, as you know,
lead makeup artists

91
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:10,879
are responsible not only
for creating

92
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:12,781
the featured characters,

93
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:15,784
but also the myriad
of background characters.

94
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:18,253
Working together
in teams of two,

95
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:20,122
your foundation challenge
is to choose one

96
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:23,559
of these orc war banners
and use it to inspire

97
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:28,063
a featured orc warrior
and nine members of his clan.

98
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,965
Nine members--
oh, boy.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,434
We have to do makeup
for ten people.

100
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:33,502
This is a lot of work.

101
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,404
My heart--
like dun-gun-gun-gun.

102
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:37,806
Your teams have been
randomly assigned.

103
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,642
They are Chloe and George...

104
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:42,344
Corinne and Matt...

105
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:44,613
- Graham and Tyler...
- Hmm.

106
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,749
Niko and Daran...

107
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:49,551
- Rashaad and Cat.
- Oh, yeah.

108
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,653
Please stand next
to your new teammate.

109
00:04:51,688 --> 00:04:54,056
- Hello.
- What's up, team?

110
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,424
Let's choose your war banners.

111
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,092
Chloe and George,
you're up first.

112
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:58,460
Black.

113
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,795
Blue.

114
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:01,063
Orange.

115
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:02,297
Purple.

116
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,199
We'll take green.

117
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:09,772
So, Howard, what are you
gonna be looking for

118
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:11,106
in their final makeups?

119
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,508
I'm gonna look at the design,
and then, of course,

120
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,043
I want to see
what the execution is--

121
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:15,711
the detail aspect,
the paint work,

122
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,846
the application, how it's gonna
work with your banner.

123
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,481
You want it all
to tie in together.

124
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:21,450
Also, orcs are really scary.

125
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:23,285
They want to be really,
really menacing.

126
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,521
So keep those things in mind.

127
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:28,590
All right, guys, even though
you are working in teams today,

128
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,692
only one of you
can win immunity.

129
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:34,329
You have 2 1/2 hours
to complete your makeups.

130
00:05:34,364 --> 00:05:38,434
Your time starts now.

131
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:43,172
Please sit down for now.

132
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,940
I'm just gonna start slapping
prosthetics on all of them.

133
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,175
You three, come see me.

134
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,710
I'm getting all
the background orcs organized

135
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,479
and getting them
through prosthetics...

136
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:51,847
Okay, other ear.

137
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:54,249
And Corinne's working
on the main hero orc.

138
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:57,553
To me, the most definitive
characteristic of an orc

139
00:05:57,587 --> 00:06:01,256
are the pointed ears,
as well as an angry brow.

140
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,892
Matt and I looked
at the flag that we chose

141
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,428
and saw that it was,
like, a moon.

142
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:08,730
So we want to go
with nightwalkers

143
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:09,965
that attack at night.

144
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,333
- Daran.
- Yo.

145
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,535
I'm applying ears
and brow pieces.

146
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,971
We're really excited.
This is like working on set.

147
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:18,674
But this is a lot of work.

148
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,042
To make all of these orcs

149
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:21,910
seem like they came
from the same clan,

150
00:06:21,945 --> 00:06:25,447
I'm gonna put this image
from the flag on my hero orc.

151
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,349
And then
for our other characters,

152
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:29,151
we're gonna put the image
on their chest.

153
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:31,787
Niko, how many appliances
you got on everybody?

154
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,523
Two people,
three appliances each.

155
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:36,692
This is a lot of work to do.

156
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:37,993
The winner gets immunity,

157
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,561
but it's gonna be
a tough one to win.

158
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:41,230
We're gonna take
the symbol from the banner

159
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:42,931
and put it on each of them.

160
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,700
The banner has an eye symbol,

161
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:46,168
so our concept for the orcs

162
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:48,403
is they believe they
have to take their eyes out

163
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:50,172
to give them vision
of the future.

164
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:51,940
This is an orc assembly line.

165
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:54,643
Okay, next.

166
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,913
We chose the green banner.

167
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:01,049
The main orc-- he's got
this class of orcs under him,

168
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:03,485
so we've got generals,
soldiers, and then pawns.

169
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,487
We're gonna put brow pieces
on all the generals,

170
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:09,024
noses on all of the army guys,
and ears on all of the pawns.

171
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:11,026
They're gonna be green
like the banner,

172
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,130
and that tribal sign
is gonna be on their faces.

173
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,399
We're in kind of a<i>hurry.</i>

174
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,535
Our main concern is to get
every one of these people

175
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,036
in some prosthetics.

176
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,939
When we saw the banner,
it looked like fire,

177
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:26,275
which made us think branding
and then metal,

178
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:29,111
and everybody needs some sort
of, like, armor in Middle-Earth,

179
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:31,813
so these are the orcs
that make it.

180
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:33,849
Hey, orcs, I got you guys
some hats.

181
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,457
_

182
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:39,821
That's one hour, everybody.

183
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:42,424
Holy moly.

184
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,959
- Time to move on.
- Next!

185
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,093
Each brown, blue--

186
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:46,828
heavier on the brown,
then do the blue.

187
00:07:46,863 --> 00:07:48,964
We have five different
shades of colors

188
00:07:48,998 --> 00:07:51,733
that we sponge paint on
in different layers.

189
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:53,635
I'm so not a sponge painter.

190
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,338
Bam.

191
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:59,208
- Whoo, team green.
- That's awesome, Chloe.

192
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:02,110
I'm gonna do
all of the orcs' hair red

193
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:04,112
because we have
some red leather

194
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:05,814
that's hanging from the banner.

195
00:08:05,848 --> 00:08:07,182
I'm almost done with this guy.

196
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,350
We got to move a lot quicker.

197
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:10,219
Five minutes, guys!

198
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:14,089
All right, we need to get
black crap all over their hands.

199
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,191
This is awesome.

200
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,562
That's it, guys!
Time's up!

201
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:21,830
Brushes down!

202
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:25,701
- Whoo.
- Cool, brother.

203
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,041
So tell us about your orcs.

204
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:34,943
This is our leader over here.
He's the meanest.

205
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:37,212
He was actually branded
with a hot brander on his face,

206
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:40,282
which caused scarring,
and it's the symbol of the flag.

207
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,251
And everybody else
has tattoos on their chest.

208
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,920
The lead guy has that
big, nasty scar on his face,

209
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,822
and everybody else feels clean,

210
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:49,091
but they do feel
all very similar.

211
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,125
So, cool.
They're very nice.

212
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,760
- Thank you guys.
- Thank you.

213
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:54,529
We went with the green color
as their skin tone.

214
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,231
The mark that's on the flag,

215
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,134
as it goes down in rank,
it gets smaller and smaller.

216
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:01,136
I think the green's
a little overpowering.

217
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,005
I would rather have seen
a little more flesh tone

218
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,740
with green qualities to it.

219
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:07,876
But in the time frame, you made
sure that everybody is green

220
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,878
and got done,
which is important.

221
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:11,346
- Cool.
- Thank you.

222
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:15,884
We saw this as fire, so
they're all forgers and welders.

223
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,953
Well, I think there's
some paint opportunities

224
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:19,354
- that got missed...
- Oh, yeah.

225
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,023
Just going in
and punching things up

226
00:09:21,057 --> 00:09:23,191
and make sure you always
paint inside the ear.

227
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:24,793
But everything looks very cool.

228
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:26,061
Thanks a lot.

229
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:28,163
They believe that
when they take the eyes

230
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:30,699
of their enemies,
they can foresee the future.

231
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,968
I think your concept
is working well.

232
00:09:33,002 --> 00:09:35,437
I like the contrast
of the red hair a lot.

233
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,005
I was looking at everybody's
flag and wondering

234
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,707
if people were gonna use
any of the accoutrements,

235
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:39,908
and you certainly did.

236
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:41,576
Good job, guys.

237
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:43,745
These nocturnal orcs
come in the night,

238
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,580
and they attack and feed
on other orc camps

239
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:47,115
or elves or whoever.

240
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,484
They're very vampiric,
which is cool.

241
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,819
They feel cohesive.

242
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,954
I can tell that they're
all uniform within a tribe.

243
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,823
I like the fact
that some are splattered

244
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:58,193
with this dark blood,
and I think the concept is cool

245
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:00,295
and I think you certainly
pulled this off.

246
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,165
- Thanks, guys, really.
- Thank you.

247
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,935
So, Howard,
this was undoubtedly

248
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,537
the most difficult
foundation challenge

249
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,939
we've ever given
our contestants.

250
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,107
How do you think they did?

251
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,309
I think everybody did amazing.

252
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:16,445
I wouldn't want to do it,
that's all I know,

253
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,046
not in that time frame.

254
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,981
All right, well, which teams
had the best clans?

255
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:22,117
Chloe and George...

256
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:24,286
you're the only team
that went beyond the banner

257
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,255
and utilized the accoutrements
that were hanging off.

258
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,757
And, Corinne and Matt...

259
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,959
I felt everything
was very well executed

260
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:33,595
and your hero guy
was really spot-on.

261
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,530
Which team came out on top?

262
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:38,266
The top team is...

263
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:41,903
Coming up...

264
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:43,305
Come on, gentlemen, let's move.

265
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:44,873
I don't know
if I'm gonna finish this mold.

266
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,808
I was trying to give it
some angularness.

267
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:49,277
Daran doesn't trust me or think
that I know how to do anything.

268
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,947
- That really looks bad.
- That was a very smart move.

269
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:54,316
So disproportionate.

270
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,097
Which team came out on top?

271
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:04,367
The top team is...

272
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:07,037
Corinne and Matt.

273
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,905
Awesome.

274
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,940
The work that you guys did
was exceptional.

275
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,308
Everything worked together,

276
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:14,511
and I felt they
were actually film-quality.

277
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:15,845
So big thumbs-up.

278
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,047
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

279
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:19,215
Congratulations,
Corinne and Matt.

280
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,919
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

281
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:25,288
- So, Howard...
- The winner is...

282
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:27,891
Corinne.

283
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,493
Wow. Thank you. Awesome.

284
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:31,861
You designed the paint scheme,

285
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:35,465
and that really led the path
for the rest of the clan.

286
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:37,300
- So job well done.
- Thank you.

287
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,869
To know that I have immunity
is such a relief.

288
00:11:39,904 --> 00:11:41,638
Congratulations, Corinne.

289
00:11:41,672 --> 00:11:44,841
In the next spotlight challenge,
you cannot be eliminated.

290
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,309
Yay!

291
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:48,311
All right, guys,
you definitely created an army,

292
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:50,313
and I think
they're ready for war.

293
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:53,016
Oh...

294
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,084
Oh, my God.

295
00:11:58,122 --> 00:11:59,155
Oh, they look angry.

296
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:03,393
Oh, my God,
let's get out of here.

297
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,342
I wonder where we are.

298
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:22,245
We're walking into this swamp
in the middle of nowhere.

299
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,115
It's super hot,
and I'm trying to figure out

300
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,150
what we're doing out here.

301
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:28,518
Hey, guys.

302
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:29,953
Hey.

303
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,187
All around the world,

304
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:34,624
sightings of mysterious
creatures are on the rise.

305
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:36,526
They include
the infamous Loch Ness Monster

306
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,027
in the Scottish Highlands

307
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,764
and Bigfoot
in the Pacific Northwest.

308
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:43,533
I'm talking about cryptids.

309
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,534
Excellent.

310
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:46,770
Cryptozoology is pretty wacky.

311
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:50,039
It is the study of possibly
real, possibly fake animals.

312
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:52,308
On each of these monitors
is a set of coordinates

313
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:55,512
that correlate to the location
of a cryptid sighting.

314
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:58,014
Working in teams of two,
your spotlight challenge

315
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,916
is to choose a set
of coordinates

316
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,554
and bring that location's
cryptid to life.

317
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:07,490
And today you'll be picking
your own teams.

318
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,160
So go ahead and stand
next your new teammate.

319
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:11,561
- Come on.
- Niko.

320
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:12,829
- Corinne?
- Sure, buddy.

321
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:14,097
I picked Corinne.

322
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:16,199
I loved working with her
on the foundation challenge,

323
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,001
and I'm hoping we can turn
that energy around

324
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,569
and win it again.

325
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:21,805
When I call your team,
select your coordinates.

326
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,840
Graham and Rashaad.

327
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,019
All right, let's take a look
at your cryptids.

328
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,227
That looks pretty cool.

329
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:47,297
Niko and George,
you chose Vodyanoy from Russia.

330
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,631
I just knew it.
Russia.

331
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,601
Corinne and Matt, the Jersey
Devil from New Jersey.

332
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:53,002
Excellent.

333
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:56,773
Chloe and Tyler, Mapinguari
from the Amazon in Brazil.

334
00:13:56,807 --> 00:13:59,375
Daran and Cat,
Chupacabra from Mexico.

335
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,678
- Chupa.
- And, Rashaad and Graham,

336
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:03,213
you have the Bunyip
from Australia.

337
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,247
Right.

338
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:05,415
All right,
I would like you to meet

339
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,617
a very special guest.

340
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:10,153
He's Hollywood's most
sought-after creature actor.

341
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:12,555
He's currently featured
on <i>Falling Skies</i>

342
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,592
and blockbusters such
as <i>Pan's Labyrinth,</i>

343
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:18,228
<i>Fantastic Four</i>
<i>Rise Of The Silver Surfer,</i>

344
00:14:18,262 --> 00:14:20,296
and the <i>Hellboy</i> franchise.

345
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,798
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, yes.

346
00:14:21,832 --> 00:14:24,667
Please give a warm welcome
to Doug Jones.

347
00:14:24,702 --> 00:14:26,970
Doug Jones!

348
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:28,371
Oh, hi!

349
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:30,006
- Yay!
- Thank you.

350
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,410
Doug Jones is one of
the best creature performers.

351
00:14:34,445 --> 00:14:37,347
He knows how to bring
a character to life

352
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:38,414
through the makeup.

353
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:39,716
Thank you so much
for being here.

354
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,050
Thank you for having me.
This is a treat.

355
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:42,452
Well, you've elevated
so many films

356
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:43,887
with your amazing performances.

357
00:14:43,921 --> 00:14:45,355
- Oh, now, stop it.
- No, it's true.

358
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,422
And you're gonna be joining us

359
00:14:46,457 --> 00:14:47,991
- on the reveal stage...
- I am.

360
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:49,359
So what are you gonna be
looking for in the final makeup?

361
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:51,361
The word "Organic"
comes to mind.

362
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:53,062
When I'm wearing something,
I want to know

363
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:54,330
that I woke up that way.

364
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,099
You don't want to feel
like a guy in a suit.

365
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,234
Also, can an actor move
and perform in it?

366
00:14:58,269 --> 00:14:59,569
That's always key to what I do.

367
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:00,570
Fantastic.

368
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:01,638
All right, guys, I want you

369
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:02,805
to grab your sketchbooks

370
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,141
and start working
on your designs.

371
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,844
Good luck.

372
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:11,014
It's just hard to draw
without any reference.

373
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:14,317
Chloe and I look at our tablets,
and we have information

374
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:15,919
on what our cryptid is.

375
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:17,120
I think we have to do
all of these elements

376
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:18,554
that it says here.

377
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,390
This is definitely
gonna be a challenge

378
00:15:20,424 --> 00:15:22,926
because we don't have
any kind of reference material.

379
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,127
They've never
been photographed,

380
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:26,696
and there's no proof
cryptids even exist.

381
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,465
The Mapinguari
are ape-like creatures

382
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,967
covered in fur,

383
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:34,203
one eye,
a mouth on its stomach.

384
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,339
I'm just like, "What?"

385
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,139
_

386
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:40,209
We're doing two things that
the judges absolutely hate--

387
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:42,912
fun fur, which we're gonna cover
our creature in,

388
00:15:42,947 --> 00:15:44,213
and mouths on the stomach,

389
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:46,215
which we're gonna do
a giant one.

390
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,320
But it is what this challenge
calls for.

391
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:54,023
Maybe he has doglike features
but he's not a dog.

392
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,191
Yeah, for sure.

393
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:57,694
Our cryptid
is the Jersey Devil.

394
00:15:57,728 --> 00:16:02,832
It's part man, part kangaroo,
and it has bat wings,

395
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,134
horns, and hooved feet.

396
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:09,205
We definitely want to use
all of those elements.

397
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,542
All right, guys,
let's head back to the lab.

398
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,943
Let's go.

399
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,247
Let's go.

400
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:21,351
We have six hours at the lab.

401
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:23,219
George and I
picked the Vodyanoy.

402
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,587
I got an idea there.

403
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:26,356
He's a creature
that lives in swamps,

404
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,958
and so we want him
to have a frog face,

405
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:32,528
a barracuda type of mouth,
and a tail so it looks aquatic.

406
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:34,030
George starts
working on the face,

407
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,531
and I start working
on the cowl.

408
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:38,401
Awesome.

409
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:40,670
Cat and I end up
with Chupacabra.

410
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:44,240
I start sculpting the face.
Cat starts working on the cowl.

411
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:46,409
We want it to have
a very doglike face

412
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:50,179
with a snake-like tongue
and leathery, scaly skin.

413
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:52,648
Bring this crown right down
into the spine area.

414
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:55,585
One element that I'm pushing
for is the color choice.

415
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:57,420
The story specifically says

416
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:59,989
that the Chupacabra
has a green-gray skin,

417
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:01,591
but Daran wants to give it

418
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,427
orange-y, red,
burgundy skin tones.

419
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:05,728
It's not what the story says.

420
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,130
I don't have a problem

421
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:09,332
letting Daran
take creative lead on this,

422
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,834
but I'm trying really hard
to make this a partnership.

423
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,604
We want to kind of-- shoo--
slope it down just like that.

424
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:15,972
This silhouette
looks really nice.

425
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:18,775
I will be creating
the bat wings,

426
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,578
and Matt will be sculpting
the face and the stomach.

427
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:25,048
I'm building the wings
out of armature wire,

428
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,617
then I drape a netting fabric.

429
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,519
I'm really excited
about these wings.

430
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,587
I wish I could keep these.

431
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:33,356
This is a Bunyip.

432
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,224
I ain't ever seen one.
Just don't know what it is.

433
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,160
What we learn about the Bunyip

434
00:17:37,194 --> 00:17:40,396
is that it's got tusks,
feathers, flippers,

435
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:42,098
and the body of a man.

436
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:44,534
So we're gonna force
all of these descriptions

437
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:45,701
into the creature.

438
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,570
Very animalistic, mate.

439
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:50,606
It's going to be
crocodile from the head,

440
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:54,811
have feathers like a mohawk,
and have the tusk of a walrus.

441
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:57,413
Graham sculpts the cowl.
I sculpt the face.

442
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:58,414
And we hope we can pull it off.

443
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:05,755
I will be doing the face
for our Mapinguari.

444
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:08,257
Tyler is going
to make the fur suit

445
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,026
and then block out the chest.

446
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,894
Your favorite stuff
in the world, Chloe.

447
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,329
I start building my forms

448
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:15,598
and then start
gluing foam cushion

449
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:18,668
to really form out
the structure of an ape.

450
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:22,572
It's about halfway
through the day,

451
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:23,606
and I'm working on the face.

452
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,141
But there's a lot of elements

453
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:27,310
of the Jersey Devil
that I'm not getting,

454
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:29,212
and I'm really starting
to get nervous.

455
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:32,782
I'm not sure
that it looks like a dog.

456
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:36,285
I'm not super well-versed
in sculpting animal forms,

457
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,787
and I don't feel very good.

458
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:39,889
You don't really need this.

459
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:41,524
I feel anxious,

460
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:43,159
and for the first time
in this competition,

461
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:44,627
I'm really worried.

462
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,664
She has immunity,
and if we're a bottom look,

463
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:50,299
I'm in trouble.

464
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:54,003
I need to fix my sculpture,
or I'm going home.

465
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,389
I'm not sure
that it looks like a dog.

466
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,324
Today is the first day
of our cryptid challenge,

467
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:05,259
and I feel like there's
a lot of elements

468
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,695
about the Jersey Devil
that I'm not getting.

469
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,730
My confidence level
has dropped.

470
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:10,865
Do you want to refine that,

471
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,299
and I can start putting
some clay on the belly?

472
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:13,334
Sure.

473
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:15,102
I ask Corinne
to take over the face

474
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:16,570
because I'm having
a difficult time,

475
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,205
but she has immunity.

476
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,674
So, if we're a bottom look,
I'm the one going home.

477
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,943
You picked me.
Remember that.

478
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:24,412
I did.

479
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:30,050
- Are you sculpting a tongue?
- Yes!

480
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,553
I'm in the middle
of sculpting the stomach piece

481
00:19:32,587 --> 00:19:34,054
on our Mapinguari,

482
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,890
and I need a reference
of a tongue of some sort.

483
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,224
Okay.

484
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,360
I end up taking a reference
of Rashaad's mouth,

485
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:41,195
and it really helps.

486
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:43,931
I think it's hilarious.

487
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,068
Here's yours.

488
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,837
- Thanks, Rashaad.
- You're welcome.

489
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:51,939
It's time to mold.

490
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,407
We got to get
this face out today,

491
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,775
because since
we're doing the cowl,

492
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,278
we need to make sure
that it lines up correctly.

493
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:01,515
Then we can move on to
the other aspects of our Bunyip.

494
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,783
We don't need
to be adding more clay.

495
00:20:02,818 --> 00:20:04,018
We need to take away, I think.

496
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,252
Daran takes over the cowl.

497
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,787
He doesn't trust me,
and I feel like

498
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,423
I might as well not even
be here, and that's frustrating.

499
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,859
I need to fight to put
a bit of me in the design

500
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,761
because I want
to impress the judges

501
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,832
with something that's mine.

502
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,668
- There you go.
- We only got seven minutes.

503
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,036
Can he do it in seven minutes?

504
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,305
We're gonna find out
over here on<i> Face Off.</i>

505
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:26,874
At the end of the day,
I'm still cleaning the mold.

506
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,742
- Time?
- 2:22.

507
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:30,211
I'm pushing it.

508
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:31,610
_

509
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,214
We've got minutes left
on the clock.

510
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:35,282
- A minute and 38 seconds.
- Go!

511
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,418
I've just got my fingers crossed
Graham can get it done

512
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:38,786
so we can run in foam.

513
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,222
You got 20 seconds, Graham!
Here comes the mold strap.

514
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:45,392
I'm spraying this mold out
with seconds left.

515
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,627
We get it done.

516
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,497
All right, everybody,
that's time!

517
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:51,932
By the end of the first day,
the face is already finished.

518
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,102
Tomorrow we're in a good spot.

519
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:56,837
So it's looking
pretty good for us.

520
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,912
Let's do this.

521
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:06,714
It's day 2
of our cryptid challenge,

522
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,482
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab today.

523
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,384
Check that out.

524
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,920
The foam gods love us.
No, your molds love us.

525
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:15,589
Maybe make it, like,
a little more of a fish scale.

526
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:16,891
We have a lot of work to do.

527
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,760
George needs to finish
detailing the face and the cowl.

528
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,663
I need to start sculpting
the chest and back.

529
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,698
I'm trying to get this chest
molded today.

530
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,333
I hope we can do it.

531
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,202
- It's gonna be beautiful, dude.
- Yeah.

532
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:29,503
I'm just making sure
that, you know,

533
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,438
we don't put
all this time and effort

534
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,474
into veins you don't even see
until you're--

535
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,042
They'll see it.

536
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:36,777
Corinne is definitely
leading this team.

537
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:39,914
I want to do bigger, but Corinne
keeps wanting to go minimal.

538
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:42,416
It is really hard to see
from far away.

539
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,385
If we don't do enough
and we're a bottom look,

540
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:47,454
I'm gonna
take the brunt of that.

541
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,265
Come on, let's move,
gentlemen, let's move!

542
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,134
- George?
- Yes?

543
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:01,669
Can you bring me hemp?

544
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,805
I'm putting the last layer
of the mold, but it has to dry,

545
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,974
and we have to open it,
we have to clean it.

546
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:09,109
So I don't know, at this point,
if I'm going to get it done.

547
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:10,344
How much time?

548
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:11,845
- 32.
- 32 minutes.

549
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,783
- Let's take it outside.
- Come on, dry for me.

550
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,117
If we don't get this out,

551
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,719
we will have no chest
and no back,

552
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,654
no tail, no nothing.

553
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:25,359
We got to help 'em
open this mold.

554
00:22:25,393 --> 00:22:27,461
We're attacking this thing
to get it open.

555
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,330
Oh, it's opening.
All right, come on, let's do it.

556
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:30,331
- Got it.
- Yeah!

557
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:31,332
Put it on the floor.

558
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:32,466
With one minute left,

559
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,801
there's just so much chaos.

560
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,469
All right, let's go, guys.

561
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:36,837
- Got it.
- Got it, got it, let's go.

562
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:38,872
Oh, my God.

563
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,474
We do it in the nick of time.

564
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:42,509
All right, guys, that's time!

565
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:44,478
I'm really grateful
that I have, like,

566
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:45,646
good people that help us.

567
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,681
We couldn't do it without them.

568
00:22:47,716 --> 00:22:50,150
We got it.

569
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,725
It's application day.
We got four hours in the lab,

570
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,126
one hour at last looks.

571
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,661
We're just ready to apply
this thing and get going.

572
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:03,263
We just need a bucket of water
and a bucket of thinner.

573
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,932
- How's the face?
- It's good.

574
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,433
I'm gonna grab some clay
real quick

575
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,168
and just make a quick hoof.

576
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:10,137
I think that we've gone
way too subtle,

577
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:13,107
so I'm working on getting
some hooves made up.

578
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:17,244
It's an additional piece
that might punch it up.

579
00:23:18,747 --> 00:23:20,914
- Hey, man, good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

580
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:22,783
Ours is more
like a frog-fish.

581
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:24,485
Ooh, you got
a good bald cap head.

582
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,554
Ready to be a Bunyip?
There you go.

583
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:31,392
Okay, thinner right here.
Glue here.

584
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:32,960
Daran pours up some glue
and says,

585
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,561
"Hey, Cat, stand here."

586
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:36,230
- Glue.
- And I'm standing there like,

587
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,564
"How long is this
gonna go on?"

588
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,133
Fill me up
a little more glue, please.

589
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm not your assistant, Daran.

590
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,368
Do you want to have him
hold the cups?

591
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:42,803
I think it would be
a better use of our time

592
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:45,906
for me not to stand here
and hold cups.

593
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,007
We've got a lot to do,

594
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,575
so I kind of
just move on really fast.

595
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,512
We need to start painting
and applying our model.

596
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,814
You're good.

597
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:55,916
- We got to get painting going.
- Start.

598
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,518
We have all the pieces
applied on him

599
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:59,853
and start applying paint.

600
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:02,289
I'm going with this
minty-green color.

601
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:05,392
It looks unreal,
which it would make sense to me

602
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:08,328
for a creature like this.

603
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,568
This is, like, a perfect blend
of these two colors.

604
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:15,636
Just like you and me.

605
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,705
We decide on
an overall paint scheme,

606
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:22,076
which needs to transition all
of these different animal parts.

607
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:24,078
That's a Bunyip.

608
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:26,580
Everybody,
that's 15 minutes left.

609
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,222
That's time, everybody.

610
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:37,257
Everyone's concepts
are so great,

611
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,560
and I'm looking at ours
and it's not looking good,

612
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:42,296
but it's what we have,
and we have to go with it.

613
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,964
It sucks because I let Daran

614
00:24:43,998 --> 00:24:45,733
make so many
of the important decisions,

615
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,601
and I don't want to go home
for something

616
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:51,238
that I know wasn't my design.

617
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:53,974
Coming up...

618
00:24:54,008 --> 00:24:56,210
This is the fastest hour
of my life.

619
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,244
- Look at in there.
- Oh, boy.

620
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:58,579
One of us could be going home.

621
00:24:58,613 --> 00:24:59,847
Wow.
That's impressive.

622
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:02,883
Dudes, you got
the kitchen-sink boogeyman.

623
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:13,644
All right.

624
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,281
It's last looks, and we know
we have a lot of work to do.

625
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,816
I need to glue the tail.

626
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,584
We need to finish
all the paint job.

627
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:23,620
We're trying to work
as fast as we can.

628
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,125
- I got to lay all this hair.
- It's looking really good.

629
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,560
At this point,
we got to make sure

630
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,528
every element
is on our character,

631
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,264
because at the end of the day,
one of us could be going home.

632
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,766
You want to hot-glue
this to here?

633
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,102
This is the fastest hour
of my life.

634
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,504
You want to leave this hair
long like this?

635
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,539
- I was thinking.
- We should, uh...

636
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,807
maybe cut some of this down.

637
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,442
I like 'em kind of flaring off.

638
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,211
I'm not happy
with the hair at all.

639
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,146
Daran doesn't listen
to anything I say.

640
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,483
15 minutes, guys!
15 minutes.

641
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,818
Where's his teeth?

642
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:01,425
All right, guys, that's it.
That's time.

643
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,893
- Yay!
- High fives.

644
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:04,461
I'm sorry, but it looks good.

645
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,464
I'm not feeling very confident,

646
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:10,768
and I really don't want to go
home because of this makeup.

647
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,436
I'd rather go home
on an individual challenge,

648
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,737
knowing that it was my fault

649
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,541
rather than someone else's
poor decisions.

650
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:30,120
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

651
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,456
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

652
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,092
Say hello
to our talented judges...

653
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,928
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick...

654
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:39,797
- Good evening.
- Hey, Glenn.

655
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,166
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

656
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,568
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey, Ve.

657
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,804
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page...

658
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,516
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

659
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:52,970
And joining us again is famed
creature actor Doug Jones.

660
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:55,479
Hey-- Oh, thank you.

661
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,547
Thank you for having me back.

662
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,115
I can't wait
to see what happened

663
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,383
over the last couple days.

664
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:02,019
All right, guys, this week
your spotlight challenge

665
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,254
was to choose a set
of coordinates

666
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,524
and create the fabled cryptid
found at that location.

667
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,894
Let's take a look
at your creations.

668
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,185
I'm not happy
with this creature.

669
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,387
I definitely regret
not pushing the ideas

670
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,023
that I wanted in this makeup.

671
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,677
There are a lot
of risky things we did

672
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,913
that the judges
might absolutely hate.

673
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,916
But I hope they notice
that we really did try do it

674
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,720
in a way that did make sense.

675
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,675
I think we did
bring the folklore to life.

676
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:35,279
It's creepy,
and I'm proud of it.

677
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,767
It just looks so cool.

678
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,469
I'm happy to show Doug Jones
what we've made.

679
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:03,407
Maybe it's something
he might want to wear.

680
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,730
I know she's not quite
as stunning and striking

681
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,265
as the other cryptids.

682
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,302
I'm just hoping, at this point,
that we're safe.

683
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,243
Judges, it's time to take
a closer look at our cryptids.

684
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:48,452
What happened here?

685
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,020
Dude,
this is a speckle-fest.

686
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:52,255
And as we go
into the face, mud.

687
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,323
It's so sloppy.

688
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,927
Turn all the way around,
please.

689
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,330
- Is the spine off-center too?
- Yeah, looks like it.

690
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,867
All right, thank you.

691
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:07,204
I like how this fur has been
all treated from head to toe.

692
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,339
Look how beautiful
the paint is on the tongue.

693
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,274
Look, that's a lot of movement
out of that thing.

694
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,877
Yeah. That's got to hurt.

695
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,046
Thanks.

696
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,516
Turn sideways.

697
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,651
This line here is really cool.

698
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,253
- Matches this one back here.
- Mm-hmm.

699
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,421
So he's balanced.

700
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,689
- Good.
- Thank you.

701
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,325
Excellent.

702
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,160
This dude's
got it all going on.

703
00:30:30,194 --> 00:30:32,095
Turn all the way around.

704
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,463
Wow.

705
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,599
You wouldn't have put feathers
and reptilian together,

706
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,733
would you?

707
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,603
It works.

708
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,906
Thanks.

709
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,441
I think that's
the kangaroo belly.

710
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,209
- I guess.
- The skirt hides it.

711
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,445
Everybody else
got so much done,

712
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,881
and all they have is the wings
and this facial sculpt.

713
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:51,915
Yeah.

714
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:53,984
I know that the judges
are thinking,

715
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,653
"It's just not as good
as everyone else's."

716
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,055
So, if we're a bottom look,

717
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,456
I'm probably
going to be going home,

718
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,492
because Corinne has immunity.

719
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,129
Who made your favorite cryptid?

720
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:09,266
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

721
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,288
Everybody else
got so much done,

722
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:15,924
and all they have is the wings
and this facial sculpt.

723
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:16,992
Yeah.

724
00:31:17,026 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm starting to feel like this

725
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:19,861
may be my last day here.

726
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:22,464
It's just not as good
as everyone else's.

727
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:25,367
Can you move
your eyebrows at all?

728
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:27,269
- Mm-mm.
- No?

729
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,305
All right.
Thank you.

730
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:39,547
So, Doug, you gave these guys
some great advice the other day.

731
00:31:39,582 --> 00:31:42,083
What do you think
of the final creations?

732
00:31:42,118 --> 00:31:43,418
I think that everybody
listened really well.

733
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,298
You all have elements that
move well, each one of you.

734
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:48,303
- They did a great job.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

735
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:51,100
Okay, the judges would like
to speak with each of you

736
00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:52,394
to learn more about your work.

737
00:31:52,428 --> 00:31:55,330
Tyler and Chloe,
you're up first.

738
00:32:02,305 --> 00:32:04,139
Tell us about
your design, guys.

739
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:07,642
This is a Mapinguari,
a creature that has one eye,

740
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,898
a mouth on the stomach,

741
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:13,078
and lots of mudded red fur.

742
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:16,584
Chloe sculpted the face.
I fabricated the suit.

743
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,454
I sculpted the mouth,
and we both painted together.

744
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:21,523
I really want to see
Captain Kirk fight this thing.

745
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:26,361
I think that
your greatest triumph

746
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:29,831
is taking all those
extremely ridiculous things

747
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,200
and combining it in a way
that's not so ridiculous.

748
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:33,868
- Yeah.
- Wonderfully done.

749
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:34,936
Thank you.

750
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,071
I think you did
a really great job

751
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:37,639
not using red fur

752
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:40,942
but using the semi-gingerish,
warm coloring.

753
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,844
And the fact that
you matted it all down--

754
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,913
that was a very smart move
on your part.

755
00:32:44,947 --> 00:32:46,081
Thank you.

756
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:49,217
I particularly love the forms
on the chest

757
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:52,420
imply, with the nipples,
a set of eyes.

758
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:54,589
Your character
has character within it.

759
00:32:54,623 --> 00:32:56,091
It's so good on so many levels,

760
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,392
so congratulations.

761
00:32:57,426 --> 00:32:58,526
Thank you.

762
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,328
The mouth in the middle
of that belly

763
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:01,763
is the centerpiece for me,

764
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:03,898
especially from
a performance level as well.

765
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,500
It's a beautiful piece.

766
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:06,935
Thank you.

767
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,870
Tyler and Chloe,
please step back.

768
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,306
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

769
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:18,246
Matt and Corinne.

770
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:29,424
Tell us about your character
and who did what on the project.

771
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,192
We got the New Jersey Devil.

772
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:33,328
It had features of dogs
in its face.

773
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:36,398
It had devil-like horns
and tails, bat-like wings,

774
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,866
and a kangaroo body.

775
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,635
I made the wings and the horns.

776
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:44,272
Matt sculpted the face,
did the hooves and the tail.

777
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:47,942
I think you just didn't do
enough this week, guys.

778
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:49,944
Everybody else
did so much more,

779
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:52,614
and you guys just had
fabric wings and this face,

780
00:33:52,648 --> 00:33:54,783
and the wings look
like draperies, unfortunately.

781
00:33:54,817 --> 00:33:57,252
So I'm a little bit
disappointed in that.

782
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,388
If it's gonna be minimal,
it's just got to be so precise.

783
00:34:00,423 --> 00:34:04,959
But I don't think that you've
executed a high-end makeup.

784
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:06,728
We should want
to shrink in terror

785
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:09,597
from the horrible visage
of the Jersey Devil,

786
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,000
and instead, you chuckle
at the curtain-wing demon.

787
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:16,004
You made some tough decisions
this week, guys, sorry.

788
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:18,907
Matt and Corinne,
please step back.

789
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,512
I'm sorry.

790
00:34:24,547 --> 00:34:26,815
Let's talk to Niko and George.

791
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:32,887
Tell us about your creation.

792
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:35,023
Our creature's name
is Vodyanoy.

793
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:37,926
He's known
to have a frog-fish body.

794
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,696
This is mostly frog,
and for fish, a barracuda,

795
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:44,399
and then fish scales
going through the body.

796
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:48,369
There are some really
good things in this.

797
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:50,972
What I like the most about it
is that there are details

798
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,707
that look physically
purposeful,

799
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:54,042
like the elements
on his forearm.

800
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:55,643
They feel like
they're hydrodynamically

801
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:56,945
meant to be there.

802
00:34:56,979 --> 00:35:00,582
I like seeing things that feel
like they have a reason.

803
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:02,250
What I like specifically
about this one

804
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:05,320
is the consistency
of your fin-like attributes,

805
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,422
from the head, the shoulders,
all the way down

806
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:09,691
to the sides of his arms,
the back of the tail.

807
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:11,392
There's a balance to him.
Great job.

808
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,827
Thank you.

809
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,963
Niko and George,
please step back.

810
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:21,402
Yeah, buddy.

811
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:24,439
Rashaad and Graham,
please come forward.

812
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:31,246
So tell us about
the inspiration of this design

813
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,714
and who did what on what.

814
00:35:32,748 --> 00:35:34,315
This is called a Bunyip.

815
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,385
It has the tusks of a walrus,
feathers like a bird,

816
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:40,421
crocodile-type head,
flippers, and a horse tail.

817
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:43,558
I sculpted the face.
Graham sculpted the cowl.

818
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:46,027
And we broke down
the paint job.

819
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,263
I actually like this one a lot.

820
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:51,533
The description was ridiculous,

821
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,368
and you made
all that ridiculous

822
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,737
come together
in a cohesive being.

823
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:58,072
I love the two rows
of teeth placed willy-nilly

824
00:35:58,107 --> 00:35:59,574
as though it really just--
kahh!--

825
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,743
came out of somewhere
and-- ahh!

826
00:36:01,777 --> 00:36:04,212
- I like this one a lot.
- Thank you.

827
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:06,114
One sculpted the face,
one sculpted the cowl?

828
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:08,983
Yeah, I sculpted the face.
Graham sculpted the cowl.

829
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:11,286
Wow. That's impressive,
because the face and the cowl

830
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,354
look like they were sculpted
by one person.

831
00:36:13,389 --> 00:36:14,956
Well done.
That's really tight.

832
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,159
Dudes, you got stuck
with the kitchen-sink boogeyman.

833
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:19,694
I can't even remember
all the stuff

834
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:21,796
that it said it had on it.

835
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,831
I love the colors
on the paint job.

836
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:26,134
And his profile is amazing.

837
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:27,635
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

838
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,938
Rashaad and Graham,
please step back.

839
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:38,546
Daran and Cat, please step up.

840
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:40,715
Thank you, sir.

841
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:46,588
Hi, guys. Tell us
about your cryptid design today.

842
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:48,256
We chose the Chupacabra.

843
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,326
It's like a reptile,
emaciated dog-type creature.

844
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,929
I sculpted the face.
Cat sculpted the chest.

845
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,798
And I detailed the rest
of everything out.

846
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:58,399
Things have gone off the tracks

847
00:36:58,434 --> 00:36:59,834
in terms of anatomy for you.

848
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:01,869
Yeah.

849
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:04,906
The head is so big
compared to the rib cage.

850
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,609
That puts it in a really bad
place for me this week, guys.

851
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,577
- Okay.
- A bigger issue, though,

852
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:14,415
is the structure
in the face sculpturally,

853
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,850
especially around his mouth.

854
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,752
That really looks bad.

855
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:19,220
From an actor's point of view,

856
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:21,322
when an expression like that
is carved into you,

857
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:22,824
there's very little
the actor can do.

858
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:24,993
So you've limited what
his performance can be in this,

859
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:27,462
but overall, I would pet him.

860
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:30,465
Daran and Cat,
please step back.

861
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,000
Thanks, buddy.

862
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:38,973
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

863
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,908
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

864
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:42,143
while they deliberate.

865
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,178
Thank you.

866
00:37:46,582 --> 00:37:49,484
All right, judges, so let's
talk about tonight's looks.

867
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:52,487
Why don't we start
with Tyler and Chloe?

868
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:54,622
That's probably one
of the best uses of fun fur

869
00:37:54,657 --> 00:37:55,790
we've had on the show.

870
00:37:55,824 --> 00:37:57,692
I mean, they treated it.
They gummed it all up.

871
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:00,061
The sculpture
was pretty incredible.

872
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:02,730
The paint job on the tongue
and the interior of the mouth

873
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:05,566
up into the teeth
is one of the finest paint jobs

874
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:09,003
we've seen on the show of any
single element, ever, period.

875
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:12,440
And the fact that it moved--
oh, gosh, that was hilarious.

876
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:15,343
All right, let's move on
to Rashaad and Graham.

877
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,446
This is a cool exercise
in picking and choosing

878
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,214
what you're going to take
from your direction.

879
00:38:20,249 --> 00:38:21,849
And they pick and chose
everything.

880
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:23,051
Everything.

881
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:24,686
This is the paint job
that I love so much.

882
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,787
The profile was amazing.

883
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:28,856
That crocodile side view
was unbelievable.

884
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,025
All right, let's move on
to Niko and George.

885
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,727
There were some
absolutely gorgeous shapes

886
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:33,795
coming off of the head.

887
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:35,530
I love that pinched, curvy line

888
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,031
that came off the side
of his head.

889
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:38,399
- Yes.
- I thought it was gorgeous.

890
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:40,368
And the consistency of it,
from all the elements--

891
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,037
arms, head, shoulders,
and that tail.

892
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,206
All right, let's move on
to Matt and Corinne,

893
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,042
and I do want to remind you
that Corinne does have immunity.

894
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,210
Good for her.

895
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,245
My first comment is,
"Is that all there is?"

896
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,815
Because they did
just this face appliance.

897
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:55,149
They fabricated the wings,

898
00:38:55,184 --> 00:38:56,718
and they could've been
so much better.

899
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,554
It didn't read "Dog" to me.
I don't know if it should have.

900
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,056
They could've done
a beautiful makeup,

901
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,925
and they missed
that opportunity.

902
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:06,561
All right, let's finish up
with Daran and Cat.

903
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:11,099
This makeup was profoundly
uninteresting and uncreative.

904
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,267
My problem with this
is that the bone structure

905
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:16,070
is not straight, and it's
not purposely asymmetrical.

906
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:18,706
It looks like the skull itself
has a raised eyebrow.

907
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:20,007
It was like Silly Putty.

908
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:21,943
As a performer,
when you're given an expression

909
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:23,578
that you can't
express out of...

910
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,546
- Right.
- ...that's death to an actor.

911
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:27,515
All right, judges.
Have you made your decision?

912
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:28,616
- Yeah.
- Yep.

913
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,285
Okay, let's bring 'em back out.

914
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,861
Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

915
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:42,330
Tyler and Chloe...

916
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:45,967
We love that this character
was funny but believable

917
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:49,003
and amazingly well-balanced
throughout.

918
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:50,638
Rashaad and Graham...

919
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:53,708
There were some
tremendously well-done parts

920
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:55,376
of the head and the cowl,

921
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,079
and the multiple rows of teeth
were super cool.

922
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:00,114
Okay, which team
came out on top?

923
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:02,483
The top team tonight is...

924
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:07,523
Okay, which team
came out on top?

925
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:10,893
The top team tonight is...

926
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:16,265
Tyler and Chloe.

927
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:17,800
Good job.

928
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:21,137
We were quite impressed with
how well you brought together

929
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:24,874
all of the outrageous elements
of your cryptid tonight.

930
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:26,809
- Great work.
- Thank you.

931
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:28,644
Tyler and Chloe, great job.

932
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:30,679
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

933
00:40:30,714 --> 00:40:31,847
Glenn?

934
00:40:31,882 --> 00:40:34,517
The winner tonight is...

935
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:35,518
Tyler.

936
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:36,819
Wow.

937
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:40,322
Your belly mouth and tongue
were just fantastic.

938
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,524
Thank you.

939
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:44,994
Second win--
I'm feeling pretty ecstatic.

940
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,128
This is awesome!

941
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:47,663
Tyler, congratulations.

942
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:48,831
Thank you.

943
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:51,967
You, Chloe, Rashaad,
and Graham are safe.

944
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:53,769
Niko and George,
you are also safe

945
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:55,638
and can head back
to the makeup room.

946
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:58,040
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

947
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,280
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

948
00:41:04,314 --> 00:41:05,948
are on the bottom this week

949
00:41:05,982 --> 00:41:09,018
and one of you
will be eliminated.

950
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:11,754
Now, Corinne,
you do have immunity,

951
00:41:11,788 --> 00:41:13,255
so you are safe this week.

952
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,558
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room.

953
00:41:17,994 --> 00:41:20,162
The rest of you,
please step forward.

954
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:30,106
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

955
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,274
Matt, the scope
of your creature

956
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:36,345
simply paled in comparison
to everything else tonight.

957
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:41,217
Daran and Cat, there were
many divergent design aspects

958
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:42,451
in terms of the anatomy,

959
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:45,888
and the paint job
was inconsistent throughout.

960
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,356
So who's going home tonight?

961
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,559
The person
going home tonight is...

962
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,265
Matt.

963
00:41:56,299 --> 00:41:58,567
You knew that Corinne
had immunity,

964
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,402
so you had to step up

965
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:04,340
and include some signature
element in this makeup.

966
00:42:04,374 --> 00:42:07,576
Unfortunately,
that didn't happen.

967
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:11,247
That means, Daran and Cat,
you both are safe this week.

968
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:14,450
Please head back
to the makeup room.

969
00:42:19,723 --> 00:42:22,124
Matt, I really love
how you think,

970
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,593
and I'm hoping we get a chance
to see your creativity

971
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,729
- out there in the real world.
- Thank you.

972
00:42:26,763 --> 00:42:29,365
Matt, I am so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

973
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:31,100
It's really been great
having you here with us,

974
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,402
but if you would please
head back to the makeup room

975
00:42:33,436 --> 00:42:34,770
and pack up your kit.

976
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:36,105
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

977
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:38,107
Good luck, Matt.

978
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:39,909
This sucks,
because it was a makeup

979
00:42:39,943 --> 00:42:43,212
that I knew
I could've done better on.

980
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:44,446
Oh, man.

981
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,981
My mistake was not standing up

982
00:42:46,016 --> 00:42:48,918
for some of the things I thought
should've been in my makeup.

983
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:51,520
I came here to learn and grow,
and I did that,

984
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:55,124
and I'm gonna take this momentum
and make some crazy creatures

985
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,711
when I get out of here.
