1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,018
You did it so damn good.

2
00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:03,452
Well, that's impressive.

3
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:06,155
It's just gorgeous, guys.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,024
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,559
Tyler's creepy cryptid
brought him

6
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:10,927
his second victory,

7
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:14,897
and Matt was sent home.

8
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:16,532
Now nine artists remain.

9
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,902
And tonight they're faced
with a magical challenge...

10
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,939
- Oh.
- No way.

11
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:24,273
...that will cause
one of them

12
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:26,008
- to disappear.
- Let's go.

13
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:27,310
That's gonna look like
a man wearing a mask.

14
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:28,945
At this point, I'm going home.

15
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:30,913
- It's actually starting to burn.
- Oh, really?

16
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,649
I may be screwed on this one.

17
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,117
You did one hell of a job.

18
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:36,519
Fucking gorgeous, man.

19
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:39,622
She looks like a refugee
from a craft store.

20
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,191
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:43,392
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

22
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:46,863
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:49,732
a brand new 2014 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,634
and $100,000.

25
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:54,003
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

26
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,809
<i>Face Off!</i>

27
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:01,964
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

29
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:45,393
Matt's gone.

30
00:01:45,428 --> 00:01:46,828
There's another guy gone.

31
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:47,996
There's only three
of us left, though--

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,698
- only three girls.
- It's been what--

33
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:51,933
like, three challenges
since a girl went home?

34
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:53,301
- Four?
- Let's keep it that way.

35
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:55,103
I want there to be
a girl winner.

36
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:56,371
Girl power.

37
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:58,406
I think we've all done
some pretty cool stuff

38
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:00,375
and have good ideas
and are good at what we do.

39
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,778
So it's great to be here,
but I think at this point,

40
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:06,181
we're all competing
pretty hard.

41
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:07,215
- Yeah.
- I love them.

42
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,451
But I want to make it
to the end,

43
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:11,119
and I want to win.

44
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:12,621
Wouldn't it be cool
if all three of us

45
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:14,589
- made it to the finals?
- That'd be a first.

46
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:17,726
Let's make it happen.

47
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,664
Now, that's a castle.

48
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:23,999
We're in Hollywood.

49
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,401
We look up, and it's
the famous Magic Castle.

50
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:28,103
"Members and guests only."

51
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:30,005
Where everyone wants to visit,

52
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,673
but you can't get it in
'cause it's a club,

53
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:33,575
and you got to be a magician--
it's insane.

54
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,399
Hi, welcome to the world-famous
Hollywood Magic Castle.

55
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:39,669
This mysterious hostess
lady says to get in,

56
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:41,304
you have to say
the secret password.

57
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,773
Open sesame?

58
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:45,108
No way!

59
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:46,743
No!

60
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:50,046
There's so much cool stuff
all over the walls.

61
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:51,414
This is so cool.

62
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,684
And I'm just trying to take it all in.
This place is so cool.

63
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,787
We end up in front
of this stage,

64
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:59,790
and I have no idea
what's in store.

65
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:02,125
This is so cool.

66
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:05,162
Whoa.

67
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:06,263
Hey, guys.

68
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,631
Hey.

69
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,467
Welcome to
the world-famous Magic Castle.

70
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:13,804
For over 50 years, this
members-only club has hosted

71
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:16,173
some of the most spectacular
magicians in the world.

72
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:17,908
And it continues to be

73
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,544
one of the most exclusive
hangouts in Hollywood.

74
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,012
Nice.

75
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:23,613
Now, throughout history,
magic was seen

76
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:26,817
as a source of great power
to be worshiped and feared.

77
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:29,920
Legends like Merlin
and Shakespeare's Prospero

78
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,556
perpetuated the idea
of an all-powerful wizard

79
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,225
who could cast spells
and control the Earth.

80
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:39,963
While all wizards are armed
with wit, wisdom, and wonder,

81
00:03:39,997 --> 00:03:44,901
their abilities are lost
without one vital object...

82
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,304
their wand.

83
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:49,973
There's mechanical wands,
gold wands,

84
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:52,542
voodoo wands,
wands with ice on them.

85
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:53,944
There's so much to choose from.

86
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:57,414
Your spotlight challenge is
to choose one of these wands

87
00:03:57,448 --> 00:04:01,017
and use it to inspire
an original wizard of your own.

88
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:03,086
- Nice.
- That's cool.

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,654
Already, my heart's going,

90
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,824
'cause I love<i> Harry Potter,</i>
<i>Lord Of The Rings,</i>

91
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,826
and I know
that I can win this thing.

92
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,596
Tyler, you're up first.

93
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,397
Pchew!

94
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,771
All right, guys,
I'm going to leave you here

95
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:23,607
to work on your designs.

96
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,775
When you're done, head back
to the lab and get to work.

97
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,245
Bye.

98
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:35,051
I picked this tribal wand,

99
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:37,988
so I definitely want
to incorporate the feathers.

100
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:40,590
I figure more
of a witch doctor,

101
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,526
shaman, have him wear
some furs maybe.

102
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:49,065
I got this wand 'cause
I love organic characters.

103
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,735
So I thought immediately
of doing a natural wizard.

104
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:55,372
And he's made up of tree bark,
pieces of wood.

105
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:59,376
And he's a protector
of the deep forest.

106
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:03,980
I went with this wand.

107
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,249
It looks really futuristic
and really sci-fi.

108
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:07,684
My concept is there's
this wizard

109
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:09,586
that wanted to have
an assistant,

110
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,254
so he created this robot.

111
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:15,926
But the robot kills the wizard
and takes the power of the wand.

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,662
So let's see
if I can make it work.

113
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:21,932
I got a super-cool wand,

114
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:23,900
kind of like,
a light saber kind of thing.

115
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,703
All the aspects of the wand
are gonna be integrated

116
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:29,973
into the cowl, the back, arms,

117
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,310
and a lot of cool
mechanical patterns all over.

118
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:35,679
He's gonna be
a very mean wizard.

119
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:37,681
I chose this wand

120
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:39,950
because I thought it was
the most beautiful one up there.

121
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:41,117
And it's very feminine.

122
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,953
So I want to do a woman wizard.

123
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:44,154
And she's becoming one
with the forest

124
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:46,122
and has all these vines,
plants,

125
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:49,092
and all these flowers
growing from her skin.

126
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:51,761
And I really want to have
this beautiful silhouette

127
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:53,396
of these leaves.

128
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,298
So I'm excited.

129
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,101
- Let's head back to the lab.
- Let's make some magic.

130
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:09,946
Today's the first day
of our wizard challenge.

131
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,215
And we get to choose our model
and start sculpting.

132
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:17,654
I'm not too much a fan
of magic and wizard.

133
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:21,257
And I have this idea
of, like, robot.

134
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,227
But how can I make robot
like a wizard?

135
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,130
Maybe instead of the muscle
and cables inside,

136
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:30,333
I can put the back of him
in front so it looks clear.

137
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,508
_

138
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:33,009
_

139
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:34,484
_

140
00:06:35,732 --> 00:06:37,473
_

141
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:39,075
So I don't know if it's gonna
look good.

142
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,378
I just try to see
what I can do.

143
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:46,449
Let's go.
Let's go.

144
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:48,118
The wand itself has
this blue arc,

145
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:49,152
these twigs around it,

146
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:50,487
and barbed wire
tying it all together.

147
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,389
So I want to make my character

148
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:54,924
look like the wand,
all spiky and sharp.

149
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,860
So he has all these
little horns and things

150
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:59,262
pushing through his skin,
just like barbed wire.

151
00:06:59,296 --> 00:07:02,399
I'm going more minimal
than I usually do,

152
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:05,268
and we'll see how that works.

153
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,504
I picked a wand
that has a chicken's foot

154
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,839
at the end of it
holding an eyeball.

155
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:11,741
And I'm gonna make this
a warlock

156
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:14,110
that has no sight of her own.

157
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:15,945
So she's gonna be using
this wand and this eyeball

158
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,580
to see everything.

159
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:20,250
And then I want to do
these really gnarly teeth

160
00:07:20,284 --> 00:07:22,919
to give it a real scary look.

161
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:27,524
So I picked the crystal wand,
and I'm seeing

162
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,092
all this really
beautiful filigree

163
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:30,326
at the top of the wand,

164
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:32,461
and the crystal is
really predominant

165
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:36,365
so I decide to go
with the filigree

166
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,901
being a binding spell
that was cast

167
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:41,737
on this sorceress.

168
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:44,473
Man, I just signed myself up
for a whole shitload

169
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,643
of intricate detail.

170
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,752
Hey, guys.
Here for a walk-through.

171
00:07:56,786 --> 00:08:00,956
- Hello.
- So he's merging with the wand.

172
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,557
The metal is actually
integrating into him.

173
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:03,859
Mm-hmm.

174
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:05,193
I would say make sure
you get all these things

175
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:08,363
deep enough to really see
all the detail

176
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:09,765
and all these gears
and everything.

177
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,033
- All right.
- Interesting.

178
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,567
Now, what drew you to this one?

179
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,436
The creepiness.

180
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,571
It has these sort
of voodoo-type skulls,

181
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:20,275
so I'm thinking he's sort of
been keeping himself alive

182
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:21,843
by collecting skulls.

183
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:24,546
I'm really needing to
incorporate the skull design.

184
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,915
So he's gonna be
sort of emaciated,

185
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,851
old man, voodoo lord.

186
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:33,088
I'm giving him these sort of,
like, tooth piercings.

187
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:34,389
I like that, yeah.

188
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:36,224
- This is a great idea.
- That's a great idea.

189
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,060
- I've never seen it.
- Thank you.

190
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,161
What made you choose this one?

191
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:40,662
I like the colors in it,
number one.

192
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:42,964
And I'm a real fan
of organic things.

193
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:45,133
I'm gonna do a witch face

194
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,302
with some really gnarly teeth
coming out.

195
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:48,637
And I'm gonna make
a second piece

196
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,238
and just put it over
the whole face.

197
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:52,307
Are you gonna age
as much of the skin

198
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,775
- as you can?
- Yes.

199
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,243
If you're gonna do that aging,
you need to do it quick--

200
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:56,344
little old age
on the throat too.

201
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:58,814
- Right.
- What made you pick this one?

202
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:01,249
Because it looks,
like, very futuristic,

203
00:09:01,284 --> 00:09:04,019
and, like, I can work more
with a robot type.

204
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,821
- Mm-hmm.
- I sculpted this face piece.

205
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:08,056
Then, I want to sculpt
all the joints

206
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:09,291
on the robot on the inside.

207
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:11,393
And then I will put
the plastic on top of it.

208
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:14,262
This looks like
it could be Neanderthal

209
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:16,164
as opposed to more robotic.

210
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,267
Michael Westmore's opinion
means a lot to me.

211
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:21,036
And I'm already stressing out.

212
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,205
That's gonna look like
a man wearing a mask.

213
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:26,475
It's almost, like,
halfway the day.

214
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:28,944
And there's not enough time
to start all over again.

215
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,779
You're trying to get
a mechanical look on this too,

216
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:32,414
- aren't you?
- Yes.

217
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,383
It's gonna look like...
basically a human chest.

218
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:37,552
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it won't look good.

219
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:40,756
I don't know
what to do right now.

220
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:43,258
Coming up...

221
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,726
It looks like a mess.

222
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:48,330
I completely underestimated
how hard something like that is.

223
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:51,500
For the face,
it's not working out.

224
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:53,735
She just looks fantastic.

225
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,570
So much wrong about this.

226
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:04,698
This looks like
it could be Neanderthal.

227
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,768
It's day one
on our wizard challenge,

228
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:10,137
and Mr. Westmore
says that my shape looks

229
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,705
too round for being a robot.

230
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:13,707
Flatten out
some of your features.

231
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,308
By squaring these things off,

232
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:18,044
it would show off
your structure underneath.

233
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,814
Mr. Westmore tell me
some really good advice,

234
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,182
and hopefully
I can get everything done

235
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,450
by the end of the day.

236
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,318
This is a character
I always wanted to do--

237
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:26,753
something like a wizard
of the wood.

238
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,256
He's actually made up
of the forest and the trees.

239
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,325
Be careful, when you're
making your chest in here,

240
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,628
that it doesn't have
two human pecs.

241
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:37,164
It just brings the human
back out of it again.

242
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:40,100
I wanted to kind
of elongate the skull

243
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:43,069
to get more
of the Mayan type of a shape.

244
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:44,538
You've got it in your drawing,

245
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,440
but in here, literally,
start it back up here...

246
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:48,675
- Okay.
- ...so you have this

247
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:51,077
whole Indian type
of a look to it.

248
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,779
She's a pretty,
young sorceress,

249
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:55,849
but I wanted to make sure
she still looks different.

250
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:58,351
So I kind of built up her nose
with these fruits.

251
00:10:58,386 --> 00:10:59,786
If you want to keep her
beautiful,

252
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:00,821
I wouldn't do that.

253
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:02,589
It makes it look like

254
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,191
there's been some trauma
that's going on.

255
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:06,193
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

256
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,627
It's looking good.
Good luck.

257
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:10,063
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

258
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,602
I mean, I'm gonna paint them
to look like roots.

259
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:17,771
Mr. Westmore tells me

260
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:19,940
I should do less vines
around the nose area.

261
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:21,374
And it definitely makes me
nervous,

262
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,109
but I think
they're very important

263
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:26,744
to the character,
so I'm going to keep them.

264
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:29,413
I am zooming with my face,

265
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,149
and I think I actually
got it done in record time.

266
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:33,984
I get my mold done,

267
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,821
and I'm starting
to block out the chest,

268
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,858
the back, and getting
the bark placed,

269
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:44,128
ready to vacuum-form
first thing tomorrow morning.

270
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,135
My wand has all these wheels
that grind together.

271
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,836
So I want those lines
in the face,

272
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:56,273
and then I'll leave some kind
of human element to it,

273
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:57,975
so you can see
that it's a human,

274
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,877
that it's getting merged
into it.

275
00:11:59,911 --> 00:12:01,412
What time is it?

276
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:04,415
1:19.

277
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,518
So I decide to make this face

278
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:10,554
and then put a vacuform
in top of it.

279
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,893
But the face is too bulky,
so it's not working out.

280
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,928
And then time's up.

281
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:19,530
All right, guys, it's time.

282
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,399
- Worse and worse every time.
- Really?

283
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,802
I don't like it.
I don't know what I'm doing.

284
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,437
I'm just getting
really frustrated.

285
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,157
_

286
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:30,847
_

287
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,037
_

288
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:33,638
I don't have a cowl.

289
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:34,846
I still have to work
on the chest.

290
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,581
And I have to figure out
this face.

291
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:38,383
So I'm getting
a little bit worried

292
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,386
because there's a lot to do.

293
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:52,597
It's day two
of our wizard challenge.

294
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:53,999
We have ten hours today.

295
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:56,868
I need to sculpt the chest,

296
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,471
but I still am having
a hard time

297
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:03,108
even falling in love
with this concept.

298
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,910
I'm hoping that I can pull
this off

299
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:09,914
because I just really need
something to get onstage.

300
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:18,590
I need to finish the cowl

301
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:21,092
and make sure to place
some feathers in

302
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,193
so I have a placement line

303
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:24,262
for where I want to put
the feathers

304
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:26,164
once I have the foam piece.

305
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:28,533
With such
a minimalistic makeup,

306
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:31,603
I'm really gonna have to have
a flawless execution.

307
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:37,475
Yesterday I ran my face
in foam latex,

308
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,811
so my plan is to
finish sculpting

309
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:40,879
the chest and the cowl

310
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:43,581
and also run a second face

311
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,216
to see if I can get
a better version

312
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:46,217
to apply tomorrow.

313
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:47,318
I like it.

314
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:50,955
- It's, like, badass-looking.
- Yeah.

315
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,694
The face mold comes out perfect

316
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:57,595
and cleans out immediately.

317
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,665
Good for me
and my molding abilities.

318
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,835
I move on to the chest,
and I'm trying to throw

319
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:06,104
a little bit of strangeness
into the design

320
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,772
because it needs to be
something

321
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,507
that hasn't been seen before.

322
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:12,877
So I want some cool
rib anatomy going on.

323
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:16,047
Suck in your stomach
as much as you can.

324
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,615
Oh, that's perfect.

325
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,552
I take a picture
of Niko's chest

326
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:23,154
and get a cool idea
off of that.

327
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,229
I want to sculpt the chest

328
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:34,432
to look as if his rib cage
is growing through his chest

329
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,102
and his skin is healing
around it.

330
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:40,171
I'm still feeling nervous
'cause I'm going more minimal

331
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:42,707
than I normally do.

332
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,778
I decide I need to give him
some height

333
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,413
without making a huge cowl

334
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:49,781
that's gonna really
weigh him down.

335
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,517
So I'm creating bark by

336
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:56,087
vacuum-forming shapes of clay

337
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:59,124
and then attaching it to him
as if it's almost

338
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:02,193
like a crown on his head.

339
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,529
Nice.

340
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,898
Those will be cheated down
'cause I put it way back.

341
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:08,767
And I can cock it
any which direction I want.

342
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:10,435
I am so inspired
by this challenge.

343
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:11,603
Oh, my God.

344
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:13,104
I am seeing my vision
come to life,

345
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,441
and I think people
are just like...

346
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,043
So I'm sculpting
the chest piece,

347
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,547
and I'm realizing that
this is taking way more time

348
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:23,882
than I really have.

349
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:28,520
The chest piece is
the same filigree patterning

350
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,188
as the neck,

351
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,791
tons of swirls upon lines
upon swirls

352
00:15:32,825 --> 00:15:34,425
that all kind of flow
and connect together.

353
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,894
I feel like it looks
like a mess.

354
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,962
But I completely underestimated

355
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:40,331
how hard something like
that is.

356
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:43,101
There's so many fucking swirls.

357
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:47,338
I am running out of time.

358
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:50,675
I've already invested the past
two days into this piece.

359
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,710
But if I don't change
my design,

360
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,712
I'm gonna have big trouble.

361
00:16:01,216 --> 00:16:03,084
It's day two
of our wizard challenge,

362
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:05,286
and the chest piece is taking

363
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,655
way more time
than I really have.

364
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:08,956
That's a lot of swirls.

365
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:11,392
The chest is really important,
because without it,

366
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:13,561
my makeup
isn't gonna make any sense.

367
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:16,964
There's so many fucking swirls.

368
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:19,167
Look, that's what it
calls for. Look at that.

369
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:20,835
Even though
I want to do smaller,

370
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:23,004
more intricate filigree,

371
00:16:23,038 --> 00:16:24,372
I don't have that option.

372
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,574
I need to do it bigger so
that I have to do less of them.

373
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:29,811
I don't like it,
but I need to move on,

374
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:32,313
or I won't have a chest piece.

375
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:37,351
Okay, I incorporated
my little burgundy things

376
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:39,821
in my forehead piece.

377
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,022
As the day's going on,

378
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,157
I finished my sculpture
on my ornamental piece,

379
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:46,194
and I'm feeling extremely
excited about my wizard.

380
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:48,096
I've got my hands I've got
to knock out really quick.

381
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,299
So I'm doing hands, face,
and then a forehead piece.

382
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,402
Creepy hands done, sir.

383
00:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,537
Yesterday
I was having a problem

384
00:16:56,572 --> 00:16:58,372
vacuforming the face.

385
00:16:58,407 --> 00:16:59,941
My old concept wasn't working,

386
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:01,642
so I decided to go
for a new one.

387
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,878
So, instead of covering
the whole face with a vacuform,

388
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:06,747
I'm just gonna have his face
uncovered like a helmet.

389
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:08,049
So I'm feeling better,

390
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,750
and hopefully
I can get it all done.

391
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:10,818
It's cool.
I like the design.

392
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:11,819
It looks great.

393
00:17:11,854 --> 00:17:14,622
So, after all my molds
are done,

394
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:16,891
I start fabricating
this huge flower

395
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:19,127
that's going to be growing
out of my wizard's back.

396
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,763
So I make a stencil out
of the vacuform with plastic.

397
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:24,665
And I take a heat gun,
and I start shaping it

398
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,069
to look like these huge petals.

399
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,070
Oh, nice.

400
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:31,405
I'm really excited about this.

401
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:37,979
Let's see what Tyler
is doing over here.

402
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,814
It looks pretty cool.

403
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:41,215
By the end of the day two,

404
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,751
I have the face
completely pre-painted.

405
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:45,486
The cowl is complete.

406
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:47,155
I'm starting to see
a wizard here.

407
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:48,422
And I'm like, "All right,

408
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,124
I just whipped this magic up
out of nowhere.

409
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:51,225
Here we go."

410
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,528
This is, like,
your dream challenge, huh?

411
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:55,463
Yeah.

412
00:17:57,466 --> 00:18:00,768
That's time, guys.

413
00:18:00,802 --> 00:18:02,570
Application day needs to come

414
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:05,773
because I'm ready to go here.

415
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:17,218
So it's application day.

416
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:20,888
We have four hours in the lab
and one hour in last looks.

417
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,523
Now I'm trimming
the flashing off

418
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,624
the chest and the back piece,

419
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:25,459
which had little rips here
and there.

420
00:18:25,494 --> 00:18:29,063
But I'm gonna have moss
come out.

421
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,099
All right.

422
00:18:32,134 --> 00:18:33,401
- Good to see you.
- George, bro.

423
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:34,468
This is gonna be you today.

424
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,803
- Ah, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:38,172
First, I need to get
the cowl fitted.

426
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,107
Since I'm only doing
three prosthetics,

427
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:42,109
it could seem like
I'm going too simple,

428
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:44,345
so I really have to focus
on the details,

429
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:46,113
make sure that everything's
applied well

430
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,715
and fully painted.

431
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,720
I start applying the face,

432
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:54,789
and when it's almost
all glued down...

433
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:59,264
- It's actually starting to burn.
- Oh, really?

434
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:00,265
_

435
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,229
- Sorry.
- No, no, no. That's fine.

436
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:02,296
It starts to burn him.

437
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:04,432
He's allergic to Telesis.

438
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:08,469
Telesis is used to glue
the prosthetic to the model.

439
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:09,737
I start taking it off.

440
00:19:09,771 --> 00:19:11,572
Okay, let's clean you up
so it doesn't burn you.

441
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:14,308
Thank goodness I made
an extra face.

442
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:15,476
- You made two?
- Yeah.

443
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,111
Just in case.
You never know.

444
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,914
I applied Pros-Aide
which is another type of glue.

445
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:20,915
It's perfect.
It works.

446
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:23,117
But now I'm way behind,

447
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:25,152
so I got to speed this up.

448
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,994
I start applying
the chest piece first.

449
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:36,030
And then I lay
the neck piece over that.

450
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:40,735
But now I'm starting to panic
because I still don't like it.

451
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,270
I got to pull
this thing together,

452
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:43,804
whether it's
with the beauty makeup

453
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,606
or a killer paint job.

454
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:47,508
But I don't even believe
in this piece.

455
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:52,213
And I don't know how the judges
are gonna believe in it either.

456
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,851
One of the extra things
I'd like to add

457
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:57,985
on to this character is

458
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,021
to take the hash marks
that are gored

459
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,856
into his chest and bring

460
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,924
that design out
all over the place.

461
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,826
I'm really excited about it,

462
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:07,862
and I can't wait to hear
what the judges think.

463
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:09,430
There, makeup done.

464
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,535
I start working
with my two arms.

465
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:17,505
I'm using L200
and different metal pieces.

466
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:20,675
So it look like he's getting
really infused with metal parts.

467
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:23,144
A lot of people are already
painting and airbrushing,

468
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,979
and I still have
to fabricate a lot.

469
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,447
And I just started painting.

470
00:20:26,481 --> 00:20:28,449
I don't even know at this point
if I'm gonna have time

471
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:30,685
to do it all.

472
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,521
I'm extremely nervous

473
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:34,989
'cause I only have
an hour to paint.

474
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:38,326
And I have to get not only
a flawless paint job

475
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,195
between his skin, silicone,
and foam,

476
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:43,497
but I need a tribal paint
on top of that.

477
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,805
Because my wand has
a crystal ball

478
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,907
in the middle,
I'm incorporating globes

479
00:20:52,941 --> 00:20:54,675
coming out of her chest.

480
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,877
After that, I start painting
like a madwoman.

481
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,247
I decide to paint her orange

482
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:01,749
to make her
less human-looking.

483
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:04,452
It's the same color scheme
as the actual petals,

484
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:06,654
so she looks
like she's part of the flower.

485
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,091
30 minutes, people.

486
00:21:17,632 --> 00:21:18,766
Everything's glued down,

487
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,402
so now I have apply
these tube connectors

488
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:22,737
that are fusing into his skin,

489
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:25,339
then finish this paint job,
and put on the hands.

490
00:21:25,374 --> 00:21:27,641
That's time, everybody.

491
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:30,678
Time's up, and I still have
to do so much.

492
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:32,380
I'm sweating bullets here.

493
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:35,716
I only have one hour
in last looks to finish this.

494
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,386
Whew.

495
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,056
I may be screwed on this one.

496
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,191
Coming up...

497
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,960
Everything I'm trying
to glue down

498
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:47,428
is not sticking.

499
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:49,096
I'm just getting
really frustrated.

500
00:21:49,131 --> 00:21:50,765
This resonated through you.

501
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,867
- It's gorgeous.
- It's so well done.

502
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,636
I am really disappointed
in this makeup.

503
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:05,911
Hold on.

504
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:07,479
We get to last looks,

505
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,648
and I know I'm really gonna
have to scramble,

506
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:12,050
'cause I have to have
a great paint job

507
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:16,155
to make this
a great-looking wizard.

508
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:17,956
I know I have to finish
this paint.

509
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:20,993
I start going in
with highlights, shadows.

510
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,896
I have to blend the seams
around the chest and stomach.

511
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,298
And that's a lot of work
to do in an hour.

512
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:28,534
I'm starting
on the beauty makeup.

513
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:29,835
My hands are shaking because

514
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:31,470
of the stress and exhaustion

515
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:34,106
from trying to get this
makeup done.

516
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:38,577
30 minutes, guys.

517
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,012
I'm getting really frustrated.

518
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:42,881
Everything I'm trying
to glue down is not sticking.

519
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,317
I know it's not my best work.

520
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:49,655
At this point, I'm like,
"I'm going home."

521
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:51,456
I get the beard on.
It looks great.

522
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:53,358
And I'm adding
the moss everywhere.

523
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:56,495
There's so much involved
in the makeup,

524
00:22:56,529 --> 00:22:58,564
but everything is coming
together.

525
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:06,939
Hey, everybody, that's time.
That's it.

526
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:22,454
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

527
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,389
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

528
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:27,693
But first, let's say hello
to our talented judges--

529
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:30,295
owner of Optic Nerve
Make-Up Effects Studio,

530
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,797
- Glenn Hetrick...
- Good evening, guys.

531
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:33,131
- Good evening, Glenn.
- Hi, Glenn.

532
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,701
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

533
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:37,369
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Ve.

534
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:39,905
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

535
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:41,707
- Hello.
- Hi, Neville.

536
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:44,276
So this week
your spotlight challenge

537
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,879
was to select a wand
and use it to inspire

538
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:49,948
an original wizard character
of your very own.

539
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,817
So let's take a look
at your magical creations

540
00:23:51,851 --> 00:23:53,018
while the audience
at home tweets

541
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:56,021
about their favorites,
using #FaceOff.

542
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,880
My wizard turned out
exactly how I wanted it.

543
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,782
She's got vines
growing out of her.

544
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:25,417
She's got flowers
growing from her.

545
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:28,453
She looks like
she's one with nature.

546
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:49,207
I wish I would've done
something different

547
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:50,943
with the beauty makeup,

548
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:53,879
but it's out of my hands
at this point.

549
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,665
I think
he has the perfect look.

550
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,334
I like the silhouette,

551
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:17,836
and I'm really pleased
with how it turned out.

552
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,392
He looks like a freakin' tree.

553
00:25:40,426 --> 00:25:42,194
He's standing there,
and I'm like,

554
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:46,198
"I did it.
This is great."

555
00:26:05,018 --> 00:26:07,652
He looks cool.
I really like it a lot.

556
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:10,288
And I think I created
something unique here.

557
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:33,745
I'm very pleased with her.
She's looking very cool.

558
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,247
She goes well with the wand.

559
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:38,683
And I think
it's the complete package.

560
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,971
The first thing I see is
a seam on his chest piece.

561
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:01,873
I'm not happy,
and I know that the judges

562
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:05,077
are gonna notice it too.

563
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,565
This definitely looks like
I had imagined it

564
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:29,067
to look like, with some
of the voodoo elements.

565
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:30,535
So I love it.

566
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:53,024
I just don't feel good
about this.

567
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,727
It's one of the worst,
and I think I'm going home.

568
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:59,564
And I feel, like,
really frustrated.

569
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:05,604
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look at our wizards?

570
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:12,644
I don't get it.

571
00:28:12,678 --> 00:28:15,981
There's so many better ways
to approach this appliance.

572
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:18,416
Yeah, there's such
a lost opportunity.

573
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,152
And it's so orange.

574
00:28:20,186 --> 00:28:22,420
Thank you.

575
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:26,491
It would've been nice
to have seen this detail

576
00:28:26,526 --> 00:28:28,960
up here
on the forehead as well.

577
00:28:28,995 --> 00:28:30,762
It just looks sloppy.
That's the problem.

578
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,197
Yeah.

579
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:37,102
Mm-hmm.

580
00:28:37,136 --> 00:28:39,171
- I like the broken teeth.
- Yeah.

581
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:42,174
Using the war paint as a way
to hide these edges

582
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,175
is really smart.

583
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,709
Thank you.

584
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,514
Wow.
This guy's covered.

585
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:52,984
I love the unburnt transition

586
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:55,487
all the way to the charred
at the top.

587
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,725
This is so cool.

588
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,627
These ridges--
I don't understand them,

589
00:29:02,662 --> 00:29:05,764
and I don't need to,
'cause it feels right.

590
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:07,132
Thanks.

591
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:10,969
I love the mask.

592
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,604
It feels so natural,

593
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:14,206
and it has
a feel of the forest.

594
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,208
Very cool.

595
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:19,678
These are particularly
rough edges all through here.

596
00:29:19,712 --> 00:29:21,980
Can you turn to the side?

597
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,715
The seams are really bad.
Look at this.

598
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:26,418
Everything you don't want them
to notice, they notice.

599
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:29,120
For the first time,
I'm not feeling confident.

600
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:33,792
And from watching the judges,
I know I'm in trouble.

601
00:29:33,826 --> 00:29:37,028
Who made your favorite
wand-wielding wizard tonight?

602
00:29:37,063 --> 00:29:39,998
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

603
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,550
These are particularly
rough edges all through here.

604
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,318
Well, he did his best to use
the paint job

605
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:49,788
to cover them, though--
I'll tell you that much.

606
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,556
The judges go in
for a closer look,

607
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,293
and I have to hope that they
look at the overall design.

608
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,463
And I'm hoping
that'll be enough to save me.

609
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,200
What's he got going on here?

610
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,702
That's a fun treatment
I've never seen before.

611
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:05,770
- I love the teeth.
- I do.

612
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,439
I like all of this in here.

613
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,074
He has finger extensions,
though, too.

614
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,810
- Thank you.
- Very cool.

615
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,647
- It's a wreck.
- Yeah.

616
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,215
It doesn't have
the smoothness of metal.

617
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,951
- I can see streaks.
- Unbearable to look at.

618
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:26,891
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

619
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,160
so let's find out
what they thought.

620
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,795
Rashaad...

621
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,897
Graham..

622
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:35,767
Daran...

623
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,869
Congratulations--
you are all safe

624
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,504
and can head back
to the makeup room.

625
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,140
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

626
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:48,746
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

627
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,782
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

628
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,116
to learn more about your work.

629
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:55,587
Corinne, please step forward.

630
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,393
Explain to me how your wand

631
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,362
influenced your concept
this week.

632
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:08,566
When I saw the wand,
it felt very tribal to me.

633
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:12,537
So I decided that
it was gonna be a dark shaman.

634
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:16,641
You did one hell of a job
executing the makeup.

635
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,077
You can do a minimal makeup

636
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,913
if you execute it
in a super-clean,

637
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:23,248
professional manner.

638
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:25,016
That's exactly
what you've done this week.

639
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,417
Thank you.

640
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:27,952
You have a stupendous paint job

641
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:29,654
all over his entire body.

642
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,189
Great coloring.

643
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,857
It looks like a mud treatment.

644
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,225
He looks fantastic.

645
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,561
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

646
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:37,595
The paint job, the sculpt,

647
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,797
particularly the Peruvian skull

648
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:42,700
is really a very smart,
unique element--

649
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,769
- so well handled.
- Thank you.

650
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:48,039
Corinne, please step back.

651
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,009
Yeah, Corinne.

652
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,611
Chloe, you're up.

653
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,985
Tell us about your wand
and your character.

654
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,588
What I really liked
was the filigree

655
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:06,858
at the top of the wand,
which is all of this.

656
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,827
Overall, I don't mind
the whole concept.

657
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:13,298
I just think you went
a little heavy-handed.

658
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,800
It would've been nice,
instead of painting up here,

659
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,436
to have seen that
filigree carried around her face

660
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,805
so that it tied
the whole look together.

661
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,574
For me, really, the problem is

662
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,375
you bit off
a little bit more than time

663
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,210
would allow you to chew.

664
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:29,047
Trying to get all of that
filigree under that giant space

665
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:32,984
results in what is a meandering,
confused pattern.

666
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,819
Chloe, you can step back.

667
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,694
George, you're up.

668
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,631
Hey, buddy.

669
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,567
So tell us what it
was about your magic wand

670
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:50,868
- that inspired this.
- Okay.

671
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:53,137
I tried to integrate it
into my design,

672
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,639
like he's being possessed by it

673
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,308
and converted
into this metallic being.

674
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:00,712
There's so much about this
I really do like.

675
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,514
This showcases
sophisticated design,

676
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,450
form language, concept.

677
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,752
It is fucking gorgeous, man.

678
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,920
Thanks, man.

679
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,355
It really just is.

680
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:12,190
Thank you, brother.
Thank you.

681
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:16,094
It feels like this concept
just resonated through you

682
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:19,530
into every aspect
of what you designed.

683
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,099
- It's gorgeous.
- Thanks, man.

684
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,968
I especially love
your paint job.

685
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:27,171
The transition
from that metalized skin

686
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:31,542
onto that flesh tone
is so absolutely stunning.

687
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,277
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

688
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,913
- George, thank you very much.
- Thanks, man.

689
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:37,682
- Thank you.
- Nice job, George.

690
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,417
Thank you.

691
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,853
Cat, please step up.

692
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,994
Cat, tell us about how your
wand worked into the concept.

693
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,263
Her name is Flora
Of The Forest,

694
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:56,434
and she protects the plant life,
and she heals people as well.

695
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,736
I'll tell you,
I absolutely love the wings.

696
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:02,306
Unfortunately, that is all
that I love about this makeup.

697
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,577
The style of the sculpture
detracts from the beauty

698
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,880
of the model
instead of augmenting it.

699
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:12,116
I am really disappointed
in this makeup.

700
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:14,986
She looks like a refugee
from a craft store.

701
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,455
The vine work on her face

702
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,391
feels more like a disease.

703
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:22,660
It's not working for me.

704
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:25,897
Cat, please step back.

705
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:34,505
Tyler, please step forward.

706
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,011
Tell us about the wand
that you got

707
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,246
and how it influenced
your makeup.

708
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:44,382
He is a wizard of the woods

709
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,350
and protects
the forest from fire.

710
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:49,487
I think you did a great job.

711
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,322
Everything blends together.

712
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,825
I mean,
it's all really well designed.

713
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,761
You clearly have spent time
in the woods,

714
00:34:56,795 --> 00:35:00,698
looking and absorbing
what bark and branches do,

715
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:02,567
because it feels authentic.

716
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,837
- And that's hard to do quickly.
- Thank you.

717
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,438
It's tremendously successful.

718
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:10,374
The nose and chin are
very unorthodox,

719
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:11,542
and they really work.

720
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:12,643
Thank you very much.

721
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,045
Tyler, please step back.

722
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,452
Niko, please step forward.

723
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,794
Tell us about the magic wand

724
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,062
and how that inspired
your concept.

725
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,231
He has evil powers.

726
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,767
He controls
all metals and electronics.

727
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,802
And every time he use it,
he gets infused

728
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,570
with metal parts.

729
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:43,808
There's so much wrong
about this.

730
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:47,779
Be so careful about how far
you stretch your skill set

731
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,680
to the point where it snaps.

732
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,884
And I think for you,
it completely snapped.

733
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:54,152
When you're doing
hard surfaces,

734
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,621
you either need to make them
super, super smooth

735
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,823
so that when you paint them,
they actually look like metal,

736
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:02,260
or you have to apply
some sort of texture

737
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,228
that would be appropriate
for a metallic surface.

738
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,763
You have neither.

739
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:08,733
I think your problem
was your lack of knowledge

740
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,335
of the subject matter
that we were asking you to do.

741
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,804
I mean, yeah,
I have seen movies,

742
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,907
and I know,
but it's not, like, my type.

743
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,176
And I think that's
to your detriment this week,

744
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,379
and that's why this happened.

745
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,381
Niko, you can step back.

746
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,519
All right, guys,

747
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:30,054
the judges have heard
what you have to say.

748
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,656
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

749
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,525
while they deliberate.

750
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:41,098
All right, so, judges,
let's talk about the looks

751
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,533
you liked the most this week.

752
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:43,901
Why don't we start
with Corinne?

753
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:46,504
Simple, clean, so well done.

754
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,906
Yeah, very well executed,
great paint job,

755
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,309
- really clean application.
- It's killer--

756
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:53,744
perfectly asymmetrical,
very natural-looking.

757
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,379
All right,
let's move on to George.

758
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:59,595
I loved the way the flesh
tones came off of that metal.

759
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,597
And that beautiful paint job
that he did--

760
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,699
I mean, what a great choice
of colors.

761
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:05,635
There's one singular moment,

762
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:07,637
which is that fleshy bit
of skin.

763
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:11,240
That, as a makeup on its own--
so well handled.

764
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:13,409
The true magic
in George's work this week

765
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:16,012
is his ability to have conceived
and executed something

766
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:17,913
that brilliant
in the time that he had.

767
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:19,382
All right,
let's move on to Tyler.

768
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,784
I loved the transition
between the moss,

769
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:25,454
from the warmer wood up to
the deadening up by his head.

770
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,256
We all know what
a tree should look like,

771
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,858
but not everyone
can sculpt one.

772
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:31,093
That was impressive.
That was a lot of work.

773
00:37:31,128 --> 00:37:32,628
All right, judges,
let's move on to the looks

774
00:37:32,663 --> 00:37:33,996
we liked the least.

775
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:35,364
Let's start with Chloe.

776
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:37,333
She just bit off
more than she could chew.

777
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:39,468
That filigree
was the kiss of death.

778
00:37:39,503 --> 00:37:41,971
She grabbed the wrong element
of the wand

779
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:44,206
to inspire her design.

780
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:45,574
It wasn't very cohesive.

781
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:48,010
It wasn't a really beautifully
blended makeup.

782
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:49,245
Let's move on to Cat.

783
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:51,314
I mean, it looks like
a bomb went off

784
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:53,616
at a craft store,
and that poor creature

785
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,950
got in the way.

786
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:57,820
All those hokey flowers
and painted bright orange.

787
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,156
It did feel like
she was being stifled

788
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,025
by the vines
instead of experiencing

789
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,127
- some sort of unity with them.
- Yeah.

790
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:06,662
Okay, let's move on to Niko.

791
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:08,631
What we saw was not good.

792
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:12,068
The paint job on Niko's
hard surfaces was awful.

793
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:14,637
It wasn't just the sculpture.
It was sloppily applied.

794
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,839
I could still see
brush streaks in it.

795
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,342
Okay, judges,
have you made your decisions?

796
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:21,510
- We have.
- Let's bring them back out.

797
00:38:30,987 --> 00:38:33,856
So, Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

798
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:37,226
Corinne, this was
a really beautiful makeup,

799
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,195
and we felt that it was
a perfect interpretation

800
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:40,930
of your wand.

801
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:44,066
George, you displayed
some spectacular

802
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:46,669
sculpting techniques
and meticulous paint job

803
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:49,872
which when combined, resulted
in a stunning wizard.

804
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:53,709
Tyler, you managed to create
a very graceful flow

805
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:56,078
from one part
of your character to another.

806
00:38:56,113 --> 00:38:59,215
It resulted
in a very potent character.

807
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,150
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

808
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:05,087
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

809
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,811
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge?

810
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:15,513
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

811
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:22,087
George.

812
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,088
Thank you.

813
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,090
Oh, man, finally.

814
00:39:25,124 --> 00:39:27,859
Your character transcends
the challenge,

815
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:29,661
and it had us in awe.

816
00:39:29,695 --> 00:39:31,963
- Very, very fine work.
- Thank you, guys.

817
00:39:31,998 --> 00:39:34,332
Finally, I got one.

818
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:36,835
I've always been
in top looks and never winning.

819
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:39,704
It was like, "Man, come on,
when is it gonna happen?"

820
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:42,474
- So I'm very grateful.
- George, congratulations.

821
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,709
You, Tyler, and Corinne

822
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:47,779
can head back
to the makeup room.

823
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:55,787
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

824
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,255
are on the bottom this week,

825
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:59,024
and one of you
will be eliminated.

826
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:02,060
Would you please step forward?

827
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:11,369
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

828
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:14,506
Chloe, your struggle
to find inspiration

829
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,909
in your wand was quite evident
in your final makeup.

830
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:22,280
Cat, we had major issues
with your conceptual choices.

831
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:25,884
She looked more forced priestess
than she did wizard.

832
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:29,320
Niko, your metallic design

833
00:40:29,355 --> 00:40:31,823
called
for sculptural perfection,

834
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:34,359
and clearly, you did not get
there this week.

835
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,127
So who is going home tonight?

836
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:39,531
The person going home
tonight is...

837
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:44,135
Cat.

838
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,305
It was a very tough choice
for us tonight,

839
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:51,009
but we had a disconnect
with the arts-and-craft nature

840
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:52,343
of your character.

841
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:55,480
That means, Chloe and Niko,
you are safe this week

842
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:58,383
and can head
back to the makeup room.

843
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,693
Hey, Cat, we have no doubt

844
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:10,695
that you're gonna make
a fantastic makeup artist.

845
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,797
Focus on your designs
a little bit more.

846
00:41:12,832 --> 00:41:14,132
Okay.

847
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,534
Cat, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

848
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:18,703
It's been great having you
here with us.

849
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:20,972
And if you would please
head back to the makeup room

850
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:22,741
- and pack up your kit.
- Thank you.

851
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:24,309
- Thank you, Cat.
- Good luck, Cat.

852
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:26,010
I'm really sad to be leaving,

853
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:30,915
but I'm happy it's me
and not Niko.

854
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,717
It's Cat.

855
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:34,152
Aw.

856
00:41:34,186 --> 00:41:35,587
It's okay.

857
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,322
Just kick ass.
There's a reason you're here.

858
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:39,290
- I love you.
- I want you to stay.

859
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:40,992
I want you to do really,
really well, okay?

860
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:42,093
I will.

861
00:41:42,128 --> 00:41:45,063
This experience
has made me more excited

862
00:41:45,097 --> 00:41:49,167
to get back out there
and keep doing what I love.

863
00:41:49,201 --> 00:41:51,179
I'm just proud I made it
this far.

865
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:59,444
Cat just left.
We all feel sad and tired.

866
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:00,612
I just want to go home
and rest.

867
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:02,747
Hey, guys.

868
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:04,783
Oh, shit.

869
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,417
I really don't want to see
you right now.

870
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:08,286
You don't want to see me?
Why?

871
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,988
Here we go--
This is another challenge,

872
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:12,157
or there's gonna be
another person eliminated.

873
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:14,425
That's just too much for me
to handle today.

874
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,261
I do have something
really important to tell you.

875
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:17,962
Do you remember
in the beginning of the season

876
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:19,397
I said that it would be bold

877
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:20,799
and extreme
and full of surprises?

878
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:22,233
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

879
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:23,768
I'm taking you all to Japan.

880
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:25,503
- It's not a joke?
- It's not a joke.

881
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:26,971
- No, I'm serious.
- We're going to Japan?

882
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:28,339
What?

883
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,476
What?
Are you kidding me?

884
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,477
Japan?

885
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:33,845
You guys better get some sleep

886
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:35,213
because it is a long flight
from here to Tokyo.

887
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:37,482
And we are leaving first thing
in the morning.

888
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,083
I will see you guys there.

889
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:41,152
Japan?

890
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:42,620
It's the other side
of the world.

891
00:42:42,655 --> 00:42:46,691
It don't get any more bold
and extreme than that.

892
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:48,593
Now do you hate that I came in?

893
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:49,727
I'm sorry!

894
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:50,995
It's okay.
I still love you.

895
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,030
<i>Konichiwa!</i>

896
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:57,402
- Let's go!
- Hey, let's go to Japan.

897
00:42:57,436 --> 00:42:59,137
Let's go!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
