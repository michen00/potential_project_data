1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:02,539
It looks beautiful, it's fantastic.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,440
I think this guy's terrific.

3
00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:07,182
You simply missed.

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:10,040
Previously on Face Off...

5
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:11,975
Rashaad's plant-inspired vampire

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:13,643
earned him his second win.

7
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,345
But instead of elimination...

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,714
This is actually a two-part challenge.

9
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:21,385
And the second half starts right now.

10
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:23,153
Oh, my gosh. Second chance.

11
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,488
And tonight...

12
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:26,523
You guys already created the vampire.

13
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:27,791
For the second part of your challenge,

14
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,926
you will have to create its greatest enemy.

15
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:31,561
- Yes.
- Whoa.

16
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:32,696
This is great.

17
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,930
But with the impending finale,

18
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:37,534
any setback could mean the end.

19
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:39,102
I really want to win tonight.

20
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,837
At least, I want to be in the last three.

21
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,306
But my wrist is giving me intense pain.

22
00:00:44,342 --> 00:00:45,992
It just slows me down.

23
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:48,361
Who's gonna see that from 20 feet away?

24
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:52,949
This is a beautiful paint job.

25
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:54,684
You did something I haven't seen before.

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,821
The overall look is an issue for me.

27
00:00:57,855 --> 00:00:59,122
In the end, only one will

28
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,758
win a VIP trip from
Kryolan professional make-up

29
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:04,795
to one of their 85 international locations,

30
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,833
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500, and $100,000.

31
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,903
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic?

32
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,041
Face off!

33
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,444
Welcome to Face Off.

34
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:03,715
So this is, like, the
craziest elimination, uh, ever,

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,600
'cause no one's going home.

36
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,003
And all of a sudden, we're
just driving somewhere.

37
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:09,771
And it's like, bring it on.

38
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:18,013
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

39
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,214
Look at this place.

40
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:22,083
It's dark, scary. We're tired.

41
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:25,287
And it's like, where are we?

42
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,922
Hey, guys.

43
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:27,989
Hey.

44
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:30,042
Welcome to the court of miracles

45
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:31,927
on the Universal Studios backlot.

46
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:34,596
This historic set has inspired filmmakers

47
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,398
since the early 1900s.

48
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:37,966
And you might actually recognize it

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,636
from House of Dracula,
The Mummy, Frankenstein,

50
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,638
and The Wolf Man.

51
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,974
This is where, like, the villagers run out,

52
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:47,526
and you feel like you're in the movie.

53
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,344
You feel like you're
standing in a part of history.

54
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:50,545
And it... it's so cool.

55
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,914
Now I mentioned a special guest.

56
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,650
He's here to tell you
about your last challenge

57
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:57,085
before the finale.

58
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,187
Please welcome back production designer

59
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,656
and director Patrick Tatopoulos.

60
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:04,526
- There he is.
- Hello.

61
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:05,727
Hello.

62
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:06,862
Well, I know these guys are dying

63
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,630
to know more about their next challenge.

64
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:09,831
So why don't you fill 'em in?

65
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,233
Well, you guys have already created

66
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:13,101
one of the most popular movie villains,

67
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:14,636
the vampire.

68
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,804
For the second part of your challenge,

69
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:19,141
you will have to create its greatest enemy,

70
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,142
the werewolf.

71
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:21,843
Yeah!

72
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:23,211
Since I was an eight-year-old,

73
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,513
I've been obsessed with werewolves.

74
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:25,680
It's, like, crazy.

75
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,115
I watched the Wolf Man with my father,

76
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,283
like, I don't know how many times.

77
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:29,785
So this is great.

78
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,219
That's right, your spotlight challenge

79
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:33,855
is to create a werewolf nemesis

80
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,658
that comes from the same
world as your vampires.

81
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:37,893
Wow.

82
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,060
Patrick, we're very excited to have you

83
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:41,730
joining us this week on the reveal stage.

84
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,064
What are you gonna be looking for

85
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,516
in their final creations?

86
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,568
I'm looking for a very uncommon design.

87
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,870
Do not forget that this werewolf

88
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:51,039
will have to belong to the same world

89
00:03:51,057 --> 00:03:52,040
your vampire comes from.

90
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,692
That's very, very important.

91
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:56,761
Now there is just one more thing.

92
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,647
Your werewolves must incorporate

93
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,483
a newly evolved feature
specifically designed

94
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:04,152
to take their vampire rivals down.

95
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:06,188
Now remember, this is your last

96
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:09,191
spotlight challenge before the finale.

97
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:12,160
Only three of you will make it through.

98
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:13,829
The judges will be considering both

99
00:04:13,863 --> 00:04:16,031
your vampires and your werewolves

100
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:19,000
when choosing this season's final three.

101
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:20,018
Well, we're gonna leave you here

102
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,020
to get started on your sketches.

103
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,472
Good luck.

104
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:24,639
- Thank you.
- Good luck, guys.

105
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:27,642
- Good night.
- Thank you.

106
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,911
♪ Do it, do it, do it, do it ♪

107
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:33,482
My vampire was Yara-ma-yha-who

108
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:33,482
from Australia.

109
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:36,017
My concept is, my vampires evolve

110
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,619
into werewolves over time.

111
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,789
And that kind of blend
is gonna be kind of cool.

112
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,624
My special weapon is gonna be

113
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,092
bone protrusions that come out

114
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:46,361
of their index finger, like a blade.

115
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:48,997
And it can jump at him and stab him.

116
00:04:51,868 --> 00:04:54,035
My vampire has this big tongue that has,

117
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,770
like, acid and poison.

118
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:58,273
So I'm thinking... the
concept for my werewolf is,

119
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:00,809
he has all these spikes that protects him

120
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,945
from the acid tongue of the vampire.

121
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,715
And the spikes turn into stakes

122
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,150
he can attack the vampire with.

123
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,585
Yesterday was kind of like,

124
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,153
uh-oh, wake-up call, you know?

125
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:14,239
I focused too much on covering the vampire

126
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,790
and forgot about the simplest things,

127
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,692
like proportions and things like that.

128
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:19,261
Now it's almost like a second chance.

129
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:21,263
Now I know what I need to work on.

130
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:24,099
So my werewolf's ability is this extension

131
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:27,135
of his bone that comes out, like a spike.

132
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,837
I really want to push myself,

133
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,471
do as much work as I can

134
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:33,375
to prove that I deserve
to be in the finale.

135
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:39,381
I gave my vampire an Asian theme,

136
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:41,082
and I know I want to do
that again with the werewolf.

137
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:43,418
So I'm giving him a paisley brow

138
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:45,921
with an armored nose and tufts of fur

139
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:47,489
almost like their dragons have.

140
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:49,223
My vampire has plants

141
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,492
that have taken over his body,

142
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,894
and one way to kill them is with fire.

143
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,130
So I want to incorporate
that into my werewolf.

144
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,433
All right, guys, let's go home.

145
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,936
After doing a full day of make up

146
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,138
and finding out what our next challenge is,

147
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:06,074
we definitely need to
recharge for tomorrow.

148
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,525
All right.

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,579
I'm gonna redeem myself this time.

150
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:20,155
- Werewolves.
- This is it, guys.

151
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:23,191
It's very surreal to know
that we started with 15.

152
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,893
Now it's only four.

153
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,962
- Congratulations to you...
- Thank you.

154
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:27,963
- Yeah, man.
- That win.

155
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:28,947
It took me a while.

156
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:30,165
It took a couple challenges,

157
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,500
but now I'm starting
to get my point across.

158
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:33,952
Just hoping to make it to the finale.

159
00:06:33,986 --> 00:06:36,738
Yeah, I think we want to go big on concept,

160
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,807
but not on making something super big,

161
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,976
because you can make the same with less.

162
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,377
And I have learned that.

163
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,545
I'm really excited that I have

164
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,447
one more chance to prove myself.

165
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,649
This has never happened
in the history of Face Off.

166
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:48,833
This time, I really want to focus

167
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,236
on the simplest things, getting those down

168
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,320
before I even start the make up.

169
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,789
Last challenge, I really didn't focus

170
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,391
on getting my ideas together,

171
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:58,226
and the judges didn't like it.

172
00:06:58,244 --> 00:06:59,861
I'm gonna have to step it up.

173
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:01,396
All right, guys, let's
go make some werewolves.

174
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,965
- Let's do it.
- Of course, yes.

175
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:10,104
So we finally get to the lab.

176
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:11,339
We were super excited.

177
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:14,876
And we've got six hours today.

178
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,695
The first thing I got to
do is get that face done

179
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:19,180
and get it out for foam.

180
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:21,232
I don't want to do classic werewolf.

181
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:23,118
We have to do something original.

182
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,253
And I don't want to do a total big snout.

183
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:26,488
I want something in the middle.

184
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:27,922
It's not gonna be a static snout.

185
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:30,125
It's gonna growl and roar, you know.

186
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,261
And I think it might work very well.

187
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,000
Werewolves are all, like,

188
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:40,368
different from each movie.

189
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:42,404
There's werewolves that look like dogs.

190
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,305
There's werewolves that
have, like, big snouts.

191
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,274
There are werewolves that
even look more feline.

192
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:48,777
I think everyone is going
for different directions,

193
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,111
because we're trying to follow

194
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:52,080
the same world of the vampire.

195
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,918
Oh, okay.

196
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:59,487
Today I really want to focus on the face.

197
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,756
I love when werewolves are transforming.

198
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,759
And I always hate that
look of a big muzzle,

199
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,428
'cause it just reads fake to me.

200
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:08,613
So I kind of want to keep my werewolf

201
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:09,831
more on the human side,

202
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,532
just to kind of show that this thing's

203
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,569
in mid-transformation.

204
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:18,473
Because this is an Asian werewolf,

205
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,375
I want to sculpt Asian elements into it.

206
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,510
So I'm giving it the paisley brow,

207
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,080
a strong, dragon-like nose.

208
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:28,383
And because fire is gold in
traditional Asian culture,

209
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,652
I want the hands and face gold

210
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,353
to tie the whole look together.

211
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:35,323
Wow, that's [Bleep] gorgeous, dude.

212
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:37,358
Hey, guys.

213
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:38,559
We're here for a walk-through.

214
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:40,428
- Hey.
- How are you?

215
00:08:40,463 --> 00:08:42,230
So tell us about your werewolf.

216
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:45,500
I want it to have these
spikes in the whole body

217
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:49,270
that protects him from
the vampire's tongue.

218
00:08:49,305 --> 00:08:50,438
The mouth should be a little bigger.

219
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:52,657
It ought to come back
into here a little more

220
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,309
to get away from the reptilian look

221
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:55,577
and get it more into the werewolf.

222
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:56,945
- Okay.
- Yeah.

223
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:59,314
I want my werewolf to
have the ability of fire.

224
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:00,882
These tufts of hair almost give it

225
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,150
the look of fire.

226
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:04,052
And then paint it with the orange,

227
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,220
just to bring that across.

228
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,821
With all the sculpting you have going on,

229
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,089
- don't get too dark.
- Okay.

230
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:09,491
Your vampire read so well.

231
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:11,359
You don't want this to totally disappear.

232
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:12,560
Okay.

233
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,645
I'm trying to keep

234
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,863
some elements of human, right?

235
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:17,015
I would work on the nose a little bit more.

236
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:20,101
In most of the canines,
there's a split in here.

237
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:22,871
And you could take this
nostril down to here,

238
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,539
maybe close that up a little teeny bit.

239
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:25,840
Yeah, I get what you're saying.

240
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,510
My werewolf has this extremity coming off,

241
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:30,378
and that's what he uses
to kill the vampire.

242
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:31,679
Mm-hmm.

243
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:33,298
I'm just wondering, in your mind,

244
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:34,549
what makes this a werewolf?

245
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,484
The nose and there's this zone.

246
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:40,288
Yeah, but who's gonna see
that from 20 feet away?

247
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:41,489
Uh-oh.

248
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:43,291
You've got human lips on there.

249
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,876
There's really no muzzle.

250
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:46,194
It's gonna look like a vampire.

251
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:48,163
Mr. Westmore is not
liking what he's seeing.

252
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:50,832
This is, like, the worst
time to not impress him.

253
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:53,535
That canine look is in the muzzle.

254
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:55,637
- Okay.
- That's what's gonna sell your werewolf.

255
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,572
This is getting too close to the end

256
00:09:57,606 --> 00:10:00,475
to not really keep on your "A" game.

257
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,610
For the first time, I
feel stumped at this point.

258
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,479
I'm standing back, going, "this sucks,

259
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:07,816
is this thing gonna send me home?"

260
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,817
Coming up...

261
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,086
My finger extensions
just broke and crumbled.

262
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,123
It's not like I sculpted it.

263
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,208
This is a beautiful paint job.

264
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:17,993
Thank you.

265
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:18,965
You did something I haven't seen before.

266
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:26,847
It's gonna look like a vampire,

267
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:29,049
as opposed to werewolf.

268
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,285
It's day one of our werewolf challenge,

269
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,287
and I feel stumped at this point.

270
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:36,590
Mr. Westmore thinks my
face sculpt reads vampire,

271
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:37,925
but I'm making a werewolf.

272
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,526
This sucks.

273
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:40,577
I go in the back room.

274
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:42,046
I just want to really clear my head.

275
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:43,663
I don't want to see anybody's sculpt.

276
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:45,966
I just want to focus on mine.

277
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,402
All right, guys, we're heading out.

278
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:49,970
- Good luck.
- Bye.

279
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:50,734
Thank you.

280
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,247
Time's up.

281
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,865
My face is sculpted the way I want it.

282
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,217
So now it's time to mold this thing

283
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:04,918
and get it ready for foam.

284
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,787
I mold as fast as possible.

285
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,122
While that's setting up,

286
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:11,191
I get to work on my cowl.

287
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:15,155
I'm in the back room,
trying to figure this out.

288
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:18,198
- And all of a sudden...
- Okay, Tyler,

289
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:20,250
we want to come back and talk to you.

290
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:21,435
I feel like you got a little scared

291
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:22,486
because the judges didn't

292
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:23,737
receive you very well last night.

293
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,572
- Yeah.
- And it's showing in your...

294
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,740
'cause you're such a good artist.

295
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:28,308
Don't forget that.

296
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:29,543
Don't let this challenge scare you

297
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:31,628
into doing something
that could send you home.

298
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,746
You're cutting back.

299
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,381
And you need to, you know, go for it.

300
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,016
Your drawing has it,

301
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,350
with all the stuff in it that's great.

302
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,086
- Yeah.
- Translate it to here.

303
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,654
- All right, thank you.
- Don't be scared.

304
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:42,372
- You can do this, come on.
- Thank you so much.

305
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:44,391
- Good luck.
- All right, thanks.

306
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:46,827
I'm going to take Mr. Westmore's advice.

307
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,061
I have my sketchbook.

308
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,897
And my werewolf drawing is exactly

309
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,031
what I pictured in my head.

310
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:52,449
So I think I'm finally heading

311
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,201
in the right direction.

312
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,536
It really means a lot that they came back.

313
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:58,839
They really gave me a boost and also

314
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:01,875
gave me advice that could help me win.

315
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,279
The game is on.

316
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:07,815
My cowl piece is very important,

317
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:09,466
because it's gonna separate

318
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:11,919
my werewolf from the vampire.

319
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:13,387
Since they come from the same world,

320
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:14,688
I have to do something to make him

321
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:16,523
stand out as a different species.

322
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:20,928
So I'm going with a very
massive head and neck.

323
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:23,130
And the ears have to look wolfy,

324
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:24,665
but not that wolfy.

325
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:27,684
So it's gonna be tricky.

326
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,405
That's cool, man.

327
00:12:32,423 --> 00:12:33,507
It's getting there now.

328
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,909
I'm thinking, what could make this

329
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:37,094
a much cooler werewolf?

330
00:12:37,145 --> 00:12:39,546
Let me change the forehead a little bit,

331
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:43,050
adding bits of Clay to extend the eyebrows

332
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:45,252
to follow a curvature.

333
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,321
I think that's gonna be a cool feature,

334
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:49,422
'cause it's gonna bring
you right up the face

335
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,658
and have your eyes follow to the skull.

336
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:52,943
What's our time over there?

337
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:55,562
Our time is 2:27.

338
00:12:55,597 --> 00:12:58,699
But I just feel so behind.

339
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,154
My face is molded,

340
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,540
so I want to start blocking out the cowl,

341
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:10,294
so I can have a starting
point for tomorrow.

342
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:13,046
There's a little bit more
pressure for this challenge,

343
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:14,715
because the judges didn't like my vampire.

344
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:16,917
And that makes me really scared,

345
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:19,086
because three of us is
gonna go to the finale,

346
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,105
and one of us won't.

347
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,493
31 more minutes.

348
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:28,328
I am zooming with my face,

349
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,864
and I'm molding this in crazy, record time.

350
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,566
And the scene is chaotic.

351
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,135
Everyone is really scrambling
to get everything out.

352
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,470
Let's make some noise.

353
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:39,573
Go, Niko.

354
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:42,409
No time, no time.

355
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:50,918
That's time, guys. Let's go.

356
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:52,452
That is time.

357
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:54,655
- All right.
- Whoo!

358
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,341
This day is going so much better.

359
00:13:57,392 --> 00:13:58,559
After having this big setback,

360
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:00,377
I'm gonna forget it, move forward.

361
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:02,968
I'm completely a new, new guy right now.

362
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:15,025
So it's day two of our werewolf challenge.

363
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:16,526
We have 9 1/2 hours today.

364
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:18,262
My face looks gorgeous.

365
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:20,964
Now it reads very dog, wolf like.

366
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:22,449
If everything turns out great,

367
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,950
this make up is gonna help me

368
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,553
get into the finale for sure.

369
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:33,727
I gotta finish the cowl,
so I can start molding it.

370
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:37,631
But it's gonna take a while
to create this whole big piece.

371
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:39,733
And I got to make sure that I have time

372
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:41,835
to start working on the spikes.

373
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:42,970
I think I can get it done.

374
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:46,073
I just have to work really, really fast.

375
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,911
I want to sculpt extensions,

376
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:52,346
just to make the hands look bigger,

377
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,148
like, if they conjure fire.

378
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:58,485
First, I cast both of my hands in alginate,

379
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,421
and then I pour in polyurethane resin.

380
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,724
Once those are cured, I release them

381
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:04,858
from the mold...

382
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:06,059
Yay.

383
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:07,460
Screw them into a board,

384
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,762
so I have a base to sculpt off of,

385
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:11,765
and start sculpting my
finger extensions on them.

386
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:17,804
So the bone extensions, I'm thinking,

387
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,441
"all right, what if I take a foam noodle

388
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:24,678
and carve it into this long spike?"

389
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:27,280
to give them a bone feel,

390
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,399
I coat them with epoxy.

391
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,351
The epoxy gives it a sheen

392
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:34,221
but also makes it hard as a rock.

393
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:35,756
I just sand it down.

394
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,457
And it's starting to look like bone.

395
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:38,959
Nice, how'd you do those?

396
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:40,127
Rock-ass hard.

397
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:41,962
- What'd you put on this?
- Stuff.

398
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:46,366
I know what you put on
that. I'm not an idiot.

399
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,610
As I'm trying to pop my hand mold open...

400
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,912
No.

401
00:15:58,946 --> 00:16:01,815
It just breaks and
crumbles and comes apart.

402
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,084
My mistake was, I went just with ultracal.

403
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:06,920
I didn't use any backing,
like burlap or hemp,

404
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:08,555
because I wanted to save time.

405
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:12,843
So the mold was really weak and frail.

406
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:17,831
My werewolf is supposed
to kill vampires with fire.

407
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:20,600
This hand piece was going
to accentuate that look.

408
00:16:24,856 --> 00:16:26,973
Even though I did win the last challenge,

409
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:28,125
all it would take is one mistake,

410
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,309
and I can still go home.

411
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:30,927
That was a complete waste.

412
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,451
No.

413
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,254
So it's day two of our werewolf challenge.

414
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,458
My finger extensions
just broke and crumbled.

415
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:47,961
So now I'm just trying to figure out

416
00:16:47,979 --> 00:16:50,681
what I can use instead
to make my concept work.

417
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:53,767
And it sucks, because
we have no time to waste.

418
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,636
So I just have to very quickly

419
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,753
figure out what I'm gonna do.

420
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:59,973
Take more than a broken mold to stop me.

421
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,481
My cowl has to be done
by the end of the day.

422
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:08,598
I'm running out of time.

423
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,733
It's heavy as hell.

424
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,936
And my wrist is giving me intense pain.

425
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:14,671
It's slowing me down,
because it really hurts

426
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:16,489
when I pick up very heavy stuff.

427
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:20,226
You got it?

428
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:22,446
Yeah, it's just my fractured wrist.

429
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:24,965
The pain is there, but I just have

430
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:26,950
to power through it and keep going.

431
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:29,002
Yeah, I'm gonna finish this.

432
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:31,905
Thank you, bro.

433
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,576
So my werewolf has all these spikes

434
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:37,644
that protects him

435
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
from the acid tongue of my vampire.

436
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:43,216
I'm using different sizes of foam.

437
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:46,119
And I'm using the sander to make a point.

438
00:17:46,154 --> 00:17:48,021
And then I'm using the heat gun,

439
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:51,191
so the spikes will have
really interesting form.

440
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:53,960
We got 40 minutes.

441
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:56,229
I can do this, I can do this.

442
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:58,065
Since my sculpted hands didn't work,

443
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:01,101
my plan "B" is aluminum foil fingertips

444
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:03,070
with latex wrapped around them.

445
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:06,973
I fabricate the fingers
with paper towels and latex.

446
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,675
Hot glue gives the aluminum foil backing,

447
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:10,527
so it doesn't bend or crease.

448
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,412
Then I take latex and paper towels

449
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,864
and wrap that around each finger,

450
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:15,916
so all the fingers will
go on like a glove piece.

451
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,551
How'd you make all the claws?

452
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:20,286
- Latex and hot glue.
- Cool.

453
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,454
Going through these setbacks

454
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:22,923
and having things not work that

455
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,425
are essential to your
design is always a bummer.

456
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,743
But that means I have to be

457
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:30,130
even more driven to make it out on top.

458
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:33,967
I'm pre-painting the face,

459
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:38,105
and I think it's really
starting to come together.

460
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:40,690
And I even have time to
make the nose look wet,

461
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:42,676
using a gloss medium.

462
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,060
All right, guys, that's time.

463
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:46,146
Brushes down.

464
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,514
At the end of day two, I have

465
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:49,182
a beautiful face set up for tomorrow.

466
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:51,301
Still debating on whether
or not I should use it

467
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:53,437
only because I really want to make sure

468
00:18:53,488 --> 00:18:55,388
I match the cowl perfectly with the face,

469
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:56,790
so I can do everything as a whole.

470
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,904
I wish all of us luck.

471
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,772
We've been working hard.

472
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:07,906
And we all deserve it.

473
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,608
But we have to do this for our loved ones.

474
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:11,009
I'm doing this for my child

475
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:13,145
and my wife and my parents.

476
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,947
So I'll do whatever it takes.

477
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,649
You should do it for your baby girl.

478
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:18,951
She's gonna be so cute.

479
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,720
I can't wait. I don't know, George.

480
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:21,921
She's gonna be beautiful, dude.

481
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,356
You see my wife?

482
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,490
That's it. Yeah, but you got

483
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:25,758
to take your genes into consideration.

484
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,693
Oh, well, hopefully it
will take all of hers.

485
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:29,845
I'm just messing with you.

486
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,064
There's a lot riding on this one challenge.

487
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,750
So it feels good to relax together.

488
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:36,402
These guys are like a family.

489
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:39,205
Here's to, uh, great application.

490
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,380
- Whoo!
- Let's go, let's go.

491
00:19:47,414 --> 00:19:48,748
Let's see what we got.

492
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,049
So it's application day.

493
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,017
We have four hours in the
lab, one hour at last looks.

494
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,319
And it's definitely

495
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:55,721
the most important application day of all,

496
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,323
because this is gonna determine

497
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:58,891
who's in the finale.

498
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,793
So I get the new face, and it actually

499
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:02,912
came out much cleaner than the last one.

500
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:04,430
So I'm looking at

501
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,115
the beautifully pre-painted piece,

502
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:08,100
and I'm like, "nope,
let's start from scratch."

503
00:20:08,135 --> 00:20:10,135
I need to put these pieces all on

504
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,238
and start the entire recipe

505
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:15,274
of painting this guy from the beginning.

506
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:20,463
- Oh, yeah.
- Go have a seat, brother.

507
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:22,614
- Yeah.
- My model got sick.

508
00:20:22,632 --> 00:20:23,666
So I got a change of model.

509
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:25,634
You're a werewolf from Australia.

510
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:26,819
I'm a little concerned.

511
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:28,437
My original model has very thick lips.

512
00:20:28,472 --> 00:20:30,806
And my new model has very thin lips.

513
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:33,509
So that's gonna make a
huge gap in the prosthetics.

514
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:34,827
And it might look funky.

515
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:37,012
So I'm just hoping that it works out.

516
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:39,148
Let's see.

517
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:43,135
All right. It's like-

518
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,837
there's some issues here.

519
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:46,405
I have some trouble with the cowl.

520
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,907
The cowl has some ripped pieces

521
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,575
in both of the ears.

522
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:52,228
So I need to glue them down and patch.

523
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:55,114
That's gonna take time.

524
00:20:58,718 --> 00:21:00,436
Let's see where your eyes are at.

525
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,054
I'm putting the face on my new model.

526
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:04,106
And I'm seeing a huge gap here.

527
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:06,292
I just have to glue teeth in

528
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:07,293
as best as possible.

529
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,494
The teeth are actually

530
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,095
distorting the jaw a little bit.

531
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,165
It's making the whole
face kind of squish down.

532
00:21:17,437 --> 00:21:18,471
It's looking decent,

533
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:19,538
but it's not like I sculpted it.

534
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,208
Open your mouth, like...

535
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:31,283
So this paint job is a pretty long process,

536
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:33,369
and I have to make it look like it has hair

537
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:34,887
but not actually lay on the hair.

538
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:36,972
So that means I have to

539
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:40,059
airbrush strands of
hair all over this thing.

540
00:21:40,093 --> 00:21:42,428
This is it, last make up
right before the finale.

541
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:45,531
I want to make sure that
everything is perfect.

542
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,385
Everything's going really quickly.

543
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,604
The paint looks even better
than the pre-painted piece.

544
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:54,373
I'm glad I made the decision
to go with this face.

545
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:56,475
And it looks great.

546
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:01,997
I want the paint scheme to be related

547
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:04,650
to my aswang vampire from the Philippines,

548
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:07,753
to have that light palette
but in a different way.

549
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:11,190
So I'm going more with
grays and some purple tones.

550
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:12,625
- How many minutes?
- Eight.

551
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,794
Eight minutes, okay.

552
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,551
So all these adjustments that I made

553
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,870
for the face took me too much time.

554
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:27,056
I'm worried, 'cause I only
have a base coat on it,

555
00:22:27,107 --> 00:22:30,276
and I have a lot to do
to finish this paint job.

556
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:32,328
All right, guys, it's time.

557
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:34,513
Brushes down.

558
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:35,714
You know, I really want to win tonight.

559
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,449
At least, I want to be in the last three.

560
00:22:37,484 --> 00:22:38,817
So I have a lot to do.

561
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:42,788
This is not the challenge
that I want to go home.

562
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:44,790
Coming up...

563
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:47,059
This is the one that's
gonna take us to the finale.

564
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,727
So it's a lot of pressure.

565
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:51,247
He looks like he could
kick everybody's ass.

566
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:52,731
The last person that will be joining us

567
00:22:52,766 --> 00:22:54,330
in the finale is...

568
00:23:00,692 --> 00:23:02,960
Aah!

569
00:23:02,994 --> 00:23:05,295
We get to last looks. We have one hour.

570
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,382
And the first thing I
do is attach the spikes.

571
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:11,034
It's time-consuming,
because I have to put glue

572
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:13,320
in all of them and hold
them until they dry.

573
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:16,039
Because if I don't do
that, they'll come out.

574
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,210
There's definitely a
lot riding on this hour.

575
00:23:20,245 --> 00:23:23,680
So I'm making sure
everything is glued down,

576
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:25,415
everything is seen.

577
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,167
There's so many things I have to

578
00:23:27,218 --> 00:23:29,853
take into consideration.

579
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,556
All I have to focus on
is touch-ups and hair.

580
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,058
I have hair coming out
of the chest and hands.

581
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:38,094
And it looks great.

582
00:23:39,497 --> 00:23:40,631
I got a lot of paint to do.

583
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:42,549
I have to also epoxy

584
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:45,419
all those protrusions on
the whole frickin' body.

585
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,370
So I'm worried about time.

586
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:50,073
This is the one that's
gonna take us to the finale.

587
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:52,025
One of us is gonna be sent home,

588
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:53,210
so it's a lot of pressure.

589
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:56,346
All right, guys, we got 15 minutes left.

590
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,923
Time's up.

591
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:07,291
Looks good.

592
00:24:07,325 --> 00:24:10,561
I think it looks decent for the time I had

593
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:12,429
and all the situation with
the model and everything,

594
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:13,881
so I'm happy with it.

595
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,917
I hope the judges like it as well.

596
00:24:25,343 --> 00:24:28,779
Welcome to the Face Off reveal stage.

597
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:31,615
Tonight, one of you will be eliminated,

598
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,585
and three of you will
move on to our finale.

599
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,355
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

600
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,724
Owner of optic nerve make up effects studio

601
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,159
Glenn Hetrick. Good evening.

602
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,393
Hi, Glenn.

603
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,929
Three-time Oscar-winning
make up artist Ve Neill.

604
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,164
Good evening, gentlemen.

605
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:48,331
- Hey, Ve.
- Hi, Ve.

606
00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:50,133
Creature and concept designer Neville Page.

607
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:52,336
- Hello, guys.
- Hi, Neville.

608
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,620
And joining us again tonight

609
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:55,706
is production designer, creature designer,

610
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,908
and director Patrick Tatopoulos.

611
00:24:57,942 --> 00:24:59,209
Good to see you.

612
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:00,244
Great to see you again.

613
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:01,444
I'm sure you're anxious to see

614
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:02,813
what these guys have created.

615
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,681
We've got four great artists here.

616
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,316
I'm very anxious to see their work.

617
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:08,818
All right, this week I surprised you

618
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:11,955
with our first-ever two-part challenge.

619
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,190
Your second spotlight challenge

620
00:25:13,224 --> 00:25:15,859
was to create a werewolf
Nemesis for the vampires

621
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:17,561
you created last week.

622
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:19,396
Now I also asked that you incorporate

623
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,199
a newly evolved feature in your werewolves

624
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:25,702
specifically designed to take
their vampire rivals down.

625
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:27,454
As a reminder, the judges will be taking

626
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:29,873
both characters into consideration

627
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:33,210
when choosing which of you
will make it to the finale.

628
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:35,008
Let's take a look at your creations.

629
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:00,437
My werewolf walks out onstage.

630
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,506
He's acting. He's roaring.

631
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,542
And he looks great. I'm loving him.

632
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:29,232
My werewolf comes out, and he looks strong,

633
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:31,318
cocky, confident.

634
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:35,238
And he looks like he can
definitely kick some butt.

635
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:55,625
My werewolf comes out.

636
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:57,344
He actually has a great profile.

637
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:59,262
He looks really good on the side.

638
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:02,032
He's awesome.

639
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:22,218
I'm feeling great about my make up.

640
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:24,488
My father will be super thrilled about it.

641
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:27,524
I can't wait for him to see it.

642
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:32,596
Judges, why don't you take a closer look

643
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,198
at our werewolves?

644
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:41,872
The shapes are nice.

645
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:44,157
I kind of like the classic nature of this.

646
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,076
It's a shame he didn't bring color

647
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:47,244
down into the chest, because it

648
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,046
almost reads like a t-shirt... It does.

649
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,481
Even though there's all this
awesome texture and shape to it.

650
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:52,682
The shape is cool.

651
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:55,052
It's a little thick here.

652
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:56,870
It's a detail, but scalloping that out

653
00:27:56,904 --> 00:27:57,954
I think would've helped.

654
00:27:57,988 --> 00:27:59,423
Even just some spots and mottling

655
00:27:59,457 --> 00:28:01,958
would've helped, especially from far away.

656
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:03,744
Give us some facial expression.

657
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,796
It moves really well.

658
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,098
I like the lower lip
black, like the dogs have.

659
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:09,583
I'm not seeing this everywhere.

660
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:13,403
- It's kind of cool.
- Thank you.

661
00:28:13,438 --> 00:28:14,538
I think it's vastly improved

662
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,440
from last week's sculpt.

663
00:28:16,474 --> 00:28:19,676
These features are handled a lot better.

664
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,977
This is all just padded out,

665
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,430
which is a smart, quick
way to get his proportion.

666
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:25,048
And it blends nicely with the neck.

667
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,283
It does, it does.

668
00:28:26,317 --> 00:28:28,051
I like the fact that
he was smart enough to,

669
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:29,619
like, wet up the nose and give it

670
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:32,189
some nice, shiny highlights.

671
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:33,457
He put some grays in there

672
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:35,392
to break it up a little bit, which is nice.

673
00:28:35,426 --> 00:28:37,494
I like the subtle expression he's doing.

674
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:39,195
Let's see you do some really extreme faces,

675
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:42,165
and see how well it...

676
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:46,570
Really well done.

677
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:50,857
It's definitely original,
I'll give it that.

678
00:28:50,908 --> 00:28:53,360
Can you turn around?

679
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:55,212
So what's happening on the back here

680
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:57,130
is intriguing for a werewolf.

681
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:59,416
So these are the growths.

682
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,384
- Are these the weapons?
- Yeah, they are.

683
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:03,520
One of my biggest concerns here is,

684
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:06,490
this is so flat and one-dimensional.

685
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:08,558
It doesn't feel like a functioning ear.

686
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:10,794
It would've been easy to carve deeper.

687
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:12,762
Yeah, it wouldn't have taken any more time.

688
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:14,764
- I agree.
- I feel really worried.

689
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,167
I don't know if the judges
like my concept or not.

690
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:19,536
Last challenge, they
didn't like my vampire.

691
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,205
So they're gonna have to
really love this make up

692
00:29:22,223 --> 00:29:26,109
if I'm gonna make it
all the way to the end.

693
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,994
Who made your favorite werewolf?

694
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:31,281
Tell us on Twitter, using #FaceOff.

695
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:35,693
Can you turn around for a second?

696
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:38,997
He put his energy into the big concept,

697
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:41,366
certainly not the... the finish.

698
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,768
I don't know if the judges
are liking my werewolf.

699
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,703
But I know they're gonna have to really

700
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:47,972
love this make up if I'm
gonna get to the finale.

701
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:49,607
Thank you.

702
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:51,443
The paint job, from far away,

703
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:52,677
looks really great.

704
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:53,945
It looks a little rough up close.

705
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:56,214
But for the broad picture,

706
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:58,333
- it looks really terrific.
- Yeah.

707
00:29:58,384 --> 00:30:00,251
Can we get a little
movement on the mouth a bit?

708
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:01,536
That's cool.

709
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,371
Can you... can you turn to the side?

710
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:06,357
That is one impressive shape.

711
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:08,409
It has ripped skin.

712
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:09,494
- That's a nice detail.
- Yeah.

713
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:11,062
There's so much stuff going on there,

714
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,832
even in the dark areas.

715
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:16,851
Thank you.

716
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:20,939
The judges would now like to speak

717
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:23,174
with each of you to learn
more about your work.

718
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:26,194
- Tyler, you're up first.
- Okay.

719
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:32,033
Tell us about your
concept for your werewolf

720
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:35,003
and how he fits in to
the world of your vampire.

721
00:30:35,054 --> 00:30:36,721
My werewolf is a vampire hunter.

722
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,523
And he spends his days searching out

723
00:30:38,557 --> 00:30:40,825
these legendary vampires
from around the world.

724
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,428
He uses a extension of his bone

725
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:45,163
to jab into the vampire and kill them.

726
00:30:45,197 --> 00:30:47,131
It reminds me of several

727
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,067
traditional different werewolf designs...

728
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:52,570
- Okay.
- Which I love.

729
00:30:52,604 --> 00:30:55,373
The way that you worked that angle,

730
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:58,893
coming down off of the enlarged skull

731
00:30:58,928 --> 00:31:02,380
and transitioned to the human aspects

732
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,016
that remain, is beautifully handled.

733
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,652
You made this very organic and very real.

734
00:31:07,686 --> 00:31:08,653
Thank you.

735
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:10,522
This is a beautiful paint job tonight.

736
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:12,857
Your hair work, superb.

737
00:31:12,892 --> 00:31:14,526
Yes.

738
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,927
He's the smallest guy out there,

739
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,095
and he looks like he could kick

740
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:19,197
everybody in this room's ass.

741
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:20,465
Yes.

742
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:22,500
You've improved upon the aesthetic

743
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:23,968
that you established before.

744
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:26,704
And it's really nice to
see that you've enhanced

745
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:28,573
this world that you've established.

746
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:29,774
Congratulations. Thank you.

747
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:31,843
That thing is a werewolf.

748
00:31:31,877 --> 00:31:33,144
There's no question about it.

749
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:34,562
The proportion of the chest,

750
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:36,397
the narrow waist, it feels very real.

751
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:37,415
Great work.

752
00:31:37,449 --> 00:31:38,533
Thank you very much.

753
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:41,569
Tyler, please step back.

754
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:46,124
- Good job, man.
- Good job.

755
00:31:46,158 --> 00:31:49,126
Niko, please step forward.

756
00:31:52,948 --> 00:31:54,532
Tell us how your werewolf

757
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,534
fits into the world of your vampire.

758
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:58,453
And what is his special ability

759
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:00,355
for hunting and killing them?

760
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:02,674
My werewolf is a warrior-hunter.

761
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:05,076
He has this DNA that
grows all these spikes,

762
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,279
which he uses as stakes to attack vampires.

763
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:11,516
I think that's a really good idea, Niko.

764
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,918
Can you turn him around for me?

765
00:32:13,953 --> 00:32:15,653
I love the profile, and I love

766
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:17,522
all the spikes coming off the back.

767
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:19,890
And I think this idea
of the spikes pulling off

768
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:21,409
is really very clever.

769
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:22,493
Thank you.

770
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,595
It's just on the hairy edge

771
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:28,232
of not looking like it's
of the canine family.

772
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:31,002
But there's just enough data there visually

773
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:35,139
that makes it feel like it is a wolf man.

774
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:36,691
You did something I haven't seen before.

775
00:32:36,742 --> 00:32:39,077
You are very original.
You're a great designer.

776
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:40,628
That's very important for me,

777
00:32:40,663 --> 00:32:42,246
and I'm gonna credit you for that.

778
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:44,499
- Good stuff, Niko.
- Thank you.

779
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,651
Your color scheme across both the vampire

780
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:49,520
and the werewolf is far too limited.

781
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:51,230
You'd want to keep the colour schemes

782
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:52,490
distinct from one another.

783
00:32:52,524 --> 00:32:56,944
However, this character
has a captivating profile,

784
00:32:56,996 --> 00:33:00,598
and I am very impressed.

785
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:02,517
Niko, thank you very much.

786
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:03,551
If you'd please step back.

787
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:06,337
Thank you.

788
00:33:08,741 --> 00:33:11,743
George, please come forward.

789
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,283
Tell us about your werewolf

790
00:33:19,318 --> 00:33:20,985
and how he fits into the world

791
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:22,987
of your already-established vampire.

792
00:33:23,022 --> 00:33:26,057
The vampires had a mutation,

793
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,626
and through evolution, became werewolves.

794
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:31,295
And with these things,
he could slice them out

795
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,563
and then bite them.

796
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,599
And eat 'em up.

797
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:37,669
There's some really
elegant stuff happening.

798
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:40,521
The shape on the back is bat-like.

799
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:43,574
But what I like about this is the texture.

800
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:46,477
It does remind me of shark skin.

801
00:33:46,495 --> 00:33:50,014
I think the palette is
rock-solid and sound.

802
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:51,883
I'm also a big fan of the coloring.

803
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,718
It's not black, but it's a mix of color

804
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:55,386
that gets this creature
quite dark on the back

805
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:57,121
without going straight to a black.

806
00:33:57,156 --> 00:33:59,824
The wod efunct on the neck
was very, very cleverly done

807
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:01,492
and very effective and realistic.

808
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:02,794
Thank you.

809
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:05,596
The angle and length of
the finger extensions,

810
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:07,632
what a turnaround compared to last week,

811
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,000
your weakest point.

812
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:11,169
This week, it's a smashing success.

813
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:12,270
Thanks.

814
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:13,421
I think you did a really great job.

815
00:34:13,472 --> 00:34:14,505
They definitely look like

816
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,990
they came from the same place.

817
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,625
They have similar coloring.

818
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:19,744
Your story is really cool.

819
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:21,145
So very nice job, George.

820
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,196
Thank you so much, Ve.

821
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:23,598
George, please step back.

822
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:26,117
Thank you, my friend.

823
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:31,089
Rashaad, you're up.

824
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,129
Tell us about the
backstory of your werewolf.

825
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,764
My werewolf just so happened to

826
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:41,733
get bit on a fire moon, a red moon,

827
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,835
so that gave him the ability

828
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:46,971
to conjure up fire element
to fight his vampire.

829
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:47,955
This is a great concept.

830
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,942
That is something very original.

831
00:34:50,976 --> 00:34:52,510
I love the sculpt of the chest.

832
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,078
The fact that you extended it so long,

833
00:34:54,096 --> 00:34:55,279
very much like a wolf.

834
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:57,381
I wish you carried on
the language of ornament

835
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,684
to the center of the chest,

836
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:01,652
because it looks like the
chest is a little plain,

837
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,154
almost like he's wearing a t-shirt.

838
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:04,555
But of a whole, it's a beautiful creature.

839
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,390
And I think it's a great, great concept.

840
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:07,625
Thank you.

841
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:09,160
We were really looking
for originality this week.

842
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:12,764
And this is certainly
an unorthodox approach,

843
00:35:12,798 --> 00:35:13,798
which is a good thing.

844
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:17,101
The overall look is an issue for me.

845
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:19,036
This guy does not look like

846
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:22,406
he'd be able to hunt your vampire.

847
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:23,641
I'm still not really clear.

848
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:26,027
Are these supposed to be jewelry pieces,

849
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:27,678
these side bits up here?

850
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:29,080
Jewelry, not so much.

851
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:30,248
It's part of the animal.

852
00:35:30,282 --> 00:35:31,799
- Like a scale, sort of?
- Yes.

853
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:34,018
Okay, now I got it.

854
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:36,454
I like him, 'cause you
gave it an underbite,

855
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:38,856
which gives it that whole animal quality.

856
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:42,660
The palette of this is really beautiful.

857
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:45,763
I also love the fact
that the ears are down,

858
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:48,699
giving him this very aggressive look.

859
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:49,700
Thank you.

860
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:52,487
Rashaad, please step back.

861
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,208
All right, guys, the judges have

862
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:58,409
heard what you have to say.

863
00:35:58,443 --> 00:35:59,944
If you'd please head
back to the make up room

864
00:35:59,978 --> 00:36:03,548
while they decide who
will move on to the finale.

865
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:10,004
All right, judges, well, we have a lot

866
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:11,372
to talk about tonight.

867
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:12,790
Why don't we start with Tyler?

868
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:15,593
He did an exceptional job of painting it,

869
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:17,395
right down to the sheen on the nose,

870
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:19,430
the black lip like a little dog.

871
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:21,131
He was the only true werewolf tonight,

872
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:22,900
the one that really felt like a werewolf

873
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:24,135
in the traditional kind of way.

874
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:25,536
That profile was beautiful.

875
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:29,407
He was capable of
presenting a clear ferocity.

876
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:32,610
But also, he was able to emote sympathy.

877
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:35,146
He managed to convey the world

878
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,783
of the previous design
but evolve the sculpture.

879
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:40,117
Here's the problem.

880
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:42,353
A huge part of this
challenge was that unique

881
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:44,522
weapon element... how do
they hunt the vampires?

882
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:46,224
Very lame approach to that,

883
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:47,958
the bone claw out of the wrist.

884
00:36:47,976 --> 00:36:50,862
And looking at them together,

885
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:52,363
his vampire is still hurting him.

886
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:55,032
As a group, I'm still
not thrilled with them.

887
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,501
All right, judges, let's move on to Niko.

888
00:36:57,536 --> 00:37:00,004
Overall, it's kind of a cool idea,

889
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:03,007
but he did such a poor job
of putting it in front of us.

890
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,675
He didn't refine the sculpt.

891
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,277
He didn't give it a good paint job.

892
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:09,614
You know what was a really
great prosthetic moment

893
00:37:09,648 --> 00:37:11,148
were the corners of the mouth.

894
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:14,018
The fact that he got that to work,

895
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:16,721
open,  big, and not have it feel

896
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:19,323
completely detached
from the actor's mouth...

897
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:20,575
that was impressive.

898
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:23,027
That was... that was really very clever.

899
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:24,328
But why would he not give something

900
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:26,297
that he could cut that big tongue off with?

901
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:28,666
I thought that tongue
thing was a brave move.

902
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,967
But then your werewolf

903
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:31,702
ought to have something
to get rid of that baby.

904
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:33,537
Then suddenly, what we
didn't think was amazing

905
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:36,173
last week could have
come together this week.

906
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:37,792
All right, let's move on to George.

907
00:37:37,843 --> 00:37:39,977
Boy, he came up with
an interesting approach.

908
00:37:40,012 --> 00:37:43,948
Let's take the vampires and
have them turn into werewolves.

909
00:37:43,982 --> 00:37:46,417
And it was very apparent that
that's exactly what happened.

910
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:47,752
When you put them side by side,

911
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:50,121
they're very similar
but completely different.

912
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:53,891
The precision around the lip and teeth area

913
00:37:53,926 --> 00:37:55,209
was so well handled.

914
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,962
Because typically, that
gets bulky and thick,

915
00:37:57,996 --> 00:37:59,430
but it was so thin.

916
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:01,933
He's showing off some expert-level skills.

917
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:03,601
Like, an area that's gonna be dark,

918
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:05,236
the dark isn't just black.

919
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,537
So it looked very natural.

920
00:38:06,571 --> 00:38:08,039
On the down side, that great work

921
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:11,008
that appears in the back
disappeared on the chest.

922
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:13,210
All right, let's discuss  Rashaad's work.

923
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:16,580
If he could've made that gold organic

924
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:18,282
or have embraced the fact

925
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:21,452
that the gold was a metallic element,

926
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:23,287
it would've been a whole
different conversation.

927
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:25,389
But the fact that it was an
attempt to make it organic?

928
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:27,725
I loved his vampire.

929
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:31,529
But this really slips him
backwards, in my opinion.

930
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:33,197
He didn't concentrate on creating

931
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:34,732
proportion and strength,

932
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,200
and so it ends up looking

933
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:38,803
so measly compared to his vampire.

934
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:40,838
Okay, judges, have you made your decisions?

935
00:38:40,872 --> 00:38:42,056
- I think so.
- Yeah.

936
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:45,109
- We have.
- Let's bring 'em back out.

937
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:55,236
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge

938
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:57,888
and the first person to
make it to the finale?

939
00:38:57,923 --> 00:38:59,557
The winner of tonight's challenge

940
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:03,594
and the first person moving
on to the finale is...

941
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:11,569
All right, Glenn, who is the winner

942
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:13,471
of this challenge and the first person

943
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:15,122
to make it to the finale?

944
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:16,740
The winner of tonight's challenge

945
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:19,877
and the first person moving
on to the finale is...

946
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:24,148
George.

947
00:39:26,718 --> 00:39:29,987
You had a terrific concept, and it was,

948
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:32,589
overall, extremely well executed.

949
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:35,493
But most importantly,
your werewolf felt like

950
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,761
it came from the same
world as your vampire.

951
00:39:37,796 --> 00:39:39,497
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

952
00:39:39,531 --> 00:39:41,649
Oh, my God. I did it.

953
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,101
I won the werewolf challenge,

954
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:46,737
and it feels fantastic.

955
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:49,123
I feel really, really good.

956
00:39:49,174 --> 00:39:51,275
George, congratulations.

957
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:53,177
You have made it to the finale.

958
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:54,478
Thank you.

959
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:56,497
Glenn, who is the next person

960
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:57,998
going on to the finale?

961
00:39:58,049 --> 00:39:59,616
The next person that will be moving on

962
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:02,086
to the finale is...

963
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:06,290
Tyler.

964
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:12,163
Tyler, we thought that your sculpture,

965
00:40:12,197 --> 00:40:15,332
paint job, and hair work
were all beautifully handled.

966
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:17,768
Huge rebound from you this week.

967
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:20,938
Yes! I'm in the finale! This is awesome.

968
00:40:20,972 --> 00:40:22,139
This is a dream come true.

969
00:40:22,174 --> 00:40:24,692
Family is gonna be so proud of me.

970
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,794
I am so happy.

971
00:40:26,828 --> 00:40:27,995
Oh, my gosh.

972
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,513
Congratulations, Tyler.

973
00:40:29,548 --> 00:40:31,415
You have also made it to the finale.

974
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:32,550
Thank you.

975
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:35,052
All right, we have one spot left

976
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:37,121
with two artists remaining.

977
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:41,692
After working so hard
and after all these weeks,

978
00:40:41,726 --> 00:40:44,595
being in the finale would
mean everything to me.

979
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:46,814
Being right here, like, right at the door

980
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:50,501
of the finale, it would so
suck to go home right now.

981
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,470
Glenn, who gets the
last spot in our finale?

982
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:55,139
The last person that will be joining us

983
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:58,776
in the finale is...

984
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,549
Rashaad.

985
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:08,519
Wow.

986
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:09,853
Rashaad, you created

987
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,690
an interesting version of
the traditional wolf man,

988
00:41:12,724 --> 00:41:15,826
but it was your vampire that
really put you over the top.

989
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,161
Thank you. Thank you so much.

990
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:18,329
I'm very proud.

991
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:20,497
I fought this whole
way, showing what I got.

992
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:22,266
And now I'm on my way to the finale.

993
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,467
I'm ready.

994
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:26,904
And I think I have a
good chance of winning.

995
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:29,106
Unfortunately, that means, Niko,

996
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,141
you will be leaving us tonight.

997
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:34,628
Niko, we really appreciate
your daring ideas,

998
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,679
and we do know what it was that

999
00:41:35,714 --> 00:41:37,248
you were trying to do with this piece.

1000
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:40,417
But it was really rough around the edges.

1001
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,186
And it simply just wasn't enough

1002
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,054
to secure you a spot in the finale.

1003
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:45,673
Niko, I know it's tough.

1004
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:48,692
But listen, I'm not too
concerned about your future.

1005
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,728
You're a great, great conceptual artist.

1006
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:52,062
You have fantastic ideas.

1007
00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:54,265
- You're in good shape.
- Thank you so much, guys.

1008
00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:57,601
It's been an honor just
to be with these people.

1009
00:41:57,636 --> 00:41:58,969
It has been awesome.

1010
00:41:59,004 --> 00:41:59,970
It's been awesome seeing your work, man.

1011
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:01,639
Thank you.

1012
00:42:01,673 --> 00:42:03,941
Niko, I am so sorry, but
you have been eliminated.

1013
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:06,176
It's been so great having you here with us

1014
00:42:06,194 --> 00:42:07,278
and seeing your work.

1015
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:09,263
Please head back to the make up room

1016
00:42:09,314 --> 00:42:10,481
and pack up your kit.

1017
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:11,849
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1018
00:42:11,883 --> 00:42:12,850
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

1019
00:42:12,884 --> 00:42:13,834
- Bye, take care, Niko.
- Thank you.

1020
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:15,970
It's been a pleasure.

1021
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:17,921
The three of you have done

1022
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:19,957
incredibly well to get this far.

1023
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:23,594
I will see you soon for your
last spotlight challenge.

1024
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:25,129
Why don't you head home and get some rest?

1025
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,130
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1026
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:27,114
Yes. Thank you, guys.

1027
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:28,132
Good luck, guys.

1028
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,375
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1029
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:36,021
I'm bummed out that I
didn't get to the finale.

1030
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:38,821
But this is not gonna stop me, you know.

1031
00:42:39,153 --> 00:42:41,905
Being here makes me
want to go further and further.

1032
00:42:42,772 --> 00:42:45,187
There is a lot I'm gonna take with me.

1033
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:49,230
I got to learn new techniques, and I
actually have inventive and original ideas

1034
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:51,296
that I thought I didn't have.

1035
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:55,546
Getting this far has really pushed
my confidence and that feels awesome.
