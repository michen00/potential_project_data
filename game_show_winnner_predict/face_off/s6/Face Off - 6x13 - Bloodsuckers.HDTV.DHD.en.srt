1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,863
Fantastic job.

2
00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:02,998
He's amazing.

3
00:00:03,032 --> 00:00:05,164
I'm not really a big fan.

4
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:07,903
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,937 --> 00:00:09,905
Rashaad's robot earned him
his first win...

6
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:11,240
Thank you.

7
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:14,876
...and Daran was sent home.

8
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,812
Now only four artists remain,

9
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,281
and tonight their challenge
will be legendary.

10
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:21,583
The most famous movie monster
of all time...

11
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:24,653
How cool is that, man?

12
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:25,921
But with the finale looming,

13
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:28,357
a single mistake can cost
one artist everything.

14
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:29,992
What the fuck, man?

15
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:32,094
I don't think that
I can use this piece.

16
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,428
It's very serious.

17
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:36,265
All of a sudden, I realize
I made a big mistake.

18
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,599
Fucking shit, George.

19
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:40,135
They looked awful.

20
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,603
It looks beautiful.
It's fantastic.

21
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:43,238
It really doesn't look
like the top half

22
00:00:43,273 --> 00:00:44,573
goes with the bottom half.

23
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:46,975
It could be responsible
for sending you home.

24
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,578
In the end, only one will win
a VIP trip

25
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:50,946
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

26
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,149
to one of their
85 international locations,

27
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:57,052
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

28
00:00:57,086 --> 00:00:59,521
and $100,000.

29
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:01,423
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

30
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,262
<i>Face Off!</i>

31
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:09,564
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

33
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:57,079
All right, Mr. Winner,

34
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:58,847
- finally.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:59,882 --> 00:02:01,383
- Took a while.
- Catching up to me.

36
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:04,720
But on a sadder note,
we did lose Daran.

37
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:06,488
I know. Daran--
Daran's awesome.

38
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:08,957
To see Daran knocked
out of the competition is crazy.

39
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,325
Now that there's only four
of us left,

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,761
every challenge
is getting more real,

41
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,596
and you can't slip,
and you can't make any mistakes.

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,198
- How do you guys feel?
- Good.

43
00:02:16,232 --> 00:02:17,632
Wondering what today's
gonna be.

44
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,402
Pretty much our last challenge
and then the big one.

45
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:23,672
To be this close to the finale
is, like, a dream come true.

46
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:24,940
Final four, let's see
what we got for today.

47
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:26,174
- Let's see.
- All right.

48
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,176
- Let's see. Let's see.
- Let's go.

49
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:29,277
Let's see.

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,155
- What in the world?
- Nice.

51
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:42,791
I don't know, guys.

52
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:45,127
We're walking up
to this mausoleum,

53
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:46,395
and it's a beautiful building,

54
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:49,131
lots of cool patterns going on.

55
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,736
- I like the colors.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,405
We're all just trying to think

57
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,408
of what our next challenge
could be.

58
00:03:01,711 --> 00:03:02,677
Whoa.

59
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:03,812
Whoa.

60
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:05,547
It's kind of creepy.

61
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:07,549
Yeah.

62
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:12,988
There's dead people
in here, you know.

63
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:16,291
We don't want to start messing
around with any spirits here.

64
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:18,293
So let's all behave.
Let's behave.

65
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:19,461
Oh, my God.

66
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,997
I see McKenzie with somebody.

67
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,532
It's frickin'
Patrick Tatopoulos.

68
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:25,834
What is this?
And where the hell are we?

69
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:28,703
'Cause this place
creeps me out.

70
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,838
Hey, guys.

71
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,006
- Hey.
- Hello.

72
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,709
Welcome
to the Angeles Abbey Mausoleum.

73
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:36,077
This beautiful building

74
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:38,847
was inspired
by the iconic Taj Mahal.

75
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:42,250
Now, we've come to this house
of the dead

76
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:44,719
to talk about your
next spotlight challenge.

77
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:46,388
Before I tell you more,

78
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:49,291
please welcome back
our very own Patrick Tatopoulos.

79
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:51,393
- Hey, Patrick.
- Good to be back, guys.

80
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:52,961
Good to see you.

81
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:54,429
Now, I know
you've been busy at work

82
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,565
on the new
Superman-Batman project.

83
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,266
So thank you for taking
the time to be here today.

84
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,701
I wouldn't miss it
for anything.

85
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:03,171
Now, your next challenge
taps into what many consider

86
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:07,976
the most famous movie monster
of all time.

87
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,613
Vampires.

88
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:13,949
We're all like, "Yes."
You know, finally, vampires--

89
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,350
we get to do something
that we've wanted to do.

90
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:16,785
And I think across the board,

91
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:17,986
everybody wanted
to do a vampire.

92
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,287
Awesome.

93
00:04:19,322 --> 00:04:21,756
Of course, you know
it can never be that simple.

94
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,427
You'll each need something
before we can go any further.

95
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:29,164
Down this hall
are four coffins.

96
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:31,399
Ooh.

97
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,235
When I call your name,
I want you to head down there,

98
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:34,636
open one,

99
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,271
and take what you find inside.

100
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,540
George...

101
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:40,342
you're up first.

102
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:41,510
Good luck.

103
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:43,178
Oh, my God.

104
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:44,346
I have to go through
this hallway

105
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,081
that's got dead people
in the walls.

106
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:47,949
There's four coffins.

107
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:50,452
And I see this
very old, rusty one.

108
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,189
There's a stake with
a name on it.

109
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:56,625
Whoa.

110
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,305
On your stakes

111
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:12,007
is the name
of a legendary vampire

112
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,108
from a different part
of the world.

113
00:05:13,142 --> 00:05:14,242
Nice.

114
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:16,144
But these vampires
are not the type

115
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,846
we're used to seeing today.

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,383
Instead, each has
a very specific characteristic.

117
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,652
Like green fungus-covered skin

118
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:27,022
and fingers that drain the blood
of their victims.

119
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,324
Your spotlight challenge
is to create

120
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,593
a vampire inspired

121
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:33,929
by the blood-sucking legends
that you've chosen.

122
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:34,930
Ooh.

123
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,865
But...

124
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,033
your final creations

125
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,102
must introduce
a new extreme ability

126
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:45,140
not typically associated
with vampires.

127
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:47,509
Now, Patrick, you created
some pretty extreme vampires

128
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:49,244
for the<i> Underworld</i> franchise

129
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:51,246
that stood out
from the typical Dracula look.

130
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,683
How can these artists create
something unique?

131
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:56,885
Pay attention to their
culture, their backstories,

132
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,787
and I think you'll find
something very interesting

133
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,121
and original, in that case.

134
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,323
Thank you, Patrick.

135
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:03,325
I believe you have
a surprise for everyone.

136
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,961
My great friend Len Wiseman,

137
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:07,696
writer and director
of<i> Underworld</i>

138
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,164
and<i> Underworld Evolution</i>

139
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:10,398
will be at the reveal stage

140
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,233
this week to look
at your vampires.

141
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:13,301
- Nice.
- Awesome.

142
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:15,236
How cool is that, man?

143
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,538
Len Wiseman--
I'm a big fan.

144
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:18,440
I can't wait to present him
my work.

145
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:19,441
We're gonna leave you here

146
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:21,276
to start working
on your designs.

147
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,078
When you're finished,
head back to the lab

148
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:24,512
and get to work.

149
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,514
Bye, guys.
Good luck in here.

150
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:28,650
Thank you.

151
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:33,021
We immediately grab
our tablets,

152
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:37,392
looking up the characteristics
of our vampires.

153
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:41,296
I have Sasabonsam, which is
a vampire legend from Ghana.

154
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,099
It says that he lives
in the forest.

155
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:47,268
It's known to have horns,
iron teeth,

156
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,837
and it's bat-like
with 20-foot wings.

157
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:49,904
Whoa.

158
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,840
20-foot wings in three days?

159
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,074
Yeah, don't think so.

160
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:56,011
But it also says he has
these short, stubby arms.

161
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:59,280
So I'm thinking I could make
short, stubby arms

162
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:02,183
and use the model's arms
as the wings

163
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:05,220
and just add a second set
of fangs as my extreme ability.

164
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,022
So, if this thing were to wrap
around a person,

165
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:10,792
it can kind of get them
also right here.

166
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:14,429
My character, Yara-Ma-Yha-Who,
is a vampire creature

167
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:16,665
from the Aboriginals
of Australia.

168
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:17,932
And he has no teeth.

169
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,534
His teeth to suck blood

170
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:21,202
are in the ends of the fingers.

171
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:23,872
And it has a very large head
and a big mouth,

172
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:25,507
red skin and lots of hair.

173
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:29,277
And then his extreme ability
is gonna be stingers

174
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:31,579
that come out from the back
to grab the victim.

175
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:41,156
I got Jiang Shi,
which is a Chinese version

176
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,791
of the vampire.

177
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:46,161
It's actually
more like a reanimated zombie.

178
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:48,263
This fungus plant has taken
over his body,

179
00:07:48,297 --> 00:07:49,964
and vines shoot out
from his palms

180
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:50,965
to grab his victims.

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,267
But instead of sucking blood,

182
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:53,802
he absorbs the person's chi,

183
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:55,537
or life force,
through his chest.

184
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:59,074
His extreme ability is gonna be
a Venus flytrap mouth

185
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,241
on his chest.

186
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,844
That's where the chi enters
his body.

187
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,985
Aswang is a vampire
from the Philippine folklore

188
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,923
that can change itself
into different shapes.

189
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:16,991
In the day,
she's a beautiful woman.

190
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,461
And in the night,
she becomes this vampire

191
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:22,664
with a giant tongue
for sucking blood.

192
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:24,499
But I'm having a lot of trouble

193
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,569
coming up with an extreme
ability to incorporate.

194
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:29,104
Hopefully, I can figure
something out.

195
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:32,340
All right, guys,
let's head back to the lab.

196
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:41,116
Back.

197
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,317
We get back to the lab,

198
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:45,019
and we have six hours
to work on our vampires.

199
00:08:45,054 --> 00:08:47,288
The first thing I have
to figure out is the face.

200
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:49,524
Australian folklore says
that Yara-Ma-Yha-Who

201
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,293
has a very big mouth
without teeth

202
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:53,828
and that,
after he sucks the blood

203
00:08:53,863 --> 00:08:54,929
through his fingers,

204
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:56,664
he swallows his victims whole.

205
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,168
So I'm definitely gonna go
with a gigantic jaw.

206
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,036
That's cool.

207
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:10,445
My face sculpture is coming
along really good.

208
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,947
But I still don't know
what to do

209
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:16,351
for the extreme ability
of my vampire.

210
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:17,886
As soon as I think of that,

211
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,255
I'm gonna incorporate it
into my design.

212
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,691
Right now I just want to focus
on having a really good piece.

213
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:32,433
I really want to get my face
done by the end of the day,

214
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,636
so I can be running foam.

215
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,105
Then I can just finish
doing my cowl,

216
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,440
do all the last-minute details
tomorrow.

217
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:46,314
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Hello.

218
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:47,882
- We're here for a walk-through.
- Hey, how are you?

219
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,384
Hi.

220
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:50,985
My vampire is Aswang.

221
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,587
He's from the Philippines.

222
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:54,022
And he has a big tongue.

223
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:55,390
The tongue is gonna be
on the chin.

224
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:56,791
Are you making
a second piece that's gonna--

225
00:09:56,826 --> 00:09:57,792
Yes, I'm gonna make
a second piece.

226
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:58,993
Okay.

227
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:00,562
This is all gonna be
inside of the mouth,

228
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:03,031
and the tongue is just gonna
be right here.

229
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:04,165
I think it's a good idea.

230
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,100
What are you gonna do
for your extreme?

231
00:10:06,135 --> 00:10:07,468
What are you gonna add
to this that isn't

232
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,838
in your description?

233
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:12,574
Um, well, I was thinking that

234
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:15,243
maybe he can survive underwater
or something like that.

235
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,344
Those are words.

236
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:18,947
I mean something that maybe
is visual.

237
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:20,515
At this point, I'm confused

238
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,951
about what extreme ability
to incorporate.

239
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:24,485
You're supposed to add
an element to it

240
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,956
that isn't in the description
that adds to your vampire.

241
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,091
I don't know what to do,
and I'm really worried,

242
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,493
because if I don't have
this extreme ability,

243
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:35,096
I'm not gonna make it
to the finale.

244
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,334
Coming up...

245
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:43,338
All of the sudden, I realize
I made a big mistake.

246
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,006
What the fuck?

247
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,808
I don't think
that I can use this piece.

248
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:48,643
He just looks so menacing.

249
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:51,679
It could be responsible
for sending you home.

250
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,535
You're supposed to add
an element to it

251
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:03,704
that isn't in the description
that adds to your vampire.

252
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,840
It is day one
of the vampire challenge,

253
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,241
and Mr. Westmore tells me

254
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:09,877
that my concept needs to have
this extreme ability.

255
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:11,646
I still don't know
how I'm gonna figure it out.

256
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,314
But I need to do it fast,

257
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:15,516
because it has to be part
of my design.

258
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:16,517
- Good luck.
- Okay.

259
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,052
- And you think of that.
- All right.

260
00:11:18,087 --> 00:11:19,353
- Good luck, Niko.
- Thank you.

261
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,757
I got the Jiang Shi--
vampire from China.

262
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,358
He's more like a zombie.

263
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,494
When he died,
the plants around him

264
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,996
grew into him
and made him alive.

265
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,132
In your drawing,
you're seeing a lot of neck.

266
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,567
Are you gonna have
a lot of neck showing?

267
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:33,568
Oh, yeah.

268
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:35,036
So you can take your sculpture,

269
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,071
and you come all the way
out here like that.

270
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:38,673
- Hmm.
- You cover all this up.

271
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:40,007
And you've got
so much wrinkling going on.

272
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,943
I would say just take
and stretch

273
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:43,744
- and stipple the mouth...
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:46,080
...and pull those eyelids
and stretch and stipple those.

275
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:47,281
Otherwise, you're still
gonna have

276
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:48,850
a young person
underneath there.

277
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:50,184
Unless you have thought
of that already.

278
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:51,953
No, I didn't even think
of that, but thank you.

279
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,423
I got Yara-Ma-Yha-Who.

280
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,693
He's a vampire from
the Aboriginals from Australia.

281
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:01,262
He sucks the blood
with his finger.

282
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:04,599
He has a very big head,
and he's all red, like a demon.

283
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,334
The skin tone needs
to be mottled red,

284
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:07,535
not just one tone.

285
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:09,137
It means you're gonna have
to get in there

286
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:10,138
- with the airbrush...
- Airbrush.

287
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:11,539
...maybe even do
some spattering.

288
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:12,940
- Oh, yeah, that's cool.
- You know, if you have time.

289
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,041
For sure.
I'll experiment with that.

290
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:15,042
- Good luck.
- Awesome.

291
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:16,377
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck.

292
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:17,712
Thank you, McKenzie.

293
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:18,946
Okay, remind us what
you've got on your stake.

294
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:19,947
Sasabonsam.

295
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:21,315
- Where is it from?
- Africa.

296
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,018
The wings are, like, 20 feet
long in their description.

297
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:25,019
And I'm like, "Oh, boy."

298
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:26,587
And they have little mini arms.

299
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,056
Okay, now, what are you adding
as the extreme ability?

300
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,425
The fangs
at the tip of the wings.

301
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,560
Someone comes--
chh!

302
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,195
And that's
what sucks the blood?

303
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,363
Yeah.

304
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:37,365
So how are you going to melt
that into this?

305
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,567
I love doing a lot of things
with textures and wrinkles.

306
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:41,802
And I want this to have
a leathery-skin feel.

307
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:43,437
So I'm thinking
of a dark skin tone

308
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,839
with definitely
a lot of speckling

309
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,140
- of other colors.
- Mm-hmm.

310
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:47,775
You got to be careful
with that,

311
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,778
because you're gonna lose
all your detail.

312
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,213
- Okay.
- You can make it tan.

313
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:54,415
But if you go too dark,
you can't go back...

314
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:55,750
- Okay.
- ...because you're not gonna see

315
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:58,452
all this wonderful sculpting
that you've done.

316
00:12:58,487 --> 00:12:59,921
All right, gentlemen,
we are heading out.

317
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,856
- But it's looking really good.
- Good luck.

318
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,857
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

319
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,026
- Bye.
- Bye.

320
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:11,699
Almost ready to mold this puppy.

321
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:22,643
My goal for today is to finish
this face piece,

322
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,045
because I have to mold it,

323
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,981
but I have to also make
a snap mold of the sculpture

324
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,216
on this area.

325
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,850
Niko.
Here comes Niko.

326
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,252
Finally.

327
00:13:31,286 --> 00:13:32,954
- Two hours, I think--
- Yeah, two hours.

328
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:35,690
So a snap mold is a replica
of a specific area

329
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:37,325
that you want to sculpt.

330
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,594
So I can have just
a separate piece of the lip.

331
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:41,762
So, as soon as it's done,

332
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:44,332
I take it
and pour some plaster on it.

333
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,834
After it's ready,
I take it out.

334
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,704
And now I have a replica
of the mouth piece.

335
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:50,705
I think it will work.

336
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,940
♪ bum, bum, bum, bu-- ♪

337
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:54,809
Nice.

338
00:13:54,843 --> 00:13:57,445
- Good job, buddy,
- Thank you.

339
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,452
Now that I have my face
molded, ready for foam,

340
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:05,820
I start blocking out my chest.

341
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:08,189
The Chinese legend states
that Jiang Shi

342
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,025
has fungus all over his body
and doesn't drink blood.

343
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,693
He absorbs the person's chi.

344
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:15,830
So I decided to incorporate
a Venus flytrap mouth

345
00:14:15,864 --> 00:14:18,065
on his chest
for his extreme ability.

346
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,270
It has big teeth and can open
really wide to engulf the chi.

347
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,538
- Rashaad, what time?
- You got 19 minutes.

348
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:30,411
What's going on, man?

349
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:33,247
That's time, guys.
Let's go.

350
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:34,382
So, at the end of day one,

351
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,684
I got my face molded
and ready for foam.

352
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:39,687
Tomorrow I have to do the cowl
and the extreme ability,

353
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,422
which are
the vampire's stingers,

354
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,924
bone protrusions that grab
the victims.

355
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,960
I also have to make
the fingers,

356
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:47,795
which I don't know yet
how I'm gonna do.

357
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,297
Ow!

358
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:50,464
It's a lot to do.

359
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:54,869
And the stakes
are humongously high.

360
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,347
Whoosh!

361
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:08,449
So it's day two
for our vampire challenge.

362
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:11,519
- We have 9 1/2 hours today.
- Back to work.

363
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:14,188
The first thing I do
is go to the mold room

364
00:15:14,222 --> 00:15:16,324
and start opening my face mold.

365
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:18,125
It actually opened really fast.

366
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,660
So I started cleaning
out the clay

367
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:22,196
to get it ready for foam.

368
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,565
This challenge is pushing us
out of our comfort zones

369
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,034
because our vampires
have specific traits

370
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:28,769
from different parts
of the world.

371
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,838
Plus, we have to create
some kind of extreme ability

372
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:32,306
for these vampires.

373
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:35,009
And it's very interesting to me
how we interpret this stuff.

374
00:15:38,714 --> 00:15:41,048
I still have to sculpt
the tongue.

375
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,750
I want it to look perfect

376
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:44,752
because it's the main feature
of my vampire.

377
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:46,787
It doesn't look that bad.

378
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,457
Yeah, that looks cool.
Make it more pointy.

379
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,891
- More pointy?
- Yeah.

380
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:53,694
I want it to look as creepy
and realistic as possible.

381
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,263
We're almost down
to the finale,

382
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,733
and I want to make sure
that I can go to that finale.

383
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,034
Nice.

384
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:02,837
I'm making it a little bit
more pointy.

385
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:06,207
I really got to finish
sculpting

386
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,008
my vampire's upper-body suit,

387
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:10,945
because it's gonna be
a very big mold.

388
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:13,581
The stress is extreme.

389
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:15,583
I have a lot
of detail to cover.

390
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:18,519
Most importantly, I still have
to make these huge wings.

391
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:21,422
They're not only essential
to the Sasabonsam legend,

392
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,758
the extreme ability
is a second set of fangs

393
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:24,992
on the wings.

394
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,495
So I need to mold this
as fast as I can.

395
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,163
Sweet, dude.

396
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,664
What do you think of mine?

397
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,032
It looks, like, puppy--

398
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:34,668
Tell me the truth, please.

399
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,770
Ooh, I love that.

400
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,539
- I'm so getting bat out of it.
- Yeah?

401
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:39,540
- Yeah.
- Okay.

402
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:42,076
- That's cool.
- Thanks.

403
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,084
So I'm busy working on my cowl,

404
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:52,987
when I finally notice
my face prosthetic.

405
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:56,323
What the fuck?

406
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:57,691
Damn.

407
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,327
My face has, like,
a huge tear in it.

408
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,829
Come on.

409
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:04,732
Look at that.

410
00:17:04,766 --> 00:17:07,168
It has a tear in the corner
of the mouth.

411
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:09,503
Two huge tears in it.

412
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:10,718
And a tear by the eye.

413
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,209
_

414
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:13,374
I'm frustrated.

415
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,109
My paint job is gonna be
what sells it.

416
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:16,844
Now there's less time to paint.

417
00:17:16,878 --> 00:17:20,881
So I need to figure out
what I'm gonna do and quickly.

418
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,248
Two huge tears in it.

419
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,250
It's day two
of our vampire challenge.

420
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,153
And my foam has a tear
in the corner of the mouth

421
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,622
and also a tear by the eye,
going towards the nose.

422
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,357
Can you fix that, Rashaad?

423
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,259
I'm gonna run it again,
but I'm gonna keep that one.

424
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,528
- I'm just mad it came out ripped.
- Yeah, I know.

425
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,796
I'm running my face again.

426
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,798
But just in case
it doesn't come out better,

427
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,332
I'm gonna patch this one.

428
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,901
So a lot of work.

429
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,836
But it means everything
to get to the finale.

430
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,871
Everything has to be perfect.

431
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,280
My Aswang is a vampire

432
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,315
that is from
the Philippine folklore.

433
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,119
And I decided to place two claws
on the tip of the ears,

434
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:09,488
maybe to make it
a little bit more original.

435
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,323
And I also decided to use
the claws

436
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:13,792
as a type of horns or hair.

437
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,762
And then it just goes
all the way down to the spine.

438
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,097
- It's cool, man.
- Really?

439
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,932
Yeah.
It's a good start.

440
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,234
I finally came up
with an extreme ability--

441
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,503
a tail that has fangs.

442
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,639
That's the way my vampire,
Aswang, feeds off his victims.

443
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,542
I hope I can impress
our guest judge, Len Wiseman.

444
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,350
My vampire's mold has probably
well over 200 pounds of clay,

445
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,052
and that weighs more than I do.

446
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,221
So, at this point,
the mold is so big,

447
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:43,322
it's taking too long.

448
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:45,224
Unfortunately,
I just don't think

449
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,825
I'm gonna have time to do
these big wings.

450
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,227
And that kind of sucks,

451
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,462
because that's a big part
of my design.

452
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,299
Hey, Niko,
what do you think of this?

453
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,001
My vampire sucks the blood

454
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,704
of his victims
through the fingers.

455
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,939
So I find these foam tubes.
They're hollow.

456
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,474
So I can fit the finger inside.

457
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:05,077
- It will be like a tentacle.
- And you don't have to...

458
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:08,013
Sculpt the whole thing.

459
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,717
I'm gonna shape them out.

460
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,020
And I'm putting some tissue
and latex on them,

461
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,857
so it looks kind
of textured and organic.

462
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,694
My cowl is molded.
My chest is molded.

463
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,496
And I mold this hand piece,

464
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,998
which looks like a little mouth

465
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,567
where vines shoot out
from the vampire's palm

466
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,835
to grab his victim,

467
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,370
so their chi can be absorbed.

468
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,872
And I think it's looking good.

469
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,277
I don't know what to do,

470
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,579
because
the 20-foot wingspan

471
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,848
is the most distinctive
characteristic

472
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,449
in the Sasabonsam legend.

473
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,518
It has to be part of my makeup.

474
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,521
So I find these spandex gloves,

475
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:51,790
and I put them
on mannequin arms.

476
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,560
I'm thinking, "All right,
what if I create the illusion

477
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:58,030
that this thing has big wings
that are just all folded up?"

478
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,702
All right, everybody,
that's time. Brushes down.

479
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,804
Unfortunately, I have
no choice-- I have to go with it.

480
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,307
I'm still bummed that
I can't complete these wings

481
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,775
exactly how I wanted them.

482
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,311
But I just really got to focus
on detailing tomorrow

483
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,848
because it's gonna be
a very big application day.

484
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,857
Another day.

485
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,325
We're feeling it at this point.

486
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,094
We're all exhausted.
I think we all pushed ourselves.

487
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:32,164
- Come on, Georgie.
- Coming.

488
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,799
All of our designs
are so strong.

489
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,968
And most importantly,
they're all different.

490
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,270
- What a day, man.
- What a day.

491
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,538
We're doing things

492
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,108
that usually take a team
of people to do.

493
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,611
And I really want to make it
to the end.

494
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:49,481
It's just that, mentally,
it's very, very exhausting.

495
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,417
Oh, my God, I was, like,
running around all the time.

496
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:54,553
I have a lot of pieces
to apply tomorrow.

497
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,389
The face, did the cowl,
did the tongue.

498
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,325
There's some pressure,
because this is it.

499
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,760
With this, the judges
decide if you're gonna be

500
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,161
on the finals or not.

501
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,863
And you, you did that big mold.

502
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,064
I can't wait to put it
together tomorrow.

503
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,232
Oh, yeah.
That's the best part.

504
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,867
You got all of these
little pieces.

505
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,569
And you're just excited
to see what they look like

506
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,437
all together,
then you're like, "Oh, crap."

507
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,472
Yeah.

508
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,907
The four of us--

509
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,341
we become brothers here, man.

510
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,811
Knowing that tomorrow
we're losing one of us,

511
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,847
it hurts a lot.

512
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,426
- Let's see what we got.
- Let's do this.

513
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,827
It's application day.

514
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,330
We got four hours in the lab
and one hour in last looks.

515
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,899
- Tyler, it didn't rip this time.
- Yay.

516
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:43,435
My new vampire face
is amazing-- no splits.

517
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,771
It's the right thickness.
It just looks great.

518
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,472
Nice.

519
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:50,375
But I start to get worried
because there's so many pieces.

520
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,577
I just hope I have the time
to apply it all.

521
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,316
How are you?

522
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,484
The teeth are gonna be
in the fingers.

523
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,053
So these things go
on your fingers.

524
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,487
You're gonna have
a couple appliances.

525
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,022
This is, like, the face piece.

526
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,958
And it's gonna have
this big tongue.

527
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,359
We have a lot
of work ahead of us.

528
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:08,360
Yes.

529
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,995
So the models arrive.

530
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,864
And the first thing that I start
applying is the tongue.

531
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,967
I put a strap with a velcro

532
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,102
and put the cowl
on top of that.

533
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,004
So it can all hold it together.

534
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:21,213
There you go.

535
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,245
So, immediately, I have to get

536
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,681
this creature suit
off this mannequin

537
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,450
and apply it to my model.

538
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,385
I start putting the pieces on.

539
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,521
And it's coming together
really, really well.

540
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,730
So, finally,
I get all my pieces applied.

541
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,432
But I got to make sure that
I have time to paint everything,

542
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,368
because I basically have to do
a whole-body paint.

543
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,569
Turn around.

544
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,904
I'm using different
techniques of modeling,

545
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,674
speckling--
blue, some purple--

546
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,708
to do the whole body.

547
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,710
That was easy enough.

548
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,249
I put the cowl on and the face,
and they're looking great.

549
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm loving it.

550
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,487
I'm painting the whole body red.

551
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:11,390
And all of the sudden,
I realize...

552
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:12,657
I made a big mistake.

553
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,359
Fucking shit, George.

554
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,927
The finger extensions--

555
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,696
one side is very thin.

556
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,930
It can blend to the skin.

557
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:20,966
But I put the nails on
the wrong side.

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,703
So now I have these
huge, thick edges right here,

559
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,438
where it's supposed
to blend to the skin.

560
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:28,807
And it's like, "Oh, my God.
They look stupid."

561
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,575
It's too late to change
anything right now.

562
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,412
So I have to use them like this.

563
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,147
We got 20 minutes, guys.

564
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:38,183
We got 20 minutes left.

565
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,924
All right, guys, it's time.
Brushes down.

566
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,059
I'm looking around.

567
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,127
Everyone's look so different.

568
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,029
And, like, I just feel
so behind

569
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,230
because I have to finish
painting

570
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,233
this massive, huge
creature suit.

571
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:59,037
And some people just have
a face piece and a chest piece.

572
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,643
I honestly bit off a lot
to push me into the finale.

573
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:07,212
I just hope I can finish
this makeup.

574
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,315
Coming up...

575
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,383
Ah, it doesn't matter.
Fuck it.

576
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,617
They look awful.

577
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,119
I don't know if I'm gonna
have time

578
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,487
to finish everything.

579
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,656
You gave us something
that we've never seen before.

580
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,791
- Thank God.
- It looks beautiful.

581
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,793
You've done some really
great things thus far.

582
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,324
But this is not one of them.

583
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,958
Good luck, guys.

584
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:36,096
We get to last looks,
and we have one hour left.

585
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,765
I still need to finish
painting the tail.

586
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,901
And I still need to work
on the inside of the mouth.

587
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:45,505
I don't know if I'm gonna
have time to do everything.

588
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,941
_

589
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:49,009
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

590
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:50,777
I love it.

591
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:52,178
I still have to work on
the hands,

592
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:54,981
get the vines in there,
get the moss on him.

593
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:57,517
Still a lot of work to do,
but I'm feeling very confident

594
00:24:57,551 --> 00:24:58,785
I'm gonna get it done.

595
00:24:58,819 --> 00:24:59,953
Leave that like that.

596
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:02,055
This one goes here.
All right?

597
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:03,890
Ah, it doesn't matter.
Fuck it.

598
00:25:03,924 --> 00:25:06,860
I'm putting the fingers on,
and they look awful.

599
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:09,696
So I'm hoping that I can cover
the seams with hair.

600
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,197
Maybe the judges won't notice.

601
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:13,533
Now let's paint the horns.

602
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:16,803
_

603
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:19,139
All I want to focus on
is last-minute details,

604
00:25:19,173 --> 00:25:21,908
folding the wings up
and positioning my model,

605
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:24,911
so she can give me
that crouched, birdlike feel.

606
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:27,547
Like, neck up, like--
Exactly.

607
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:29,115
I'm worried.

608
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,784
The time is going
really, really fast.

609
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:32,652
So I decide to scrap the wings

610
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:35,789
so I can concentrate
on the mouth and giant tongue.

611
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:37,891
All right, everybody,
we got ten minutes.

612
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:40,026
You can do this.

613
00:25:49,303 --> 00:25:50,270
That's time!

614
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:52,639
What a run.

615
00:25:52,673 --> 00:25:55,241
One of us is not gonna make it
to the finale.

616
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:57,477
So, at this point,
it could be anyone.

617
00:26:08,055 --> 00:26:10,690
Welcome
to the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

618
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:15,228
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

619
00:26:15,262 --> 00:26:17,364
First, say hello
to our talented judges--

620
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:20,633
owner of Optic Nerve Make-Up
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick...

621
00:26:20,668 --> 00:26:22,602
- Good evening, guys.
- Hey, Glenn.

622
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:25,138
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

623
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:28,241
- Hello, chaps.
- Hi, Ve.

624
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:30,910
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page...

625
00:26:30,945 --> 00:26:32,946
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Neville.

626
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,614
And joining our panel tonight

627
00:26:34,648 --> 00:26:38,017
is a highly acclaimed writer,
producer, and director,

628
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:39,419
whose work includes

629
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:42,422
the Bruce Willis action flick
<i>Live Free Or Die Hard</i>

630
00:26:42,456 --> 00:26:45,291
and, of course,
the epic film franchise

631
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:47,961
he helped create--
<i>Underworld.</i>

632
00:26:47,995 --> 00:26:49,996
Please welcome Len Wiseman.

633
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:53,066
Hey, guys.

634
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,502
I'm really looking forward to
seeing what you guys have done.

635
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:56,903
- Cool.
- Awesome.

636
00:26:56,937 --> 00:26:59,205
<i>Underworld</i>is one
of my favorite vampire movies

637
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,573
of all time.

638
00:27:00,608 --> 00:27:02,375
So, if I can impress this guy,

639
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,111
that's another personal
achievement for me.

640
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:06,846
All right, guys, so this week

641
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:10,316
your spotlight challenge
was to select a storied vampire,

642
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:12,318
each from a different part
of the world,

643
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:14,954
and use it as inspiration

644
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:17,090
for your very own
vampiric creations.

645
00:27:17,124 --> 00:27:19,826
So let's take a look
at your bloodsuckers

646
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,161
while the audience at home

647
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:24,798
tweets about their favorites,
using #FaceOff.

648
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:51,090
It looks really creepy
with that big tongue.

649
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,892
I think it's pretty cool.

650
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:15,181
I'm worried.

651
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:17,383
Those fingers look clunky,
like a cheap costume.

652
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:21,321
And they take away from
the presence of the sculpture.

653
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,941
This is one
of my best makeup jobs.

654
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,943
He emotes really well
through it.

655
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:46,980
I'm just excited.

656
00:29:05,733 --> 00:29:08,535
She looks like
some crazy vampire demon,

657
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:10,803
and I really like
how the makeup looks.

658
00:29:18,412 --> 00:29:21,014
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look at our vampires?

659
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:29,722
Wow. This is just,
like, fabricated--

660
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:34,994
- Looks like he's got a goiter.
- It's broken up right there.

661
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:36,796
Yeah.

662
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,598
Can you breathe okay?

663
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:39,699
Mm-hmm.

664
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,134
Oh, oh.
There you are.

665
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:44,437
I wish that the placement
of the implied jaw

666
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,673
felt correct.

667
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:48,274
I couldn't agree with you more.

668
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:50,043
Can we see you from the side?

669
00:29:50,077 --> 00:29:51,411
The head shape's not awful.

670
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:53,346
- I like these things here.
- Yes.

671
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,481
Turn around
a little bit more-- right there.

672
00:29:55,516 --> 00:29:56,516
Like, if they continued down

673
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,051
- a little bit more into here...
- Yeah.

674
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:00,386
So it's not just
the back of his head.

675
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:04,651
Oh, boy.

676
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,793
I'd like to see you emote.

677
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:08,494
Push your forehead.
Wrinkle it.

678
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:12,665
Open your eyes and mouth
as wide as they go.

679
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,200
- That's interesting.
- It is.

680
00:30:14,234 --> 00:30:17,036
I actually think
this is a good touch here,

681
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:18,605
putting a little bit
of hair on there.

682
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:22,041
- Hmm.
- Really?

683
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:24,410
Oh, my God, those fingers.

684
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,746
That looks like
a bad, bad choice.

685
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,981
I may be screwed on this one,

686
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:30,216
just because
of those awful fingers.

687
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:35,088
Who made your favorite vampire?

688
00:30:35,122 --> 00:30:38,858
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

689
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:43,853
Yeah, these hands-- that looks
like a bad, bad choice.

690
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:47,089
I may be screwed on this one,
just because of the fingers.

691
00:30:47,124 --> 00:30:48,891
I bet this was
the last-minute thing here.

692
00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:50,760
The only choice is to just
leave those on the table.

693
00:30:50,794 --> 00:30:52,328
Just take it off.

694
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:54,697
I'm hoping the judges consider
the good sculpture,

695
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,833
and they will ignore
the fingers.

696
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,301
Thank you.

697
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:05,141
The paint's even better
up close than it is far away.

698
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:08,611
Oh, that's cool when you open
your eyes really wide.

699
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:10,279
That's a good-looking face.

700
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:13,216
That hair is hiding a lot
of what's actually there.

701
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,283
Thanks.

702
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:18,487
There's something about this

703
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:21,123
that looks so flat,
in terms of the paint job.

704
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:23,326
If he was on set, I would squirt
him down with a hose.

705
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,361
I really like this thing,

706
00:31:25,395 --> 00:31:27,263
the way that comes out.

707
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:31,133
And then we have this internal
piece of the nose exposed.

708
00:31:31,168 --> 00:31:33,035
- Can you turn around?
- Yeah, turn around for us.

709
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,439
- Oh, my God, he did so much.
- That's a lot.

710
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:39,742
- That's a big mold too.
- Boy, oh, boy.

711
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,310
Nicely painted on the face,
I think.

712
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:43,045
Yeah, the paint job
on the face is great.

713
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,380
Thank you.

714
00:31:49,052 --> 00:31:52,054
So, Len, did they
successfully reenvision

715
00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:53,623
the classic vampire?

716
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:55,391
There was a lot
of very imaginative choices

717
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:56,692
that I wouldn't have expected.

718
00:31:56,727 --> 00:31:59,228
So I'm very interested to see

719
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:01,297
some of the reasons
behind the choices

720
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:03,232
and what that character means
to you guys as well.

721
00:32:04,668 --> 00:32:05,968
Okay.

722
00:32:06,003 --> 00:32:07,970
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

723
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:09,939
to learn more about your work.

724
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,942
Niko, please step up.

725
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:21,851
Tell us about the concept
behind your vampire

726
00:32:21,885 --> 00:32:24,186
and what unique ability
you included.

727
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,889
My vampire is originally
from the Philippines.

728
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:29,525
I wanted to incorporate
the big tongue with poison.

729
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,394
So, if he licks you,
he hurts you.

730
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:33,462
And then he sucks
the blood from the tail.

731
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:36,265
I think there's
so many design opportunities

732
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,234
that you simply missed.

733
00:32:41,104 --> 00:32:43,706
It would've been
more vampy to me

734
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,375
if the teeth protruded
from the upper jaw,

735
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,145
making it a little more scary
and intimidating.

736
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:51,714
Man, is that nasty.

737
00:32:51,748 --> 00:32:54,917
I do appreciate the fact
that you took the chance

738
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:56,619
on making that big,
giant tongue.

739
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:58,788
You gave us something

740
00:32:58,822 --> 00:33:01,390
that we've really never
seen before. Thank God.

741
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:03,392
I still don't get the tail,

742
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:04,994
because that is not
a special ability, really.

743
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:07,563
It's just an added appendage.

744
00:33:07,597 --> 00:33:09,632
I don't think I can address
any other choice

745
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:11,100
that you made
beyond the tongue.

746
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:13,569
My concern is the way
you've sculpted it.

747
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:15,404
It's just this flaccid tongue.

748
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:18,274
So it doesn't look menacing
or scary.

749
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:21,677
It's a very, very loose sketch
of a good idea.

750
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:23,346
Okay.
Yeah.

751
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,514
The vampire quality
in being a vampire theme

752
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:26,682
wasn't immediate.

753
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:28,551
I think it looks like
an evil clown.

754
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:30,252
The red, the tongue

755
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,355
has a little bit
of a comedic element to it.

756
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:33,889
But I will say that the story

757
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:36,025
behind the design of it
I do really like.

758
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,627
- Thank you.
- Niko, please step back.

759
00:33:38,662 --> 00:33:41,130
Thank you, guys.

760
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:47,269
Rashaad, please step forward.

761
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:56,178
Tell us about your vampire

762
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:59,015
and what extra-special ability
this guy has.

763
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:00,883
I got the Jiang Shi.

764
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,285
It's a Chinese version
of the vampire.

765
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,821
When he died,
his blood went into the ground

766
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:10,059
to make this vampiric plant
that grew onto him

767
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:11,227
and brought him back to life.

768
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:14,096
He has these vines
that come out

769
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:16,132
of his palms to grab
his victims.

770
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:19,101
I really like this guy.

771
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:20,903
I love the paint job on him.

772
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:23,339
He just looks
so menacing and creepy.

773
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,607
I do wish, however,

774
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:25,941
you would've, like,
kind of ratted up

775
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,109
his hair a little bit.

776
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:29,345
But I think you did
a really nice job.

777
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:30,746
He's really cool-looking.

778
00:34:30,781 --> 00:34:32,581
Thank you.

779
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:34,383
The face is so well crafted.

780
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:38,220
And your actor is able
to emote through it,

781
00:34:38,255 --> 00:34:39,255
which is great.

782
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:40,389
Hate the palms.

783
00:34:40,424 --> 00:34:41,891
The way you executed that

784
00:34:41,925 --> 00:34:44,326
is counter to how
you executed the face.

785
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:47,663
If this character was
to step on set,

786
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,331
I'd say the makeup's done.

787
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:51,100
The face is really scary.

788
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:53,903
- And the color design is great.
- Thank you.

789
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:56,372
I think this is incredibly
visually articulate,

790
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:59,141
in that it conveys not only what
the character's supposed to be,

791
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:01,343
but also
the cultural reference.

792
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:03,646
I do wish that we could see
the ears a bit more.

793
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,816
It's the most vampy aspect
of the whole thing.

794
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,050
Look at that.

795
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:09,785
I mean, that's a huge
improvement right there.

796
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,155
You also managed to make sure
that your paint job

797
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,690
is accentuating your sculpture.

798
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:16,625
And you leave a lot
of light surfaces

799
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,095
for us to just see
the highlight and the form.

800
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:20,996
And then where
you do put color,

801
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:22,431
you didn't go overboard
with it.

802
00:35:22,466 --> 00:35:25,468
- Thank you.
- Rashaad, step back.

803
00:35:25,502 --> 00:35:28,671
Thanks.

804
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:30,039
Great job, brother.

805
00:35:30,073 --> 00:35:32,441
Thank you.

806
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:34,510
Tyler, please step
to the center.

807
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:44,420
Tell us about your concept
and the unique ability.

808
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:46,789
Well, this is
the Sasabonsam of Ghana.

809
00:35:46,823 --> 00:35:48,224
I made the short, little arms

810
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:50,759
and used her natural arms
as the wings.

811
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:53,462
His special ability is fangs
on the end of his wings,

812
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,931
and that's what he uses
to grab his victims in.

813
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:57,533
My biggest bone of contention

814
00:35:57,567 --> 00:36:02,171
is how you're sculpting
the anatomy.

815
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:07,042
From basically the necklace
down to the waist,

816
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:11,347
it's just so active and busy
with folds of skin

817
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:13,983
and shapes
that don't make much sense.

818
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:17,553
It's really visually muddy.

819
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:19,855
It feels like a costume

820
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,525
that is three sizes too big
for the subject.

821
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,093
The head, there's something
about the horns.

822
00:36:24,127 --> 00:36:26,896
Because they are sculpted
into it,

823
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,598
it reads almost as a hairdo
rather than horns.

824
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:31,133
Okay.
Thank you.

825
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:33,469
My main focus is
the proportion.

826
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:35,137
It doesn't look like
the top half of this body

827
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:36,972
goes with
the bottom half at all.

828
00:36:37,007 --> 00:36:38,641
You put all of your time
and effort

829
00:36:38,675 --> 00:36:40,009
in the paint job into his face.

830
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:41,777
That was really well done.

831
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:43,479
Unfortunately, you didn't have
quite enough time

832
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:45,080
to do that to the entire body.

833
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,316
So he looks like
a big, brown tree trunk.

834
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,218
You definitely did
a massive amount of work.

835
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:50,419
I get that.

836
00:36:50,453 --> 00:36:52,087
The sculpt has to be rough.

837
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:54,823
That's necessitated by
the amount of time that you had,

838
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:56,525
but you could've saved it
with paint.

839
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,028
You've done some really
great things thus far.

840
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:00,563
This is definitely
not one of them.

841
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:04,600
It could be responsible
for sending you home.

842
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:06,635
Tyler, thank you.
You can head back.

843
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,404
Thank you.

844
00:37:13,777 --> 00:37:16,145
George, you're up next.

845
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:20,683
Hey, buddy.

846
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:22,618
- Hello, George.
- Hi.

847
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:24,253
Tell us the story
behind your character.

848
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:26,855
The name of the vampire is
Yara-Ma-Yha-Who.

849
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,291
He's originally from Australia.

850
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:31,360
He feeds through these guys.

851
00:37:31,394 --> 00:37:34,496
He stabs the victim and sucks
the blood through the holes.

852
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:38,667
From a director's perspective,
it has a menacing presence.

853
00:37:38,702 --> 00:37:41,070
The face looks real.
It looks like a creature.

854
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:43,205
It doesn't look like a man
with prosthetics on.

855
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,306
Really, really great job.

856
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:45,741
Thank you.

857
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:47,443
I think the head
is absolutely gorgeous,

858
00:37:47,477 --> 00:37:50,312
but you've surrounded it

859
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:52,047
with a buffet
of bad decisions, man.

860
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,984
Like, you couldn't take
a prettier sculpture

861
00:37:55,018 --> 00:37:57,586
and then make more piss-poor
choices to present it with.

862
00:37:57,621 --> 00:38:00,856
I think this guy is terrific,
but the fingers...

863
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,625
- Yeah, I know.
- They really do suck.

864
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,395
I want to see what this thing
looks like without that sash.

865
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:08,964
Look how bitchin'
this thing is!

866
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:11,634
Oh, dude, take the fingers off.

867
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,636
Hurry up. Hurry.
Let's do it.

868
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,938
This is so beautiful.

869
00:38:15,972 --> 00:38:17,840
Why cover it up?

870
00:38:17,874 --> 00:38:19,108
Put that in the trash.

871
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:21,710
I will, absolutely.

872
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,879
It looks beautiful.
It's fantastic.

873
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:26,882
You create elegant lines

874
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,717
within something
that is beastly.

875
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:31,520
This is a very beautiful
character.

876
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:33,522
Thank you.
Thank you, Neville.

877
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:34,790
George, please step back.

878
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:44,733
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

879
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:45,901
If you would please head

880
00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:47,503
back to the makeup room
while they deliberate.

881
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:48,504
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

882
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:50,339
Thank you, guys.

883
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:57,980
All right, judges, let's talk
about tonight's looks.

884
00:38:58,014 --> 00:38:59,214
Why don't we start
with Rashaad?

885
00:38:59,249 --> 00:39:01,583
It's so well crafted,

886
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:03,152
both from
a sculptural standpoint

887
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:05,120
and, I think, also
from a paint standpoint.

888
00:39:05,155 --> 00:39:06,689
There's so much work
and detail.

889
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:08,190
It does have
that Asian influence,

890
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:09,625
and you recognize that.

891
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:12,594
I especially love the way
the neck flowed from the ears.

892
00:39:12,629 --> 00:39:14,363
I love the charcoal
around the eyes

893
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:16,398
and all the little bits
around the nose.

894
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,701
In that paint job,
there's so many great details.

895
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:21,003
And to do it that fast
is quite astounding.

896
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:22,705
All right,
let's move on to George.

897
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:25,741
I loved how regal
this thing was,

898
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:27,609
keeping everything sucked in.

899
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:30,412
And then just making the face
as majestic as he did

900
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:32,181
it was very, very intelligent.

901
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:33,916
The color palette
is so different,

902
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,186
but it reads as a vampire,
and it looks real.

903
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,320
I think he was concerned

904
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,089
about getting the suckers
on the fingers

905
00:39:40,123 --> 00:39:43,192
because this particular vampire
does not have fangs.

906
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:45,627
I still think he could've done
it in a much smaller way.

907
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:47,529
He didn't need to use
those big fingers.

908
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:49,665
All right, judges,
let's move on to Niko.

909
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:51,233
The tongue's very distracting.

910
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,568
It makes it comedic.

911
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:53,902
It looked like he got punched
in the face,

912
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:55,871
and his tongue
just sort of fell out.

913
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:59,842
I do think it was an extremely
appropriate color decision.

914
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:02,544
But this paint job
was really sloppy.

915
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,847
Yeah, it was just
a spattery mess.

916
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:06,849
Okay, let's move on to Tyler.

917
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:08,684
Wow. I don't know
what the heck

918
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:10,185
he was thinking
about this week.

919
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,787
That thing is dreadful.

920
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:13,622
It looked like a tree trunk
stuck on top

921
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:14,990
of a little person's body.

922
00:40:15,024 --> 00:40:18,127
It got so complex
in the midsection.

923
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:19,328
His torso looked like

924
00:40:19,362 --> 00:40:21,463
it was spray-painted brown.
It looked flat.

925
00:40:21,498 --> 00:40:24,767
I wish the detail on the back
existed in the front.

926
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:26,902
You go to the back,
and he knows what he's doing.

927
00:40:26,936 --> 00:40:29,171
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

928
00:40:29,205 --> 00:40:30,439
Yes, we have.

929
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:32,608
Let's bring them back out.

930
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:42,451
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

931
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,852
Rashaad,

932
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:45,854
we loved the sculpting

933
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:47,523
and the movement of the face.

934
00:40:47,557 --> 00:40:49,625
And your color choices
and paint

935
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,727
did a great job
showcasing that.

936
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:55,297
George, there were some
brilliant sculptural decisions

937
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:57,466
in your character's face
and head.

938
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,068
That made
for a very convincing character.

939
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:02,704
So, Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

940
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,706
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

941
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:13,822
So, Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

942
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:16,358
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

943
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:22,431
Rashaad.

944
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:26,935
You did a great job
melding disparate elements,

945
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:29,404
from hallmark
vampire characteristics

946
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:31,640
to traditional zombie ideas.

947
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:33,675
Well done, man.
Congratulations.

948
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,343
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

949
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:37,612
Second win,
and I'm just stoked.

950
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:40,549
I'm shocked.
I can't stop smiling.

951
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,950
I'm just very excited.

952
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:44,586
Finally, they're recognizing
my talents.

953
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,389
- Rashaad, congratulations.
- Thank you.

954
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:49,791
Now this is where
I would normally send you

955
00:41:49,826 --> 00:41:51,293
and George back
to the makeup room.

956
00:41:51,327 --> 00:41:55,230
But I can't do that tonight.

957
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:57,599
I'm completely bewildered
at this point.

958
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:01,503
Like, "Oh, my God.
Am I going home?"

959
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:03,405
We're about to do something

960
00:42:03,439 --> 00:42:06,541
that we have never done before.

961
00:42:06,576 --> 00:42:08,643
This is actually
a two-part challenge.

962
00:42:08,678 --> 00:42:11,580
And the second half starts
right now.

963
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:13,215
Okay.

964
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:14,683
This means no one
is going home tonight.

965
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:17,686
Oh, my gosh!
Second chance!

966
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,754
Holy cow!

967
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:19,955
Now I'm really excited

968
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:22,057
that I have one more chance
to prove myself.

969
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:23,558
So I just want to know
what the other part

970
00:42:23,593 --> 00:42:24,593
of the challenge is.

971
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:26,361
Next week the judges
will be putting

972
00:42:26,395 --> 00:42:27,929
three of you through
to the finale

973
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:29,931
based on both characters
that you have created

974
00:42:29,966 --> 00:42:31,933
for this two-part challenge.

975
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:34,002
This is very nerve-racking.

976
00:42:34,036 --> 00:42:35,871
Even though I did well
in the vampire,

977
00:42:35,905 --> 00:42:37,672
the next creature
we're gonna make

978
00:42:37,707 --> 00:42:38,840
could send me home.

979
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,842
I have a van waiting outside
to take you

980
00:42:40,877 --> 00:42:44,179
to meet a special guest
and find out what's next.

981
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,614
I don't know what we have
in store,

982
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:47,916
but I want to make sure
that I do everything I have to

983
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,351
to make it to the finale.

984
00:42:49,385 --> 00:42:51,253
There's no point
in going home now.

985
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:53,054
Thank you, guys.
See you.

986
00:42:53,089 --> 00:42:54,456
Bye.

987
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,725
What's happening?
