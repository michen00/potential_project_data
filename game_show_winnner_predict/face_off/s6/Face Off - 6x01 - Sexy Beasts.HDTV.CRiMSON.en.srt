1
00:00:15,877 --> 00:00:20,276
Face Off is back
and more extreme than ever.

2
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,943
This season the artists
will face bold new challenges.

3
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:27,647
This will be a season
of extremes.

4
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:31,214
How can it get
any more bold and extreme

5
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,447
than it has been?

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,045
I have another surprise
for you.

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,711
And their quest to become
the next great name

8
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,246
in movie magic will take them

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,379
to the far reaches
of the globe.

10
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:41,746
I'm taking you all to Japan.

11
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:44,214
What?

12
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,214
Are you kidding me?

13
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:47,648
In this
no-holds-barred season,

14
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,149
artists will bare their souls

15
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,717
and push themselves
to the breaking point.

16
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,485
I have really messed up.

17
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,652
Coached by makeup effects
legend Michael Westmore,

18
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:57,919
they'll work
through creative obstacles

19
00:00:57,954 --> 00:00:59,553
and impossible deadlines.

20
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:01,321
- Oh, my God.
- But ultimately,

21
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:03,022
their fate will rest
with our award-winning panel

22
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,290
of judges.

23
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:06,590
In the end, only one will win

24
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,092
a VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Makeup

25
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:12,294
to one of their 85
international locations,

26
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:15,329
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

27
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:19,130
and $100,000.

28
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:21,130
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

29
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,931
Face Off!

30
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,367
Welcome to Face Off.

31
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,285
Sync and corrections by n17t01

32
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,374
My name is George.

33
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:15,941
I'm from Puerto Rico
originally,

34
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:18,043
and I have my own company.

35
00:02:18,077 --> 00:02:19,043
I'm gonna be a father.

36
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:20,745
So, if I win Face Off,

37
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:23,347
that money's gonna be for her.

38
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:24,748
- Hi.
- Hey.

39
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:28,084
My name is Chloe.
I enjoy doing fantasy work.

40
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:30,220
Being a woman
in special effects makeup,

41
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:32,356
I really have to prove myself
every time.

42
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:33,291
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey!

43
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,125
My name is Tyler Green,

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,094
and I just quit my job
as a dental lab technician.

45
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,528
So I'm taking a huge risk,

46
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:41,731
and I'm gonna really push myself
to make it to the end.

47
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,802
- Wow.
- As soon as I walk in,

48
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:50,838
I see this huge runway,

49
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,139
and I'm thinking,
"Here we go."

50
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:55,075
This is crazy.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,677
I'm Rashaad.

52
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,412
Right now I can only work
on special effects part-time

53
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:03,115
because I'm trying to support
my fiancee and my son

54
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,850
by working
at a fast-food restaurant.

55
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,853
So winning Face Off would
definitely change our lives.

56
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,555
Dan Phillips.

57
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:11,956
I'm from Detroit, Michigan,
and I own

58
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,824
a special makeup effects
studio.

59
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,192
And I've been very fortunate
to work

60
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:16,727
on some really good projects.

61
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:19,863
Hopefully, being a little
older and experienced

62
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:22,333
will really help
in this competition.

63
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,335
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi.

64
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,103
- I'm Dan.
- Hi, Dan. I'm Cat.

65
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:28,005
My dad was very disappointed
when I told him

66
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,406
that I didn't want to go
to law school

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,541
and was even more disappointed
when I said,

68
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,242
"Hey, I'm gonna go
to makeup school instead."

69
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:35,378
Winning Face Off
would definitely show him

70
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,910
that this is
a legitimate career for me.

71
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,484
My name's Matt.

72
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:43,853
I've been working in special
makeup effects professionally

73
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:45,855
since I was 18 years old.

74
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,890
I feel like my drive
and my passion

75
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,026
is gonna give me an edge.

76
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,461
- How's it going? Matt.
- Bethany.

77
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,596
I went to school
for video game design,

78
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,399
and halfway through,
I switched to special effects.

79
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,334
So now, instead of sculpting
on a computer,

80
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:00,836
I'm sculpting in real life.

81
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,305
- Bethany.
- Tanner. Nice to meet you.

82
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,441
I work for a company that
contracts for the military.

83
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:09,145
We make suits to simulate trauma
in the battlefield.

84
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:11,914
Hey, guys.

85
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:13,649
- I'm Cat.
- Hi, Cat. I'm Tess.

86
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:16,018
In Denver, there's not a lot
of opportunities

87
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,553
in special effects,

88
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,421
so I make molds
of mannequin sculptures,

89
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,290
and create the perfect casting

90
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:23,158
so that they can reproduce it
over and over.

91
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:28,195
Whoa.
What's happening?

92
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,400
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my gosh.

93
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:35,204
Whoo!

94
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:37,139
Welcome to Face Off.

95
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:40,509
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

96
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:44,680
Oh, God.
I'm actually doing this.

97
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:48,550
This is going to be
a season of extremes.

98
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:51,453
Now, in addition
to some huge surprises

99
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,021
that we have in store for you,

100
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:54,622
the judges will also be looking

101
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:58,560
for bolder and more extreme
makeups than ever before.

102
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:00,495
My heart drops,
and I'm like, ugh.

103
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,097
How can it get any more bold
an extreme

104
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,765
than it has been?

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,535
So take a look at this.

106
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:07,903
Oh, boy.

107
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:12,908
- Oh, shit.
- Oh.

108
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,346
Wow.

109
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,381
All of these models walk out

110
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:23,085
wearing these huge, weird wigs.

111
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,121
My heart is in my throat.

112
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:27,424
It's very exciting.

113
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,539
All right, for your first
foundation challenge,

114
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,741
you're going to choose
one of these over-the-top wigs

115
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,510
and create an extreme character

116
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:51,479
that represents you
as an artist.

117
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:53,481
The winner
will receive immunity

118
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:56,083
and cannot be eliminated
this week.

119
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:59,419
Immunity in this first
challenge is very important.

120
00:05:59,453 --> 00:06:01,788
Nobody wants to go home first.

121
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:03,690
All right, I brought
a special guest

122
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:06,593
who knows all about creating
incredible characters.

123
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,929
She's an Academy award-winning
makeup artist

124
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:11,264
for her work
in The Chronicles Of Narnia,

125
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,166
The Lion, The Witch,
And The Wardrobe,

126
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:14,535
and was nominated again

127
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,904
for The Hobbit,
An Unexpected Journey.

128
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:19,873
Please welcome Tami Lane.

129
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:22,309
Wow.

130
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:24,044
I'm freaking out immediately
because I'm a fan

131
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,679
of The Hobbit.

132
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:27,013
She did an amazing job.

133
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,148
Thank you so much
for being here.

134
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:30,116
Well, thank you very much
for inviting me.

135
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,217
What advice can you give
these guys

136
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,618
about today's challenge?

137
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:35,087
In order to create
a cohesive character,

138
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:37,524
you have to have good makeup
as well as good hair.

139
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:38,525
They both work together.

140
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,027
You will destroy a character

141
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:41,862
if the makeup is bad
and the hair is great

142
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:43,230
or vice-versa.

143
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:44,932
So I'm looking forward to seeing
how you bring your wigs

144
00:06:44,966 --> 00:06:46,467
into your makeup.

145
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:47,901
Okay.

146
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:51,338
Models, if you'd please
head down.

147
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:53,073
All right, now, on my go,

148
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,409
I want you each to select
a model.

149
00:06:55,443 --> 00:06:58,913
Grab some wardrobe and create
your extreme characters.

150
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:00,648
You have two hours,

151
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:02,716
and your time starts...

152
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,286
now!

153
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,654
- You're with me.
- Okay.

154
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,089
- What's your name?
- Tyler. Nice to meet you.

155
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:10,658
I'm Niko.
I'm from Puerto Rico.

156
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:13,161
I live with my girlfriend, Cat.

157
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:14,362
She's also competing.

158
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:15,563
If either of us win,

159
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,089
it's gonna be great
for the both of us.

160
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,528
_

161
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:21,635
My name is Margaret.

162
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,837
I've been doing special effects
for nine years.

163
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,405
I'm trying to grow a business
out of it in the Bay area.

164
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
If you look at my wig,

165
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:30,009
it's a very haunted
earth goddess.

166
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:32,078
I am starting my prosthetic,

167
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:33,880
and I have an idea
for what I want to do

168
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:35,782
for the colors.

169
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:43,290
I want it, like,
sort of fashion on this side,

170
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:44,724
kind of creepy on this side.

171
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,892
I'm Graham.

172
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:48,562
I'm a freelance
makeup artist/instructor.

173
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:53,233
My concept is this model
tried to transform herself

174
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,302
by drilling holes into her face

175
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:57,304
to resemble
her circular hairdo.

176
00:07:57,338 --> 00:08:00,440
It should represent me
and the fact that I have style,

177
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:02,809
I'm creepy and weird.

178
00:08:06,147 --> 00:08:07,281
My name's Corinne.

179
00:08:07,315 --> 00:08:08,983
I'm a co-owner
of Synapse FX,

180
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,184
and we recently headed
special effects

181
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,453
on Sharknado for SyFy.

182
00:08:13,488 --> 00:08:17,424
She's going to be
a forest witch doctor.

183
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,829
I applied this brow
to give her a unique look.

184
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:25,400
My character is a princess
that lives in a fantasy land.

185
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:27,135
Three weeks before coming here,

186
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:28,569
I fractured my hand.

187
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:31,039
It hurts, but I'll do
whatever it takes to win.

188
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,408
My name is Daran.

189
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:36,009
I'm originally
from Kansas City.

190
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,878
For most of my life,
I've been a regular joe

191
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:39,146
doing regular jobs,
9:00 to 5:00,

192
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,548
but my passion was always makeup
and monsters.

193
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:45,319
Now I make monsters,
and I sell 'em online.

194
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,955
My concept
is a futuristic club girl

195
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:50,657
who's got purple hair
with lights in it.

196
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:53,260
I figured that'd be
pretty bold and extreme.

197
00:08:53,294 --> 00:08:54,662
Ten minutes, everybody!

198
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:57,597
Shit.

199
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,239
_

200
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:07,339
Time's up, everybody!
Brushes down!

201
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:08,807
Phew.

202
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:09,841
- Hi, Bethany.
- Hey.

203
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,243
Tell us
about your makeup today.

204
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:12,978
This was the fairest lady
of the land.

205
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:14,746
One of the suitors
attacked her,

206
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:16,214
and this is the aftermath.

207
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:17,349
- Wow.
- I tried to keep her

208
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,551
still beautiful, yet grotesque.

209
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,819
You've achieved that,

210
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,654
because it's a beautiful makeup
on that side

211
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:23,988
and the contrast on this side.

212
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,123
- Thank you.
- Very nice.

213
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:28,426
I really loved how natural
the wig was,

214
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,128
so I wanted to go
with sorceress.

215
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:33,230
Good use of some
very subtle speckling.

216
00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,266
It's very excellent, simple,
very well applied.

217
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,367
Thank you.

218
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,436
She's a queen,
but she has something

219
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:40,972
inside her body
that is precious.

220
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:43,008
They were trying to make
an incision there.

221
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,509
Well, I love
your color choices.

222
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:45,577
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

223
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:47,079
And it goes very well
with the costume,

224
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:48,181
and I like the fact
that you put

225
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:50,216
the wound on her chest.

226
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:52,218
- It was very well executed.
- Thank you.

227
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:53,353
Well, when I seen the wig,

228
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:55,054
I automatically thought
about a bird.

229
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,457
The top part of the beak is
an old-age throat piece.

230
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,225
- Huh.
- And then the bottom piece

231
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,693
was actually a large brow.

232
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:03,062
You've done a great job
incorporating the face

233
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:04,730
with the wig to make
a full creature.

234
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:07,032
Thank you.

235
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm looking around the room
and noticing

236
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:10,669
that there are
some really strong concepts.

237
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:13,071
I realize the competition
is going to be intense.

238
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:15,040
For a two-hour makeup
with a brand-new kit,

239
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,743
I think everybody
did a great job.

240
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:19,010
All right, Tami,

241
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:21,547
which of the makeups
were your favorite looks?

242
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:24,350
Bethany, you combined
the beautiful

243
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:26,852
as well as the horror
in a very cohesive way,

244
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:29,855
and, George, I love
the prosthetic on the chest.

245
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,125
You didn't do the typical
bleeding red.

246
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,860
That was thinking
outside the box.

247
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,095
All right, Tami,

248
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,864
who is the winner
of today's challenge?

249
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:39,532
The winner of today's
challenge is...

250
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:45,104
Coming up...

251
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,206
There's no way to get
this mold off

252
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,807
without cracking it.

253
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:49,875
We didn't have a face.

254
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:52,811
I'm just absolutely devastated.

255
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,012
I love it.

256
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:57,049
It looks like a big blob
of Silly Putty.

257
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,131
All right, Tami,

258
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:06,532
who is the winner
of today's challenge?

259
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,133
The winner
of today's challenge is...

260
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,573
George.

261
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,109
You created a bold
and extreme character

262
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,779
with an incredible attention
to detail.

263
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,314
Thank you so much.

264
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,316
- Well, George, congratulations.
- Thank you.

265
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,920
You have won immunity
and cannot be eliminated

266
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,289
in this week's
spotlight challenge.

267
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:31,391
Yeah. That's a good start.
Yes!

268
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,293
All right, and I will see
you tomorrow

269
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,128
for your first
spotlight challenge.

270
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,596
- Bye, guys.
- Thank you.

271
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:37,744
Thank you.

272
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:44,804
- Oh, my God!
- No!

273
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,074
This is where we're gonna live
for the next ten weeks?

274
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:51,077
I see a living room,
a ping-pong table,

275
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:52,312
a pool, a hot tub.

276
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:54,147
I am blown away
being in this house.

277
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,217
Face off!

278
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:04,158
All right.

279
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,693
It's the morning of our first
spotlight challenge,

280
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:08,295
and we're walking
through this huge metal gate,

281
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,464
and we see
this beautiful castle.

282
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,967
It feels
like I'm in a fairy tale.

283
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:16,235
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

284
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,671
Welcome to Castle Knoll.

285
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,008
We're here today
because your spotlight challenge

286
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:24,579
is based
on a timeless fairy tale,

287
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,047
Beauty And The Beast.

288
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,448
- Yes.
- Yay.

289
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,253
These trumpeters come out,

290
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,954
and these gorgeous princesses

291
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:36,090
start filing down one by one,

292
00:12:36,124 --> 00:12:37,858
and I am stoked.

293
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,468
These are our belles
from Beauty And The Beast.

294
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,506
Each of them is holding
an amazing castle

295
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,475
which you will use
to inspire your makeups.

296
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,544
So, working together
in teams of two,

297
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,513
your spotlight challenge is
to choose one of the belles

298
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,481
and create the huge beast

299
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,116
that would live
in the castle with her.

300
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,251
Yes.

301
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,354
Your randomly assigned
teams are...

302
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,523
Rashaad and Chloe...

303
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,759
Daran and Graham...

304
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,128
Bethany and Tyler...

305
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,164
Margaret and Matt...

306
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:19,366
Tanner and Corinne...

307
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,867
Cat and Daniel...

308
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:23,504
Tess and Niko...

309
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:26,406
Okay, go stand
beside your new teammates.

310
00:13:29,377 --> 00:13:31,979
And, George, as the winner

311
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,747
of the first
foundation challenge,

312
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:36,484
you actually get to select
which team you'd like to join.

313
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,619
I think I'm gonna go
with Daran and Graham.

314
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:39,887
- Excellent.
- Nice.

315
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,722
All right, now, keep in mind,
when choosing your castles,

316
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:44,056
the judges will be looking

317
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,492
to see how they've inspired
your designs.

318
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,161
All right, Rashaad and Chloe,
you're up first.

319
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,029
- Underwater?
- Yeah.

320
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,437
All right, I've brought in
a special guest

321
00:13:58,472 --> 00:13:59,472
to give you some advice.

322
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,974
He's a writer, producer,
and director

323
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,877
whose films have grossed
over $2 billion worldwide,

324
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,445
including Van Helsing,

325
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,381
GI Joe, and The Mummy films.

326
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:13,117
Please give a warm welcome
to Stephen Sommers.

327
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,154
I'm excited.

328
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,490
Stephen Sommers has created
some great creatures,

329
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,126
so his advice is
gonna be very helpful.

330
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,828
We are very lucky
to have you joining us

331
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,330
on the reveal stage this week.

332
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,965
What are you gonna be
looking for

333
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,133
in their final designs?

334
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:29,034
The real trick, I think,
to the beast is

335
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,769
you have to scare us
in the first half

336
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,505
but by the end,
he has to be sexy.

337
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,106
So, when belle kisses him
at the end,

338
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,108
we can't be repulsed.

339
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,576
All right, guys,

340
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,544
we're going to leave you here
to work on your designs.

341
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,413
When you're done,
go check out the lab

342
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,380
and get to work.

343
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:43,848
- Good luck.
- Good luck, guys.

344
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,684
Bye.

345
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,622
We decided to go
with a whitish look,

346
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,191
like the Marble Palace.

347
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,293
We're taking some
of the structure from the castle

348
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,728
into his horns.

349
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,164
Our inspiration is a little bit

350
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,666
classic monster Creature
From The Black Lagoon.

351
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,068
We're making his face
very fishlike,

352
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,371
giving him gills and this fin
that goes down his back,

353
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,673
but he is also gonna be having
a nice physique.

354
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,809
We have a lot of interesting
shapes here with geometry,

355
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,143
and we're trying to find ways

356
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,112
to incorporate that into
the anatomy of our character.

357
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,614
Since he's alien-like,

358
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,816
we're gonna bump out the jaw
and stuff, make it strong.

359
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,652
We're trying to make sure
that he's defined and sharp.

360
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,022
I'm thinking we go with, like,

361
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:26,491
- a hardened castle-like back.
- Yeah.

362
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,893
This is all gloomy
and kind of foggy.

363
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,495
We're incorporating
the stone as well.

364
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,464
There's three of us,
so they're gonna expect

365
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,268
a little bit more from us,
I'm sure.

366
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,438
We are working
on a dragon kind of character.

367
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,941
We have these type
of horns in the palace.

368
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,976
We want to add it
in the crown piece.

369
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,244
All right, guys.

370
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,979
Let's go check out the lab.

371
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,814
- All right.
- All right.

372
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:52,018
- Whoo!
- All right.

373
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,066
- Wow.
- This is awesome.

374
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,702
- Oh, my God.
- Holy moly, dude.

375
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,103
This is heaven.

376
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,505
Oh.

377
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,541
I've never worked
in a lab like this before.

378
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,612
We have five hours to work,

379
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,647
and the first thing we do is
we select our model,

380
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,082
and we start sculpting.

381
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,250
I get paired with Cat.

382
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,352
All right, let's do this.

383
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,587
Our castle's very traditional,

384
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,056
and our belle is very regal,
a lot of jewels.

385
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,827
So I really want more
of a traditional, regal beast.

386
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,962
You want me to start
on blocking?

387
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,431
I'm gonna say face.

388
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,132
Corinne and I picked
the ice fort.

389
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,001
We want to make our beast

390
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,238
abominable snowman-ish
with this mane-type hair.

391
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,377
Is that what you were thinking?

392
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,613
Our character has
a face, a torso,

393
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,414
and a cowl,

394
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,550
so I'm constantly checking in
with Chloe,

395
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:02,787
making sure that we make
one cohesive piece.

396
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,088
- Like this?
- Mm-hmm.

397
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,590
- Kind of?
- I like that a lot.

398
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,791
Focus.

399
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,394
I'm working on the face,
and Matt is working on the cowl.

400
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,263
The face is
really important to me,

401
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,466
and there's some things
that aren't correct--

402
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,001
the symmetry and anatomy.

403
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,604
I'm just gonna work as hard
as I can to correct that.

404
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,240
30 minutes left.

405
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,117
My goal was to get
the face piece sculpted,

406
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,485
molded, and ran in foam
by the end of the day.

407
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,553
As I'm molding my face sculpt

408
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:37,755
I notice that I'm
the only one in the room,

409
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,592
and no one else
is molding their face.

410
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:46,700
All right, guys, that's time!

411
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:49,036
Getting the face piece
molded is really gonna help

412
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,837
Bethany and I get
ahead of the game,

413
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:53,740
'cause tomorrow we can focus
on the cowl

414
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,141
and the accessories
and the paint scheme

415
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,544
to bring this character
to life.

416
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,451
Let's do this, guys!
Let's do this.

417
00:18:05,486 --> 00:18:07,721
Let's do it.

418
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:08,722
I like it.

419
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,424
I like it a lot.

420
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,692
It's day two in the lab,

421
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,895
and Rashaad and I
are going to start

422
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,329
tightening up all the pieces,

423
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:17,098
getting them
ready to be molded.

424
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:19,901
I will be responsible
for molding the face...

425
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:21,169
It's game time.

426
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:24,139
And Rashaad assured me
that he can pull off

427
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:26,374
the chest piece,
as well as the cowl.

428
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,808
Look what I've got!

429
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:31,278
I trust he'll get these
out on time.

430
00:18:33,248 --> 00:18:35,416
- Hey, guys.
- Hello. Hi.

431
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,651
We're here
for a first walkthrough.

432
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,119
Hi.

433
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,754
McKenzie and Mr. Westmore
come in,

434
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:41,089
and it's amazing.

435
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:42,891
I am a huge
Michael Westmore fan.

436
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:43,992
We're gonna go with, like,

437
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,660
more of whites and grays
for the hair

438
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:48,861
to have it within the theme
of being in the snow.

439
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:50,395
You've got
something very unique,

440
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,496
and that's ice.

441
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,563
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

442
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,031
When you put the face together,

443
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,065
take advantage of icicles.

444
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,733
It'll be very effective.

445
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:57,801
- Okay.
- Yeah.

446
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,003
We chose The Sultan's Palace.

447
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:03,440
We wanted to keep the face
more humanist a little bit,

448
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,443
but also kind of have
that beast flair to it.

449
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,280
Up close, I can see
all the hard work,

450
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,549
but when you paint this,
make sure you don't lose it...

451
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,917
- Okay.
- ...by doing a wash on it.

452
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,785
By picking The Lunar Tower,

453
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,153
we were able to play
with the hard elements

454
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,555
of what we know as the Moon

455
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,458
and also the vagueness
of extraterrestrial life.

456
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,528
Your face and this
look awfully close,

457
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:25,963
so I would bring this down
a little bit more

458
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:27,131
on the forehead,

459
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:29,700
because once you turn this
out in the foam,

460
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,135
you could get up to 5%
to 10% shrinkage.

461
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,169
Okay.

462
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:34,503
So we got The Golden Keep.

463
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,038
Our beast is a dragon.

464
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:38,073
With the scales,
you don't want to make them

465
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,042
so subtle
they totally disappear.

466
00:19:40,076 --> 00:19:41,910
It has to show up,
so you need to,

467
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,178
at least when you're painting,

468
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:44,880
make sure you take advantage

469
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:46,214
of shading

470
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:49,184
to pop the scales
into your design.

471
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,219
All right, we're leaving,

472
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,887
- but good luck tomorrow.
- Thank you very much.

473
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:54,489
- Bye.
- Good-bye, everybody.

474
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:55,557
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

475
00:19:55,592 --> 00:19:58,727
Bye!

476
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:00,596
I go to check on Rashaad.

477
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:02,568
_

478
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,360
_

479
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,469
Rashaad told me that he knew
how to do molds really well,

480
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,971
so I thought
it was all taken care of.

481
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,940
There's no burlap down here.

482
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:13,174
There's not?

483
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,576
I'm starting to panic
a little bit.

484
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,212
There's no way to get
this mold off this head

485
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,582
without cracking it in half.

486
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:22,903
_

487
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:27,055
If we crack this mold,
we'll lose the entire piece

488
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:28,889
and have to start from scratch.

489
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:30,258
I may not have a cowl tomorrow.

490
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:33,061
This is the beginning
of the end.

491
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:42,918
The cowl mold is not coming
off the mannequin

492
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:44,786
because the mannequin has
undercuts,

493
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:47,790
which is a curve
that the plaster seals around,

494
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:49,993
which means you have to chip
away at your mold

495
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:51,194
in order to get it off.

496
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:53,462
So make sure you do, like,
really thick burlap

497
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:54,930
on all these edges

498
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:57,666
so we have, like, a really good
spot to pop it off.

499
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,634
Okay.

500
00:20:58,668 --> 00:20:59,701
I'm feeling guilty.

501
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,204
This is not a mistake
I normally make.

502
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:05,341
The cowl is a crucial element
to our character.

503
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,143
It's coming.

504
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:10,514
We have to get this thing free.

505
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:11,681
Oh!

506
00:21:11,716 --> 00:21:13,784
We finally crack it open
on the floor.

507
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:19,022
Thank God.

508
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:22,225
We have enough of the mold
so we can get our cowl piece.

509
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:23,693
- Next time...
- I got you.

510
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:25,361
...maybe we should make it
a little thicker.

511
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,197
Yeah, a lot thicker.

512
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:31,801
You know what
would be a big help?

513
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:33,403
If you spent, like,
five or ten minutes

514
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:34,905
just cutting burlap for me,

515
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:36,706
it would make this go
so much faster.

516
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,742
Daniel's adamant
about doing the wig.

517
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:40,844
He's only concerned
about his stuff, so fine.

518
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:43,713
I'm gonna go mold.

519
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:46,449
We have the prop,
the two hand molds,

520
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:47,751
his face,

521
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,387
and my huge cowl,
which is a two-part mold.

522
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:52,089
We're a team,
and unless he wants to end up

523
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:54,925
in bottom looks,
then he needs to help me.

524
00:21:54,926 --> 00:21:57,386
_

525
00:21:57,387 --> 00:22:00,171
_

526
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:05,336
We open up the cowl mold,

527
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,304
and the clay is sticking to it.

528
00:22:07,339 --> 00:22:10,640
Niko and I only have
five minutes left.

529
00:22:10,675 --> 00:22:13,343
So I'm outside cleaning
up this thing,

530
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:16,480
and I'm feeling
absolutely anxious.

531
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:19,617
We have, like,
the important scales done.

532
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:20,718
Two minutes left--

533
00:22:20,752 --> 00:22:22,186
We're starting to put
things together.

534
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,321
I'm like, holy shit,

535
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,356
we're gonna get this mold done
in time.

536
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:29,694
And that's when my heart sinks.

537
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,930
Niko, we don't have the face!

538
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:36,901
All right, everybody,
time's up!

539
00:22:36,935 --> 00:22:38,903
I was so hyper-focused
on the cowl,

540
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:43,107
we forgot to pour foam latex
in the face piece.

541
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:45,008
I'm absolutely devastated.

542
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:46,343
What do we do about the face?

543
00:22:46,377 --> 00:22:49,946
Tomorrow we're gonna have to do
a latex and polyfoam face.

544
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:51,114
Fuck.

545
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:54,952
Latex and polyfoam is stiffer
than foam latex.

546
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:57,521
How is the actor going
to be able to emote?

547
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:00,457
I'm really worried.

548
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,604
Let's do this.

549
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:14,872
It's application day.

550
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,940
There's four hours in the lab,

551
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,475
and Matt's looking
at our piece,

552
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,844
and it has this huge ridge
of foam

553
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,446
on the perimeter.

554
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:24,381
So Matt starts to patch that,

555
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,086
and we're just gonna make
the best of it.

556
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,856
The face piece
wasn't ready before time's up,

557
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,692
so I decided to go with gelatin
instead of the polyfoam,

558
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:37,562
because gelatin
will have better movement.

559
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:40,397
I'm worried that
a transparent gelatin face

560
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:43,535
is not going to match
an opaque foam cowl,

561
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:47,139
but I am gonna hope
for the best.

562
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:52,944
- Hi, guys.
- How you doing?

563
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:55,146
You're, like, a wolf guy.

564
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,648
Give us 45 minutes.

565
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:00,985
Our plan for application day
is to open our chest mold,

566
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,920
fill it with poly foam,

567
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:04,189
and pull our pieces
out of that.

568
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:07,958
I can't do anything
until we have the chest piece,

569
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:09,993
because it has to be
the chest piece first

570
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:13,831
and then the cowl
and then the face.

571
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:16,033
All right, we're gonna try
to put this on you here.

572
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,068
There's a lot to do.

573
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:18,836
I have to finish the staff,

574
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,370
finish painting, dress him,

575
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:21,905
put the wig
and all of his hair on.

576
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:24,241
But I'm feeling a lot better
at this point.

577
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,943
We're actually vibing
very well as a team right now,

578
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,779
but we still have to pull
this character together.

579
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,919
I'm looking
at all these pieces,

580
00:24:36,954 --> 00:24:38,154
and I'm thinking, "All right,

581
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:39,890
all these edges are very nice,

582
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:41,225
and we're ready
to start painting."

583
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:43,026
So we're basing everything
out in white

584
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,161
to make sure that
all the stone texture

585
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:46,496
is really gonna pop,

586
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,665
and we're gonna get all
those cracks to show off.

587
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,340
Going over your face.

588
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,443
I just ripped it in half.

589
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:02,745
When I pull the cowl
over the head,

590
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:04,246
it completely rips
in the center.

591
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,714
I'm just gonna have to fix it.

592
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:07,816
It's a "Oh, fuck" moment
for me,

593
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,019
but our creature is gonna be
kind of a warrior king,

594
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:11,988
so I'm just gonna create
some scarring

595
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:13,589
so he's battle-damaged

596
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:15,257
and make a negative
into a positive

597
00:25:15,292 --> 00:25:16,692
and just keep moving forward.

598
00:25:16,726 --> 00:25:18,861
We can just put latex
on top of it.

599
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:21,730
Yeah, don't worry about it.
I got it.

600
00:25:28,104 --> 00:25:29,705
We're getting that
blue on there,

601
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:33,576
but I'm thinking we need
another bold color,

602
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,679
and I remember that our belle
has a red dress.

603
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:40,283
So I find a color I can pop
into the chest

604
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:43,286
to match her
the best that we can.

605
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,223
- How many minutes do we have?
- 15.

606
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:53,096
I need a white acrylic.

607
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:54,965
- Empty bottle.
- All right, I'll go get one.

608
00:25:58,368 --> 00:26:00,336
All right, guys, time's up!

609
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,171
- Let's go.
- Good job, buddy.

610
00:26:02,205 --> 00:26:03,372
You're gonna kick ass.

611
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:04,507
- Do-do-do!
- Time is up,

612
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:05,841
and Margaret and I are gonna
have to hit

613
00:26:05,876 --> 00:26:07,910
the ground running as soon
as we get into last looks.

614
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,545
We've got to finish
the paint job,

615
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:12,448
and we got to finish
bondo'ing some of his edges.

616
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:13,983
I think that we're in trouble,

617
00:26:14,017 --> 00:26:17,986
and I'm really starting
to get nervous.

618
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,154
Coming up...

619
00:26:19,188 --> 00:26:21,223
Yeah, that's too much.
We got to fix all that.

620
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:23,625
There's a new twist
that I need to tell you about.

621
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:26,661
Your technical ability is
very, very evident.

622
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:27,796
I think this is really cool.

623
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,898
This is one
of the kookiest choices

624
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:31,599
I have ever seen on this show.

625
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:43,122
It's last looks.
There's only one hour left.

626
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:44,891
And we're just gonna paint
the living shit

627
00:26:44,925 --> 00:26:47,627
out of our character.

628
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:49,261
I need hair on the other ear.

629
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:50,630
Everything is applied.

630
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:53,265
Now I need to lay
all of the hair

631
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:55,734
as fast as humanly possible.

632
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:57,603
We got held up
having to fix all the patches

633
00:26:57,637 --> 00:26:59,571
and the appliances,

634
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:01,841
so Margaret and I have to skip
some of the stuff

635
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,643
we wanted to do.

636
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:05,411
We got to fix all that.

637
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,418
That's time!

638
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:14,021
I can't believe it.

639
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:16,590
I'm really anxious, but it's
time to stop worrying about it.

640
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:18,125
We did our best,

641
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,794
and I'm hoping the judges
are gonna see that.

642
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:37,411
Welcome to the Face Off
reveal stage.

643
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:40,948
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

644
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:43,084
Let's say hello
to our talented judges--

645
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:45,052
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio

646
00:27:45,087 --> 00:27:46,287
Glenn Hetrick...

647
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:48,589
- Good evening, guys.
- Hi.

648
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:51,358
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

649
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:54,127
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi.

650
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:56,963
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page...

651
00:27:56,997 --> 00:27:59,065
- Hello.
- Hi.

652
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:00,867
And rejoining us tonight
is writer, producer,

653
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:03,169
and director Stephen Sommers.

654
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:04,871
Hey, guys.
Good to be back.

655
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:06,640
Now, before we see
your makeups,

656
00:28:06,675 --> 00:28:10,111
there's a new twist
that I need to tell you about.

657
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,580
This season the judges
will be able to issue

658
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:15,116
a one-time special immunity.

659
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,553
They will be able to save
an artist who's had a tough week

660
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:20,588
and would have
otherwise been eliminated,

661
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:22,356
so this will be
at their discretion,

662
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,160
and you won't know
when it's coming.

663
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:28,162
The judges are gonna grant
immunity to one of us.

664
00:28:28,196 --> 00:28:29,163
How cool is that?

665
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:30,331
All right, so this week

666
00:28:30,365 --> 00:28:32,033
your spotlight challenge
was to choose

667
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,703
one of the castles
our belles were holding

668
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:35,905
and create the huge beast

669
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:38,240
that would live in it with her.

670
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:41,210
So let's take a look at
your creations and their belles.

671
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:03,633
The gold against the black
looks awesome,

672
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:06,669
and I want to give Niko
the biggest hug in the world

673
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,172
and be like,
"We did it, buddy."

674
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:26,723
He's beautiful, sexy,
and terrifying.

675
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:30,193
I'm really proud of everything
me and Daniel did together.

676
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,043
He looks like he came
from that castle.

677
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,912
He looks like he's part
of that castle.

678
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:50,346
He looks like a beast,

679
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:53,049
and he looks like the belle
might be able to kiss him.

680
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,668
Looking at our beast,
I'm totally bummed.

681
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:14,303
It doesn't look real.

682
00:30:14,338 --> 00:30:17,840
It's just not what
I wanted it to be.

683
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:36,727
Our character has
the brightest-looking elements

684
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:38,228
out of everybody else's.

685
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:42,166
I'm nervous, because
I don't know what to expect.

686
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:58,817
We're happy with what we did,

687
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,318
and we know what we did wrong,

688
00:31:00,353 --> 00:31:01,686
and we're gonna do better
next time.

689
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,923
But we're so proud
of what we've done today.

690
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,007
I'm very proud of what
me and Chloe have done

691
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:24,143
in the limited time
that we had.

692
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:26,612
That's our baby.

693
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:36,522
Judges, it's time to take
a closer look at our beasts.

694
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:42,726
These nails are cool.

695
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:44,095
Try to emote
through the makeup.

696
00:31:44,129 --> 00:31:47,464
Growl. Grimace.

697
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:51,068
Cool. Thank you.

698
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:53,437
The blood throws me.
It's more horror.

699
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:54,972
It should be scary,
but not gory.

700
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:56,140
Thank you.

701
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:01,947
Up close, there's
some nice detailing happening

702
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:03,282
up through here.

703
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,083
If they pulled
the eyelids back,

704
00:32:05,118 --> 00:32:06,618
I think it wouldn't be
as hard to light.

705
00:32:06,652 --> 00:32:07,819
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

706
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:13,558
The judges are going
for a closer look,

707
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:15,026
and I'm really nervous,

708
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,728
because I know
what all the flaws are.

709
00:32:16,762 --> 00:32:19,197
I'm very curious
as to the choice of sculpting

710
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:20,331
around the nose.

711
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:21,899
Can you turn your head?

712
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:24,835
_

713
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:27,538
_

714
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,607
The ears are laughable.

715
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:31,542
I knew as soon as the judges
noticed them,

716
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:34,578
we were going to be in trouble.

717
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:37,881
I'm really scared
that I'm going home.

718
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:45,515
I like that there's snow in it and frost,
but I thought it made him look old.

719
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:50,415
Judges going for the closer look,
and I know this isn't the greatest makeup.

720
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,859
The sculpting around the nose
almost feels diseased.

721
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:55,694
- Okay, thanks.
- Well done.

722
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:03,169
I want to know the story
behind this makeup.

723
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:07,840
- This is not a pretty look.
- Thank you.

724
00:33:07,874 --> 00:33:09,341
How would you kiss those lips?

725
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,342
That's an odd nose.

726
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:14,679
- It's an odd everything.
- Yeah.

727
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:18,550
Wow.

728
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,720
This is a lot of detail.

729
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:23,323
It looks so professional to me.

730
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:26,227
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

731
00:33:28,697 --> 00:33:30,998
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations,

732
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:32,633
so let's find out
what they thought.

733
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:36,002
Tess and Niko...

734
00:33:36,036 --> 00:33:38,938
Cat and Daniel...

735
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:41,674
Tanner and Corinne...

736
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,709
Congratulations, because
you guys are safe this week

737
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:44,844
and can head back...

738
00:33:44,878 --> 00:33:46,612
- Oh, my God.
- ...to the makeup room.

739
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:48,312
We did it!

740
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,721
Now, the rest of you
were the best and the worst.

741
00:33:54,756 --> 00:33:56,990
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

742
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:58,993
to learn more about your work.

743
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:02,596
Daran, Graham, and George,
if you'd please step forward.

744
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:10,735
Start by telling me
about the idea

745
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,336
and also who did what.

746
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,737
He's been trapped
in this castle

747
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,371
with a 100-year curse.

748
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:17,938
The longer he's in the castle,

749
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,239
the more he becomes part of it.

750
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:21,706
Daran sculpted the face.

751
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,373
George did the chest.

752
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:26,609
I blocked out the cowl.

753
00:34:26,643 --> 00:34:30,645
I think this is really cool.

754
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,279
One of my favorite things
about the makeup

755
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:35,615
is you can't actually follow
those shapes into his chest.

756
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:37,216
He'd be bulked out super huge.

757
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,583
But you just suggest that,

758
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,117
and it goes away
under the robe,

759
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:41,785
and that's really cool.

760
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,154
Is the pink color supposed
to resemble a fleshy tone?

761
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:46,289
It's around his heart,

762
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:47,523
so it's just keeping
that area warm,

763
00:34:47,557 --> 00:34:49,691
to show that there's still
a man in there.

764
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,092
I think it should have been
a little bit warmer.

765
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:52,126
- Mm-hmm.
- It just looks

766
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,728
a little pink-y to me.

767
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:56,630
The execution of the sculpt
is at a high level.

768
00:34:56,665 --> 00:34:59,099
There's some really nice detail
when you get up close.

769
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:01,501
I am excited about what
the three of you have to offer.

770
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:02,735
Thank you.

771
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,035
I love the backstory,

772
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,669
and, also, I like
that I can see his eyes.

773
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,037
Belle I could see
kissing him at the end.

774
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,705
- Awesome, thank you.
- Thank you.

775
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,607
Please step back.

776
00:35:15,277 --> 00:35:17,244
Matt and Margaret.

777
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,082
What is his backstory?

778
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:27,017
A human prince of this
castle had come upon a stone,

779
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:28,419
not realizing that this was
an object

780
00:35:28,453 --> 00:35:31,420
that was slowly turning him
into this beast.

781
00:35:31,455 --> 00:35:32,487
I got to tell you guys,

782
00:35:32,522 --> 00:35:34,355
he looks like a big blob
of Silly Putty

783
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:36,790
with some divots in it.

784
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:39,292
There's not enough texture
in it.

785
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:41,526
This shape is very odd.

786
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:45,361
I'm just not real fond
of this particular design.

787
00:35:45,396 --> 00:35:48,330
I said to make it
terrifying and sexy,

788
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:50,131
and this one in particular,
especially with the lips,

789
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:52,432
I don't know how belle
kisses this creature.

790
00:35:52,466 --> 00:35:53,899
Okay.

791
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:55,667
Who put the initial shape
on the front of the face?

792
00:35:55,701 --> 00:35:57,033
- I did.
- Okay.

793
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:59,701
The abrupt disruption
of the cheeks

794
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:01,602
and the nasolabial folds here
in the face

795
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:04,069
is a very strange decision--

796
00:36:04,104 --> 00:36:06,504
beyond unacceptable.

797
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:08,204
Okay, you can head back.

798
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:18,043
Rashaad and Chloe.

799
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,081
So tell us about your design.

800
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,182
I've been very inspired
by the Gill-man.

801
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:28,983
That's the oldest
"Beauty And The Beast" story.

802
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:31,318
Chloe sculpted
the wonderful face,

803
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:33,886
and I did the cowl and torso.

804
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,755
You've got a beautiful piece.

805
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:39,557
The face has a lot of detailing
going on there.

806
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:41,492
The sculpt on the chest
and the back--

807
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:43,060
there's some
beautiful stuff there.

808
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:44,662
It's a very complete makeup.

809
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:46,163
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

810
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:47,831
I can't believe what you did
in a day and a half.

811
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:49,599
- It looks amazing.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

812
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,667
I think it is stellar.

813
00:36:51,702 --> 00:36:53,969
The sculpture
is so well designed.

814
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,137
It's scary,
but you could sell it

815
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:58,072
to little kids as a doll.

816
00:36:58,106 --> 00:36:59,139
Thank you.

817
00:36:59,174 --> 00:37:00,273
You can step down.

818
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:02,075
Thanks, Omar.

819
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:09,273
Tyler and Bethany,
please step forward.

820
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:10,444
- Go first.
- Thanks.

821
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:16,819
What's your character's
backstory?

822
00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:19,921
He was chosen to be
a human sacrifice,

823
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,055
and that's why he's chained up.

824
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:23,623
Bringing in cultural aspects
of the palace

825
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:25,191
was something
we really wanted to do,

826
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:28,526
so the orbs are the structural
part of the building.

827
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,128
He doesn't seem scary,
and he doesn't seem sexy.

828
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:34,531
The face, especially
with a black nose,

829
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:36,700
it's very mousy.

830
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,701
It doesn't quite gel
for me there.

831
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:39,902
Okay.

832
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:42,504
I don't see the monster in him.

833
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:45,539
He seems like a teddy bear
or a clown.

834
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:48,742
He looks like a Persian cat
that got mixed up

835
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,309
with a blueberry
ice cream cone.

836
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:53,378
I'm not really even sure what
you guys were thinking of

837
00:37:53,412 --> 00:37:55,880
when you jammed
this guy's head with balls

838
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:58,215
with spikes coming out of 'em.

839
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:00,216
This is one
of the kookiest choices

840
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,152
I have ever seen on this show.

841
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:07,089
Thank you very much.
If you'd please step back.

842
00:38:11,695 --> 00:38:14,130
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

843
00:38:14,164 --> 00:38:15,498
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

844
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:18,034
while they deliberate.

845
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:25,241
All right, judges,
why don't we start

846
00:38:25,275 --> 00:38:27,142
with the looks
you like the most?

847
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:30,012
Let's begin with Daran, Graham,
and George's team.

848
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:33,983
The way that the chest flowed
into the wardrobe--

849
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:36,853
it was a pretty clever way
to integrate

850
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:38,355
the bulk of the beast.

851
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,658
It was almost like
a ruffly shirt coming up

852
00:38:40,692 --> 00:38:41,959
that was part of his body.

853
00:38:41,994 --> 00:38:44,928
Daran's face sculpt
was particularly good.

854
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:46,897
All right, let's move on
to Chloe and Rashaad.

855
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:48,532
Wow, did they get a lot done.

856
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:50,601
I mean, there was so much detail
in that face,

857
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:52,302
it was pretty much astounding.

858
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:54,171
That is one of the most complex

859
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:58,208
and complete first-week makeups
we have ever seen.

860
00:38:58,243 --> 00:39:01,011
I was completely and absolutely
impressed with this.

861
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:02,613
All right, let's move on
to the looks

862
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:03,948
you liked the least.

863
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:06,250
Let's start
with Bethany and Tyler.

864
00:39:06,284 --> 00:39:08,886
It really did look like
a kitty cat

865
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,289
and some ice cream cones
got into a brawl.

866
00:39:11,323 --> 00:39:13,457
We asked huge--
Not there.

867
00:39:13,491 --> 00:39:15,725
Terrifying-- Not at all there.
Sexy-- It wasn't there.

868
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,361
So what we were asking
wasn't there at all.

869
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:20,597
Okay, let's move on
to Margaret and Matt.

870
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:22,900
He wasn't scary or sexy.

871
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,769
Even though he was a big model,

872
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:26,305
they didn't take advantage
of it.

873
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,574
My biggest complaint
is the face.

874
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:30,242
There was no elegance
to the sculpture,

875
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:35,247
but there was also no reference
to any strong anatomy.

876
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,850
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

877
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:39,417
- I think so.
- Yes, we have.

878
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:41,553
Let's bring them back out.

879
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:51,096
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

880
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,000
Chloe and Rashaad,
we were really wowed

881
00:39:55,034 --> 00:39:57,502
by how much work
you did this week

882
00:39:57,537 --> 00:40:00,405
and how detailed it was.

883
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,507
Daran, Graham, and George,

884
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,941
we really liked the way

885
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:06,311
that you integrated
your castle elements,

886
00:40:06,345 --> 00:40:07,879
and your decision to retain

887
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:10,782
some of those human skin tones
was a wise one.

888
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:12,917
Okay, which team
came out on top?

889
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,653
The winning team tonight is...

890
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:22,925
Okay, which team
came out on top?

891
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,661
The winning team tonight is...

892
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:33,236
Chloe and Rashaad.

893
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:37,206
We were really wowed
by how detailed it was.

894
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,340
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

895
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:39,674
Great job.

896
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,442
But we can only have
one winner.

897
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:42,977
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner

898
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:44,412
of this challenge?

899
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:48,083
Tonight's winner is...

900
00:40:48,118 --> 00:40:50,152
Chloe.

901
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:52,555
Awesome overall character,

902
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:55,091
but the face and the paint

903
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,659
were the standouts
of this makeup.

904
00:40:56,693 --> 00:40:57,793
Thank you.

905
00:40:57,828 --> 00:40:58,928
This is incredible.

906
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:00,495
Winning the first spotlight
challenge

907
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,263
is a confidence booster.

908
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:03,665
Chloe, congratulations.

909
00:41:03,699 --> 00:41:05,066
Thank you.

910
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,368
You, Rashaad,
George, Daran, Graham,

911
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:09,404
are all safe and can head back
to the makeup room.

912
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:11,573
Thank you, guys.

913
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:16,812
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

914
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:19,314
are on the bottom this week,

915
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:20,749
and one of you
will be eliminated.

916
00:41:20,784 --> 00:41:22,651
Please step forward.

917
00:41:28,123 --> 00:41:31,326
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

918
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,295
Bethany and Tyler,

919
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:36,098
there were some really good
techniques employed

920
00:41:36,132 --> 00:41:37,232
in your makeup,

921
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:39,501
but a faulty concept
and poor design choices

922
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:41,570
ultimately led you astray.

923
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:43,138
Margaret and Matt,

924
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:45,874
your sculpting lacked
in detail--

925
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:47,842
a problem which was
further exacerbated

926
00:41:47,877 --> 00:41:49,878
by a bland paint scheme.

927
00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:51,814
So who is going home tonight?

928
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:53,550
The person going home
tonight is...

929
00:41:57,988 --> 00:42:01,223
Margaret.

930
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:03,825
We had several issues
with this makeup,

931
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,560
but the face was filled

932
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:07,096
with sculptural shapes
and anatomy

933
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,831
that just didn't make sense
to us.

934
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:09,932
Yeah.

935
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:12,935
That means,
Tyler, Bethany, Matt,

936
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,203
you are safe.

937
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:15,604
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room.

938
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:18,841
Thank you.

939
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:23,879
Margaret, go home
with your head held high.

940
00:42:23,913 --> 00:42:26,081
That makeup in another season
might have gotten you

941
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:29,283
at least through
to the next week.

942
00:42:29,318 --> 00:42:31,952
Margaret, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

943
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:33,854
It's been great
having you with us.

944
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:36,657
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

945
00:42:36,692 --> 00:42:37,792
and pack up your kit.

946
00:42:37,826 --> 00:42:38,859
- Bye.
- Thank you.

947
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:39,760
- Good luck.
- Take care, Margaret.

948
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:41,161
Good luck, Margaret.

949
00:42:41,196 --> 00:42:44,532
I am disappointed to go out
in the first round.

950
00:42:44,566 --> 00:42:45,533
_

951
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:46,734
Aw.

952
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:48,269
Meeting all these
different artists,

953
00:42:48,303 --> 00:42:49,570
it's been inspiring.

954
00:42:49,604 --> 00:42:50,871
Come on.

955
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:54,208
For me, makeup
has been amazing.

956
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:55,342
It's done a lot for me.

957
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:57,908
I'm looking forward to seeing
what happens next.
