1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:02,013
This makeup
doesn't really work.

2
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:03,247
It's really quite beautiful.

3
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:06,117
You have to turn your game
up at this point.

4
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:07,852
Previously, on<i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:10,054
Tyler's wall-crawling mutant
brought him

6
00:00:10,088 --> 00:00:11,555
an astounding fourth victory.

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,590
Oh, my God.

8
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:16,293
And Graham was sent home.

9
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:17,895
With only five artists
remaining,

10
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:21,032
tonight, they face a challenge
of bionic extremes.

11
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,634
It's the future
that brings us here today.

12
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:25,002
This is right up my alley.

13
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:26,370
And the competition explodes

14
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,272
with a dramatic fight
to the finish.

15
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:29,874
- It's gonna come apart.
- Fuck.

16
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,575
I'm really worried,
because if I don't have this,

17
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,010
I'm not gonna have anything.

18
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,813
I'm looking around, everybody
seems to be going larger.

19
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:39,283
This challenge
is so far out of my league.

20
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:42,820
- You have blown me away.
- I'm not really a big fan.

21
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:45,723
This is the best thing
that you have showed us.

22
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:48,392
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

23
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:49,794
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

24
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:53,030
to one of their
85 international locations,

25
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:57,835
a brand new 2014 Fiat 500,
and $100,000.

26
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:00,938
Who'll be the next great name
in movie magic?

27
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:06,077
Face Off!

28
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:08,512
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

30
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,894
- Five of us, man.
- Final five.

31
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:58,762
You can almost taste the final.

32
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:01,699
We're that much closer
to the finale,

33
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:04,869
and everyone remaining has wins,
and I don't.

34
00:02:04,903 --> 00:02:08,772
So I just need to get into
that zone and focus on the goal.

35
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:10,341
All right, guys, let's see
what our next challenge is.

36
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,910
Everybody's on their A game,
so I can't make anymore mistakes

37
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,946
because that'll be
my ticket home.

38
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:27,658
Where are we today?

39
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:31,829
- Union Station.
- Oh, nice.

40
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,365
Whoa.

41
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,699
Oh, this is big.

42
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:39,403
We are at Union Station,
and it's just beautiful.

43
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:42,740
I can smell the old furniture
and the wood.

44
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,643
It's like history.
I'm smelling history here.

45
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,113
Hey, guys.

46
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:53,083
Welcome to Union Station
in downtown Los Angeles,

47
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:56,387
known as the last
of the great railway stations.

48
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:58,889
This historic transportation hub
continues to serve

49
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:01,125
over 60,000 passengers a day.

50
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,560
- Mm.
- It's also been

51
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:06,363
a popular filming location
for movies like<i> Drag Me To Hell,</i>

52
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:07,865
<i>The Dark Knight Rises,</i>

53
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:11,302
and the futuristic sci-fi
thriller,<i> Blade Runner.</i>

54
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:15,606
And it is the future
that brings us here today.

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,209
- Nice.
- Okay.

56
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,177
This is the old ticketing room,

57
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,079
and once upon a time,
it was the station's

58
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:24,915
bustling nerve center,
but its ticketing agents

59
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,984
have since been replaced
with machines.

60
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:29,687
Now, with the onslaught
of machines handling tasks

61
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:31,822
that were once
exclusively done by humans,

62
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,324
one can't help but wonder,

63
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:36,527
how long
until we're all replaced?

64
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:38,162
Now, next to me are props

65
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,964
representing
various occupations.

66
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:43,033
We have a surgeon, photographer,
hairdresser,

67
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:46,403
firefighter, chef,
and construction worker.

68
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:49,006
You're spotlight challenge
is to select one of them

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,909
and create the robot that has
taken that professional's place

70
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:54,044
- in the workforce.
- Nice.

71
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,580
Awesome.
We get to do futuristic robots.

72
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:57,615
This is right up my alley.

73
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:59,917
Tyler, you're up first.

74
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,785
Surgeon.

75
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,153
Photographer.

76
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,822
Firefighter.

77
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,858
The construction worker.

78
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,362
Hairdresser.

79
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:14,431
Before you begin your designs,
there's just one more thing

80
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,233
I need to tell you.

81
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:19,837
Each of your robots must display
an extreme functional advantage

82
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:21,372
over their human counterparts.

83
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,553
_

84
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,341
I'm slightly terrified,
because I know

85
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:26,310
a robot that has
multiple functions

86
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:29,446
is gonna be a lot of work,
and this is not my thing.

87
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,582
It's time to start
working on your designs,

88
00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:34,918
and I want to remind you,
do not go for the obvious.

89
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:38,422
Make bold choices that will
surprise and impress our judges.

90
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:39,423
Good luck.

91
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:40,824
- Thank you.
- See you later.

92
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,063
I have firefighter.

93
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:47,564
It's actually something I
thought about being

94
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,700
for a long time.
I want this character

95
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:52,002
to be very big
and be able to save the day.

96
00:04:52,037 --> 00:04:54,338
I also want to incorporate
the eagle on the helmet.

97
00:04:54,372 --> 00:04:56,340
There's no truck,
because this robot

98
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:59,410
can put out a fire by himself.

99
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:00,577
I'll be taking a chance
on doing

100
00:05:00,612 --> 00:05:02,146
a lot of fabrication
and hardly any makeup.

101
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,715
I plan on making the head
a camera, fabricated chest,

102
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,583
which is gonna be
a huge light on the front

103
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:09,019
because it needs to shine light
on whatever subject

104
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:12,589
that the camera's gonna be
taking a picture of.

105
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,327
You need a lot of time
to fabricate a robot,

106
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,463
and I'm not a big fabricator,
so I'm gonna sculpt everything.

107
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:21,198
I want to make
my hairdresser robot

108
00:05:21,232 --> 00:05:25,235
very cool and elegant and
something pleasant to the eye.

109
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,737
So the concept
for my hairdresser

110
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,138
is a female robot.

111
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:32,242
She's gonna be stylish
and modern looking and hip.

112
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:34,845
The special feature
that my robot is gonna have

113
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,114
is two blowers coming
out of her breasts,

114
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:39,249
and her hands are gonna have
different fingers

115
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:41,385
with the scissors
and the nose clipper.

116
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,387
Each hand will have utility.

117
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,023
All right, guys,
let's head back to the lab.

118
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:48,659
- This is gonna be fun.
- Oh, yeah.

119
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:59,103
It's day one
of our robot challenge.

120
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:02,439
We get six hours in the lab.

121
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:03,907
We have an extra day
for this challenge.

122
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:07,378
That means I get more time
to work with the fabrication,

123
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:09,813
which tends to take
a little extra time anyway,

124
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:11,915
but the first thing I do
is sculpt the face.

125
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,453
I decided to cover one eye
with wires,

126
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,556
put two lenses in the forehead
and one over the nose

127
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:20,724
so it looks like
it has three eyes

128
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,760
that can rotate
and see different things.

129
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:25,696
Holy fuck, man.
What the fuck is that?

130
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,164
Nice.

131
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:29,433
My robot can see
the structure of a building

132
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:32,703
as well as things that might
be harmful to people.

133
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:34,845
That way,
he could replace a human.

134
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:39,843
I've worked
in a hospital setting before,

135
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:42,646
so the surgeon one
kind of screamed to me.

136
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,549
This surgical robot
has these little arms

137
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,317
that come out on both sides,

138
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:50,621
and I want it to have
a human-looking face.

139
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:54,725
So I vacuformed my model's life
cast to create a face shield.

140
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,126
So when it talks to people,

141
00:06:56,161 --> 00:07:00,230
they're not looking
at a creepy-looking machine.

142
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:05,269
I selected
a construction worker,

143
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:09,473
and I know that I have to do
something big.

144
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:11,241
This robot is from the future,

145
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:14,311
but it's the first generation
of this kind of machine,

146
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:16,346
but he can still do the work.

147
00:07:16,381 --> 00:07:18,849
I want it to have
all the cables and everything

148
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:21,251
coming on the face,
and then everything else

149
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:24,388
is just gonna
be fabricated around it.

150
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:30,027
I immediately get to work
building a face

151
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:33,864
for my futuristic
photographer robot.

152
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:36,633
I'm basically sculpting
with wood instead of clay,

153
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,803
and I'll be using a router
and a dremel and a hand saw

154
00:07:39,838 --> 00:07:42,706
and everything else to make
this face look like a camera.

155
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,575
I've been a carpenter
since I've been 16.

156
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:46,577
I'm used to working with wood,
but I've never actually

157
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:51,215
used wood to do a makeup
or make a robot.

158
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:53,917
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

159
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:56,653
- Here for a walkthrough.
- How are you?

160
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:58,589
You left this lower jaw open,

161
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:00,657
and so it's gonna look
like a human who's wearing it.

162
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,292
- Mm-hmm.
- You're gonna have to keep

163
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:05,929
adding pieces to cover anything
that is skin.

164
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,064
Mm-hmm.

165
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:09,333
This is gonna be the face here.

166
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,501
- Okay.
- Is it gonna be

167
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:11,902
all basically gadgets?

168
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:14,905
Or are you working any type
of makeup in there with it?

169
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:17,841
I was playing with the idea
of a silicone face

170
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,176
that goes over my model.

171
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,744
If you do that,
I would make sure

172
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:21,879
you kind of square things off
a bit

173
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:23,747
as opposed to making it flow

174
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:25,048
like a human in there
or something.

175
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:26,049
Right, right.

176
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:27,050
How are you gonna incorporate

177
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,352
the aspects of hairdressing?

178
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:31,255
Her boobies
are gonna be like hairdryers,

179
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:34,591
and they suck also the hairs
that fall from the person.

180
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:35,859
- It goes--
- Okay.

181
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:38,395
Sucks it in and throws it
out in the back.

182
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,630
You know, the thing is,
I don't know

183
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:42,799
if this is going to sell
as a hairdryer.

184
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,902
You might rethink that design
a little bit.

185
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:47,237
Might be able to combine this
all into one

186
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:48,505
or something
so it comes down--

187
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,773
Like a blow dryer
or something--

188
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,309
And actually maybe take
a piece of plastic,

189
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:55,178
and then mount it in there
so you know that's a dryer.

190
00:08:55,213 --> 00:08:56,580
You need to do something to--

191
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:58,482
And it's similar to a dryer
of our time, exactly.

192
00:08:58,516 --> 00:08:59,883
Exactly.

193
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:03,120
Are you planning on covering
it all with this type of wiring?

194
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:05,222
No, the wire is gonna be
in this bottom part

195
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,823
and around the eyes.

196
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,126
To me, it looks like a face

197
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,563
that you put worms over the top
of it in these areas here.

198
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,765
I think you need to be
a little bit more powerful

199
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,802
in your bridge across here
and in your nose.

200
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:20,704
What you want to do
is make planes

201
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:22,940
as opposed to rounding off.

202
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:26,410
Otherwise, I'm afraid
it's gonna look like a person.

203
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:29,880
What you can do to maybe
get away from this human look

204
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:31,815
with the eyes and the mouth
is do a lower lip

205
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:34,851
in a separate piece, just so you
get a whole mechanical mouth,

206
00:09:34,886 --> 00:09:36,987
or that's
gonna look like a person.

207
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,288
Okay.

208
00:09:38,323 --> 00:09:39,690
All right, gentlemen,
we're heading out.

209
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,959
- Good luck to everybody.
- Thank you.

210
00:09:41,993 --> 00:09:44,227
- Thank you.
- Bye.

211
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,636
I take Mr. Westmore's advice
by taking away human form.

212
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,105
I distort the face.
I make it look very mechanical.

213
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:56,139
And I'm back on track.

214
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,109
Now it's time to mold.

215
00:09:59,143 --> 00:10:00,477
I always try
to get the face first

216
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:03,513
because that's the most
important element in a makeup.

217
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,518
At this point,
everyone is in the mold room,

218
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:10,854
but I'm gonna spend more time
working on the changes

219
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,556
that Mr. Westmore told me to do.

220
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,859
But after I finish,
I only have a less than an hour,

221
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:19,363
and I still have to mold it.

222
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:22,633
I'm molding as fast as I can,
but I don't think

223
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,401
I'm gonna be able to open
and clean this

224
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,737
by the end of the day.

225
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:29,206
Since we have an extra day,
I think it will be worth it

226
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,575
to just open it tomorrow.

227
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,378
All right, everyone.
That's time.

228
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,013
My sculpture is ready
for opening tomorrow.

229
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,615
I feel pretty good with my face,
and I'm excited

230
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,318
to start working
on the other pieces.

231
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:49,292
Whoo!
Ah!

232
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:50,661
It's day two.

233
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,063
We have nine hours
in the lab today.

234
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:55,399
The first thing I need to do
is check the silicone

235
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,901
to make sure it set up so I
can pull the wood out of that

236
00:10:57,935 --> 00:10:59,503
and then pour resin into it

237
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:02,039
for the face
on the robotic camera.

238
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:03,940
But right now, I need
to get sculpting on a face

239
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:07,744
so I can have a base
to attach all this stuff to.

240
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,786
As soon as my face piece
is ready for foam latex,

241
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,320
I start sculpting
the chest piece

242
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,989
for my construction worker.

243
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:22,592
I'm taking my time
to do a really good sculpture

244
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:25,228
so it doesn't look too similar
as last challenge.

245
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:28,031
And because we have
an extra day, maybe tomorrow

246
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:32,803
I can spend my whole day
just working on the robot suit.

247
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,314
I'm sculpting this chest piece
that I'm gonna incorporate

248
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:46,349
these little helping hands
coming out

249
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,351
that spread open the tissue
during surgery.

250
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:50,053
I'm gonna vacuform it,

251
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:55,592
so I can use this same piece
as my back.

252
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:58,128
This challenge is all about
the really smart,

253
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:02,399
quick decision, and this
is gonna help me save time.

254
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,039
I'm following Mr. Westmore's
advice, and my robot

255
00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:12,476
is gonna have a hair blower
coming out from her chest.

256
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,547
Everybody's doing
all this L200 and gluing,

257
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:19,316
but the last time
I fabricated pieces,

258
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,852
I almost got eliminated.

259
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,920
At the same time,
it's kind of hard to make foam

260
00:12:23,955 --> 00:12:26,757
look like metal, and I would
hate to go home now.

261
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,759
At least, I want to go
to the finale.

262
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:32,662
So I'm afraid sculpting
this robot is a big mistake.

263
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,767
Coming up...

264
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:38,268
This is so far
out of my league.

265
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:39,503
Maybe I didn't do enough.

266
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:40,570
He won't be able to move.

267
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:41,872
It's gonna come apart.

268
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:43,740
I don't have time
to do another bodysuit.

269
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:45,342
I think you really missed the mark
on this one.

270
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:46,977
You hit the right notes.

271
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,765
It's the second day
of the robot challenge,

272
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,835
and I'm sculpting
the chest piece and the cowl.

273
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:02,339
My strength is sculpting,
not really fabrication.

274
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,841
But foam moves like foam.
It doesn't move like metals.

275
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,044
So there's a big risk, but
I'll have to do what I do best.

276
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,479
It's got a blow dryer
on the front.

277
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:11,147
Oh, you got a blow dryer.

278
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:13,049
I hope I made
a good decision on doing this,

279
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,486
so hopefully, the judges
won't send me home.

280
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:22,058
With this fireman suit,
I'm using L200,

281
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,426
a very flexible material.

282
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:25,428
It can also be very rigid.

283
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:27,430
This fireman has vents
on his chest

284
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:29,366
that are gonna be taking
in the smoke

285
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,334
and putting out fresh oxygen
through the back,

286
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:33,636
and a water tank on his back

287
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:37,707
with an arm that goes over
the shoulder with a hose on it.

288
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:41,244
I really want to get
my two arms and chest done

289
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,646
so that all I really have
to focus on the third day

290
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:46,249
is the legs.

291
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:53,123
So to create these extremities
coming off of my robot

292
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:56,659
and the headpiece with
the vacuform face in the front,

293
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:59,896
I take PVC pipe, cut several
different sections,

294
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,332
and I velcro every piece
to a black spandex suit.

295
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:05,301
It's gonna be so much easier
in application, where the models

296
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:09,139
can just slip into the suits
and pull everything on.

297
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:12,675
I'm hoping the bright, white
pieces will help your eye

298
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,446
get rid of that black suit,
and all you see

299
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,416
is the form of the robot.

300
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:24,087
I'm creating, for
my robot construction worker,

301
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,190
an arm piece that will hold
a lot of different tools.

302
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:27,000
There you go.

303
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:29,692
So I got this idea
to fabricate quick slots

304
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,195
for each one of the tools.

305
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,130
I vacuform all these tools.

306
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,499
I have a drill,
a wrench, screwdrivers.

307
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:40,270
It's starting to look
really cool.

308
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,409
I finished the mold,
and honestly

309
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:48,711
I think it looks beautiful.

310
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:51,481
It's gonna be foam.
It's not fabricating a robot.

311
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,384
But I'm liking the way
it's looking.

312
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:56,553
The only thing that's
worrying me is that tomorrow

313
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,755
I've got to fabricate
some arms,

314
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:02,926
and I'm not sure
how they'll come out.

315
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,965
By end of day two, I have
all these pieces laid out

316
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,135
and everything pretty much
is almost covered.

317
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:15,472
And then I realize that
the mannequin I'm using

318
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:19,843
is 6' tall, and my model's 5'.

319
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,349
All right, guys, that's time.

320
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,585
I hope I didn't waste
all this time doing this suit

321
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,653
because I don't even know
if it's gonna fit my model.

322
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:31,654
Robot.

323
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,056
I don't know what to do.

324
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,260
I know a mistake like this
can send you home.

325
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:46,469
Yeah!

326
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:49,639
It's the third day
of the robot challenge,

327
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:53,510
and I'm gonna concentrate now
on the arm pieces and the hands.

328
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:55,512
The tools that I got
for my hairdresser,

329
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:58,448
they're very stylized combs
and scissors,

330
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:01,251
and they're actually
very cool tools.

331
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:04,087
I'm taking all the tools,
and I'm casting them in resin,

332
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,755
which is plastic
that's gonna be lighter

333
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:08,091
so that it won't weigh down
my model's fingers.

334
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:11,261
- Oh, nice.
- Really lightweight.

335
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,367
As soon as I get to the lab,
I start working

336
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:19,169
with my full-bodysuit robot.

337
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:21,471
Where is that paper that you
said that you used?

338
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,873
I get some advice from Rashaad

339
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:26,109
because he's the king
of fabrication.

340
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:28,044
You draw it, you cut it,
and then you put it--

341
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,579
- draw two.
- Okay.

342
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,114
It's gonna be
a little bit challenging

343
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:33,416
because it's the first
fabrication that I do

344
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,119
for a whole suit,
so it's very important for me

345
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,921
to take my time and make sure

346
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,256
that I can put all
the pieces together in a way

347
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,358
that looks cool
and it has movement.

348
00:16:42,393 --> 00:16:45,995
And I want to make it
really big.

349
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,964
What you makin'?

350
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:50,633
I'm makin' a robot!

351
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:52,001
I'm taking advantage
of this extra day

352
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:53,770
because I have a lot to do.

353
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,874
I start getting everything
on the spandex suit,

354
00:16:57,908 --> 00:17:00,810
start to tie in tubing
and wires

355
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:03,012
to really give the robot feel.

356
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:04,180
And I want to give the sense
that this thing

357
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,049
has a functioning brain,

358
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,717
so to create this illusion,

359
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:13,022
I glue LED light strips
to the top of the spandex cap.

360
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:14,857
So it almost looks like
a circuit board computer

361
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:18,995
on the inside,
and it looks cool.

362
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:22,632
Today, I've got to get
a helmet made for this robot,

363
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,167
and I've also got
to get a chest piece made,

364
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:25,535
which will reflect light

365
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,638
on whatever the camera's
gonna be taking pictures of.

366
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,241
The first thing I do is
I vacuform over a styrofoam head

367
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:34,110
so I can get a shape
of a helmet.

368
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:37,280
I cut that out, and now I need
to move on to the chest piece.

369
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:41,484
I hope I can just get it right.

370
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:49,192
Today, I need to finish
the legs, the feet,

371
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:51,294
and an arm that goes over
the shoulder.

372
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:53,496
- Is that like a hose?
- Yeah, for--

373
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,531
to feed the water through.

374
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:57,533
My time management
is where I need it to be,

375
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:02,972
and I need to get this armor
latexed down so I can paint it.

376
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,979
I'm gluing L200
onto the bodysuit.

377
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,748
Is that gonna be able to bend?

378
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,049
- Yeah.
- You sure?

379
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,551
- I think so.
- But you glued it all together.

380
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:17,987
So now he won't be able
to move his arms.

381
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:19,355
And Rashaad's telling me

382
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,757
that I kind of, like,
screwed myself.

383
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,426
- It's gonna come apart.
- You think so?

384
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,028
Yeah because
you glued it all straight.

385
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,563
I left some spaces
so he can move,

386
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:29,232
but I glued
the joints together.

387
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:32,368
I put a screw and a washer
so it could bend.

388
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,903
But you glued it all straight,

389
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,738
so it's not gonna be able
to bend now.

390
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:37,707
I don't have time
to do another bodysuit.

391
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,242
You got to leave that open,
and then I hope

392
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,777
you do the same thing
for the legs.

393
00:18:40,811 --> 00:18:42,912
I'm really worried because, if
I don't get this bodysuit

394
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:45,415
done the right way,
I'm gonna be in trouble.

395
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:47,350
I need to fix this
or I'm going home.

396
00:18:47,384 --> 00:18:49,786
Fuck.

397
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,352
It's day three
from our robot challenge.

398
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,786
He won't be able
to move his arms.

399
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,088
Okay.

400
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:02,090
I mistakenly glued
the robot's joints together.

401
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,225
Don't glue nothing there.
Don't glue nothing in the back.

402
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,460
Leave this all open.

403
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,029
And Rashaad starts
giving really good advice,

404
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,365
so I make sure that I unglue
all these parts

405
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,968
and make sure that all
his joints are free of glue

406
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:15,336
so he can actually
have some movement.

407
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,372
I need to fix this
so I can move on

408
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,508
to fabricating the helmet.

409
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:26,914
I'm making vacuform pieces
for the robot arms.

410
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:28,516
The arms are not perfect.

411
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,819
They're not super pristine
like I wanted it to be.

412
00:19:31,854 --> 00:19:33,221
It's kind of rough
on the edges.

413
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,957
They're looking
like vacuform pieces,

414
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:37,925
but with a good paint job,
I'll make it work.

415
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,962
I'll make it happen.

416
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,435
A lot of times in doing armor,

417
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:49,704
people make it
bright and shiny,

418
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,506
but a firefighter
breaking through buildings

419
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,540
and knocking down doors

420
00:19:52,574 --> 00:19:53,908
and having smoke
constantly on them,

421
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,276
it's going to be dirty.

422
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:57,578
It's gonna have scratches
where you can see

423
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,049
the silver metallic paint
under it.

424
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,851
Exactly how I was as
a little kid playing with toys,

425
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,653
this is how I feel
doing this robot.

426
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,756
So I'm in a good place.

427
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:15,463
Feeling very good today.

428
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:17,231
I've got everything done
that I wanted to do.

429
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,300
I've got all of the lenses
and plastic parts

430
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:23,638
and metal pieces for
my futuristic robotic camera.

431
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:26,774
Everybody else seems
to be going really large,

432
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,443
but all I'm doing
is a robot face,

433
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,644
and I'm okay with that.

434
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,045
This is so far
out of my league.

435
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,450
I don't do robots,
so we'll see what happens.

436
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:39,854
All right, guys, it's time.

437
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,725
I feel pretty good
about application day tomorrow.

438
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,294
All's I need to do is get
these things glued to the foam

439
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,196
and start putting
everything together.

440
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,697
Maybe I didn't do enough.

441
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,999
I could be going home
or I could be a winner.

442
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,776
I just don't know.

443
00:20:58,941 --> 00:20:59,907
That's right.

444
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,109
So we get back to the house.

445
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:02,276
We're all completely worn out.

446
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,411
Oh, my God.

447
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:04,612
How do you guys feel?

448
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,047
- Worn out.
- Me too.

449
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:07,415
I'm tired.

450
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,517
With the stress of the
challenge and the competition,

451
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,052
I'm feeling mentally tired.

452
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:13,454
I'm definitely missing
my motorcycle, my girlfriend.

453
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,390
Daran, happy birthday.

454
00:21:15,424 --> 00:21:17,759
Hey, buddy!
Happy birthday to you!

455
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:20,395
Red velvet.

456
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:21,763
Thank you, thank you.

457
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,998
To my surprise, my roommates
know it's my birthday.

458
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,666
I basically forgot
about it myself,

459
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,035
and they bring out my favorite,
red velvet cupcakes.

460
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,904
- Thank you, gents.
- Whoo-hoo!

461
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:31,739
- Final five.
- Final five.

462
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:34,175
We made it this far.
There's only five of us left.

463
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,578
So the pressure is really
on now to get to the finale,

464
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,820
and I'm hopin' I can make it.

465
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:50,391
- Good luck.
- Oh, definitely good luck.

466
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:51,826
So it's application day.

467
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,595
We have four hours in the lab,
and one hour at last looks.

468
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,964
I start taking the robot apart,

469
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,033
knowing that it's all
gonna go back on really well

470
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,101
if everything fits.

471
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:02,403
But I'm also nervous
that this thing

472
00:22:02,438 --> 00:22:03,738
may not fit my model.

473
00:22:03,772 --> 00:22:05,807
I obviously do not know
how everything's gonna turn out

474
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:09,277
until my model
tries this thing on.

475
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,250
So on this application,
I really need to make sure

476
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,952
the face piece is
glued down perfectly

477
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,087
because it will be holding
a lot of weight.

478
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:22,056
So I'm gonna have to put
some latex in it,

479
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,125
which will help the bond
of the glue,

480
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,161
and this should work out great.

481
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,399
Here they come.

482
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,600
You're gonna be a hairdresser
from the future.

483
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:33,901
Okay.

484
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,636
I'm nervous that
it's not gonna fit you

485
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:37,605
'cause it's so tall,
but we'll have to see.

486
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,907
So this is what you got.

487
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,909
I try all the armor on my model

488
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,344
to make sure everything fits.

489
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:44,879
Little kid's dreams.

490
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:46,447
That's exactly how I design.

491
00:22:46,482 --> 00:22:49,450
Every time I design a character,
I always think to myself,

492
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:51,052
"Would my son
want to play with it?"

493
00:22:51,086 --> 00:22:53,988
And I think this robot
looks like a superhero.

494
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:54,989
He looks amazing.

495
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:58,025
Oh, yeah.

496
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,898
This is gonna have a light.

497
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:06,501
For my construction worker,
the first thing

498
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:08,536
that I want to do
is finish that helmet.

499
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,104
Almost there.
Almost there.

500
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,639
I need to work as fast as I can

501
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:14,375
so I can start painting
the whole robot suit.

502
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:18,546
It's big, so it's gonna
take me a little bit of time.

503
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:24,218
Oh, that's a big gap here.
Let me see.

504
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:27,955
I don't want the judges
to be seeing any human form.

505
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,757
Otherwise,
it won't sell as a robot.

506
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,360
So I'm taking
this windshield tint,

507
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:34,028
put it on the surface
of the face.

508
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:35,029
Perfect.

509
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:37,565
And you just see
metallic reflection,

510
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,800
but my model
can actually see through it.

511
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,935
It's very good stuff.

512
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,444
I start zipping everything up,
popping everything on,

513
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,880
and everything
actually fits great.

514
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,649
Ah!

515
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,551
This thing looks like it
can actually operate.

516
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:57,718
It's amazing.

517
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,587
Yeah, it's perfect.

518
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,919
Ten minutes, guys, ten minutes!

519
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,051
Coming around.

520
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:11,399
I'm looking around the room
and noticing

521
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,234
that there are some
really strong makeups.

522
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:14,535
Beautiful.

523
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,637
Everybody's robots
is just lookin' amazing.

524
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:17,738
All right, guys.
It's time.

525
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:18,906
Brushes down.

526
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:20,207
There's only five of us left,

527
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:24,345
and everybody else has wins,
and I don't.

528
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,214
I really have to get a win,
or else there's no way

529
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,151
I can make it to the finale.

530
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:33,621
Coming up...

531
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:34,855
Paint job is still not there.

532
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,424
It's gonna look
like a silver spoon.

533
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,458
I don't have a clue
where I stand.

534
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:38,893
He's amazing.

535
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:40,328
I couldn't believe it
when he walked out.

536
00:24:40,362 --> 00:24:41,596
He's clumsy.

537
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,365
His proportions
are a little wacky.

538
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,967
That is one of the strangest
shapes I've ever seen.

539
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:57,371
Yay, I get my corner!

540
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:00,274
We get to last looks.
We have one hour left.

541
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:02,710
The most important thing is
getting this mouthpiece glued on

542
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:05,246
and gettin' all of these lenses
and plastic parts put on

543
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,615
so this can look like a camera.

544
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:09,483
I've got a hot glue gun.
I've got some five-minute epoxy,

545
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:11,886
and it's just all about
attaching things now.

546
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,554
This little piece I found
attaches right

547
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:15,132
to the top of that.

548
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:18,959
The paint job
is still not there,

549
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:21,162
and everything's gonna look
like a silver spoon.

550
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:24,365
So I decided to go
with a faint gold wash.

551
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:28,335
I think it's working.
It's looking very stylish.

552
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,804
I'm getting the face shield on,

553
00:25:29,838 --> 00:25:30,871
getting everything adjusted.

554
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,840
I'm building this thing
not knowing

555
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:34,141
how it's gonna turn out.

556
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:37,912
I really hope it's enough
for the judges.

557
00:25:37,946 --> 00:25:39,413
It's pretty intense.

558
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:41,449
I'm trying to apply everything
as fast as I can,

559
00:25:41,483 --> 00:25:45,119
but I'm worried if I can get
all the pieces painted and done.

560
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,454
I forgot the box cutter.

561
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:49,056
I got one.
Here.

562
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,225
I've pre-painted so much,
all I have to do

563
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,960
is touch up some weathering
and yellow highlights

564
00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:54,995
on his back,
and he's ready to go.

565
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,199
Ten minutes, guys!

566
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,576
That's it, everybody.
That's time.

567
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,177
I've been pretty steady

568
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:11,645
throughout
this whole competition,

569
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,280
but I really have to get a win

570
00:26:13,315 --> 00:26:15,816
because I definitely
want to be in the finale.

571
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:28,729
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

572
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:31,866
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

573
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,935
First, let's say hello
to our talented panel of judges.

574
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,639
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

575
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:40,674
- Good evening.
- Hello.

576
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:43,611
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

577
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,379
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Ve.

578
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,882
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

579
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:49,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

580
00:26:49,584 --> 00:26:51,719
All right, this week,
your spotlight challenge

581
00:26:51,753 --> 00:26:54,822
was to select a professional
and create a robot

582
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:57,091
that has replaced them
in the workforce.

583
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:59,560
Now, I also asked
that your robots display

584
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:02,329
an extreme functional
or articulating advantage

585
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:04,198
over their human counterparts.

586
00:27:04,232 --> 00:27:06,567
So let's take a look
at your creations.

587
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,760
From a distance, all you see
is this exoskeleton,

588
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,829
and it just looks like this
thing is really operating

589
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,864
in front of my eyes.

590
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:57,885
It looks so cool.

591
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,921
Everything I envisioned
has come to life.

592
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:22,209
This is my first robot that
I've ever attempted to make.

593
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,812
Kept it nice and clean
and robotic looking.

594
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:27,481
I'm very satisfied with it.

595
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:48,869
She's looking very slick
and beautiful.

596
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:52,306
She's looking like a freaking
robot from<i> The Jetsons.</i>

597
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,896
It looks pretty cool.
He has a good presence.

598
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,431
It's looking really big
and massive,

599
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:20,868
and I just want to hear
what the judges have to say.

600
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:28,008
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

601
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:31,845
at the robotic replacements?

602
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,251
It makes sense functionally.

603
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:40,187
Smart thing too about
just doing the spandex bodysuit.

604
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,388
Just let it disappear.

605
00:29:41,423 --> 00:29:43,791
Love the layers.
This is really cool.

606
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,493
And it's cool that he put work
under it for us to see too.

607
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:49,296
- Yeah.
- Good. Thank you.

608
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:52,099
This dude is killer.

609
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,567
It's actually
even better close up, huh?

610
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:56,036
Yeah.
Look at all this detail.

611
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:57,304
- Yeah.
- Wow.

612
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,106
I absolutely love
this flourish,

613
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,841
just to break it up
a little bit.

614
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:05,479
Can you turn to the side?

615
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,148
Look at how tight
that profile is on his head.

616
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,583
Can you turn
all the way around?

617
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:13,954
Plus his choice of weathering,
it gives it history.

618
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:16,690
Okay.
Thank you.

619
00:30:18,727 --> 00:30:20,961
I think heartbeeps have more
complexity in the chest piece

620
00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:22,062
than this thing does.

621
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:24,098
Like a lampshade.

622
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:26,667
Is it possible that something
didn't come out?

623
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,435
I don't have a clue
where I stand.

624
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:31,338
I'm still feeling like I didn't
do enough on this makeup,

625
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,707
so I'm really worried about what
the judges are gonna say.

626
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:35,576
I mean, we really
have just this face.

627
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,878
- This is so minimal.
- It is.

628
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:40,814
I don't do robots, so it could
very well be me going home.

629
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:46,186
Who made your favorite robot?

630
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:49,223
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

631
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:53,412
This is so minimal.

632
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:54,980
We really have just this face.

633
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,782
Maybe I didn't do enough.

634
00:30:56,816 --> 00:30:58,183
It could very well
be me going home.

635
00:30:58,218 --> 00:31:00,118
This is wood.
Hmm.

636
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:03,689
Thanks.

637
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:06,925
It feels so retro accurate,

638
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,228
it could step off of original
<i>Battlestar Galactica--</i>

639
00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:10,562
- Biddy, biddy, biddy.
- Mm-hmm.

640
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:12,965
It's an interesting choice.
I kind of like it there.

641
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,866
I think it's an attachment
for her hand.

642
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:17,903
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

643
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:21,607
There's a ton of work.

644
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:23,575
All scruffy, mind you,

645
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,045
but every single region
has been addressed.

646
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,381
I love whatever this is.

647
00:31:29,415 --> 00:31:31,583
I just wish he would've
explored this more.

648
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:34,620
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

649
00:31:39,092 --> 00:31:41,660
Okay, the judges would now
like to speak with each of you

650
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:42,861
to learn more about your work.

651
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:46,531
- Tyler, step forward.
- Okay.

652
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:52,504
Tyler, tell us how
the profession that you selected

653
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,439
inspired your robot design
this week.

654
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,541
I wanted to do something
like the surgeon of the future,

655
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:58,343
a robot that can really take on

656
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:00,345
the job of several surgeons
at once.

657
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,683
I think you
did a fantastic job,

658
00:32:04,717 --> 00:32:06,485
particularly the construction

659
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:09,121
out of very rudimentary
elements,

660
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:10,922
of the harness that holds

661
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:13,825
that face piece
out from the face.

662
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,061
I think that's your
great triumph this week.

663
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:18,297
It's really cool,
and it's fun to look at.

664
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:19,498
Thank you.

665
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:21,300
She doesn't seem
to be too futuristic,

666
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:23,402
which is kind of a nice thing
in a weird kind of way

667
00:32:23,436 --> 00:32:26,204
because it makes her look
a little bit more familiar.

668
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,140
I think she's pretty sweet,
honey.

669
00:32:28,174 --> 00:32:29,975
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

670
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:33,111
What's great is you've hit
all the right notes

671
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:36,348
of what implies this
being a medical product,

672
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:37,916
and it all kind of stacks up

673
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,818
to being a nice,
solid character.

674
00:32:39,852 --> 00:32:41,086
Thank you.

675
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,123
Tyler, thank you very much.
Please step back.

676
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:51,029
Daran, if you'd please
step to the center.

677
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:57,269
Can you tell us how your
profession inspired your robot?

678
00:32:57,303 --> 00:32:59,771
I chose the futuristic
photographer.

679
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:03,809
I wanted to make a robotic head
that was nothing but a camera.

680
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:05,677
Definitely out of my element.
I don't make robots.

681
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:07,264
I can tell.

682
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:10,782
I'm disappointed in this.

683
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:12,984
It just doesn't have the vavoom

684
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,152
that all the rest of them have.

685
00:33:14,187 --> 00:33:16,088
This looks like a guy
with just, like,

686
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:19,324
a little rubber vest on with
a big plate in the middle of it.

687
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,693
I think you really missed
the mark on this one this week.

688
00:33:21,728 --> 00:33:23,729
Yeah, I don't do robots.
I'm sorry.

689
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:25,697
That right there
is your main problem this week.

690
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,233
Even though the robot thing
is not your bag,

691
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:31,770
focusing on the fundamental
ideas of proportion

692
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:35,498
and functionality
would've helped go a long way.

693
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,629
What I struggle with
is the overall silhouette

694
00:33:37,968 --> 00:33:39,669
and the codpiece thing.

695
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:43,173
It turns it from a potentially
sophisticated concept

696
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:45,441
into a cartoon-like
character.

697
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:46,910
Yeah.

698
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:51,014
Daran, thank you very much.
Please step back.

699
00:33:55,085 --> 00:33:57,131
Rashaad, you're up.

700
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:04,661
So tell us about the profession

701
00:34:04,695 --> 00:34:06,763
and how it inspired this guy.

702
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,431
I always think of a firefighter

703
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,099
as heroic and cool,

704
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:12,435
so that's what inspired
my design.

705
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:15,872
Definitely heroic.

706
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:19,642
You sculpted and fabricated
an entire costume,

707
00:34:19,677 --> 00:34:21,010
which is astonishing.

708
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:22,245
Thank you.

709
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:23,646
I think this is the best thing

710
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:26,015
that you have showed us
so far this season.

711
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,218
- Thank you.
- It's all about function,

712
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:29,752
what the thing does.

713
00:34:29,787 --> 00:34:32,021
And that's exciting, because
that makes you really believe

714
00:34:32,056 --> 00:34:34,991
that the thing was built
for a specific task,

715
00:34:35,025 --> 00:34:36,693
which is exactly
what we asked you to do.

716
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:37,694
Thank you.

717
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:39,028
- He's amazing.
- Thank you.

718
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:40,396
I couldn't believe it
when he walked out.

719
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:42,131
He looks like
he's been through hell.

720
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:45,134
He looks like he's been through
a blowtorch about 40 times.

721
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:46,836
And the fact that you
spray-painted

722
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,971
that yellow is awesome.

723
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,740
You have blown me away
this week.

724
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:52,742
Thank you.

725
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:55,347
Rashaad, you can step back.

726
00:34:58,582 --> 00:34:59,916
You were lookin' for that win.
You got it.

727
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,284
Finally.

728
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:02,318
I hope so.

729
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:05,455
Niko, please step
to the center.

730
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:15,131
Niko, tell us how your
profession inspired your robot.

731
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:18,134
I think about construction
workers, like, big and bulky,

732
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:20,536
and I wanted to create
a big machine

733
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:23,406
that is in the future, but
it's, like, the first series.

734
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,576
You certainly did a lot
of work this week,

735
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,911
but it's a bit clunky,
isn't it?

736
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:30,613
Yeah.

737
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:34,117
Could've been proportioned
a little bit more elegantly

738
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:36,019
and still looked
rough industrial.

739
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,253
Okay.

740
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,921
He does have
that kind of clunky feel,

741
00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:40,356
but he's kind of fun.

742
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:43,626
I particularly like those--
what are they called, Neville?

743
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:45,695
- Hydraulic cylinders?
- Yes.

744
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,096
- Oh, this?
- Yes, the hydraulic cylinders.

745
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:49,499
It's a really neat little touch
that you put on him,

746
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:50,900
and I think he's kind of sweet.

747
00:35:50,934 --> 00:35:52,502
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

748
00:35:52,536 --> 00:35:54,203
His proportions
are a little wacky.

749
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:56,072
He's got this big beluga head.

750
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,607
He's clumsy.

751
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:00,343
There's, like, all sorts of
weird stuff goin' on with this.

752
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:05,548
I'm not really a big fan of it,
but it's cohesive.

753
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,083
Okay.

754
00:36:07,117 --> 00:36:10,153
Niko, thank you.

755
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:16,636
George, please step forward.

756
00:36:19,997 --> 00:36:22,065
Oh, there you go.

757
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,233
All right, can you tell us
how your profession

758
00:36:24,268 --> 00:36:25,868
inspired your robot?

759
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:27,570
Her name is V-3000.

760
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,906
It stands for Venus,
for the goddess of beauty.

761
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,741
I got inspired by high fashion.

762
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,576
I would go to this salon
in a minute.

763
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,747
- I think she's quite beautiful.
- Thank you.

764
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,415
I think she does
a little crossover,

765
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,851
'cause I see she also
has some makeup tools

766
00:36:41,885 --> 00:36:43,419
on the end of her fingers.

767
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:45,121
- Oh, yeah.
- Very well done, George.

768
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:46,622
Thanks.

769
00:36:46,657 --> 00:36:49,092
There's some
very elegant line work

770
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:52,762
that divides up the planes
either for access panels

771
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,797
or just for the sake
of making it pretty.

772
00:36:54,832 --> 00:36:56,666
It's a beautiful piece.

773
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,002
That is one of the strangest
and most bizarre chest shapes

774
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:01,170
I've ever seen.

775
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:03,940
Using those planes
to create something

776
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,742
that suggests female,

777
00:37:05,776 --> 00:37:07,243
that's the high point for me.

778
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:09,479
The form ideas
are near perfection.

779
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:10,980
Thanks, man.

780
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:12,682
George, thank you very much.
If you'd please step back.

781
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:15,461
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

782
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:21,391
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

783
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:22,792
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

784
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,160
while they deliberate.

785
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:26,529
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

786
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:30,933
All right, judges, let's talk
about tonight's looks.

787
00:37:30,968 --> 00:37:32,468
Why don't we start with Tyler?

788
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:35,238
Tyler did an excellent job
with the colors and the shapes

789
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:37,440
conveying a piece
of medical equipment.

790
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:40,343
It feels very much
like a logical progression

791
00:37:40,377 --> 00:37:42,478
from conventional
robotic attempts

792
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:44,247
that we're working with now
into the future

793
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:46,849
where it actually works
and walks around like a person,

794
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:48,017
and I think that's
a really intelligent way

795
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:49,051
to have approached this.

796
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:50,086
Yeah, and I liked the way

797
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,155
that he had
the human facial piece

798
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:54,357
over the top so the patient
would have something

799
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:56,092
to refer to.

800
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,593
All right,
let's move on to Rashaad.

801
00:37:57,628 --> 00:37:58,928
This is awesome.

802
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:01,230
I couldn't believe
all the detail.

803
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:03,332
You could put that thing
in a movie right now.

804
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,402
There are some really
gorgeous design choices,

805
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:10,573
and as a character,
all those layers of paint

806
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:12,341
gives us a sense of history.

807
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,243
It's an impressive amount
of work.

808
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:15,812
All right,
let's move on to George.

809
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:17,380
George's is very well done.

810
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:20,383
For me, this was
an exercise in form.

811
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,718
Even though he had
the utility in the hand,

812
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:25,488
our focus was on the head
and the chest,

813
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:27,390
and it ended up
being beautiful.

814
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:29,025
I like that he used
different techniques

815
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,259
for the metal process.

816
00:38:30,294 --> 00:38:32,361
There's silver
and gold bronzes.

817
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,063
There's hammered,
there's smooth,

818
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:35,631
and he made them all
go together.

819
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:38,434
What did you think
of the name V-3000?

820
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:40,069
Ah, he named it after me,
of course.

821
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:44,207
All right,
let's move on to Niko.

822
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,675
It felt disproportionate.

823
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:49,045
It looked like an old
boxing helmet on top of a face

824
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,580
that made no sense to me.

825
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:51,881
It's so clunky,

826
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,150
particularly
the proportion of the head

827
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:56,719
and the proportion
of the legs and pelvis.

828
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,222
But I loved the chest
and the detail--

829
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:01,991
those little wires that
were embedded in the design.

830
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:03,493
I think it was very successful.

831
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:06,362
Do I think it's as successful
as the other makeups this week?

832
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:07,463
I-- I don't.

833
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,798
I like this robot.
I don't know.

834
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:10,399
You guys are bein'
really hard on him.

835
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:11,501
You know what
was a cool detail?

836
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:14,971
He made animated
hydraulic actuators.

837
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:18,241
That was the one element
that really did say

838
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:19,709
construction equipment.

839
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:21,844
All right,
let's move on to Daran.

840
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:23,312
So disappointing.

841
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:25,181
He decides to just focus
on the head,

842
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:27,617
throw, like, a sheet of foam
over the body,

843
00:39:27,651 --> 00:39:29,719
and even the head
wasn't stellar.

844
00:39:29,753 --> 00:39:31,821
It's convoluted.
It's huge.

845
00:39:31,855 --> 00:39:33,756
It's massive.
It makes no sense.

846
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,526
Even when he was defending it,
if you want to call it that,

847
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,394
he kind of just kept repeating
a simple sentence--

848
00:39:38,428 --> 00:39:39,762
"I don't do robots."

849
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:41,764
Maybe he's not interested
in doing anything

850
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,666
other than what he feels
comfortable doing.

851
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,401
That makes you
very unemployable.

852
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:47,003
Yeah, exactly.

853
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:48,905
All right, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

854
00:39:48,939 --> 00:39:50,907
- Yeah, we have.
- We have.

855
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:52,850
Okay.
Let's bring 'em back out.

856
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:00,917
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

857
00:40:00,951 --> 00:40:04,820
Tyler, there were
such cool and clever solutions

858
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:07,356
in your design that it
was really hard to believe

859
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:08,925
that this is the first time
you've tackled

860
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,693
this level of fabrication.

861
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:13,496
Rashaad,
your robotic firefighter

862
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,398
really felt like a hero,

863
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:16,899
and we loved the decision

864
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:19,235
to place that crest
around his neck.

865
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:24,273
And, George, your robot's
flowing lines and gold paint job

866
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:26,042
really made her quite elegant.

867
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:28,177
All right, Glenn, who
is the winner of this challenge?

868
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:31,614
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

869
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:38,460
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

870
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:43,532
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

871
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:46,702
Rashaad.

872
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:51,473
Your choices were all
so spot on this week.

873
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:53,943
This is the perfect time
to raise your game.

874
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:55,244
Thank you guys so much.

875
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:58,280
Finally got a W.
I can join the winners' circle.

876
00:40:58,315 --> 00:41:01,617
And gettin' a win now definitely
gives me that extra push

877
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,986
and lets me know
that I do have what it takes.

878
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,989
- Rashaad, congratulations.
- Thank you.

879
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:10,559
You, Tyler, and George can
head back to the makeup room.

880
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:12,962
Thank you, guys.

881
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:22,071
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom looks.

882
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,740
Actually, there was only
one bottom look

883
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,243
for us this week.

884
00:41:30,347 --> 00:41:33,482
Daran.

885
00:41:33,516 --> 00:41:35,918
It was really obvious that you
were out of your element,

886
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,687
and you were a bit resigned
because, as you put it,

887
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:39,989
you don't do robots.

888
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:43,626
That sentiment really worked
against you this week.

889
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,928
That means Niko,
you are safe and can head back

890
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,196
to the makeup room.

891
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,298
Thank you, guys.

892
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:50,666
All right, brother.

893
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,069
It's been fun.

894
00:41:55,672 --> 00:41:59,942
Daran, it is obvious that you
are truly a huge talent.

895
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,811
You've shown us some beautiful
and unique designs.

896
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:05,681
We all look forward very much
to seeing what you do next.

897
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:06,682
I appreciate it.

898
00:42:06,716 --> 00:42:08,017
Daran, I'm so sorry,

899
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:10,419
but you have been eliminated.

900
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:12,655
It's really been great
having you here with us,

901
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:14,456
but please head back
to the makeup room

902
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,091
and pack up your kit.

903
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:19,028
- Thank you, guys.
- Good luck, Daran.

904
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:20,596
I'm a little bit sad
I didn't make it to the end.

905
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,964
I was right there.

906
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:25,935
I definitely wanted to go on
and win this competition.

907
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:27,403
What do you think, boys?
What do you think?

908
00:42:27,437 --> 00:42:29,071
- Don't do that.
- Don't do that, bro.

909
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:30,606
- It's you, Daran?
- Yeah.

910
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,408
- What?
- Aw, dude.

911
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:33,609
Ah, brother.

912
00:42:33,643 --> 00:42:35,311
This competition is no joke,

913
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,947
and I'm truly amazed
at the stuff I came up with

914
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:39,114
in the amount of time I did.

915
00:42:39,149 --> 00:42:41,617
- Whoo!
- Fierce hug. Fierce hug.

916
00:42:41,651 --> 00:42:45,020
Bein' here was a blast, and
if this is feelin' like a loser,

917
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:48,791
then I'm very confused
'cause I feel like a winner.

918
00:42:48,825 --> 00:42:51,226
I'll always be a makeup artist.

919
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:53,162
I'm definitely
gonna design more.

920
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,531
I've got a lot of ideas.

921
00:42:55,565 --> 00:42:57,569
This is not the end for me,
of course.
