1
00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:02,095
I couldn't be more pleased
with this makeup.

2
00:00:02,156 --> 00:00:03,590
I think it was
a really huge mistake.

3
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:05,912
It's killer.

4
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:08,795
Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:10,630
13 talented makeup artists

6
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,399
competed
in a monstrous challenge.

7
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:16,903
Tyler's icy dragon soared
to the top for the win,

8
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:20,173
and Daniel was sent home.

9
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:21,908
Now, 12 artists remain,

10
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:25,245
and tonight they face their
most electric challenge yet.

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,013
- Rock and roll.
- Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,416
But some will crash and burn.

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,550
I'm not seeing goat.

14
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:32,619
- It's like a smiling kitty cat.
- Okay.

15
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:35,689
I am having, like, the worst
panic attack in the world.

16
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:37,991
Cat and Niko's mold
is going to weigh

17
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,326
more than both of them combined.

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,009
We're really taking
our chances on this.

19
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,900
_

20
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:44,314
If we don't
have a full bodysuit,

21
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,467
what are we gonna have?
Just a face?

22
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:49,169
This character is a vision.

23
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:51,738
This thing would never last
through a day of shooting.

24
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:53,540
Rock and Roll, Hoochie Coo.

25
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:55,909
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

26
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:57,510
from Kryolan Professional
Make-Up

27
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:00,413
to one of their
85 international locations,

28
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:03,650
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

29
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:05,385
and $100,000.

30
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:08,398
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

31
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,760
<i>Face off!</i>

32
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:16,129

34
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:03,576
- Hey, Tess.
- Hey, Niko.

35
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:04,828
- How do you feel?
- You know.

36
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,313
The last one was pretty hard
for the both of us.

37
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:08,982
I'm definitely confused.

38
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:11,685
I feel like
I'm second-guessing everything.

39
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,386
It doesn't feel good
being in the bottom.

40
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,754
Next time it's the top.

41
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,956
Yeah.
Next time.

42
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,224
I've been off my game
a little bit,

43
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,860
so if I can really pull it
together this challenge,

44
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:23,563
I'll be able to prove myself.

45
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:30,470
Ladies.

46
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:32,572
Thank you, sir.
Ooh.

47
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:36,443
- Holy...
- Not too bad.

48
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:37,544
- That's a cool idea.
- Holy crap.

49
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:38,862
We walk in the lab today,

50
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:43,383
and we see these amazingly
crazy motorcycles,

51
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:46,753
and Patrick Tatopoulos
is standing right there.

52
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:49,389
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

53
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:51,357
Well, as you can see,
today's foundation challenge

54
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:55,795
is inspired by motorcycles,
so who better to judge

55
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,165
than <i>Face Off's</i> resident
bike expert Patrick Tatopoulos?

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,166
- Hello, guys.
- Hey.

57
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:02,869
I'm extremely excited.

58
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:05,038
I'm a huge fan of his work,
and I think he's just amazing.

59
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:06,239
It's great to have you
back on the show.

60
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,475
- Thank you.
- All right, let's get to this.

61
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:10,543
Some of Hollywood's most
memorable characters

62
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,078
look great on a motorcycle,

63
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:13,847
whether it's
comic book hero Batman

64
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:17,150
or even supernatural creatures
like Ghost Rider.

65
00:03:17,184 --> 00:03:18,852
So with that in mind,

66
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:22,255
your foundation challenge is to
choose one of these motorcycles

67
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,891
and create the badass character
that rides it.

68
00:03:24,925 --> 00:03:27,060
- Yeah.
- Nice.

69
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:28,812
So, Patrick, as the judge
of today's challenge,

70
00:03:28,846 --> 00:03:30,964
what will you be looking for
in their final makeups?

71
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,132
You're gonna create creatures

72
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,950
but never forget
what they're sitting on.

73
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,137
The bikes are your clue to
the world the riders come from.

74
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,706
Look at them
in detail, color, shapes.

75
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,124
Make something
people will remember.

76
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:43,243
We have an important prize
on the line.

77
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:46,246
The winner of today's challenge
will earn immunity

78
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,665
and cannot be eliminated
this week.

79
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:52,385
On my go, I want you to choose
a bike and get to work.

80
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,553
You have two hours,

81
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:57,357
and your time...
starts... now.

82
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,424
- Whoo.
- Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

83
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,777
- Got it.
- You.

84
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,229
My character
is a female road warrior

85
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:04,931
in a postapocalyptic society.

86
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,366
You know,
after looking at the bike,

87
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,284
I'm going to keep it
kind of dingy and gritty.

88
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,136
I'm totally going
with a <i>Mad Max</i> theme.

89
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:13,873
I got the yellow
almost Vespa-looking bike.

90
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:16,025
I'm gonna try and do,
like, a graphic-looking

91
00:04:16,076 --> 00:04:18,695
Bumblebee fairy kind of thing.

92
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,180
I've given her a bald cap.

93
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:23,950
So I want it to be like
she paints on her head

94
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:26,553
to emulate the bike.

95
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,857
I picked
the fluorescent green bike.

96
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:33,159
I feel like I could do
a really neat body paint

97
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:35,428
using the colors of the bike,
so it would be very black,

98
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:40,567
very green, so she'll be like an
alien-esque, sexy, badass biker.

99
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,304
I ended up
with a vintage road bike.

100
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,605
He's been riding it
for a long time

101
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,540
and doesn't
really stop riding it.

102
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,809
I'm a big fan of aqua colors.

103
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:54,347
I like to sponge paint and model
with them and really layer 'em.

104
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,852
I think I was the last one to
choose the big train over there.

105
00:04:58,886 --> 00:05:02,171
I'm going for a crazy conductor
who lures passengers on

106
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,790
and takes them away
to some crazy place

107
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:06,075
that no one wants to be.

108
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:08,261
You got five minutes left.

109
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,871
Time's up, everybody.
Brushes down.

110
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:19,222
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

111
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:21,341
- Hey, Tyler.
- Hello.

112
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,176
All right, tell us
about your character today.

113
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,311
So this bike
is like a giant train,

114
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,913
so it kind of inspired me
to do this,

115
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,249
- like, crazy conductor character.
- What is she holding there?

116
00:05:29,283 --> 00:05:30,250
She's holding a ticket to hell.

117
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:31,651
Oh, a ticket to hell.
Fantastic.

118
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,153
- Wanna jump on?
- Look, a prop.

119
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:35,305
The character is great.

120
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:37,123
The idea of a train
is really fantastic.

121
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:39,225
My character
is an alien humanoid.

122
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,727
She had this bike custom-made

123
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:42,712
based on her natural
alien markings.

124
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,130
It feels very ghostly,

125
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:45,281
- and I love that.
- Yeah.

126
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:46,466
I think
it's a beautiful execution.

127
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,467
It's very slick.

128
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:48,935
The paint job is really cool.

129
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,003
Thank you.

130
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:51,154
He was a demon

131
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,705
who fell in love with the bike.

132
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,540
Because it's
his prized possession,

133
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:57,410
the bike stays clean,
and he just lets himself go.

134
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:58,945
Your character is
very realistic, very dark,

135
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:01,614
and the bike is almost silly,
but you know what?

136
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,116
- It's a beautiful piece.
- Thank you.

137
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,851
I wanted to make a badass queen

138
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,185
- that would go with my bike.
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,688
I wanted to bring in
some elements of the copper

140
00:06:08,722 --> 00:06:10,890
in the fingernails
to match the motorcycle.

141
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:12,926
The motorcycle feels
very tribal to me,

142
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,144
and you brought at lot of that
in the character as well,

143
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:18,097
like the mix of colors
through the copper tones.

144
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:19,732
It marries
really well together.

145
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,435
My character--
she's taken on this persona

146
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,103
of, like, the Bumblebee Racer.

147
00:06:24,138 --> 00:06:25,605
You didn't
put hair on her head.

148
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,741
There is something very simple
and slick about the motorcycle,

149
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:30,977
which translated by that.
That to me is the best thing.

150
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,446
I would even have pushed it
a little sleeker even.

151
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:36,549
Looking around,
it's again anybody's game.

152
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,519
Everybody has amazing talent
and interesting concepts.

153
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:42,889
Getting immunity would let me
create an amazing character

154
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:45,375
without the stress
of the competition,

155
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:48,962
which would be really awesome.

156
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:51,431
All right, Patrick,
what did you think

157
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:52,966
of the creations today?

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,550
I loved them all, seriously.

159
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:55,802
Thank you.

160
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:57,403
All right, who created
your favorite looks today?

161
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:59,806
Tanner, great job
for the paint.

162
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,458
Absolutely bold and strong
and stark lines.

163
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,860
Thank you very much.

164
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:06,980
Daran, you brought the road
warrior to another level.

165
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:09,349
That tribal look
really works for me.

166
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:10,450
Thank you.

167
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:12,251
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

168
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:16,289
The winner
of this challenge is...

169
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:19,525
Daran.

170
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,494
- Nice.
- Awesome.

171
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:22,562
Thank you.

172
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:23,663
I love your choice of color,

173
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,064
and the whole character together

174
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:27,100
was very much in symbiosis
with the bike.

175
00:07:27,134 --> 00:07:28,685
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

176
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:29,736
That's awesome.

177
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,537
Daran, congratulations.

178
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:34,374
You have earned immunity
in the next spotlight challenge.

179
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,175
The immunity
gives me the chance

180
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,778
to go a little more bold
and extreme,

181
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:39,929
which is what
this season is about.

182
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,213
All right, Patrick,
thank you so much

183
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,598
- for being here with us.
- It was great.

184
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:43,883
I'm glad I was here today
with you guys.

185
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:44,867
You guys are amazing.

186
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,085
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,121
All right, guys,
I will see you tomorrow

188
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:49,922
for your next
spotlight challenge.

189
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:51,657
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

190
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:54,227
Thank you.

191
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:03,803
Oh, wow.

192
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:05,338
I like this already.

193
00:08:05,372 --> 00:08:08,091
We're walking into the lab,
and I see McKenzie and Glenn

194
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:13,146
and all of these really amazing
guitars, and I'm so excited.

195
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,451
This looks like it's gonna
be an awesome challenge.

196
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:20,920
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

197
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:24,257
Some say that there is no
bigger influence to pop culture

198
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,792
than rock and roll.

199
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,126
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

200
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:29,545
Legends like Chuck Berry
and Elvis Presley,

201
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:31,114
bands like the Beatles and U2

202
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:35,568
have used music to inspire,
unite, and shape society.

203
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,720
And none of it
would have been possible

204
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:41,140
- without an electric guitar.
- None of it.

205
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:43,976
Which brings us to
your next spotlight challenge.

206
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:47,029
The best guitar players
in the world are so good,

207
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:50,433
it's almost as if they're
one with their instrument.

208
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:52,552
So working in teams of two,

209
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:54,187
your spotlight challenge
is to select

210
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,456
one of these amazing guitars

211
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,058
and create an extreme
rock star character

212
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:01,327
that has literally fused
with their guitar.

213
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,896
- Nice.
- That's cool.

214
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:04,931
This is awesome.

215
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:07,066
I love music, so I'm stoked.

216
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,935
All right, now, Glenn,
you're a musician.

217
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:12,371
You've even designed
a custom guitar for Lady Gaga.

218
00:09:12,406 --> 00:09:15,441
What will you be looking for
in the final makeups?

219
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:18,244
I'm going to focus on just
how clever each of you are

220
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,848
at integrating your instrument
with your model.

221
00:09:21,882 --> 00:09:23,716
Take advantage
of the extremely unique designs

222
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,818
of these instruments
and incorporate their shapes,

223
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:29,655
colors, and even their
personalities into your designs.

224
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,375
All right, you will be working
together in teams of two,

225
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:36,345
but this time, you get to decide
who you're going to work with.

226
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,897
Oh.

227
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:41,617
So go ahead
and choose your new bandmate.

228
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:47,340
Instantly,
everyone couples off real fast.

229
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:48,875
Tess and I are the last ones,

230
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,643
and we don't have a partner,
so we're together.

231
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:51,877
It's me and Matt.

232
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:54,163
We don't really know
how each other work,

233
00:09:54,214 --> 00:09:56,682
so it's gonna be interesting.

234
00:09:56,717 --> 00:09:59,719
All right, guys, it's time
to select your guitars.

235
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:01,254
Cat and Niko, you're up first.

236
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:03,099
- The first red one?
- Yeah.

237
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Okay.

238
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,870
All right, guys,
get started on your designs.

239
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:20,706
I'm gonna stop by later on with
my dad to see how you're doing.

240
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:21,807
Good luck, guys.

241
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:23,442
Thank you.

242
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:28,147
We just
make these more angular.

243
00:10:28,182 --> 00:10:29,815
I'm feeling good
about this challenge

244
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,118
because Tanner and I have really
wanted to work together.

245
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:33,553
Our concept for this rock star

246
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:35,922
is a red and black queen
of shredding.

247
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:38,991
We want to hide these shapes all
throughout this makeup,

248
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:41,594
so we're gonna do this mohawk

249
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:45,264
with vacuform pieces that are
the shape of the guitar,

250
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,500
and Tanner's gonna
sculpt out the cowl.

251
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:49,468
In that will be more hidden Vs

252
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:51,103
and then guitar picks
for the nails.

253
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,371
I love that idea.

254
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:55,358
- Standard grain pattern.
- This part here.

255
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:56,676
George knows
that I have immunity.

256
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,311
I'm not sure
if he's nervous or scared,

257
00:10:58,345 --> 00:10:59,979
but I'm not gonna let him down.

258
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:02,365
I'm a little confused
how we're going to integrate

259
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,750
the clear guitar
into our character.

260
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:06,586
I've always wanted
to do a makeup

261
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,255
where the face is actually
on the neck area,

262
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:10,456
so we're gonna get rid
of the model's face

263
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,391
and make our own face
down under the chin.

264
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:13,442
Can you picture
her lips right here?

265
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:14,927
- Yeah.
- This is her head.

266
00:11:14,962 --> 00:11:16,429
This is cool.

267
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:19,131
Our concept
is a heavy metal goddess.

268
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,200
It's a complete transformation
kind of thing.

269
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,902
The wood and the crystals
are trying

270
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:24,737
to take this character over.

271
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,039
Let's get clay.

272
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:32,778
Our concept for our character
is a punk rock kid

273
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:34,413
that makes a deal
with the devil,

274
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:35,648
and the devil
ends up turning him

275
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:38,417
into this demonic
guitar rock god.

276
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:39,885
All right,
we've got this, Niko.

277
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,355
We decided to sculpt
a full bodysuit,

278
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,040
so she start working
on the face.

279
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:47,627
I start working on the cowl,
chest, and back piece.

280
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:49,295
Niko and I are boyfriend
and girlfriend,

281
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,230
but we also work together a lot.

282
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:53,733
To be able to share
this whole experience with Niko,

283
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,834
it's priceless.

284
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:56,402
You know on my team
who's in charge.

285
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:57,753
Cat.

286
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,372
Cat, yes.
I was gonna say Cat.

287
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:00,745
Mm-hmm, yeah.

288
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:10,983
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

289
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:12,116
Here to do our walkthrough.

290
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:13,992
So remind us again
which guitar you picked.

291
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,193
We picked this guitar.

292
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:17,362
The guitar makes me
think of Rockabilly,

293
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:21,066
and Tess thought it would
be fun to do a rocker billy.

294
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,969
- Billy goat.
- So we're doing a goat man

295
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:26,471
rocker who's starting
to fuse into his guitar.

296
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm not seeing goat right away.

297
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:30,575
Okay.

298
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,144
There's a jowl on the goat
which you don't have here.

299
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:34,679
It's like you have
a very human form.

300
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,448
What about the nose?

301
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,750
To me it's like
a smiling kitty cat.

302
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:39,734
Okay.

303
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:40,986
Our design is risky,

304
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,587
and I don't want to be
on the bottom again.

305
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,256
Dude, I don't know what to do.

306
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,657
That's okay.
We'll figure it out.

307
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:47,359
He said that it
looks like a cat.

308
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,476
- It'll be all right.
- Oh.

309
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,563
I have never had
so much anxiety in my life.

310
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,269
Shit! Shit!

311
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:59,471
Tess has been having
a really hard time emotionally.

312
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,506
She's letting
the stress get to her.

313
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,007
Matt, I'm so sorry.

314
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,476
I'm having, like,
the worst panic attack

315
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,061
- in the world right now.
- Just calm down.

316
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,579
It's overwhelming me.

317
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,564
I can't really breathe,

318
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:12,067
and there's no time
to take a break,

319
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:13,735
but I kind of need
to take a break

320
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,121
before I just
absolutely lose it.

321
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:22,694
I'm having, like, the worst
panic attack in the world.

322
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,083
Coming up...

323
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:26,548
_

324
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:27,279
_

325
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:29,067
What are we gonna have,
just a face?

326
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,369
We're really taking a big
chance with Daran's design.

327
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:32,804
I am very worried.

328
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:35,573
- It is genuinely unique.
- Wow.

329
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,899
Rock And Roll, Hoochie Coo.

330
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,302
Our challenge
is to pick a guitar

331
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:46,703
and create the rocker

332
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:49,606
that is literally
becoming fused with it.

333
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,008
We want to do
a rocker billy goat.

334
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:56,479
Tess is upset about the advice
from Mr. Westmore.

335
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:59,266
Mr. Westmore tells us
that the face that I'm making

336
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:00,567
isn't very goatlike.

337
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:02,118
It's much more catlike.

338
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:06,122
I'm having, like, the worst
panic attack in the world.

339
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:08,525
I feel really bad
that I'm having this meltdown

340
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,930
in the middle of us
needing to finish our sculpt.

341
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,349
I don't know
what's going on with Tess,

342
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:20,103
but right now
we're not looking so good.

343
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,639
Yeah, we sort of have
this psychedelic style guitar.

344
00:14:22,673 --> 00:14:23,723
- Interesting.
- Almost a paisley, isn't it?

345
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:24,758
- It's got paisley.
- Yeah.

346
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,076
So we're thinking of, like,

347
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,911
psychedelic acid trip.

348
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:30,180
Our concept is a trippy hippie,

349
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:32,749
where as he's jamming out
on his guitar,

350
00:14:32,783 --> 00:14:34,117
he's becoming one with it,

351
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:36,319
and it's also distorting
his features.

352
00:14:36,354 --> 00:14:38,421
And then we're just gonna try
to have this paisley design

353
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,156
trail down one of the arms.

354
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:41,174
That's a great idea

355
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,359
incorporating
the paisley into it.

356
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:44,244
How are you planning
on painting this?

357
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:45,595
Are you gonna cut a stencil?

358
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,280
I think cutting
a stencil's a good idea.

359
00:14:47,315 --> 00:14:48,448
- Yeah.
- Wow.

360
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:49,599
Look at that coloring in there.

361
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:50,734
- The detail.
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:52,202
Our character
is a demon rock star.

363
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:53,603
He is literally
becoming his guitar,

364
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:56,473
so I'm incorporating
that crackle texture

365
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,608
that's in our guitar
onto the face.

366
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:00,677
The detail that you're doing,
do it deeper than that.

367
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:01,711
Oh, yeah.

368
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,746
This is an ideal place

369
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,447
- to put your base color on.
- Okay.

370
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:06,416
Put your red over the top,
and it'll pick up

371
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,567
- just like the guitar is.
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:08,585
- Okay.
- Yeah.

373
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:09,619
We also are gonna incorporate

374
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:11,421
those clear plastic pieces

375
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:14,257
as kind of, like,
the pectoral muscles and--

376
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,925
And using that little hint
of silver around it.

377
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,160
- Great.
- Great.

378
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:18,161
- Good luck to you.
- Good luck, guys.

379
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:19,346
Thank you.

380
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,847
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

381
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:21,864
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

382
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:24,167
- Thank you.
- Bye.

383
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:28,638
The competition
is just weighing down on me,

384
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:30,807
and I just wish
that I could get it together.

385
00:15:30,841 --> 00:15:34,711
Matt and I
are running out of time.

386
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:36,779
_

387
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,648
No.

388
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:39,632
What do you need me to do?

389
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:41,584
- Just focus on the guitar stuff?
- Yeah.

390
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:44,287
After Tess comes back in,
I tell her to take some time

391
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:46,056
cleaning up on the chest piece.

392
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,325
I'm gonna work on getting
the face a little more goatlike

393
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:50,060
and then get it ready
for molding.

394
00:15:50,094 --> 00:15:51,811
We can make it rock.
Don't worry.

395
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:53,396
Matt's being really supportive.

396
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:57,367
He gives me
my time to calm down.

397
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,505
I think it's done.
It looks friggin' beautiful.

398
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,807
Let's mold it.

399
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,008
We're getting down
to the end of the day.

400
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:06,910
Let's mold this thing.

401
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:09,178
Having the face on early

402
00:16:09,196 --> 00:16:13,750
means tomorrow I can focus
on getting that cowl done.

403
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:17,987
After I take over the face, I
sculpted the chin, the lip area,

404
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:19,773
and some of the sides
of the face

405
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:21,557
to try to bring in more
of the goat elements.

406
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:24,160
All right, I'm gonna
go get this molded them.

407
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:25,195
- Hey.
- Where'd it go?

408
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:28,031
High five.
Come on.

409
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,600
- Gonna get it done on time?
- I don't know.

410
00:16:30,634 --> 00:16:32,335
Oh, we only have 21 minutes.

411
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,687
Yeah, I'm just gonna get
another coat on it.

412
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:37,307
I know we're not gonna
get these ready for foam today.

413
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:39,726
At least if we can get
these both molded tonight,

414
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:41,327
they'll be ready to go
in the morning.

415
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:43,496
After you get another layer
on this, can you come help me?

416
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:44,881
Yep.
Totally.

417
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,049
Tess is a little worried,

418
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,001
but I think as long
as I stay calm

419
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:50,854
and keep a positive attitude,
we'll be okay.

420
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:52,489
That's time, people.

421
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:54,791
We're just gonna do
what we have time to do.

422
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:58,828
There's no time to stress out
about what ifs.

423
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:10,707
Day two of the challenge,
I want to get these molds done

424
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:13,143
so that we have time
to get enough paisley out

425
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:14,961
to cover an arm.

426
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:19,015
I run back to open up
the face mold.

427
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,316
Cool, thanks.

428
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:23,103
And Tanner is cleaning up
the cowl sculpture

429
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,188
so that we can start
molding it.

430
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:27,891
I'm really excited
at the way it's looking.

431
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:29,058
I think that's cool.

432
00:17:29,093 --> 00:17:31,961
I like it.

433
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:35,364
Niko and I give ourselves
two hours to finish sculpting

434
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:37,350
before we start
molding that thing.

435
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:39,669
It's a lot to mold
because everything is connected.

436
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,938
Graham, do you think
we should chop the horns?

437
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:43,506
It would make your mold
a lot easier.

438
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,575
I know in a perfect world,
I would cut the horns off

439
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:48,678
and do a two-piece mold,
but we don't have time for that.

440
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:49,913
Holy fuck.

441
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:52,248
Cat and Niko's mold
is going to weigh

442
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:53,783
more than both of them combined.

443
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:55,433
Like, I hope
that they can get this done.

444
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,118
_

445
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,519
_

446
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,187
_

447
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,091
We're really taking
our chances on this.

448
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:04,694
We didn't want to take time
molding the horns,

449
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,329
molding the bodysuit,
and we decided

450
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:08,097
let's just trust ourself
and do this.

451
00:18:08,115 --> 00:18:10,533
Are you doing the single layer
on the body, a double layer?

452
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,470
- Double layer and that's it.
- Okay.

453
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,590
And the parts were gonna
be here or on this one?

454
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,342
The clear plastic parts.

455
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:20,960
They're gonna be on this one.

456
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:22,462
- On this one?
- Yeah.

457
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:25,215
In this makeup, we're going to
make a dome from clear elements

458
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:26,850
to cover up the model's face.

459
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:28,151
How many clear parts are there?

460
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:29,252
- Just this one?
- Six.

461
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:30,253
Six clear parts.

462
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:31,421
Where is she looking out of?

463
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,956
- The top part.
- The dome.

464
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,325
As I'm sculpting,
I put the plastic into the clay

465
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,993
and sculpt around it,
and then I've got to

466
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:39,162
pull the plastic out later,
so we can mold this thing.

467
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:40,797
- This piece goes here.
- Yep.

468
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:43,867
I don't see any shapes
of the guitar on Daran's design,

469
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:45,034
and I'm a little worried.

470
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,135
We really have to make sure

471
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:48,204
that the vacuform pieces
fit into the foam

472
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:50,640
because that's
the guitar element.

473
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:52,475
It has to work.
We'll make it work.

474
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,878
This one here.
Nice, dude.

475
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:57,130
Cat and I--
we're working great,

476
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,631
going as fast as we can,

477
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:01,284
but we still have to open
the mold and then clean it.

478
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:04,220
We're trying to open it,
trying to go as slow as we can.

479
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,572
- You got it.
- Is that the--

480
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:07,840
- the front's coming off?
- Yeah.

481
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,343
Or is it the back?

482
00:19:10,377 --> 00:19:12,262
The whole thing's
coming out with it.

483
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:14,097
- There she goes.
- Boom.

484
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,299
It just opens really easy,
really fast.

485
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,285
Beautiful.
Oh, like butter.

486
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:20,686
_

487
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,869
We're starting
to open the other side.

488
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,242
_

489
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:27,143
_

490
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:28,361
We were risking ourself

491
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:29,879
when we decided to mold it
with the horn.

492
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:33,269
If the mold locks, we'll really
have problems with this.

493
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,770
_

494
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,402
If we don't
have a full bodysuit,

495
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:40,023
what are we gonna have,
just a face?

496
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:45,992
_

497
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,029
_

498
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,481
I think it's one of the biggest molds
that we have done together.

499
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:52,517
We were risking ourself
when we decided

500
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:53,851
to mold it with the horns.

501
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:56,838
If it locks, we can really have
problem with this,

502
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,976
so we're really
taking our chances.

503
00:19:58,977 --> 00:20:00,134
_

504
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:06,731
All right.
All right. Got it.

505
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:07,782
So it's a miracle.

506
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:09,367
We end up cleaning out
and finishing

507
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:10,802
our molds early.

508
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,770
I think everyone in the shop was
kind of holding their breath,

509
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:14,572
waiting to see if we could
really pull it off.

510
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,474
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoo!

511
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,475
And we did it.

512
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:20,645
Biggest mold in the house.

513
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:31,506
Originally, our character was
just gonna have a clear plate

514
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:34,492
on his chest, but I figured
that's going too simple.

515
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,311
I'm pretty sure the judges
are gonna want to see

516
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:37,729
something else under there.

517
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,981
- Take some L200 for ribs...
- Okay.

518
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,132
...and then put this over.

519
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,752
I begin to fabricate
his clear heart,

520
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:46,671
some other internal organs,

521
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,873
which look mechanical
like our guitar,

522
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:50,858
which I can put together all
under that plastic sheet,

523
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,176
which will make it
look amazing.

524
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:56,247
Liking this already.
Yep.

525
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,416
Hey, what are you guys
doing over here?

526
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,500
It looks pretty interesting.

527
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:01,586
I'm trying to make
some paisley.

528
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,620
- Okay.
- And I'm trying to just

529
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:03,621
make it look, like, you know--

530
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:05,256
like I can sculpt.

531
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,526
Corinne traces the design of the
paisley onto a piece of paper,

532
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,063
so we're able to trace
those drawings with the clay,

533
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:15,333
which is making creating these
patterns a little bit easier.

534
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,168
I'm looking at our design,
and I'm like,

535
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:19,504
if this doesn't read right,

536
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,573
it is gonna look like
a big mess of nothing.

537
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:25,610
Come with me, children.

538
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:33,534
Girl!

539
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:35,853
Tess has been working on
the horns most of the morning,

540
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:38,256
but she's just about ready
to get molding.

541
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,440
Hey, looking pretty cool.

542
00:21:39,475 --> 00:21:40,742
Do you like how it, like,

543
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:42,210
is a horn that turns
into the fret bars?

544
00:21:42,244 --> 00:21:43,695
- Yeah.
- Cool.

545
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:46,898
Now that I have these forms
sculpted, I find poster board,

546
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,568
and I make a box mold
out of that,

547
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,921
and I pour it up
out of silicone,

548
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:57,809
and I've just got to wait
for it to set up now.

549
00:21:57,843 --> 00:21:59,861
Graham, what time is it?

550
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:01,879
It's 23 to the end
of the world.

551
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:06,917
Once it's finished,
I pour rigid foam into my mold.

552
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:11,839
In about ten minutes,
I have a horn.

553
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:14,525
There you go.

554
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,961
I am a little worried
'cause I think that our design

555
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:19,063
is starting to go
way too simple.

556
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:22,166
Time.
Brushes down!

557
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:24,936
But I think once
all the pieces come together,

558
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,272
it's going to look really fun.

559
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:38,633
It's application day.

560
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:41,519
We have four hours in the lab
and one hour for last looks.

561
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:42,620
Close.

562
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:43,955
It's a big prosthetic piece.

563
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,556
Niko has to spend a lot of time

564
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:47,425
seaming and patching
this monster.

565
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,495
But because everything
is in one piece,

566
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:52,647
we don't have any edges
that are gonna show.

567
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:55,233
- Where are the horns?
- In the bucket.

568
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,467
Oh, yeah.

569
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:58,853
Matt and I only have
two pieces to do today--

570
00:22:58,887 --> 00:23:02,440
a face and a chest piece--
so they need to be flawless.

571
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:04,909
We want our application
to be really solid

572
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,145
and a good paint scheme going
for the judges.

573
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,013
- Are you excited?
- I am.

574
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:12,250
Me too.

575
00:23:12,284 --> 00:23:14,252
- Hello, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

576
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:16,420
- Hi, how's it going?
- Good.

577
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,756
First with our model,
we apply a bald cap,

578
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:21,325
and we place the cowl and
make sure everything lines up

579
00:23:21,343 --> 00:23:23,347
with his neck and he can move.

580
00:23:23,348 --> 00:23:24,648
***

581
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:26,463
Me and Tyler are
like the dynamic duo.

582
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,632
We just know what we want,
and we get things done.

583
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,337
- You got it?
- Yeah.

584
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:34,605
Like a glove.

585
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,507
Like a head glove.

586
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,811
We really, really, really got
to get that face stuck down.

587
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:42,880
So our trick is to put a plastic
bag over the model's head,

588
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,015
so we can slip the cowl on.

589
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,132
It goes on a lot easier,

590
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:47,318
so there's no tension.

591
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:49,353
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- We got the mouth perfect.

592
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,405
George and I are trying to judge
our time wisely.

593
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:53,524
We've got the dome pieces
and all these plastic pieces

594
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:54,992
that have to go on the model.

595
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,762
We want to make sure she can
breathe and have an open view.

596
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:09,473
So I have these vacuform pieces

597
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,776
that I made for the mohawk,
and I have to paint them

598
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,245
and get them ready
to be applied onto our cowl.

599
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,546
And it's an integral part
of our makeup

600
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:19,583
because that V-shape
is our guitar.

601
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:22,787
Niko and I have a lot to do.

602
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:25,423
We have a lot more painting, and
we need to get him in wardrobe

603
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:26,791
and get his nails on.

604
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:27,925
We've really got to move it

605
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:30,695
if we want to get
this character together.

606
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:32,330
I'm a little bit worried

607
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:35,099
because we're definitely
not as "Rock and Roll"

608
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,101
as everything else is looking,

609
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:39,620
but George and Daran,
I don't even know what that is.

610
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:41,706
It looks like a mushroom
with a fishbowl on it.

611
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,008
25 minutes.

612
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,252
This is not working at all,
man.

613
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,954
I am very worried
because it's way different

614
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:57,955
from everybody else.

615
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,574
It's like, oh, my God.

616
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:02,526
We're, like, so different.

617
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:07,965
All right, guys, it's time.

618
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,818
We're really taking a big
chance with Daran's design,

619
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,153
and Daran has immunity,

620
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:14,655
I don't,
so if the judges don't like it,

621
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,309
I'm going home for sure.

622
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:20,511
It sucks to be
in that position.

623
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:27,318
Coming up...

624
00:25:27,352 --> 00:25:28,903
I'm out of options.

625
00:25:28,954 --> 00:25:31,889
All I can do at this point is
hope to God they don't come off.

626
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:34,392
This character
as a whole is a vision.

627
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:37,261
I mean, the thing would never
last through a day of shooting.

628
00:25:44,596 --> 00:25:45,893
Let's do it.

629
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:49,233
Here's the glue.

630
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,367
We get to last looks.

631
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,203
We've got to get
the LEDs glued in,

632
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:53,704
glue in the vacuform pieces.

633
00:25:53,738 --> 00:25:55,289
That's gonna
take a while to stick.

634
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:57,374
And if these things
don't stay or fit right,

635
00:25:57,409 --> 00:25:58,826
that's gonna
ruin the whole makeup.

636
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,779
Okay, here we go.

637
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,214
You think she's good on black?

638
00:26:03,248 --> 00:26:05,215
Maybe shade
the in-between areas.

639
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,685
We definitely need to hammer
home this paint job

640
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:10,254
because right now
she's pretty much red.

641
00:26:10,288 --> 00:26:11,856
Chloe and I
are scrambling around,

642
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,526
I'm gluing like crazy,
everything's a blur.

643
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,294
- Right there, yeah.
- Turn it on now.

644
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:18,345
Yeah.

645
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:19,647
String's not sticking?

646
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:22,600
It's 'cause I keep
pushing on him.

647
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:24,472
_

648
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:25,743
It already fell off once.

649
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:28,906
The horn pops off,
and it's got me really worried.

650
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,807
I'm out of options.

651
00:26:30,826 --> 00:26:32,176
All I can do at this point

652
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,712
is hope to God
they don't come off again.

653
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:37,815
15 minutes, guys.

654
00:26:42,254 --> 00:26:44,088
Okay, guys.
Time's up.

655
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:45,489
Mission accomplished.

656
00:26:46,491 --> 00:26:47,658
For the first time,

657
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:50,394
I'm not really afraid
of anything.

658
00:26:50,428 --> 00:26:54,298
They asked for a rock star,
and we're gonna give it to them.

659
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:10,748
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

660
00:27:10,782 --> 00:27:14,652
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

661
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:17,504
But first let's say hello
to your talented judges.

662
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,624
Owner of Optic Nerve Make-Up
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

663
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:22,459
- Good evening, guys.
- Hey, Glenn.

664
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:24,929
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

665
00:27:24,963 --> 00:27:27,464
Rock out, guys.

666
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,800
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

667
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,835
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Neville.

668
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,238
This week
your spotlight challenge

669
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,539
was to choose a guitar

670
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:38,492
and create
the extreme rock star character

671
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,744
that has literally
fused with it.

672
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,393
So let's take a look
at your rock stars.

673
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:10,741
There is nothing else I could
think to put in that thing.

674
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:14,378
We're both feeling good because
we both love the character.

675
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:34,999
Ours is the only one
where we decided

676
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:36,917
to go whimsical and silly.

677
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:39,369
I just don't know
if the judges are gonna love

678
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:42,806
how literal we took it.

679
00:29:01,593 --> 00:29:03,294
I think
she's very rock and roll.

680
00:29:03,328 --> 00:29:07,131
There's no way the judges
can't see the V-shaped guitar

681
00:29:07,165 --> 00:29:09,950
everywhere in that makeup.

682
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:31,005
Everything looks awesome.

683
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,022
I'm so happy.

684
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:33,557
I'm hallucinating looking at it,

685
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:34,925
so if that's happening for me,

686
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,895
I'm hoping it's gonna happen
for the judges.

687
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:59,616
This is the biggest thing Niko
and I have ever made together.

688
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:02,186
It's exactly what I envisioned
as soon as I saw the guitar.

689
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,423
This is my demonic
punk rock guitar god.

690
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:28,445
She looks great, but I'm
a little nervous about it

691
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,814
'cause Daran has immunity, so if
anything goes wrong with this,

692
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:34,852
it's not gonna be him,
it's gonna be me.

693
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:40,874
Judges, time to take
a closer look at our rockers.

694
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:51,001
Wow.

695
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,953
Lot of stuff going on.

696
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:55,089
- Yeah.
- I like this.

697
00:30:55,123 --> 00:30:59,143
Like, seeing through a chest
shape into instrumentation

698
00:30:59,177 --> 00:31:01,378
that's just integrated
to the inside.

699
00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:03,180
- That's cool in there.
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:31:03,214 --> 00:31:04,579
Thank you.

701
00:31:07,135 --> 00:31:08,852
- This is gorgeous.
- Uh-huh.

702
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:11,555
All the tones they picked
are exactly the right balance

703
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:12,890
to get this skin tone.

704
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:15,025
These are kind of wonky,
aren't they?

705
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,110
Do me a favor,
shake your head around.

706
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,412
- Go yes and no.
- Yep.

707
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:19,430
- Oh, boy.
- Whoop.

708
00:31:19,464 --> 00:31:21,765
- Oh!
- Fuck! Damn.

709
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,434
I don't even want to look
at the judges right now.

710
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:26,470
If it can't hold up to simply
saying yes or no with his head,

711
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:27,738
that's a serious problem.

712
00:31:27,772 --> 00:31:29,006
Those damn horns.

713
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,902
They're gonna
kill me in the end.

714
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:37,531
Who made your favorite
guitar-infused rock star tonight?

715
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:40,567
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

716
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:46,853
- Go yes and no.
- Yep.

717
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:48,666
- Oh, boy.
- Fuck! Damn.

718
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,452
That's a serious problem.

719
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,058
I don't even want to look
at the judges right now.

720
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,380
*** that shape.

721
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,749
It just doesn't feel
very integrated.

722
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,268
- Do you think they like that?
- I don't know.

723
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:06,923
- I think this is bitchin'.
- Yeah, it's great.

724
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,991
- Thanks.
- Wonderful.

725
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,408
Thanks.

726
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,131
From the front view,
all we have really is a demon.

727
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,248
Yeah.

728
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,235
Could you turn
all the way around, please?

729
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,703
Oh, that's cool.

730
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,772
This is where
it comes together.

731
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:24,167
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

732
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,294
- This is freaky.
- Yeah.

733
00:32:27,328 --> 00:32:29,396
I don't understand
what this is.

734
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,599
I think there's a lot that we have
to hear about the story of this.

735
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:35,440
- Thank you.
- Cool. Thanks.

736
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:40,323
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

737
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:41,658
Let's find out
what they thought.

738
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,628
Niko, Cat,

739
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:47,964
Graham, and Corinne,

740
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,416
you guys are safe this week.

741
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,751
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room.

742
00:32:50,785 --> 00:32:52,235
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

743
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,810
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

744
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,094
Now, the judges would like
to speak with each of you

745
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,280
to learn more about your work.

746
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,650
Tyler and Rashaad,
please step up.

747
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,372
Tell me about your concept

748
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,957
and how you integrated
your guitar

749
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,125
into your character.

750
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,128
We picked the guitar
with the crackle design.

751
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,262
He wanted to join a band,

752
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,398
so he sold his soul
to the devil.

753
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,966
And he became
part of the guitar.

754
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,203
I like your aesthetic approach
very much.

755
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,438
The thing I like the most

756
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,208
is your taking elements
from the guitar

757
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,043
and making them internal.

758
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

759
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,479
I think this
is a really cool makeup.

760
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,314
Very impressive.

761
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,183
Beautiful sculpting work
on that face piece.

762
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,219
The paint job is beautiful.

763
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,520
I took a close look
at the guitar,

764
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:46,239
and it looks like
it is the same textures.

765
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,658
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

766
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:50,293
Tyler and Rashaad,
please step back.

767
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,296
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

768
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,068
Matt and Tess.

769
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,776
Please tell us the concept
and whose basic design this was.

770
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,912
I came up with the concept
of the Rockabilly Goat.

771
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,181
I sculpted the face
and the horns.

772
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,716
Matt sculpted the body.

773
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,617
I painted
pretty much everything,

774
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,521
and then Tess helped me in
last looks to finish up stuff.

775
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,191
It looks like a cross between
Gary Busey and Ron Perlman.

776
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,027
Just a little silly.

777
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,463
You did a really nice paint job
on the arms.

778
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,466
You should have done that on
the face too and on the chest.

779
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,036
I happen to like what you did
with the character conceptually,

780
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,338
but it feels like
you're sticking this stuff on

781
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,741
in the most obvious of ways.

782
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,593
It's a guitar
painted onto a guy,

783
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,978
and it lacks the complexity

784
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,214
and cleverness
that I was looking for,

785
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,499
but none of that bothers me

786
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:48,351
so much as the instability
of the horns.

787
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,421
Thing would never last
through a day of shooting.

788
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:54,758
Matt and Tess,
you can head back.

789
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,093
Thanks, man.

790
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,933
Tanner and Chloe, you're up.

791
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,654
Tell us about the concept

792
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,740
and how the guitar
influenced your design.

793
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,509
She's the dark lord
of shredding.

794
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:16,713
'Cause our guitar shape was very
simple and angular and powerful,

795
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,832
we wanted to make sure
that all of her features

796
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,383
were very sharp and angular.

797
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,919
The body of the guitar
is what creates her mohawk.

798
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,055
Chloe sculpted the face.

799
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:28,725
I sculpted the cowl, and then
we painted everything together.

800
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,126
It's a real striking image,

801
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,128
but it's the idea that I like.

802
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,130
It's not the execution.

803
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,766
By widening the head so much

804
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,502
and having the black makeup
around her eyes,

805
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,671
it really makes her look like

806
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:45,242
a small head
inside of a big frame.

807
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,211
My problem with this is
in the angularity on the face.

808
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,647
They're just such hard lines
on the guitar.

809
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,716
It's very angular,
and we were trying

810
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,718
to keep our lines the same.

811
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,754
Once you try to start doing
hard surfaces in flesh,

812
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,822
they've got to make sense.

813
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,856
They have to be scales

814
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,791
or plating or armor
or a helmet.

815
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:06,463
For me, this makeup is just
a little boxy and a little busy.

816
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,366
I'm just not thrilled
with this one.

817
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,301
Tanner and Chloe,
please step down.

818
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,337
Thank you.

819
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,512
_

820
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,679
George and Daran,
please step up.

821
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,353
Can't wait to hear this story.

822
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:33,590
This is our heavy metal
goddess of rock and roll.

823
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,359
Upon her journey,
she comes across this guitar

824
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:37,861
with no known origin.

825
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,462
The guitar is
a mystical element

826
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:43,049
and will assume any soul
that lays their fingers upon it.

827
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,804
I am thoroughly impressed
with this makeup design.

828
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,241
It is genuinely unique.

829
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,144
Where is
your instrument integrated?

830
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,712
We didn't want to go literal,

831
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,465
so we wanted to implement
the elements of the guitar

832
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,901
like the crystal and the wood,
so it blends into the character.

833
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:03,653
This is the vines coming up,

834
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,089
and then, this is part
of the metal guitar.

835
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,925
Wow.
Rock And Roll, Hoochie Coo.

836
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,495
Who did what on this makeup?

837
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,230
Daran did the design
on the face up to the skull.

838
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:17,667
In my design, I integrated
the vines, like, wrap around.

839
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,470
And then, I did all
of the blue and pearl paint,

840
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,355
and George did the wood paint.

841
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,674
Integrating that blue
in the eyes

842
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,376
and the blue glowing
in the chest,

843
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:27,811
really beautifully done.

844
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,513
She is bitchin', awesome,
and totally groovy.

845
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:32,682
- Thank you.
- The eyes that are glowing,

846
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,719
is that this character's face?

847
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,754
- Basically, yes.
- A beautiful piece, guys.

848
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,022
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

849
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:43,059
Daran and George,
please step back.

850
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,831
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

851
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,532
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

852
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,552
while they deliberate.

853
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,224
All right, judges,
let's start with the looks

854
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,743
you liked the most this week.

855
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,177
How about Rashaad and Tyler?

856
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:04,481
Integration-wise,
it was probably the best

857
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,016
out of all the makeups.

858
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,684
Using guitar components
internally

859
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,653
for the finished character
was just genius.

860
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,055
And the fact
that they replicated

861
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,823
the face of the guitar so well,

862
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,225
the texture and the colors.

863
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,427
And the facial piece
was beautifully crafted.

864
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,296
Let's move on
to Daran and George.

865
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,516
Truly a very unique aesthetic.

866
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,036
And I love that there's
no conspicuous guitar elements

867
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,272
just jammed in,
sticking out at an angle,

868
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:32,525
and the idea of the element
and the character

869
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,511
in a stage of metamorphosis--

870
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:36,029
it's so high concept.

871
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,616
All right, let's move on
to the looks we liked the least.

872
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,084
Let's start with Tess and Matt.

873
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,887
The Rockabilly Goat
was a goofy idea.

874
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:47,991
If they're gonna go there,
it better be a damn good goat.

875
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:51,694
It just seems like an excuse
to not do something really good.

876
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,731
Matt did a majority of the
paint, which was inconsistent,

877
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,634
but Tess was in charge
of the horns,

878
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,586
and they were so poorly done.

879
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,954
That's why I asked him
to say yes and no

880
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,038
and shake his head
side to side.

881
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,373
If it can't get through that,

882
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,242
it's a completely
nonfunctioning makeup.

883
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,812
All right, let's move on
to Tanner and Chloe.

884
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,548
At a glance,
theirs was very strong,

885
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,084
but they overdid the sculpt,

886
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,320
and the paint job made it look
synthetic and plastic.

887
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,491
It was too red,
too graphic, too busy,

888
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,127
and it was poorly done
all around the ears.

889
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,429
They didn't try
to cover up the seams.

890
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,932
All right, judges,
have you made your decision?

891
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,067
- Yeah.
- Let's bring 'em back out.

892
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,246
Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

893
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,650
Rashaad and Tyler, we love
the '70s vibe of this makeup,

894
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,919
and we think
you made a great choice

895
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,821
integrating
the see-through panel.

896
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,492
Daran and George,
this was an eye-catching makeup,

897
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,527
just filled
with interesting ideas,

898
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,964
and it is unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

899
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,466
Okay, which team
came out on top?

900
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,336
The top team tonight is...

901
00:40:11,057 --> 00:40:13,259
Okay, which team
came out on top?

902
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:16,462
The top team tonight is...

903
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,233
Daran and George.

904
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:23,436
Nice.

905
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,139
The way that you managed to
blend so many different elements

906
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,710
into a single makeup
is almost unfathomable.

907
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:32,011
An impressive display, guys.

908
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:33,179
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

909
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:36,198
Great job,
but we can only have one winner.

910
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,249
Glenn?

911
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:41,020
The winner tonight is...

912
00:40:41,054 --> 00:40:43,422
- Daran.
- Awesome!

913
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:45,691
The head was fascinating.

914
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,827
We could not
take our eyes off of it.

915
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,195
- Well done.
- Thank you.

916
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:50,196
That means a lot.

917
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,697
I feel like I'm on Cloud Nine.

918
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:53,065
It's a pretty good place to be.

919
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,700
I'm here to win
this whole competition,

920
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,635
so I'm just gonna
keep doing what I do.

921
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,705
- Daran, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

922
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,242
You, George, Rashaad,
and Tyler are all safe

923
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:04,548
and can head back
to the makeup room.

924
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:05,551
Thank you, guys.

925
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:12,968
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

926
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:17,123
are on the bottom this week, and
one of you will be eliminated.

927
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:19,258
Please step forward.

928
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,734
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

929
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:33,506
Tess and Matt, though we did
like parts of your character,

930
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,309
overall it lacked complexity
and therefore missed the mark.

931
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:41,447
Tanner and Chloe,
we liked the graphic statement

932
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:44,383
of your makeup, but you made
some design decisions

933
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:47,219
that just did not add up
for us.

934
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,737
So who is going home tonight?

935
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,491
The person going home
tonight is...

936
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,562
Tess.

937
00:41:56,596 --> 00:42:01,016
We thought that the biggest miss
was your concept.

938
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,036
It was just a mismatch
for the challenge.

939
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,172
That means,
Matt, Tanner, Chloe,

940
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:07,873
you guys are safe this week

941
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:11,811
and can head back
to the makeup room.

942
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:17,016
Tess, you have a lot of talent,

943
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,353
but the competition
this season is so tough.

944
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:23,722
Tess, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

945
00:42:23,756 --> 00:42:26,141
It's been so great
having you here with us.

946
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:27,660
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

947
00:42:27,694 --> 00:42:30,863
and pack up your kit.

948
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,114
- Bye, sweetie, good luck.
- Good luck.

949
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:33,949
- Thanks.
- Good luck, Tess.

950
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,968
I had a tough time
with this challenge,

951
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:40,306
but I'm proud of what Matt
and I came up with.

952
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,441
- It's me.
- Oh.

953
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:45,311
I've learned to be
more confident in myself.

954
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:47,079
I'm gonna miss you.

955
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:48,547
So when I get back home,

956
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:50,816
I'm gonna make
some amazing creatures.

957
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:55,054
I think now
that I've experienced this,

958
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:56,635
I can tackle the world.
