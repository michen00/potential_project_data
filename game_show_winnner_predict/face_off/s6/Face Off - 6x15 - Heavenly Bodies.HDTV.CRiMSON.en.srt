1
00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:03,000
- Whoa.
- Oh, boy.

2
00:00:03,034 --> 00:00:06,169
The other contestants
are so strong.

3
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:08,572
This is it.
No more holdin' back.

4
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:11,408
I can give it a fight.
Bring the pain.

5
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:14,869
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
season finale.

6
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:19,449
After a globe-spanning season
that was bolder

7
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:22,185
and more extreme
than ever before,

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,321
just three artists remain.

9
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:27,357
Tyler, the amount of reference
that is in your head,

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,793
that is something that other
people can't catch up with.

11
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:33,830
I really want to push
myself to freaking get that win.

12
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:36,566
Rashaad,
you are an amazing painter.

13
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,335
You've done some
beautiful work.

14
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:40,137
My dream is to make
monsters and creatures

15
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,705
for the rest of my life.

16
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,976
Winning<i> Face Off</i> will put me
that much closer to my dream.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,013
George, your ability
to sculpt is fantastic.

18
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:51,281
I want to win it.

19
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:54,885
My newborn girl that's coming,
this is for her.

20
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,854
But their epic quest
for makeup immortality...

21
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,256
Frustrating.

22
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,024
...will push them
to the edge.

23
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,026
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

24
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,461
That didn't dry at all.

25
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,897
I could just kiss
the grand prize good-bye.

26
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,899
I'm under pressure here.
I mean, it's tough.

27
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:11,168
Tyler, we can't mold this.

28
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:14,171
This is the finale,
and I feel like I'm blowing it.

29
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:16,974
And it all culminates in an
electrifying final performance.

30
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:21,845
Yeah!

31
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:24,381
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

32
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:26,049
from Kryolan
Professional Makeup to one

33
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:29,052
of their
85 international locations,

34
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:33,857
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,
and $100,000.

35
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:36,226
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic?

36
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:42,232
<i>Face Off!</i>

37
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,900
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

39
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:31,081
Being in the finale
means everything to me.

40
00:02:31,115 --> 00:02:32,849
I'm very proud how I
fought tooth and nail

41
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:34,918
to get here, and now I'm ready.

42
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:37,054
I'm ready to show some
more of what I've got.

43
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:38,722
Rashaad!

44
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,824
- Daddy!
- Hi, baby.

45
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:43,326
On the computer
is my girlfriend and my son.

46
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,562
It's just a rush, you know,
just to hear their voice.

47
00:02:45,596 --> 00:02:48,498
Aaron, you being good?

48
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,467
N--

49
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,602
My girlfriend,
she looks amazing.

50
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:53,937
You're staying focused, right?

51
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,772
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Good.

52
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,507
I can't wait to hold her again.

53
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,643
- Valeria!
- Baby!

54
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:03,580
My beautiful, lovely wife,
Valeria is right there.

55
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:05,082
Don't make me cry.

56
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:06,216
Okay. Okay. Okay.

57
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,617
I won't cry either.
Don't worry.

58
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:09,186
You don't know how much
you miss someone

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,255
until you're such a long time
apart from them.

60
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,990
I've been thinking
about you all the time.

61
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:16,927
Okay, now don't cry.
No crying.

62
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,128
Okay. No crying.
No crying.

63
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:19,930
I'm part of the final three!

64
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,164
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah!

65
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,232
- No.
- Oh, my God!

66
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,668
That's awesome!

67
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:26,636
It's a warm, welcoming feeling
to see my parents.

68
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:27,704
Everything is good.

69
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:29,139
Hurry up and win.

70
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:30,173
Yes.

71
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,808
Let me see your belly.

72
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:33,443
Wow!

73
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:37,047
Seeing them today is a boost
because it puts back

74
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,715
into the forefront why I'm here

75
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,817
and why I'm doing
what I'm doing.

76
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,385
Can I see the belly?
Can I see the belly?

77
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,021
- Sure.
- Holy shit!

78
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,892
- Oh, my--
- Very low.

79
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,694
Baby is right there, man.

80
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,362
That belly is so cool.

81
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:54,564
I'm like,
"Baby, you hold there, okay?

82
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,799
Papa's coming soon."

83
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,801
This whole competition
has made me believe more

84
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:00,871
in myself and really push
the limits,

85
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:03,140
and I'm just very proud
to be your son, so--

86
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:05,842
Good answer.

87
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,178
My parents, no matter what,
are gonna be so proud of me.

88
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:09,813
All right.
Well, I'll see you guys soon.

89
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:10,847
- Okay.
- Okay. Love you.

90
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:11,982
All right.
Love you too.

91
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,618
- Mwah, mwah, mwah.
- Mwah.

92
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:19,456
I just can't wait to see
what this finale's gonna bring.

93
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,690
That was awesome.

94
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,460
That was great, dude,
like, made my day, man.

95
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:25,962
- Definitely did.
- Here we go.

96
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,167
Whoa.

97
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,368
What do we got?
What do we got?

98
00:04:31,402 --> 00:04:32,969
Oh, my God.

99
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,271
We get to the lab
and there's, like,

100
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:37,307
stars and lasers,
and we're like, "Whoa."

101
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:40,243
I can't wait to see what
the challenge is gonna be about.

102
00:04:40,278 --> 00:04:44,581
Congratulations
and welcome to the finale.

103
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:45,849
- Ohh.
- Thank you.

104
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:49,819
As promised, this has been
the season of extremes,

105
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:52,756
and this challenge
is no exception.

106
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,193
High-profile SyFy franchises
like<i> Star Trek,</i>

107
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:58,528
<i>Babylon 5,</i> and<i> Defiance</i>

108
00:04:58,563 --> 00:04:59,896
have introduced audiences

109
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:02,732
to entirely new races
of aliens.

110
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,936
So with that in mind,
your final spotlight challenge

111
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,705
is to create
two rival alien races.

112
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:11,141
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God.

113
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,409
This is awesome.

114
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:16,012
I am getting so pumped right now
because I love space

115
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:18,281
and aliens,
but there's always that twist,

116
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,217
so I wonder what's comin'.

117
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:23,153
You'll each select one
of these constellations

118
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,589
to inspire your makeups.

119
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:28,291
We have Ursa Major,
The Great Bear,

120
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:29,993
Leo, The Lion,

121
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:32,329
Pegasus, The Winged-Horse,

122
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:35,265
and Cetus, The Whale.

123
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:38,635
Tyler, you're up first.

124
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,737
George.

125
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:43,940
And Rashaad.

126
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,376
All right, we have a lot of work
ahead of you

127
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,812
and there is a lot
at stake here.

128
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:52,382
So I brought some talented
artists to help you out.

129
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,086
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Yes!

130
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,487
Awesome!

131
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,322
- Welcome back, guys.
- Thank you.

132
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:00,757
You will each get to choose two

133
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,226
of your former competitors
to join your team.

134
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:04,928
George, you get first pick.

135
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,230
I love you all, guys.

136
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,866
Corinne.

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,468
- Rashaad.
- Daran.

138
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:13,169
You got it, man.

139
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:14,271
- Tyler.
- Graham.

140
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:15,272
Yeah!

141
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,374
- Nico.
- What's goin' on?

142
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:19,209
Cat.

143
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:21,945
Chloe.

144
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,114
Okay, before you get started,

145
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:28,251
there is one thing
that I haven't told you yet.

146
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:31,121
Your final creations
must withstand

147
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:33,556
a mind-blowing dance
performance,

148
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:35,292
complete with a live audience

149
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:38,728
three days from now
at an underground nightclub

150
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:42,999
with a special guest artist,
who happens to be here today.

151
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:46,369
He has collaborated with
everyone from Adele to MIA.

152
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:50,774
Please welcome music producer,
DJ Extraordinary, Rusko.

153
00:06:53,377 --> 00:06:55,278
- How are you?
- Awesome. Really cool.

154
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,047
- Hey, guys.
- I am super excited.

155
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,148
I love his music.

156
00:06:58,182 --> 00:06:59,449
This is gonna be very amazing.

157
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:00,717
Thank you
so much for being here.

158
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:02,619
I can't tell you how excited
I am for this.

159
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,154
All right, now, Rusko
has one more piece

160
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,289
of information
about your challenge.

161
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:10,360
A huge part of my dance music
is an awesome laser light show,

162
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:12,228
so what I want you guys
to do is

163
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:15,365
incorporate lights into
your designs and your makeup.

164
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,767
Oh, boy.
This is gonna be a challenge.

165
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:21,237
On top of two aliens,
they have to be lit up.

166
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:22,872
- That's crazy.
- All right, guys.

167
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:24,941
Our friends at Kryolan
will be supplying you

168
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:27,977
with a revolutionary new product
called Aquacolor Plus.

169
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:30,013
Unlike other water-based paints,

170
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,282
these colors don't bleed
into one another.

171
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:33,750
- Oh, hey.
- That'll be nice.

172
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,385
All right, I'll be by later on
with my dad

173
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,253
to check in on your progress.

174
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:38,288
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

175
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:45,562
We got six hours
to start getting together

176
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:49,466
a concept and start creating
our two rival alien races.

177
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,034
Okay. Constellation.
Here we go.

178
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:53,503
Let's see the description.

179
00:07:53,537 --> 00:07:57,340
What would be two opposing,
like, aquatic creatures?

180
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,075
I got the Cetus constellation,

181
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,444
which is also known as
The Whale.

182
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,748
It's all aquatic,
so I'm thinking for the female,

183
00:08:04,782 --> 00:08:07,350
she's gonna have
a jellyfish feel to her,

184
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:09,552
and then for him
he's gonna be more crustaceous,

185
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,388
which will give him
a more powerful look.

186
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:13,656
Nico, you get this flower goin'
for the chest of the girl.

187
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:15,925
Okay.

188
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,262
These two races of aliens,
we have a gentle race

189
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:20,630
and the aggressive race.

190
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:24,267
Leo represents the lion,
and my concept is the battle

191
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:26,136
between brightness and darkness.

192
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,604
They're evil.
I want to do that--

193
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,739
the spike dread things
with the lights.

194
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,409
The female is more elegant,
and the male alien

195
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:35,745
is gonna be a dark character,
very demonic looking.

196
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,046
- You want to do...
- The lioness.

197
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,616
Like, lion noses
on each of 'em essentially?

198
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,451
Not lion noses.
Kind of like an--

199
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:42,919
Okay, maybe an alien version
of that.

200
00:08:42,953 --> 00:08:44,320
Yeah, I got a really
good team here.

201
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,356
I mean, I have Graham
who can mold to perfection,

202
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,092
and Chloe is excellent
at beauty makeup.

203
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:51,628
They're both very,
very strong artists.

204
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:58,601
One of the things
that stands out for me

205
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,904
about Ursa Major is that it's
one of the brightest

206
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:02,906
infrared galaxies.

207
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,476
I want our female alien
to have bioluminescence,

208
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,179
so the male hunts
the females to kill them

209
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,715
and take their light and use it
so that they can actually see.

210
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,993
They're gonna have
different color schemes

211
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:18,573
because I really want these alien rivals
to have a night and day feel to them.

212
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:20,475
Rounded over
or pointed kind of?

213
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,476
You can round it.

214
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,878
- Okay.
- Nice.

215
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:25,247
So, Daran is working on
these silicone pieces

216
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,282
that are gonna go
on our female character.

217
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,152
Cat breaks off to work on
the female face,

218
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:31,887
and I do the male face.

219
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:37,859
You know,
I want to sculpt the faces.

220
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:39,961
It's the first thing
the judges are gonna see.

221
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,130
Corinne is working on
the female cowl.

222
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,932
Something more flowy
to the back.

223
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,233
Okay.

224
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,037
And Nico is gonna block out
the female chest,

225
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,106
which is gonna be like
a sea flower of light

226
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,774
that's gonna glow
out of silicone,

227
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,043
so it looks like the power
of the red star

228
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:56,444
of the constellation
is emanating

229
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,879
from her from within.

230
00:09:57,914 --> 00:10:01,416
Nice, Nicolai.

231
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,784
Hey, guys.
Here for walkthrough.

232
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,019
- Hey!
- Hey.

233
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,320
Let's see what you have.

234
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,290
The female is gonna
be the gentle race

235
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:10,926
and the male race
is going to be evil,

236
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,494
so we're really thinking
he would have

237
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,029
these really cool dreads
that have

238
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:15,430
the lights coming down.

239
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:16,872
These are what is interesting

240
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:19,611
because this can be
an alien-type of a mane.

241
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:21,369
Is there anything else
you're putting in here

242
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:23,605
that speaks of lion?

243
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,542
Even on a nose to give a little
of the feline look to it.

244
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:29,711
So, kind of maybe bulk out
a little bit of the tops?

245
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,013
I would maybe get a little bit
of a muzzle into it.

246
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,014
Okay.

247
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,217
We got Cetus constellation.

248
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,751
- The Whale.
- Yeah, The Whale.

249
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:39,087
It has that aquatic quality
to it, so--

250
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,889
Is she supposed to be pretty?

251
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,157
Uh--

252
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,959
If you want to definitely know
it's a female,

253
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,561
be able to see her human lips
as opposed to covering them up

254
00:10:46,596 --> 00:10:48,163
and, you know, makin' it
fish-like

255
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,164
or something like that.

256
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:50,599
Something to think about.

257
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,833
Beautiful.

258
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:54,369
I want to make the female
more light heavy,

259
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,872
keeping her very smooth,
everything round,

260
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,807
and then with the male
it's gonna be pointed

261
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,542
and everything jagged,
almost skeletal.

262
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,411
Now, remember though,
in your paint jobs,

263
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:06,748
that this has to show
from 10, 20 feet away,

264
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:08,316
'cause you've done
a lot of detail,

265
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:09,551
and I'd hate to see you
lose it.

266
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,619
You don't want to lose that.

267
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:12,687
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

268
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:14,456
All right, everybody.
We're heading out.

269
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,091
Can't wait to see your finale.

270
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,325
Good luck to everybody.

271
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,927
There's a lot of creativity
goin' on.

272
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,161
Keep it goin'.

273
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:21,196
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

274
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,230
Bye!

275
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,112
Tyler,
we can't mold these faces.

276
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,546
I'm in the middle of sculpting,

277
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:40,515
and I'm running out of time
at this point.

278
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,319
This whole competition,
I've always got my face piece

279
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,288
ready to go for foam
on the first day,

280
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:48,056
but not this challenge.

281
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,692
Yeah, we're gonna have
to figure out the light strips.

282
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,728
Yeah, that's, like,
the least of my worries though.

283
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:56,831
I have to worry about
the performance, the lights,

284
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:59,968
and two
completely different faces.

285
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:03,371
I am scared and nervous as hell
because this is the finale,

286
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:05,774
and I feel like I'm blowing it.

287
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,377
Coming up...

288
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:10,612
That didn't dry at all.

289
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,314
I could just kiss
the grand prize good-bye.

290
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,249
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

291
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:15,617
We got a gigantic rip.

292
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,821
The winner of<i> Face Off</i> is--

293
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:29,144
- We're gonna have to figure
out the light strips.

294
00:12:29,178 --> 00:12:31,212
Yeah, that's, like,
the least of my worries though.

295
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:33,515
It's day one
of our rival alien challenge,

296
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:35,283
and I just feel so behind.

297
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:38,052
I'm realizing that I'm not gonna
have anything molded

298
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,287
by the end of the day.

299
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:40,722
We still have
a lot of work to do.

300
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,757
It's driving me crazy,
but this is the finale.

301
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,961
This is not the time to rush
'cause the details count.

302
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:49,130
Concentrate on
getting 'em perfect.

303
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:53,768
That's time, guys.

304
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,704
By the end of the day,
we've got our faces detailed.

305
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:59,107
They just need some last minute
touch-up work.

306
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:03,244
I know tomorrow's gonna be busy,
but I'm here to win<i> Face Off</i>

307
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,446
and that's what I'm gonna do.

308
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:13,821
Let's do this, guys.

309
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:17,091
It's day two
of the rival alien challenge,

310
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:18,459
and I've got a lot to do.

311
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:21,229
The main goal is to finish
everything for the female alien

312
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:23,932
and tomorrow get everything done
with the male.

313
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:27,035
You could do some kind of
a patterny type thing

314
00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:28,102
that goes down the center.

315
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:29,237
Exactly.

316
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:31,339
So we have somewhere to pop...

317
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:33,641
- The little bulbs.
- Silicon, yeah.

318
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:35,643
And we got to put lights
everywhere in the makeups

319
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:38,213
and probably battery packs
and all kinds of cables,

320
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:40,582
and it's gonna make things
a little bit more complex.

321
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:44,252
First thing I do is
jump into Corinne's cowl

322
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:45,520
and start detailing it.

323
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,223
After I get that,
I jump into Nico's chest

324
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:51,125
and start the
finishing touches.

325
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:53,661
All set?

326
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:55,363
I'm taking
Mr. Westmore's advice,

327
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:57,632
and I'm gonna incorporate
the lion aspect

328
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,434
of the constellation
into my sculpture,

329
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:01,903
and Chloe is focusing
on the female cowl

330
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:04,906
while Graham
is molding the first face.

331
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,008
It's like this assembly line
kind of thing,

332
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:09,644
and it's really great to know
that I don't have to worry

333
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:13,615
about molding because Graham
is the mold master.

334
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,721
Seeing 'em next
to each other looks so cool.

335
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:20,922
I start working on the faces

336
00:14:20,956 --> 00:14:22,624
while cat is blocking out
the cowl,

337
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,627
and Daran's sculpting the
chest plate for the female.

338
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,730
I want to get both of the faces
run in foam latex

339
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:29,864
by the end of the day.

340
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:31,799
They're looking good.

341
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:38,306
We want to incorporate
some vacuform sections

342
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,841
into our different sculpts,

343
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,609
because I want to give
the illusion of layers.

344
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:42,677
That's pretty good.

345
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,345
The sculpt that Chloe's
working on,

346
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,048
we cut a section from the back
of the head to give the sense

347
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:49,628
that this thing
has a functioning brain.

348
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,231
The male chest will have
this illuminated

349
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:55,134
vacuform plate,
which is gonna hold the lights,

350
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:58,971
and then a ribcage go over it
so when the layers are lit up,

351
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:02,941
the effect in the chest
will be intensified.

352
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,614
I'm afraid.
She's already got that goin' on.

353
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:10,048
- Oh, that shape?
- Yeah.

354
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,817
Even though both of my aliens
come from

355
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,386
the constellation Ursa Major,
I really want these two

356
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:17,289
to be different
because they have to be rivals.

357
00:15:17,323 --> 00:15:19,491
A female has a raised point
in the back of her head,

358
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,727
but I don't want to do that
with the male's cowl,

359
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:23,729
so I hack off a big section
of it

360
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:24,963
and go a different direction.

361
00:15:24,998 --> 00:15:27,433
You can make it like
a hard crab shell cap.

362
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,934
You know, like the bottom
of a turtle?

363
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:32,438
- Yeah, there you go.
- I get what you're sayin'.

364
00:15:32,472 --> 00:15:33,472
38 minutes.

365
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:42,314
All right, guys!
It's time!

366
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,650
- All right.
- <i> Excelente.</i>

367
00:15:44,684 --> 00:15:45,851
By the end of day two,

368
00:15:45,885 --> 00:15:48,353
we got most of our molds done
for the female.

369
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,656
We can't run 'em in foam yet
because we're running some

370
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,624
of these parts in silicone
to make that

371
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,194
bioluminescence quality
to them.

372
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:56,428
We got a lot to do yet.

373
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:59,064
The pressure is on.
It wears on you, you know?

374
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:00,265
It really gets into your head.

375
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,411
- See what we got.
- Yeah!

376
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,413
It's day three of our
rival alien challenge,

377
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:17,049
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab.

378
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,984
What do you think?

379
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,385
That looks lovely.

380
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,054
Oh, fuck.

381
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,690
The female alien face ripped
right here.

382
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,725
This is not good.

383
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,628
It's the last day to sculpt,
and we still have to finish

384
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:32,264
everything for the male,
so there's no time

385
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:33,632
to try to patch this thing.

386
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:34,967
I got to run it again.

387
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,202
All right.
Let's get goin'.

388
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,273
It's just roughed out,
you know?

389
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:42,574
That looks awesome.

390
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,277
Chloe and I are touching up
all the final details

391
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,746
in all the sculpts
and Graham is getting

392
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,349
everything molded today.

393
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:51,850
This is the last challenge,

394
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,052
and everything's startin'
to come together,

395
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,220
and I have a shot.

396
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:56,255
I want to win this thing.

397
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,530
- We got 2:20 on the clock.
- All right.

398
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:08,033
Cat's molding the cowl
and she's being very detailed

399
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,869
in the way she does it because
it's one of our key pieces.

400
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,638
This thing
has a difficult wall.

401
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:15,073
I'm a little worried
because this thing has to cure

402
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:17,576
before we can even pop it
and get it run in foam.

403
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,610
All right.

404
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,385
After I finish the cowl
I move on

405
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,288
to the male chest piece
and back piece,

406
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:31,723
which are very important because
they have lighting emanating

407
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,058
from the chest, both of them.

408
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:35,360
That's what connects them
from the same planet.

409
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:38,430
I'm sculpting them as fast
as I can, but I'm on the clock.

410
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:40,432
I'm under pressure here.
I mean, it's tough.

411
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,740
_

412
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,676
We don't want to rush
the mold drying process,

413
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,145
but it's gettin' down to,
like, the last ten minutes.

414
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:54,680
Let's do it, son.

415
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:56,381
We let it sit
as long as possible.

416
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,617
Now we've got to try
and open this thing,

417
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,252
and get it out in foam.

418
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:02,754
Oh, my God.
Look.

419
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:03,922
What the fuck?

420
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:05,603
_

421
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,259
Our mold didn't set.

422
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:11,229
This is definitely not
a good position to be in.

423
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:13,432
I have no idea what to do.

424
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,336
This key piece
I need for the big finale makeup

425
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,770
might not be there.

426
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,906
What are we doin'?

427
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:24,209
I could just kiss
the grand prize good-bye.

428
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:30,787
Where we at?
Where we at?

429
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,589
It's day three of our
rival alien challenge,

430
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:33,957
and we're running out of time.

431
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:36,793
Oh, my God.
Look.

432
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,404
_

433
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:39,863
This is not a good thing.

434
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:42,699
You don't want to open
a wet mold

435
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:44,734
because then you ruin
your detail layer,

436
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:47,871
and that's the most important
layer of the molding process.

437
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:50,040
- All right.
- I say we leave it alone.

438
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:51,341
- Sweet.
- And just let it sit?

439
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,277
Yeah, 'cause if in the morning
it's dry,

440
00:18:54,312 --> 00:18:56,246
then at least we can polyfoam.

441
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,897
_

442
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,950
That's time, guys!

443
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:01,952
All right.

444
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:03,086
Frustrating.

445
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,522
I really want this cowl
to be foam latex

446
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:06,957
rather than running
it in polyfoam,

447
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:08,391
especially with a dance.

448
00:19:08,426 --> 00:19:09,693
Once polyfoam dries,

449
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,095
it doesn't allow
the same flexibility.

450
00:19:12,129 --> 00:19:13,964
All we can do is keep
our fingers crossed

451
00:19:13,998 --> 00:19:15,799
and just hope for the best.

452
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:25,976
- Wardrobe?
- Yup.

453
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,244
All right.
Polyfoam, polyfoam.

454
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:28,845
It's application day.

455
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,113
We have four hours in the lab,

456
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,149
one hour at last looks.

457
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,951
Either it works or it don't.

458
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:38,622
Our biggest concern of all
of this is having the cowl.

459
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:41,158
- We got one beautiful side.
- Yes, sir.

460
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,559
And one horrendous side.

461
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:45,095
We had our fingers crossed
it would be perfect,

462
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,597
and it's not.

463
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,065
This alien got burned.

464
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,666
That sets us apart.

465
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:51,535
Now I have to clean it out,

466
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:54,438
get it prepped for polyfoam,
and it'll be ready to go.

467
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,473
Get to work.

468
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:02,379
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

469
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:05,482
Holy shit.
That one is bad.

470
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:09,453
We got a gigantic rip on
the face of the male character.

471
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:11,488
It's like, "Oh, my God.
Another rip."

472
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:13,056
Yeah, we'll have to,
like, glue it.

473
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:14,992
This is not good.

474
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:17,761
I just Crazy Glue it
and then cover patch it.

475
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,630
I do want to take my time
to make it beautiful.

476
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:20,964
I mean, it's the finale.

477
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,933
While I'm patching it up,
Corinne is cutting out

478
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,801
the silicone pieces
and glue them down.

479
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:27,237
Nico's gonna work on the props.

480
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:28,772
We're trying to go
as fast as we can.

481
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:32,142
- Hello.
- Christian.

482
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,176
Christian, how are you?

483
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,578
I'm Tyler.
Nice to meet you.

484
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:36,780
Our models arrive
and Chloe and I

485
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:38,715
start applying everything.

486
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,517
Wow, that already looks
really cool.

487
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:43,153
Without them even painted
they look amazing.

488
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:44,187
I'm just so excited.

489
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:45,656
Yeah, that's gonna be cool.

490
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:50,494
It starts with here.

491
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:51,828
Oh, I see beauty.

492
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:54,431
We start opening the mold,
and it takes us a while,

493
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:55,599
but we get it out.

494
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:58,869
She's beat up
but she's useable.

495
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:00,504
We'll have to make it a scar,
make it a burn

496
00:21:00,538 --> 00:21:02,639
from battle damage,
but we got our cowl.

497
00:21:02,674 --> 00:21:04,274
It's all damage.

498
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,409
Life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

499
00:21:05,443 --> 00:21:06,443
Yeah, boy!

500
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:12,416
Every edge is smooth, Nico?

501
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,817
Most of it.

502
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:15,719
Patching the face took me
a little while,

503
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:17,821
and it threw me
a little bit behind.

504
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,724
Just seam this
so it looks pristine.

505
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,893
Now we got to hurry up
and finish applying everything,

506
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,294
but I'm running out of time.

507
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:25,495
Oh, boy.

508
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:30,901
I start prepainting everything
and it looks so cool.

509
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:32,436
Chloe's startin' on
the base coat

510
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,704
and him in the red, it's like,

511
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:35,706
"Wow, there's such a crazy
contrast."

512
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,407
These things are really
gonna hold up

513
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:40,377
and really look well on stage.

514
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:42,312
No, Rashaad.
That's too slow.

515
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:44,147
Do it.
Do it.

516
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:45,882
We still got to glue lights in.

517
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:49,619
We're just rushing to get
everything applied and painted.

518
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:51,521
We're really under the gun here,
and I don't want

519
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:53,290
to do everything in last looks.

520
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:56,359
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

521
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:58,361
That's ten minutes, everyone!

522
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:07,137
All right, everyone!
That's time!

523
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:10,173
Brushes down.

524
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,043
Time is up
and we got everything applied,

525
00:22:13,077 --> 00:22:16,446
but we don't have no paint
on it yet.

526
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,982
My God, we got so much to do.

527
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:21,118
It's like, "Oh, my God."
Nerve-racking.

528
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:23,386
All this is very stressful.

529
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:30,527
- All right!
- For the last time.

530
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:31,561
Yeah.

531
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:35,632
All right, everybody.
Feel privileged.

532
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:38,735
Greg's on the other side
doin' makeup.

533
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,504
Going into last looks,
not only do we get to work

534
00:22:40,538 --> 00:22:42,939
on our characters
but the backup dancers are also

535
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:45,642
in the room with us,
and who's in charge of that?

536
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:46,910
Greg Cannom.

537
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:49,112
This guy's resume
goes way back.

538
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:52,215
I mean, from<i> Dracula</i>
to<i> Mrs. Doubtfire.</i>

539
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,917
I mean, whoa.

540
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:58,054
_

541
00:22:58,055 --> 00:22:59,589
There's so much to do
in an hour.

542
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:00,991
We have to finish painting.

543
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:03,426
I have to make sure the side
of my female's face

544
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:05,595
looks like a burn,
make sure that our LED lights

545
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,497
are working
and a million other details,

546
00:23:07,532 --> 00:23:09,599
but I'm not worried because
I have a great team

547
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:10,901
and we're gonna get it done.

548
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:15,639
I'm not happy
with the paint job.

549
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:17,140
I think it's too muddy.

550
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:20,477
I'm also concerned about
my aliens lookin' too similar,

551
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:24,614
but I'm running out of time,
so I just want to get it done.

552
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:28,351
I'm using Kryolan's
Aquacolor Plus.

553
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:29,853
It doesn't bleed
into other colors.

554
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,355
It's so cool,
and everything's going smoothly.

555
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,357
Chloe's doing gorgeous
beauty makeup

556
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:37,928
on the female's eyes to really
make her pearl essence pop.

557
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:41,464
We got 15 minutes left, guys.
15 minutes!

558
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:43,266
I think we should turn on
the lights

559
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,568
'cause we don't want
to forget that.

560
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:45,769
Get it goin', guy.
Get it goin'.

561
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:47,904
Want to punch it up
or turn it down?

562
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:54,411
All right, guys!
That's it! It's time!

563
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:59,182
I have two complete characters,

564
00:23:59,217 --> 00:24:00,784
and I think they look amazing.

565
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:03,887
Everybody's work is great,
so you'd never know,

566
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:08,191
but I'm thinkin' maybe
I got a shot.

567
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:09,626
Coming up...

568
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,395
Welcome to
the<i> Face Off</i> season finale.

569
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,266
This over here
looks like damage.

570
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
This is it.

571
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:18,535
This is everything
I've worked for.

572
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:19,569
All right, Glenn.

573
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:21,872
Who is the winner of<i> Face Off?</i>

574
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:32,810
Ladies and gentlemen,

575
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:35,613
please welcome
McKenzie Westmore.

576
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:45,556
Welcome to
the<i>Face Off</i>season finale.

577
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:53,264
Tonight, our artist's creations
will be taking part in

578
00:24:53,298 --> 00:24:54,832
an incredible dance performance

579
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:58,235
featuring one
of the world's top DJs, Rusko.

580
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:04,608
For their final
spotlight challenge,

581
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:07,444
I asked each
of our finalists to create

582
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:12,349
two rival alien races
inspired by a constellation,

583
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:15,019
and because our theme tonight
is all about light,

584
00:25:15,053 --> 00:25:16,887
they were also required
to incorporate

585
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:19,824
lighted elements
into their designs.

586
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:21,258
With that,
I'd like to introduce you

587
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:24,528
to our incredibly talented
and accomplished judges.

588
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:25,596
First, we have owner of

589
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,498
Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio,

590
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:28,599
Glenn Hetrick.

591
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:35,472
Three time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

592
00:25:39,411 --> 00:25:42,313
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

593
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:47,151
All right, it's time to see

594
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:50,087
our finalists'
phenomenal creations.

595
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:53,757
Our first pair of makeups
is from Tyler,

596
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,293
and they were inspired
by the constellation Leo.

597
00:25:56,328 --> 00:25:57,294
Let's take a look.

598
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,697
Let's go Tyler.

599
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,634
I'm not nervous.

600
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:38,202
This is like a celebration.

601
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:40,738
I am so proud of myself
and my team.

602
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,840
I believe these
are the coolest characters

603
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:44,375
I've done in this competition.

604
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:18,609
I'm feelin' pretty good
because we pulled something

605
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:21,478
together that most people would
have thought impossible.

606
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:25,449
Everybody was worried about us,
but they look amazing.

607
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm proud of my team.

608
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:58,382
I'm proud
of what we accomplished.

609
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,651
I'm loving the way they look.

610
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:06,523
Okay, guys.

611
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,592
We are just getting started.

612
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:12,162
Now it's time to put
these aliens to the test.

613
00:28:12,197 --> 00:28:14,999
Performing his hit <i>Lift Me Up,</i>

614
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,800
give it up for
internationally acclaimed

615
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:20,104

Give it up one more time
for Rusko!

642
00:31:17,148 --> 00:31:18,982
Give it up for the dancers.
Hello?

643
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,688
All right, guys.

644
00:31:24,722 --> 00:31:26,924
Thank you so much
for being with us tonight.

645
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,893
Now it is time for our judges
to take a closer look

646
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:32,696
at the makeups
and deliberate in private.

647
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,897
Thank you for joining us.

648
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:44,641
Such a complicated sculpt.

649
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:46,376
What's interesting
is his lighting

650
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,512
is extraordinarily subtle.

651
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:52,482
Can you turn around
for us, please?

652
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:54,251
He's got the lights in here
as well.

653
00:31:54,285 --> 00:31:55,819
That's a lot to integrate.

654
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:57,788
It feels very crustacean.

655
00:31:57,822 --> 00:31:58,822
It makes sense.

656
00:32:03,728 --> 00:32:05,729
This is really different.

657
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:07,798
I like it.

658
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,766
Odd decision
when you have the chance

659
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:12,703
to create two separate things,
to make them so similar.

660
00:32:12,737 --> 00:32:14,137
You know what?

661
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,241
I think the thing that makes 'em
similar is the paint job.

662
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:18,242
Wow!

663
00:32:18,276 --> 00:32:20,577
This over here
looks like damage.

664
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:22,746
I'm ready to pass out
because this is everything

665
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,047
that I've worked for.

666
00:32:24,082 --> 00:32:26,950
There's a lot of
emergency repair happening here.

667
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:29,386
That side of the face
came out bad,

668
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,488
and I know that the judges
are gonna notice it too.

669
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:37,060
Who made your favorite
alien rivals?

670
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:40,097
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

671
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:47,277
This over here
looks like damage.

672
00:32:47,311 --> 00:32:50,280
I know that that side
of the face came out bad,

673
00:32:50,314 --> 00:32:51,781
but I want them to notice

674
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,616
that there's
a complete character.

675
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:56,653
I love how this flows
into this stuff

676
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,788
so that we can see
the light through.

677
00:32:58,823 --> 00:33:00,890
It's very celestial feeling.

678
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:03,426
Thank you.

679
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,395
That is so beautiful.

680
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:08,031
Can you turn to the side?

681
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,432
I do love the colors.

682
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,034
Love the palette.
Yeah.

683
00:33:11,068 --> 00:33:12,535
Oh, my God.
That's gorgeous.

684
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,539
Thanks.

685
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:17,574
Bare your teeth
as much as you--

686
00:33:17,608 --> 00:33:20,276
- Oh, that's wild.
- Yeah, it is.

687
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:21,411
I dig that,

688
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:22,979
and now open
with it real wide like that.

689
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:24,414
Yeah.
That's super cool.

690
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:26,916
- Amazing teeth.
- Yeah.

691
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:29,886
Wow!
Beautiful paint job.

692
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,554
- Wow!
- Look at that.

693
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:33,723
- That's beautiful.
- That's a chest.

694
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:35,392
I've never seen
anything like that.

695
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:36,693
That form on the chest?

696
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:38,194
- That is gorgeous.
- Gorgeous.

697
00:33:38,229 --> 00:33:39,462
Thank you.

698
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:48,338
All right, judges.
How did they do tonight?

699
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:50,373
I was thoroughly impressed.

700
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:53,443
Everyone did
a massive amount of work

701
00:33:53,477 --> 00:33:55,912
and all of it is so detailed.

702
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,547
I couldn't have asked for more.

703
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:58,715
Thank you.

704
00:33:58,749 --> 00:34:00,383
All right,
the judges would like to speak

705
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:02,819
with each of you to learn more
about your work.

706
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:06,022
Tyler, you're up first.

707
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:08,091
Tyler,
tell us about your aliens

708
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:11,094
and how your constellation
inspired your work.

709
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:12,662
My constellation was Leo.

710
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:15,698
My female alien represents
peace and elegance

711
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:18,902
and their essence
is their bright light,

712
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:21,204
and my rival
wants nothing but darkness.

713
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:23,740
There are some
incredibly well done things

714
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:25,108
on these makeups, Tyler.

715
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:27,110
Thank you.

716
00:34:27,144 --> 00:34:29,312
I do like
the multitudinous layering

717
00:34:29,346 --> 00:34:32,148
of the plates
on your male character.

718
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:35,685
It feels
like functional organic armor.

719
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,353
Good.

720
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:39,155
I think you've done
two really beautiful,

721
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,757
cohesive makeups.

722
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,559
I especially like your female.

723
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:45,829
I love those subtle colors,
the blues and the lavenders.

724
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:48,698
Your male has some really
interesting things going on.

725
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:50,467
Can you turn him around for us?

726
00:34:50,501 --> 00:34:53,303
I just love the transition
into the paler colors

727
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:55,905
so that you can really see
that skeletal treatment.

728
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,106
Very well done.

729
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:58,241
Thank you very much.

730
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:59,709
Really great stuff.

731
00:34:59,743 --> 00:35:02,912
On your female,
that plainer nose

732
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:04,514
and havin' the nostrils
on the side

733
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:07,150
was a really nice way
of treating it,

734
00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:09,619
and as for your guy,
I love the depth

735
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:12,055
you've achieved in his chest.

736
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:13,990
It looks like this guy
is hollow.

737
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,625
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

738
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:17,460
Thank you very much, guys.
Thank you.

739
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:18,995
Yeah.

740
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:22,832
Rashaad, you're next.

741
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:25,068
Rashaad, tell us about
your rival aliens

742
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:27,871
and how your constellation
inspired your creations.

743
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:30,406
Well, the constellation
that I got was Ursa Major.

744
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:33,109
She's a hunter on her planet,
but his race

745
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:35,945
has no problem hunting them
because they shine so much,

746
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,081
so they're easy to find
and they kill them

747
00:35:38,115 --> 00:35:39,082
and take their light.

748
00:35:39,116 --> 00:35:40,083
I got to tell you,

749
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:43,286
I think you did
an excellent job.

750
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,855
I really love the coloration
on your male.

751
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,990
It's so striking.

752
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,792
I noticed that your female
has what appears

753
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:52,428
to be some sort of a burn
on the side of her head.

754
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:54,864
Very much a happy accident
with the molding process.

755
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,432
Since they're supposed
to be fighting,

756
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,902
we thought a scar
would be great on her face.

757
00:35:58,936 --> 00:36:01,070
I think it was very successful
because that's exactly

758
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:02,539
what it does look like.

759
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:03,873
Really cool characters, honey.

760
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:05,141
Thank you.

761
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:07,210
The palette is beautiful,
and the two of them

762
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:11,047
have a great contrast
in warm and cool.

763
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:15,385
The bioluminescent
sternocleidomastoid feature

764
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:16,853
is so beautiful.

765
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:19,022
When she came out
and the lights were out,

766
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:22,926
it was one of the most powerful
uses of light on a character.

767
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,360
It's a gorgeous sculpt.

768
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:26,829
That's what we're lookin' for.
Great stuff.

769
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:28,431
Thank you.

770
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:30,934
Your female character
is so celestial.

771
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:33,371
My first impression was,
"How could they possibly

772
00:36:33,469 --> 00:36:36,577
have worked the lighting out that well?"
It looks like you'd had weeks to think

773
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,412
about just the lighting.

774
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,514
With your male character,
I could see

775
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:43,751
all of the inspirational notes
that you're taking from nature

776
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,287
to create rival alien species.

777
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:48,589
I couldn't be more pleased
with the beautiful work

778
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,924
that everyone did on your team.

779
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,460
Thank you.

780
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:54,996
George, you're next.

781
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,697
Tell us about your alien rivals

782
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:59,400
and the constellation
inspiration.

783
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,435
I choose the constellation
of Cetus.

784
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,705
The red emanating
from each of their chests

785
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,709
is the last source of power
that arise from the red star,

786
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:09,910
the dying star.

787
00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:11,746
It's some
of the most gorgeous work

788
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,248
that I've seen you do
in particular.

789
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:15,783
Thanks.

790
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:19,286
The male character,
his head and his shoulders,

791
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,522
it's a gorgeous bit
of sculptural work right there.

792
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:23,324
Congratulations
to you and the team.

793
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,227
- Yeah.
- Did some beautiful work there.

794
00:37:26,261 --> 00:37:28,729
It's some of the finest
sculptural work that we've seen.

795
00:37:28,764 --> 00:37:31,165
The male character
is awe-inspiring.

796
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,101
That combination of forms
is something I've never seen,

797
00:37:34,136 --> 00:37:37,538
and I'm particularly fond
of your female in profile.

798
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:40,608
However, in terms of the color,
I understand that

799
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:42,443
you were trying to unify
your characters,

800
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:44,945
but at the same time,
them being rivals

801
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,449
is wholly absent
in a visual manner.

802
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:50,418
You did a really remarkable
job of creating

803
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,553
two really beautiful characters,

804
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,889
and the sculpting
is really good.

805
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,123
Well done, George.

806
00:37:56,158 --> 00:37:57,591
Thank you so much, Ve.

807
00:37:57,626 --> 00:37:58,793
All right, guys.

808
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,528
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

809
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:01,896
If you'd please head backstage

810
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,197
while they decide
who will become

811
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:05,399
this season's champion.

812
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:06,434
Thank you.

813
00:38:11,473 --> 00:38:14,742
All right, judges, let's talk
about our finalists tonight.

814
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:15,776
Let's start with Tyler.

815
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:17,745
I did love the female.

816
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:19,647
Really beautiful paint job.

817
00:38:19,681 --> 00:38:22,450
Those subtle, beautiful,
luminescent quality

818
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:24,285
that he put on it
with that pale lavender.

819
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:25,986
Not so much the red guy.

820
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:28,689
It had, like,
a weird sea anemone nose on it.

821
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:31,492
But the skeletal forms
that he's chosen to do,

822
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:34,295
they were handled so well
around the eyes

823
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,932
and in the detail that makes it
a good-looking piece.

824
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:40,234
He did a really great
treatment of that chest.

825
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:43,070
It really did look like there
was almost nothing behind there.

826
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:46,507
He has been such
a strong competitor all season.

827
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,342
His dragon
was incredibly strong.

828
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:50,511
He pulled off
incredible rendition

829
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:52,313
of the mouth belly gag.

830
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:53,481
Tyler is visionary.

831
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:55,282
He's got such cool designs,

832
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:57,184
and he has the skills
to execute them.

833
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,652
All right,
let's move on to Rashaad.

834
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:01,722
He had the constellation
Ursa Major.

835
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:03,991
Well,
I loved the color choices,

836
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:06,927
especially on that
aqua and purpley-blue guy,

837
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:09,663
and the female
had the strongest light element.

838
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,432
Wow!
It was stunning.

839
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:14,101
The sculpting work that he did

840
00:39:14,136 --> 00:39:17,872
on his male character
was just gorgeous.

841
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:22,176
The precision and the craft
within it was incredible.

842
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,478
Looking at how successful
the integration

843
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:26,013
of the light is on the female,

844
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,015
he couldn't have done that
any better.

845
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:30,050
And as the season
has progressed,

846
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:32,586
he has just gotten better
and better and better.

847
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:35,656
Out of 14 challenges,
he was only on the bottom once.

848
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,024
I mean, that's pretty amazing.

849
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:40,828
I mean, he was either on the top
or safe every other time.

850
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:43,430
All right,
let's finish up with George.

851
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,900
He had the constellation cetus.

852
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:49,069
That sculpt was so good
on the male.

853
00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:51,939
He's such a strong designer,
such a strong sculptor,

854
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,741
and I love the female head.

855
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:55,943
I love the female head
in profile.

856
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,945
I definitely love it
from the back.

857
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,513
What did you think
about the lighting?

858
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:02,082
It was obvious that
that brown paint had obscured

859
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:03,918
the light source unfortunately.

860
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:05,186
It didn't so much on the female

861
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,454
because she had that big crest
going on.

862
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,490
One thing that George
has shown consistently

863
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:12,660
throughout the entire season
is his sculpting prowess.

864
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:14,929
He knows form in ways

865
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:18,065
that I don't think
most makeup artists do.

866
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:20,367
That's a pretty amazing gift
to have.

867
00:40:20,402 --> 00:40:23,037
All right, judges,
have you made your decision?

868
00:40:23,071 --> 00:40:24,605
- Yes, we have.
- Yup.

869
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,440
All right,
let's bring 'em back out.

870
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:36,183
Okay, one of you is about to be
crowned the winner of<i> Face Off.</i>

871
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:39,920
Glenn, tell us about
tonight's makeups.

872
00:40:39,955 --> 00:40:43,991
Tyler, your characters
were incredibly successful

873
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,993
in embracing
the lighted elements,

874
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,629
and we particularly loved
the beautiful iridescent

875
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:50,931
paint job of your female alien.

876
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:54,735
Rashaad, we thought you had
some really exciting

877
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:57,304
conceptual ideas,
and the lighting design

878
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:01,976
on your female alien
made her feel almost angelic.

879
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,980
George, using a dying star
as the source of power

880
00:41:06,014 --> 00:41:10,217
in the crux of your character's
relationship was very clever,

881
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:12,119
and the sculpting
on your male's head

882
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:14,054
is some of the best
we've ever seen.

883
00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:17,625
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner of<i>Face Off?</i>

884
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,793
The winner of<i> Face Off is--</i>

885
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:30,317
- All right, Glenn,
who is the winner of<i> Face Off?</i>

886
00:41:30,351 --> 00:41:32,719
The winner of<i>Face Off</i>is...

887
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:38,358
Rashaad.

888
00:41:52,474 --> 00:41:55,476
Congratulations!

889
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,478
This is gonna change my life.

890
00:41:57,512 --> 00:41:58,946
In the beginning
I was always questioning,

891
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,716
"Do I have what it takes?
Am I good enough for this?"

892
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,184
I guess I am.

893
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:05,519
Here are the keys...

894
00:42:05,553 --> 00:42:07,221
- Awesome.
- ...to your new car.

895
00:42:07,255 --> 00:42:09,089
Rashaad freakin' deserved it,
man.

896
00:42:09,124 --> 00:42:11,859
- He's such an amazing artist.
- Take a breath.

897
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:14,294
- Ohh.
- Are you all right?

898
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,596
- Oh, yeah.
- Brother.

899
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,532
I got to be in the finale
with two amazing guys,

900
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:20,467
and I got to showcase
all my work

901
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:22,336
in front of millions of people.

902
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,670
How cool is that?

903
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,174
I don't feel like a loser.

904
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,809
I was in the finale
for crying out loud.

905
00:42:28,843 --> 00:42:30,644
That's a winner in its own.

906
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:34,681
I've learned to push myself,
take advice,

907
00:42:34,716 --> 00:42:37,217
and just branch from there.

908
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:39,038
Winning<i>Face Off</i> changes a life.

909
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:43,338
I was working 24/7
wanting to do more for my family.

910
00:42:43,373 --> 00:42:45,407
Not to mention my dream
of coming out here

911
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:49,311
and starting a studio
and being a makeup artist.

912
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:50,412
I feel like this is a dream,

913
00:42:50,447 --> 00:42:51,747
and one day
I'm just gonna wake up,

914
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:53,782
and it's not gonna be here,

915
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:55,802
but, it's happened.
It's really happened.

916
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:58,803
