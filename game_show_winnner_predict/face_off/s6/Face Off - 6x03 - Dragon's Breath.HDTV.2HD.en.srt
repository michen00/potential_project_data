1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,424
- That's extremely impressive.
- You did some weird stuff.

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:05,161
It's really rough.

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,829
Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:11,532
The artists competed in
an extraterrestrial challenge.

5
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,134
Corinne's emaciated alien

6
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:14,535
- brought her the win...
- Thank you.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,539
And Bethany was sent home.

8
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:21,175
Now 13 artists remain.

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,811
And tonight they explore
the world of fantasy.

10
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:26,114
I'm talking about dragons here.

11
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,116
We're so screwed.

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,650
No time, people.

13
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,652
But some will have
their hopes shattered.

14
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,188
- I always focus on one side.
- That's a big mistake.

15
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:37,558
It just cracks.

16
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:39,927
I'm having a breakdown.

17
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:41,162
It's killer.

18
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:43,464
You've got a lot of stuff
mixed up here.

19
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:46,334
- It was a really huge mistake.
- I'm getting crazy right now.

20
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,469
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,071
from Kryolan Professional
Make-Up

22
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:53,474
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,444
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:58,346
and $100,000.

25
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,349
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

26
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:06,454
<i>Face off!</i>

27
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:08,890
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

28
00:01:44,937 --> 00:01:47,044
Sync and corrections by n17t01

29
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:53,067
You won.
Congratulations.

30
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,169
Thank you.
Safe is good.

31
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:56,671
- Top is cool.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:58,506
And I don't want to be
on the bottom.

33
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,208
No, me neither. Me neither.

34
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:02,109
Being on the bottom
wasn't cool at all.

35
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:03,978
That didn't feel right.

36
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,413
I really hope
the next challenge

37
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:06,747
is gonna be an individual one,

38
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:07,949
so I can make my own decisions

39
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:10,051
and have more control
and do better.

40
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:21,862
I'm walking up the beach,

41
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:23,531
and I've never been to Malibu
in my life,

42
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,066
never seen the Pacific Ocean.

43
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,167
Look at the rocks.

44
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,768
So this is exciting for me.

45
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:30,304
There's seagulls.
There's waves crashing.

46
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,606
They're beautiful sights--

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,941
something you only see
in movies.

48
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:36,410
Look at that.

49
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:38,613
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

50
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:39,614
Hey.

51
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:40,815
Welcome to Point Dume.

52
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,417
This breathtaking location
may look familiar

53
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:44,919
because it was used in<i> Iron Man</i>

54
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:47,688
as the backdrop for
Tony Stark's seaside mansion...

55
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:49,056
I knew it.

56
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:52,026
And the iconic final scene
in<i>Planet Of The Apes.</i>

57
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,630
- Nice.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,898
This location could be
the perfect home

59
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,268
of the very thing that
you're gonna have to create.

60
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:01,802
Come on.

61
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:03,604
So this week
your spotlight challenge

62
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,374
is based
in the world of fantasy.

63
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:08,643
I'm talking about dragons here.

64
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:10,978
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Yes!

65
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,647
Yes.

66
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:15,616
My jaw just dropped.

67
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:17,018
I love dragons.

68
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:20,655
I've loved the fantasy
behind them, the stories.

69
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:22,223
We're all feeling--
"Aw, yes"--

70
00:03:22,257 --> 00:03:23,291
amazed.

71
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:24,959
Now, Hollywood tends
to concentrate

72
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:26,494
on the fire-breathing dragons.

73
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:29,497
In movies and TV shows
such as<i> Eragon, Beowulf,</i>

74
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,932
<i>Dragonslayer,</i>
and<i> Game Of Thrones.</i>

75
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:35,102
But in the mythology
of some cultures,

76
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:37,371
dragons are capable
of breathing other things,

77
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:39,674
like ice, acid, even poison.

78
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:44,578
So, for your first individual
spotlight challenge...

79
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:45,913
Oh.

80
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,848
...you're gonna select one
of these shields

81
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:51,652
and create the dragon character
that inflicted the damage.

82
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:53,721
Fuck.

83
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:54,922
Dragons are so big.

84
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:57,258
It's essentially
flying sky elephants

85
00:03:57,292 --> 00:04:00,628
that you have to create
in, like, 18 hours by yourself.

86
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,930
We're so screwed.

87
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:06,934
Now, your options are
"Frozen," "Charred,"

88
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:09,236
"Corroded," "Quilled,"

89
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:12,973
"Slimed," "Sandblasted,"
and "Tarred."

90
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:15,242
When I call your name,
please step up

91
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:17,144
and select a shield.

92
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:19,880
Daniel, you're first.

93
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:20,915
Ugh.

94
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:35,162
All right, guys,

95
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,997
go ahead and get started
on your designs.

96
00:04:37,032 --> 00:04:38,599
When you're done,
head back to the lab,

97
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,501
and I will stop by later
with my dad

98
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:41,502
to see how you're doing.

99
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:42,503
Bye.
Good luck.

100
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:43,938
- Bye.
- Thanks.

101
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,847
I picked tarred
because I didn't want to go

102
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:55,182
with the classic
fire-breathing dragon.

103
00:04:55,217 --> 00:04:56,183
I wanted something different.

104
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:57,885
I'm gonna try to cover as much

105
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,387
of the body as possible.

106
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:02,022
Build up a lot of armor pieces
along with some chains.

107
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:03,824
It's a lot of work
to do by myself.

108
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:07,228
But I'm ready to get
back on top.

109
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,497
I chose sandblasted.

110
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:12,099
I see all the seals
and the dolphins,

111
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:14,001
and I really like
doing aquatic creatures.

112
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:16,404
So I'm just gonna do
a sea-horse dragon.

113
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,773
I think the profile
will be really beautiful

114
00:05:18,807 --> 00:05:20,941
with a big arch
in the back of the neck.

115
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:23,911
And then I'm gonna build
a bodysuit

116
00:05:23,945 --> 00:05:25,312
that holds the arms in.

117
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:26,847
I definitely think
I can pull this off

118
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,583
if I really stay on track
and manage my time well.

119
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:36,557
I love dragons that have
that pointed-beak look

120
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:39,493
inspired by vultures and birds.

121
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:43,264
I'm definitely using the ice
or some elements as accessories,

122
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:44,832
bringing it out in the back
of the head,

123
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,067
having the ice even part
of its bone structure.

124
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:52,840
I've got kind of
a low-crawling,

125
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,108
doglike lizard

126
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:57,511
who vomits slime
to ward off enemies.

127
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:58,813
I'm thinking,

128
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,781
"Let's throw a couple
different eyes in there,

129
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,283
and let's hide the human eyes,

130
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,251
and let's give it
a big, weird mouth."

131
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:06,454
Like, a gross, pitbull-ish,

132
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:10,224
just slobbery monster.

133
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,226
I started sketching
different things

134
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,428
that I would like to do--
hands,

135
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:17,131
feet, backpieces, chest pieces,

136
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,533
even though I don't know
if I'm be able to make it all.

137
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,335
He's mostly
like a dragon slave.

138
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:24,726
_

139
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,291
_

140
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:32,135
Tar brings up
really strong imagery to me.

141
00:06:32,214 --> 00:06:34,217
You know, I think stone.
I think desert.

142
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:37,208
So I'm feeling like doing maybe
a Middle Eastern-looking,

143
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,087
maybe even
Persian-looking dragon.

144
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:47,138
My concept is a female that
is banished from the castle.

145
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,296
She's waiting
for her husband dragon

146
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:50,998
to come back and meet again.

147
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:54,235
I'm really hoping
that a good-quality sculpt

148
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:57,404
will sell the dragon
more so than the slime.

149
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:02,042
Okay, everyone,
let's go back to the lab.

150
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:11,685
We get to the lab.

151
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,355
We only have five hours today.

152
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,957
I need to get the face
sculpted and molded

153
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:20,294
by the end of the day so
I can get it ready for foam.

154
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:23,898
My concept for my quill dragon
is that she's an archer.

155
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:26,100
So she uses her own quills
and feathers

156
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:28,802
to create her arrows.

157
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:34,141
My story is about a knight

158
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,310
who was messing around
with the wizard's wife,

159
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,213
and the wizard turned him
to a fire dragon.

160
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,081
It has to be
a strong, impactful image.

161
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,050
And I want to make him
cool and mean.

162
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,424
My dragon is
a treasure hoarder.

163
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,794
She's able to spit acid
to protect treasures.

164
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:56,263
When I think of acid
and corrosion,

165
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,799
I think of greens and purples--

166
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,936
my favorite colors.

167
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,572
So I'm thinking, "Okay,
this is an individual challenge.

168
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:05,773
And I've got to make sure

169
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,441
that I concentrate on the face
and the cowl."

170
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:08,709
Since it's about corrosion

171
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,911
and he spits acid
out of his face,

172
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,513
I have the bottom jaw eroded.

173
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:14,214
All the skin's gone.

174
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:16,483
I don't have time to make
a bodysuit or a tail or wings.

175
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:18,285
I've really got to put
some detail into this

176
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,754
and try to make it good.

177
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:28,462
I have a really clear idea
right off the get-go.

178
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,698
I want to break up
the human form

179
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:33,200
so it doesn't look just
like a guy in a dragon mask.

180
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:36,270
And I really want this dragon
to have huge, massive wings

181
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:40,808
to really sell the idea
of it being a dragon.

182
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,309
I'm not really thinking

183
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:44,878
about what I can and cannot do
by myself.

184
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:47,448
I'm just going
with my ideal dragon.

185
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:49,316
And then later on,
I'll have to be like,

186
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:52,686
"Ah, well, I can't really do
all of these things."

187
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,526
- It's not gonna work.
- It's not gonna work?

188
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,228
Not what I was thinking, nope.

189
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:02,863
I always focus on one side

190
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:04,431
when I'm trying
to figure shit out.

191
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:06,033
Yep.
That's a big mistake.

192
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,434
Yep.

193
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:10,638
I made
the ultimate sculpture mistake

194
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,673
and only sculpted
one side of the face.

195
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:15,409
Now I have to match
the other side,

196
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,711
and I'm falling behind.

197
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:21,615
I still have to make the leg
and the headpiece.

198
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,419
You know, this is way
fucking harder than I thought.

199
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:28,022
All the other artists
are ahead of me,

200
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:31,058
and I'm starting
to get super nervous.

201
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:35,162
It just feels like the world
is crashing down on me.

202
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:37,865
I've just shitted myself over.

203
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:42,536
Coming up...

204
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:45,873
- It just cracks.
- It's not going to happen.

205
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:48,676
I'm tired. I'm stressed out.
I've had it for today.

206
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,678
- I'm going home.
- It's beautiful.

207
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,547
I don't know what it is
that you're trying to show me.

208
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:56,183
It's not your best work.

209
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,189
It's our first day of our
first individual challenge,

210
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:09,258
and I'm already falling behind.

211
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,026
- It's not gonna work.
- It's not gonna work?

212
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,529
- I sculpted one side.
- That's a big mistake.

213
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:15,697
There's not gonna be
enough time for me

214
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:20,035
to mold the face, so now
I have to mold it tomorrow.

215
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,273
Hey, guys.

216
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,908
- Here for a walk-through.
- How are you?

217
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:26,909
Hey.

218
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,177
- Hey, Tanner.
- Hello.

219
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,645
- Hi, Tanner. How are you?
- Hello, Mr. Westmore.

220
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,846
All right,
tell us about your dragon.

221
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,347
I got charred.

222
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,983
So I'm thinking the bottom jaw
is gonna be like charcoal.

223
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,652
- Across the lips?
- Yeah.

224
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:38,720
I think it'd be interesting
if-- would be to maybe

225
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:42,658
vacuform a chin piece
when they open their mouth.

226
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:43,792
It'll move the whole--

227
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:45,060
The whole thing will move
all at one time.

228
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:46,395
- That's a great idea.
- Okay?

229
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:47,663
So I chose frozen.

230
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,699
I thought that
a female ice dragon

231
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,835
would be really, really cool
and sexy.

232
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,304
I'm just wondering
if the human mouth

233
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,206
might make this dragon
too human.

234
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,407
Give it something

235
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,310
to make a little bit more
of a muzzle on it.

236
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,477
- Okay?
- Thank you so much.

237
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:03,846
The dragon is kind of like
a scavenger

238
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,447
of the frozen wasteland.

239
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,316
What color are you
planning on going with?

240
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,085
Definitely something
with blacks, blues,

241
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,553
and whites and grays.

242
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,955
- The thing is, don't over--
- Don't overdo it.

243
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,056
Don't overdo it.

244
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,090
So I don't ruin all the detail.

245
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:16,291
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes.

246
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,227
Mr. Westmore always has
great things to say.

247
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,363
I always really try to take
his advice into consideration

248
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:23,498
all the time,
because at the end of the day,

249
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,268
he really knows
what he's talking about.

250
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:28,370
You're getting awfully thin
down in here.

251
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,671
This can be hard to apply.

252
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:32,441
You got all these edges
that have to go-- add more clay.

253
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,476
Otherwise, you're just gonna
have a problem

254
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,411
- on application day.
- Okay.

255
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,813
It's important
to teach your model

256
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:38,981
- how to walk.
- Do the hunch.

257
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,582
Not to walk in,
but to hunch over...

258
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,284
- Hunch over, yeah.
- And really take advantage

259
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:43,285
- of the space.
- That shape. Yeah.

260
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,653
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

261
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:45,721
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Rashaad.

262
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,556
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

263
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,358
All right, everybody.
We're heading out,

264
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,260
- but good luck.
- Thank you!

265
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,527
- Bye-bye.
- Can't wait. Bye-bye.

266
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:55,230
Thank you.

267
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:56,365
I finish my skull.

268
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,733
I'm the first in the mold room,

269
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,835
and already I'm feeling good
because I have a leg up.

270
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,271
I have a chance to get
my facepiece out

271
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,472
and ready to go,

272
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:06,275
so I can have something
to go off of tomorrow.

273
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,778
Now we have one hour left.

274
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,417
Tyler is my buddy.

275
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:16,485
But we're competitors,

276
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,654
so I'm trying to keep up
with him.

277
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,522
By the end of the day,
he gets his mold done,

278
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:21,523
ready for foam.

279
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:22,824
I get my face molded,

280
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:25,193
but there's not enough time
to open it.

281
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,562
I'm gonna have to save it
for the morning.

282
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,531
Time, everyone.

283
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:31,466
So I'm really worried
about tomorrow

284
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,702
because I have to get
my mold cleaned,

285
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:35,003
mold up my cowl,

286
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,171
and on top of that,

287
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:38,040
I have to fabricate
an entire bodysuit.

288
00:12:47,417 --> 00:12:49,151
No time, people!
No time!

289
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,886
It's day two
of the dragon challenge,

290
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,089
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab today.

291
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,792
First thing that I'm gonna do
is finish sculpting the cowl.

292
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:59,895
I still need to mold the face,
mold the cowl,

293
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,030
sculpt the body piece,
mold the body piece.

294
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:04,466
I might be a little insane.

295
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:14,009
The cowl is done,
but I'm running around crazy

296
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,312
because I still have to sculpt
the face, hands, chest,

297
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:20,882
and get it all molded, cleaned,
and ready for foam latex.

298
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,854
I really want to show off
all the detail,

299
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,323
so I'm going to incorporate
scale texture.

300
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm just trying to get it done
as quickly as possible.

301
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:40,202
I decided to fabricate
a muscle bodysuit.

302
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,138
You start by making a skin
for the actor,

303
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,908
and you block out where these
muscles are gonna go.

304
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,544
I also cut out
each individual scale

305
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,812
that's gonna go on the body.

306
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:52,280
Most people would sculpt.

307
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:53,815
But with fabrication,

308
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,816
you don't have to mold it,

309
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,451
you don't have to run it
in foam.

310
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:59,755
You just get it done
and paint it, and that's it.

311
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,460
After I get the face
ready and molded,

312
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,001
I focus on the legs.

313
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,131
I need to make
those insanely detailed

314
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:10,399
just like I did the face.

315
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,634
That's going to take me
a lot of time,

316
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:16,371
but I think it's gonna be
worth it.

317
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,077
I need to figure out
how I'm gonna put slime

318
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,578
all over this dragon.

319
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,481
And I decide on slime sacs.

320
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:30,152
So I start to make a bunch
of little round vacuforms

321
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:31,887
and start cramming them
into the cowl.

322
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:37,959
They give a nice, smooth,
and round shape.

323
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:41,029
I'm really happy
with this design.

324
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:44,433
So I get to the mold room,
and I'm about two hours behind

325
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,002
from my original schedule.

326
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,136
This is really not good.

327
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,871
The body sculpt
isn't even started.

328
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,740
I'm starting to sweat.

329
00:14:54,777 --> 00:15:01,021
After I sculpt ten icicle pieces,
I vacuum four of them all in one shot.

330
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:03,724
it's quick,
and it's extremely lightweight.

331
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:07,161
I'm actually surprised
at what I got done on day one.

332
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:08,662
So I'm thinking
I can incorporate

333
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:10,430
another element,
which is wings.

334
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:14,001
I'm starting with big,
chunky pieces of foam,

335
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:15,302
armature wire, foam tubing

336
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:19,473
and bending it
to the shape that I want.

337
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,212
We got, like, 25 minutes.

338
00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:29,950
We're getting
to the end of the day.

339
00:15:29,984 --> 00:15:32,853
I get the top
of my big cowl mold open.

340
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,890
But then I can't get
the core out.

341
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:38,325
The mold is locked.

342
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,726
Graham, do you have a sec?

343
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:42,196
Everybody is just desperately
trying to help me

344
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,864
get this thing out,

345
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:47,334
because they all know
the consequences if I don't.

346
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:51,271
Finally, we pulled really hard,
and we open it.

347
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:54,208
- Fuck.
- We smashed the core.

348
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:57,377
Then we run over and spray it
out as quickly as possible.

349
00:15:57,412 --> 00:16:00,414
- But nothing's coming out.
- It's not gonna happen, man.

350
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:03,258
_

351
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:05,819
There is clay stuck
in the top of the mold.

352
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,254
My fingers are cut.

353
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,556
I'm tired. I'm stressed out.
I'm hot.

354
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,358
I've had it for today.

355
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:14,862
But I know if I give up
right now, I'm going home.

356
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,671
It's the end of day two
of our dragon challenge,

357
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:22,007
and I'm having a breakdown.

358
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,109
I'm not gonna have enough time
to get my mold prepped

359
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:26,245
so it can bake overnight
in foam latex.

360
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,814
- Five minutes!
- Fuck.

361
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,349
You could do poly foam.

362
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:32,117
Poly foam doesn't work
very well.

363
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:34,019
It's hard to cut
and glue back together.

364
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:35,254
It's hard to seam it.

365
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:37,322
I just-- I don't have
a chest or anything.

366
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,291
I didn't get
that even started today.

367
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:42,861
Time's up!
That's it!

368
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,296
I'm freaking out right now.

369
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,432
I don't know how this
is all gonna be possible.

370
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:50,402
It'll be all right, Chloe.

371
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,110
It's application day.

372
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:01,246
We've got four hours in the lab
and one hour in last looks.

373
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:05,317
These are hot.

374
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:07,452
I think my pieces
look really good.

375
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,254
But there's a lot of things
that need to happen,

376
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,089
so I'm getting
a little worried.

377
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:13,125
The judges' critique
on the last challenge

378
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,393
was that I needed better paint.

379
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:16,361
So my primary goal is to get
the appliances

380
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:17,696
on as fast as possible

381
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,732
and then take the time to paint.

382
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:24,069
First thing I do is get
the bodysuit painted,

383
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:25,871
make sure it looks flawless.

384
00:17:25,905 --> 00:17:29,508
I have to stay focused 'cause
I have a load of work to do.

385
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:34,313
It's time to run
the poly foam in my mold.

386
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:37,549
Thankfully, Niko comes over
to help me.

387
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,985
I have to wait
another 45 minutes

388
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,420
so the poly foam can cure.

389
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:42,688
The clock is ticking,

390
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:46,425
and I don't even know
if I have a piece yet.

391
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:51,697
- I'm Corinne. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

392
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:52,764
We have to put
all your hair up.

393
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,233
Can you do me a favor, brother?

394
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,168
- Heat this up.
- Yep.

395
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:57,669
No time! No time!

396
00:17:57,704 --> 00:18:01,306
After helping Chloe,
I go check my chest piece.

397
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,775
It just cracks.

398
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,178
What am I gonna do?
I don't have a chest piece.

399
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,813
I look at everyone else,

400
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:10,282
and they already
have pieces done.

401
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:12,384
I realize
I'm really, really behind.

402
00:18:12,418 --> 00:18:15,187
Now I have to airbrush
the whole chest,

403
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:17,756
and that takes a lot of time.

404
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:26,465
The first thing
that I'm focusing on

405
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:27,666
is busting out those legs.

406
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,001
We're gonna do this.

407
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,636
Just don't rip it.
Just don't rip it.

408
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,006
But I can't get the things
off the mannequin.

409
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,743
So I have to slice up the side
and take the legs off that way,

410
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:40,512
which creates this giant seam.

411
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,614
I have my model put it over
her legs,

412
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,017
and it's just not
even closing together.

413
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:47,653
Luckily, I had some
blender pieces made up,

414
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:50,389
so I have to safety-pin
the pieces together,

415
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:53,058
and this totally eats away
my time.

416
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,232
One of the colors
for the dragon

417
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:01,833
is intense red
coming through the cracks,

418
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:05,203
because it's a volcano
kind of fire dragon.

419
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,372
So I want it breathe through
the cracks of the skin.

420
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,374
So my first layer is red,

421
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:12,511
then I go with metallic black.

422
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:15,080
I think it's looking fantastic.

423
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:17,015
It needs a lot of work
on the paint job,

424
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,485
but overall, it looks how
I "visioned" it.

425
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,822
I need to get
this backpiece completed.

426
00:19:23,856 --> 00:19:26,224
I still have to cut out
all of these different scales.

427
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:29,561
Dremel in texture,
glue them down, paint them.

428
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:31,229
I can't go small
when it comes to dragons.

429
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,464
I got to go big,

430
00:19:32,498 --> 00:19:35,233
and that's a tall order
for one person to do.

431
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:38,136
Just hold this
on your face for me.

432
00:19:39,472 --> 00:19:42,574
My cowl will not release
from the core,

433
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,843
so I have to cut it up
the seam.

434
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:47,612
It may be be too small.
Let me know.

435
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,549
So now I have a cowl
that's basically cut in half.

436
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,451
And it won't glue back together

437
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:55,954
because of the cell structure
of the poly foam.

438
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:59,091
The facepiece alone
looks absolutely ridiculous.

439
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,194
So I'm gonna paint the face
and the cowl

440
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:03,895
up to where the damage is,
and I'm gonna cover

441
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,097
the rest with the hood.

442
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:07,199
I'd rather go with something

443
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:10,469
that creates the shape
than just nothing at all.

444
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:13,739
I have an hour left,
and I need to start painting,

445
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:16,541
or I'm gonna not only have
a damaged piece,

446
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:20,045
but I'm gonna have
an unpainted piece.

447
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:31,156
I put a base coat
of dark black paint,

448
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,525
and then I go in
with some greens

449
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,761
and some golds
to highlight everything.

450
00:20:35,795 --> 00:20:37,295
By going
with a dark tone first,

451
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,565
it gets in all the little nooks
and crannies of the scales,

452
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,534
and I'm able to dry-brush
a lighter color

453
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:44,436
to really pop out
all the detail.

454
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,905
I'm not rushing.
Everything's going as planned.

455
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:49,975
And I'm doing
really, really well with time.

456
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:52,811
I've got all
my prosthetics applied.

457
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:54,079
They look good.

458
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:56,915
Now all I got to do is cover
this giant dude in paint

459
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,450
and slime and sticks.

460
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:00,919
My slime is made from gelatin,

461
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:03,622
which can only be used
when it's been heated.

462
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:06,425
I start just slamming slime
left and right,

463
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:08,193
all over his slime sacs.

464
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:11,029
I'm sticking leaves.
I'm putting sticks.

465
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:12,264
It's looking really good.

466
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:14,099
I'm happy with how the slime
is coming out.

467
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:15,534
It's exactly what I want.

468
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,908
I'm running out of time.

469
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:27,045
I need to get her makeup on
and her based out

470
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,915
so that I can at least have
a good paint job.

471
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:32,818
We got six minutes.

472
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,196
That's time, everybody!

473
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,498
I'm super worried
about the hair.

474
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,899
The hair's a hot mess.

475
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:50,902
And there's not a single quill
on her face.

476
00:21:50,937 --> 00:21:52,904
Absolutely nothing's
going right.

477
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:56,541
I only have one more hour left
to get everything done.

478
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:59,377
I'm fucking screwed.

479
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:00,879
Coming up...

480
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:03,014
That's the worst makeup
I've ever done in my life.

481
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:04,449
I might not put it up there.

482
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:06,751
I'm running out of time,
and that's scaring me.

483
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:08,620
I couldn't be more pleased
with this makeup.

484
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:11,389
My biggest problem is it's
rather ponderous viewing.

485
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:13,458
Head to toe, it's rough.

486
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,881
Left side.
Other--

487
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,616
It's last looks--

488
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:27,718
one hour
till we have to be done.

489
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,489
Head up a little bit.
Yeah, right there.

490
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:33,524
My heart's racing,
because if this thing

491
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:39,673
is as bad as I think it's gonna be,
I might just not put it up there at all.

492
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,910
I want to make sure I glue
on all my icicle pieces.

493
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,378
Ugh.

494
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:47,214
As soon as I get those on,
the whole makeup is complete.

495
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,617
I'm really worried
about this wardrobe.

496
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,018
I don't know what to do here.

497
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:53,153
It doesn't go
with my makeup at all.

498
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:55,155
But at this point, I just have
to go with it, you know.

499
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,958
Ten minutes, family,
ten minutes.

500
00:22:57,993 --> 00:22:58,959
Stay closed.

501
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:00,327
I'm running out of time,

502
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:02,129
and that's scaring
the living shit out of me.

503
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:04,765
So I'm just shoving quills
wherever I can,

504
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,768
trying to finish
before time's called.

505
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:14,441
That's time!

506
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,776
That looks so good.

507
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,244
That's probably
the worst makeup

508
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,079
I've ever done in my life.

509
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:20,848
I can't believe
that I have to put this

510
00:23:20,882 --> 00:23:23,050
in front of people
that I admire.

511
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:25,586
When I look at my makeup,
I'm heartbroken.

512
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:39,500
Welcome
to the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

513
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:41,656
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

514
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:45,197
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges--

515
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:47,664
Owner of Optic Nerve
Make-Up Effects Studio,

516
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:49,533
- Glenn Hetrick...
- Good evening.

517
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:50,734
Hi, Glenn.

Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist

519
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:53,870
- Ve Neill...
- Hi, guys.

520
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:55,038
- Hey, Ve.
- Hi, Ve.

521
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:57,407
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

522
00:23:57,442 --> 00:23:58,508
Hello, everyone.

523
00:23:58,543 --> 00:23:59,977
- Hi, Neville.
- Hi, Neville.

524
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:02,779
This week, your first
individual spotlight challenge

525
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:04,548
was to choose a damaged shield

526
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:07,551
and create the dragon character
responsible for inflicting it.

527
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:09,686
Let's take a look
at your dragons.

528
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,209
Everything came together
perfectly.

529
00:24:32,243 --> 00:24:35,012
I am just in awe
of what I accomplished

530
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:37,547
in three days.

531
00:24:54,065 --> 00:24:55,432
I like the profile,

532
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:58,035
even though the paint job
still looks muddy.

533
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:01,738
I don't know if I feel happy
or satisfied or nervous or...

534
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:04,675
I'm getting crazy right now.

535
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:22,926
I think it's a really cool,
solid piece.

536
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,127
My vision came to life.

537
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:26,029
I'm happy with this makeup.

538
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:43,914
I'm a little bummed

539
00:25:43,948 --> 00:25:46,049
that I went so heavy
with fabricating,

540
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,018
when that's not really
my strong suit.

541
00:25:48,052 --> 00:25:51,521
This makeup is not exactly
what I was hoping it would be.

542
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:12,275
I'm liking his profile,

543
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,411
and I'm liking the fact
that he looks like a dragon.

544
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:15,612
So I'm just waiting to see

545
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:18,615
what the judges are gonna
think about this.

546
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,567
This guy's a tar dragon,
and he looks beautiful.

547
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:41,071
I think he definitely fits
the challenge.

548
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:57,287
She's got a beautiful
silhouette to her,

549
00:26:57,321 --> 00:26:59,456
and she looks great.

550
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,859
I think
it really came together.

551
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:22,979
He looks so cool, just rad.

552
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:26,383
I'm super happy with him.

553
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,401
I really like it.
I mean, I like it a lot.

554
00:27:44,435 --> 00:27:45,802
It looks really cool.

555
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:47,838
Overall, it just pops.

556
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:08,191
I really messed up.

557
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:12,095
I honestly cannot think
of a time

558
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:16,099
when I've seen a piece
this bad onstage.

559
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:34,618
I think her proportions
are totally off.

560
00:28:34,652 --> 00:28:36,353
It's way too cartoony.

561
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:39,689
I'm not confident
with the overall paint.

562
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:56,339
This creature just sucks.

563
00:28:56,374 --> 00:28:57,841
There's so much wrong with it.

564
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:01,311
There's nothing for me
to be truly proud of.

565
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:20,764
I'm really happy
with how it turned out.

566
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:22,098
I'm feeling really good.

567
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,200
I think it's the best
I've done so far.

568
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:31,741
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look

569
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,810
at the dragons?

570
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:38,114
This is a cool
second chin here.

571
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:39,683
- I like that.
- Yeah, I didn't see that.

572
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:43,019
These are vacuformed--
Good idea.

573
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,888
On the face,
we have one solid color again.

574
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:49,897
I think there's far too much
activity sculpturally.

575
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:55,119
This is kind of confusing.

576
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,771
It's like armor sort of.

577
00:29:56,772 --> 00:30:00,296
It feels more like a sea creature
than it does a dragon.

578
00:30:00,297 --> 00:30:01,832
Yeah. Agreed.

579
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:06,628
Look at the detail
in this paint--

580
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:08,889
all the highlights and shadows

581
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,863
and modeling
in between the scales.

582
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:12,985
And there's a ton
of fabrication.

583
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:16,983
This kind of looks like
a Chinese dragon.

584
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:17,984
Yeah.

585
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,608
It's a beautiful,
original design--

586
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:21,838
Everything
that's happening here.

587
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,625
Really, really cool.

588
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,564
I'm just going to see
how far--

589
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:29,151
Could you hold this, please?

590
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:30,926
Glenn grabs for the hood,

591
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:33,086
and I know he's just gonna rip
that thing off.

592
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:34,714
Looks like there was
a problem or something,

593
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,225
But there's a lot of work.

594
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:37,424
I'm crushed.

595
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:39,219
I would rather
it not be out there.

596
00:30:40,717 --> 00:30:42,009
I'm going home.

597
00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:47,428
Who made your favorite
dragon character tonight?

598
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,250
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

599
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:55,533
Looks like there was
a problem or something.

600
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:57,435
- But there's a lot of work.
- Oh, yeah.

601
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:58,603
This doesn't look very good.

602
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:01,773
It's really hard for me
to watch this happen.

603
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:06,477
She's glued this thing on
so crookedly.

604
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,778
This goes that way,
and then that goes straight up.

605
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:11,382
All this detailing
and texture everywhere

606
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,817
is covered...

607
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:14,786
- And then--
- ...except nothing on the chin.

608
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:17,152
_

609
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,057
Thank you.

610
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:25,196
The judges have scored
your creations,

611
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,332
so let's find out
what they thought.

612
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:29,334
Tyler...

613
00:31:29,368 --> 00:31:31,202
George...

614
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,004
Tess...

615
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:35,173
Niko...

616
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:37,508
Rashaad...

617
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:40,278
Daniel...

618
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:43,514
You are the best
and worst this week.

619
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:45,350
The rest of you are safe.

620
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,820
You can head back
to the makeup room.

621
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,059
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

622
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:57,328
to learn more about your work.

623
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,464
- George, please step up.
- Sure.

624
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:06,638
George, please explain
the concept

625
00:32:06,672 --> 00:32:07,939
behind your dragon design.

626
00:32:07,973 --> 00:32:10,375
He was a knight
in medieval times.

627
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:12,744
He fall in love
with the wizard's wife,

628
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:14,512
and the wizard got very mad

629
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:18,049
and throw him
to the pits of hell, basically.

630
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,019
It's so apparent
what you were trying to do,

631
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:24,188
and that's a huge compliment.

632
00:32:24,223 --> 00:32:26,190
It's not that easy
to communicate

633
00:32:26,225 --> 00:32:27,659
those types of ideas.

634
00:32:27,693 --> 00:32:31,429
Particularly fond of the horn
placement and design.

635
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:33,264
- Well done.
- Thank you.

636
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,799
I love this dragon.

637
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,334
It really looks like it's made

638
00:32:36,368 --> 00:32:38,503
out of some sort
of bronzed metal.

639
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:40,805
And you can just see fire
coming out of it.

640
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,607
I couldn't be more pleased
with this makeup.

641
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:43,708
Thank you so much.

642
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:45,443
As much as I really love this,

643
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:48,413
I also feel
that it's not terribly creative

644
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:50,615
in terms of inventing
something new,

645
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,850
but it's beautiful.

646
00:32:52,885 --> 00:32:54,619
George, thank you very much.

647
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:57,555
Please step back.

648
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:00,224
Niko, you're next.

649
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:07,832
Please tell us what your
concept was behind your dragon.

650
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:09,434
He was a slave dragon.

651
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:13,037
He goes for revenge with
the people that attack him.

652
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,908
I feel that the sculpting
was very rough.

653
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:20,078
It's disproportionate.
It's kind of off in spots.

654
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:23,514
It's not your best work today.

655
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:26,751
I think in side view,
the quills work.

656
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:28,319
The paint on the face, though,

657
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:31,155
other than being mismatched
to the body,

658
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,891
it just feels like there's not
enough happening.

659
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:35,426
My biggest problem with this

660
00:33:35,461 --> 00:33:37,895
is that
it's rather ponderous viewing.

661
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,865
My eye doesn't find
a place to go to.

662
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:43,968
I don't know what it is
that you're trying to show me.

663
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:46,237
Niko,
will you please step back?

664
00:33:52,478 --> 00:33:54,345
Let's talk to Tess.

665
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:02,420
So tell us about the shield's
damage and your character.

666
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:03,788
I got "Quilled,"

667
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:05,857
and I wanted her
to be able to use

668
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:08,659
her feathers and her quills
to make her bow and arrows.

669
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:11,696
I like where you're going
with the idea of this,

670
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,731
but it's just rough.

671
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:16,801
Particularly around the mouth,

672
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:19,170
it just starts
to fall apart there.

673
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:22,039
A feathered serpent dragon
is a really cool idea.

674
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:24,142
But the feathers seem jammed in

675
00:34:24,176 --> 00:34:26,978
underneath the appliance,
and that is a huge problem,

676
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:29,414
because that is the focus
of your design this week.

677
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:30,515
Yeah.

678
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:32,784
The headpiece went off
to the side.

679
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:34,986
It got a little crooked
in your application.

680
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,287
Also I think
you should have tried

681
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:38,489
to integrate her chin
into this makeup

682
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:39,791
a little bit more as well.

683
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:42,493
- I agree.
- Tess, please step back.

684
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:52,036
- Tyler, please step forward.
- Okay.

685
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:56,474
There she is.

686
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:58,276
Tell me how you integrated
the damage

687
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,011
on your shield
into this character.

688
00:35:00,045 --> 00:35:01,846
The damage on the shield
is "Frozen."

689
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,449
And this dragon is
a vulture-like character

690
00:35:04,483 --> 00:35:07,218
that wanders
the frozen wasteland.

691
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:09,320
It's killer.

692
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:13,324
It is super cool,
and that unifying concept

693
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,060
of vulture in your dragon--

694
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:18,329
it gives you motivation
for wardrobe,

695
00:35:18,363 --> 00:35:20,164
wing shape, jaw shape.

696
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,467
Lots and lots
of wise decisions.

697
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:23,634
Thank you.

698
00:35:23,669 --> 00:35:26,437
This is probably
the best set of wings

699
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:29,173
- we have ever had on the show.
- Yes!

700
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,576
It's just all part
of a creepy elegance.

701
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,078
- She looks amazing.
- Thank you very much.

702
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:35,847
What I want to compliment
you on the most

703
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:37,682
is just
some very intelligent choices.

704
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:42,487
Those half-vacform icicles
on the back of the head--

705
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:44,121
you accomplished a look,

706
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:47,758
and you allowed your actor
to still function.

707
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:49,160
Compliments to you.

708
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:50,962
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

709
00:35:50,996 --> 00:35:53,197
Tyler, please step back.

710
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:58,102
Daniel, please step up.

711
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:06,210
Tell us what your concept is
behind your dragon.

712
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:08,312
My damage was "Slimed."

713
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:11,716
And she is "outcasted" from
her legion of other dragons,

714
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,018
and she's living in a cave now,
hoping for the day

715
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:16,120
that she can get reconciled
with her husband.

716
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:20,491
It really is not
a pretty picture.

717
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:23,761
It's a very
uncomfortable-looking palate.

718
00:36:23,795 --> 00:36:25,830
And that doesn't look
like scaling.

719
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:28,199
It looks like she's
got green chainmail on her.

720
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:29,734
It's very odd.

721
00:36:29,768 --> 00:36:32,770
I think you got a lot of stuff
mixed up here this week.

722
00:36:32,804 --> 00:36:34,872
The kimono is killing it.

723
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:37,775
You knew the palate,
but you didn't integrate it

724
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:38,910
in her design.

725
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:41,946
I think it was
a really huge mistake.

726
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,284
There's a conspicuous lack
of dragon elements--

727
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:48,819
horns, teeth, wings,

728
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:51,222
something that tells us dragon.

729
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:53,624
It's not here
this week, Daniel.

730
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:56,594
Daniel,
will you please step back?

731
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,134
Rashaad, please come forward.

732
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:11,375
So tell us
about your shield's damage

733
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,411
and what this character
is about.

734
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:15,179
The shield had tar on it.

735
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,647
So, when I thought of tar,

736
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:20,284
I thought thick, heavy, big,
and brutish.

737
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,687
It's mind-blowing.

738
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:25,523
How the hell
did you do this much

739
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:26,757
in the time that you had?

740
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,125
This looks
like it's a team effort,

741
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,761
and I can tell that you've got
a real great sense

742
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:33,164
of form language
in fabrication,

743
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:35,299
- which is impressive.
- Thank you.

744
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:37,668
Paint technique
is absolutely splendid.

745
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:39,570
Love everything
that you're doing.

746
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:40,972
Beautiful.

747
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:44,075
Can you turn him around
so we can see his wings?

748
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:46,377
The fact that you even
had time to build wings

749
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:49,480
and you continued that paint job
along the spine of the wings

750
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:50,615
is pretty great.

751
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:52,049
Very nicely done, Rashaad.

752
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:53,150
Thank you.

753
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:54,986
Rashaad, please step back.

754
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:59,423
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

755
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,492
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

756
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:03,427
Could you please head back
to the makeup room

757
00:38:03,462 --> 00:38:07,098
while they deliberate?

758
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,037
All right, judges, why
don't we talk about the looks

759
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,705
you liked the most this week?

760
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,273
Let's start with George's work.

761
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:20,011
It resembled a really amazing
Chinese dragon.

762
00:38:20,045 --> 00:38:22,680
Yeah, the forms were
so well done.

763
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:23,981
Okay, let's move on to Tyler.

764
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:26,217
Taking a vulture
and the frozen idea

765
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:29,186
and then allowing
those two things to merge--

766
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,388
absolutely brilliant.

767
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:31,989
The teeth, the beak--

768
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:34,325
Tyler's got
some sculpting chops.

769
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:36,961
All right, judges,
let's move on to Rashaad.

770
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:38,796
What a massive amount of work,

771
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,698
featuring a massive amount
of detail.

772
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:44,468
It did not seem like a single
person pulled that off.

773
00:38:44,503 --> 00:38:46,971
Okay, let's move on to
the looks you liked the least.

774
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,472
Why don't we start with Niko?

775
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:52,777
The sculpture was so fussy
and overly complicated.

776
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:55,112
The face was just one tone.

777
00:38:55,147 --> 00:38:57,181
All right,
let's move on to Tess.

778
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:00,251
She put it on crooked
and had the dragon-like ears,

779
00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:01,952
but she didn't finish
painting them.

780
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:03,287
She made some poor choices.

781
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:06,557
It does feel dragon-y to me,
but the paint kills it.

782
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:09,060
Let's move on to Daniel.

783
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:13,397
Why did he put that
Japanese kimono on her?

784
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:14,965
That doesn't bother me so much

785
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,436
as I can't find a dragon element
that's recognizable.

786
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:22,006
I have no idea how this fits
this week's challenge.

787
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,141
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

788
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:25,776
- Yeah.
- I believe so.

789
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:27,878
Let's bring them back out.

790
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:37,555
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

791
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:42,226
George, your dragon was
powerful but graceful.

792
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,796
And it clearly communicated
your shield's damage.

793
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:47,364
Tyler...

794
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:51,102
the vulture concept
was a brilliant stroke,

795
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:55,372
and we felt that you also made
a ton of smart decisions.

796
00:39:55,407 --> 00:39:56,941
Rashaad...

797
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:59,710
we were quite impressed
with the sculpture,

798
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:03,547
the paint, and the sheer volume
of work that you did.

799
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:06,117
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

800
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:08,519
Tonight's winner is...

801
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:15,150
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

802
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:18,153
Tonight's winner is...

803
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:21,724
Tyler.

804
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:23,092
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

805
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:24,893
Thank you.

806
00:40:24,928 --> 00:40:28,097
Head to toe,
we loved this character.

807
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:31,934
From concept to execution,
everything was spot-on.

808
00:40:31,968 --> 00:40:33,035
Well done.

809
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:34,670
Thank you guys so much.

810
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:36,572
Oh, my gosh.

811
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:40,876
I'm just so happy and thankful
the judges saw my creativity

812
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,145
and what I think
a fantasy dragon looks like.

813
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,814
- Tyler, congratulations.
- Thank you.

814
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:47,616
You, Rashaad, George,

815
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,818
will you please head back
to the makeup room?

816
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:57,693
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

817
00:40:57,727 --> 00:40:59,261
are on the bottom this week,

818
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:01,997
and one of you
will be eliminated.

819
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:04,933
Please step forward.

820
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:14,043
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

821
00:41:14,077 --> 00:41:18,147
Niko, the quill profile
was kind of cool,

822
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:20,082
but there were
significant issues

823
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:22,418
with the sculpture
and the application.

824
00:41:22,452 --> 00:41:25,454
Tess, we really liked
a lot of your ideas.

825
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:28,023
However, your makeup
was quite rough

826
00:41:28,058 --> 00:41:30,125
and generally incomplete.

827
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,163
Daniel, we understand the plan
that you had in mind,

828
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:37,166
but we were confused
by the choices that you made

829
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,435
with your sculpture
and your color.

830
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:41,103
So who is going home tonight?

831
00:41:41,137 --> 00:41:44,073
The person going home
tonight is...

832
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:49,678
Daniel.

833
00:41:49,712 --> 00:41:53,148
You made
some perplexing decisions.

834
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:55,751
The challenge was to make
a dragon,

835
00:41:55,785 --> 00:41:58,921
and we just didn't see that
in your character.

836
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:02,558
That means, Tess and Niko,
you are safe this week.

837
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:05,828
Please head back
to the makeup room.

838
00:42:11,668 --> 00:42:14,203
Daniel, you got
a lot left in you,

839
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:15,504
and I'm hoping
that we get a chance

840
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:16,738
to see that down the road.

841
00:42:16,773 --> 00:42:18,340
Thank you for the opportunity.

842
00:42:18,374 --> 00:42:19,608
Daniel, I'm so sorry,

843
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:21,243
but you have been eliminated.

844
00:42:21,277 --> 00:42:23,112
It's been great having
you here with us.

845
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:24,379
Thank you.

846
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:27,616
Please head back to the makeup room
and pack up your kit.

847
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,451
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Good luck, Daniel.

848
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:32,287
Thank you.

849
00:42:32,322 --> 00:42:34,356
I am not gonna say
I'm not disappointed.

850
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,158
It's me, guys.

851
00:42:36,192 --> 00:42:38,327
- Aw.
- What?

852
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:40,429
I'm really glad<i>Face Off</i>
gave me the opportunity

853
00:42:40,463 --> 00:42:43,031
to show the world a little bit
of what I can do.

854
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:45,100
Oh, yeah!

855
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:47,870
It's been
an awesome experience.

856
00:42:47,904 --> 00:42:49,705
Makeup is everything to me.

857
00:42:51,641 --> 00:42:54,409
I love everything
about what it brings.

858
00:42:54,444 --> 00:42:56,922
And I don't ever see myself
stopping.
