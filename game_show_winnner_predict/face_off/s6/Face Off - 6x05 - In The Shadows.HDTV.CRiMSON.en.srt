1
00:00:00,077 --> 00:00:03,205
- I am thoroughly impressed.
- Beautiful sculpting work.

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:06,475
Rock and roll, Hoochie Koo.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:07,809
Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:11,146
Daran's elegant rock goddess
brought him the win...

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,381
and Tess was sent home.

6
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:17,152
Now, 11 artists remain,

7
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:20,655
and tonight, their creations
will emerge from the shadows.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,725
I'm scared.
That actually scared me.

9
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,761
For some, the challenge
will be too dark to handle.

10
00:00:26,796 --> 00:00:28,363
The nose definitely
has to change.

11
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:29,965
It's little teddy bear,
little Whoville.

12
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,234
Well, that's not good.
I don't want a cute demon.

13
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,503
I fully locked it.
I don't have anything

14
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:35,770
but a face.

15
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:38,473
This is going to be
the end of me.

16
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:41,276
The most important part
of my makeup isn't there.

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,145
I dig it a lot.
It's creepy-licious.

18
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,913
I've never seen anything
like it before.

19
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:47,549
I'm really
kind of disappointed.

20
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,518
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:51,153
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

22
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:54,489
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:57,325
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,161
and $100,000.

25
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:01,563
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

26
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:07,402
<i>Face off!</i>

27
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:09,838
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,751
Getting homesick can, like,
just wipe you out, man.

30
00:01:56,786 --> 00:01:58,520
Got to remember
why we're here, though.

31
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:01,223
When I start feeling homesick
or I-I feel like I miss

32
00:02:01,257 --> 00:02:03,058
my girlfriend or I miss my son,

33
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:05,360
I really have to sit down
and let myself know,

34
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:06,728
they're the reason
why I'm doing what I'm doing.

35
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:10,232
How do you feel about always
being the bridesmaid?

36
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:11,466
It's nice being a top look,
you know,

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,602
that the judges like
what I have.

38
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:14,769
But it plays in my head,

39
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,304
like, am I only good
for just top looks?

40
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:17,806
You know, am I good enough
for a win?

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,407
I've been top looks three times.

42
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:21,243
The judges know
what I'm capable of doing,

43
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:23,511
so I just need to keep
bringing it on.

44
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:26,248
- All right, guys.
- Let's go!

45
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,087
I don't know LA very well,

46
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,422
but we're somewhere downtown...

47
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:35,890
Whoa, that's cool.

48
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:37,359
...and there's
all these warehouses.

49
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,693
We're like, "Where the hell
are we going?"

50
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,895
And then, we get
to this doorway.

51
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:45,166
- Uh-oh.
- What the hell?

52
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,601
It's spooky in here.

53
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,703
We walk
into this big warehouse,

54
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:51,006
and it's super dark
and creepy...

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,974
- What the hell?
- I'm scared.

56
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:55,543
Except for McKenzie.

57
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:58,146
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

58
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,015
I brought you here
to get you in the mood

59
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,651
for this week's
spotlight challenge.

60
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:04,085
In the world
of supernatural cinema...

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,654
Yes.

62
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:08,089
...films like<i> Drag Me To Hell</i>
and<i> Paranormal Activity--</i>

63
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:10,025
they get a lot of mileage
by teasing

64
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,394
but not fully revealing
the dark perpetrator.

65
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:14,863
I'd like to introduce you
to someone

66
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:17,399
who is an expert in this area.

67
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,735
He's produced films such as
<i>Insidious, The Lords Of Salem,</i>

68
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,171
and is the creator
of the blockbuster

69
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:24,773
<i>Paranormal Activity</i> franchise.

70
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:26,408
Nice.

71
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:27,509
Please welcome Oren Peli.

72
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:32,247
Oren has made the most

73
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,816
outrageously crazy,
creepy films.

74
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,351
So I'm really excited
at this point.

75
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,686
Thank you so much
for being here.

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,054
Oh, of course.

77
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:41,456
All right, now your films,
they're really scary.

78
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,857
What is your secret?

79
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:45,060
Well, I think a lot of it
has to do with building up

80
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,862
the audience's fear
and anticipation.

81
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:49,864
Sometimes the scariest thing
is not what you see

82
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:51,132
right in front of you,

83
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,836
but what's hidden
in the shadows.

84
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,472
Whoa.

85
00:03:57,506 --> 00:04:00,508
All of a sudden, these lights
start to appear in the wall,

86
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:01,976
like, different shadows.

87
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:03,912
And we're like,
"Wait. What is this?"

88
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:05,347
That actually scared me.

89
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,715
Your spotlight challenge

90
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:10,352
is to select one
of these exaggerated silhouettes

91
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:12,721
and create the supernatural
entity that cast the shadow.

92
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:14,222
Whoa.

93
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:17,158
This is definitely
going to be intense.

94
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:18,326
I'm really excited
at this point.

95
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:21,062
Chloe, you're up first.

96
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,140
All right,
and I'm excited to say

97
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:34,642
that Oren will be joining us
onstage this week.

98
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:35,877
What are you going
to be looking for

99
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:37,612
in their final makeups?

100
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:39,247
Make sure
that it's a full head-to-toe

101
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,749
application and design.

102
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,917
The most important thing
is that it elicits

103
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:44,252
a natural reaction of fear.

104
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,755
All right, guys.
Get started on your designs.

105
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,123
When you're done,
I want you to head

106
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,157
back to the lab
and get to work.

107
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:50,392
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

108
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:52,293
See you soon.

109
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:57,565
The silhouette is important
in every challenge,

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
but more than ever,

111
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,568
this one is where you
really have

112
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:02,537
to knock it out of the park.

113
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:04,105
Right now, I'm just sketching
kind of the outline

114
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,306
that I have in my shadow.

115
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:07,442
There are a lot of pieces
to this character

116
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:10,378
that have to be on there
to match the silhouette.

117
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,448
My concept is an angel of death
that's been sent from hell

118
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:16,017
to collect souls on Earth.

119
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:18,753
What scares me?
Cockroaches.

120
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:22,524
So I start designing a boogeyman
made out of bug parts.

121
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:26,394
The face is going to be, like,
a balding, old man.

122
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:29,264
But instead of having a mouth,
this creature has

123
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:32,434
all these little legs
with fingernails and teeth

124
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:35,804
that are used to just capture
and eat children.

125
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,439
Graham and I sat down together,

126
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:38,973
right beneath our shadow.

127
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:40,775
We get two people that choose
a shadow, so you're thinking,

128
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,710
"All right,
what's this person going to do?"

129
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:45,780
I am going to use the back
of this monster to my advantage

130
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:48,583
and have a huge mouth
come out of it,

131
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:52,487
which can suck up your soul.

132
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:55,623
I am terrified of bugs,
anything creepy and crawly.

133
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:57,525
This one reminds me of, like,
a scorpion.

134
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,228
I really want to focus
on the hump of the back.

135
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,863
It's going to be
these little egg sacs,

136
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:04,299
almost like it's the creature's
entities coming out

137
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,867
and coming to get you.
Ugh.

138
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,869
I'm really creeped out right
now, just thinking about it.

139
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:11,639
I really hate insects, so I'm
definitely going to play up

140
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:13,374
the insect part
of this character.

141
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,742
I'm going to be sculpting

142
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,544
really, really big
arm extensions

143
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,747
with these huge
praying mantis hands.

144
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:22,417
The shadow has
this huge horn sticking out,

145
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:23,485
right from the face,

146
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,520
so I really want to keep that

147
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:28,056
so that it looks
like the shadow.

148
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,191
Well, I chose this shadow here.

149
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,094
The first thing you notice are

150
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,696
these huge horns
coming out of the head.

151
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,500
So my concept is
a female seductive faun

152
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:42,003
that lives in this warehouse
and causes problems.

153
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:44,873
She likes to cause mischief.

154
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:48,176
I'm looking at the shadow,
and I'm thinking ancient demon.

155
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,813
I want his horns to be so big
that they grow through his body

156
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:53,314
and poke out the front.

157
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,584
The rest of him will be
very slender with spindly limbs.

158
00:06:58,454 --> 00:06:59,954
I picked this one.

159
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:04,592
I'm doing a creature that was
a man who was deemed to hell.

160
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:08,162
Satan turned him
into this goat deity.

161
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:11,132
He goes around skinning people
and trying to wear their skin

162
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,667
to gain back his manhood.

163
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,435
He's going to be skeletal

164
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,404
with pieces of flesh
nailed on him.

165
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:19,340
And he's going to have giant,
oversized horns.

166
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,775
I'm excited.

167
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:22,677
All right, guys.
Let's head back to the lab.

168
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:24,946
Drop those pencils.

169
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,451
We have six hours
at the lab today.

170
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:31,819
Here we go, here we go.
No time.

171
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:34,355
- Let's go.
- We choose our models.

172
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,358
The first thing I need to do
is start the face.

173
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:41,496
In my silhouette, there's
a very pointed nose and chin.

174
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,933
My concept is a goblin
that creeps around at night

175
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,935
and attacks people.

176
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:49,370
How does this look?

177
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:50,805
That looks like a bull.

178
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,574
I chose the same shadow
as Chloe,

179
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:55,209
so I decided to make
this scary minotaur

180
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:57,445
that hunts the hunters
that attacks him.

181
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,836
_

182
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:02,083
I'm trying to make this head
a little bit bigger,

183
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:04,118
so I wanted to incorporate
fake eyes.

184
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:06,287
It's going to be a tricky one,
but I know I can pull it off.

185
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:08,957
- What are you doing there?
- I'm doing a demon.

186
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,459
Still a long ways to go.

187
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,329
I'm making this demon that rips
flesh out of her victims

188
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,863
and eats them alive.

189
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:19,400
I'm concentrating on the face
and the cowl and getting them

190
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:21,569
sculpted and molded
by the end of the day.

191
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:25,873
Hey, guys.

192
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,475
- We're here to check on you.
- How are you?

193
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:28,910
- Hi.
- Ready?

194
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:30,478
The character is going
through necrosis,

195
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:32,480
so his skin is very pale,
and it's got of lot

196
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,748
of that blood
where it's just pooled

197
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,450
and turned purple and blackish.

198
00:08:35,484 --> 00:08:36,851
Mm-hmm.

199
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,853
I would paint him first
and then do

200
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,622
- the rest of your skin texture...
- Right.

201
00:08:40,656 --> 00:08:41,990
...so you see depth
and translucency.

202
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:44,325
- Great.
- I had teeth here, right?

203
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,160
Should I put 'em
in the outside, or--

204
00:08:46,195 --> 00:08:48,129
It's kind of tricky
to make it look like

205
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:50,331
- they haven't been glued on.
- Okay.

206
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,233
They could use their own teeth
but dirty them down.

207
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:55,403
Put a little food dye
in karo syrup and water.

208
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:57,672
Okay, cool.

209
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:00,341
So in the middle of the night,
this thing unleashes

210
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,877
these little creepy-crawlies
that come out of its back.

211
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:04,879
I would love to do little hints
of maybe yellow or white,

212
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,014
just to make it pop.

213
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,248
I'd go with a stencil,

214
00:09:07,282 --> 00:09:08,383
as opposed to trying to go in

215
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,784
- and do things with a brush...
- Okay.

216
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,053
...which could get muddy
or really not read well.

217
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:14,188
This is awfully far apart
for your model to see.

218
00:09:14,223 --> 00:09:16,391
Make sure you dig it out
underneath here

219
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,359
- when you're making your mold.
- Okay.

220
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:19,927
But they may have to do
a little bit of this...

221
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:21,996
- Right.
- ...to be able to see.

222
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,098
So that's the shadow
that I picked,

223
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,433
and this is my face sculpture.

224
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,435
You're gonna try to cover
the whole face with fur

225
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:28,569
or just come
around the edges with it?

226
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,271
Yeah, just kind of,
like, around here.

227
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:31,806
Mm-hmm. It's going to save you
time on painting.

228
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,208
This is actually still horn,
and then it'll go back

229
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:37,145
to the cowl, and then the horns
will come out at the front.

230
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,546
That's an interesting idea,

231
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,015
but I think the nose definitely
has to change a little bit,

232
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,185
because it's little teddy bear,
little Whoville.

233
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,688
It's reading
almost sweet or cute.

234
00:09:46,722 --> 00:09:49,657
Well, that's not good.
I don't want a cute demon.

235
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:53,594
It needs a nose
that's meaner, stronger.

236
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:56,464
By adding more to the nose
and giving it a mouthful

237
00:09:56,498 --> 00:09:57,999
- of piranha teeth or something--
- Right.

238
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,600
That's what you want
this character to do.

239
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:02,303
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

240
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,587
All right, guys, we're heading out.
But it's looking really good.

241
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,722
- Good luck.
- Good luck, guys.

242
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,623
- Bye.
- Bye.

243
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:11,093
I'm sweating bullets
at this point

244
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,729
'cause time's just flying by.

245
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,864
I have to get these molded
and cleaned

246
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,199
before the day is out.

247
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,001
Resculpting the nose is going
to take a long time.

248
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,372
But if my creature's not even
scary, it could be my ass.

249
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,710
- Coming up...
- I'm in a sketchy place.

250
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:31,546
I fully locked it.
Shit.

251
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,048
I still have to mold the cowl,

252
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:34,750
and I don't know
if I'm going to finish this.

253
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,618
You've got some serious issues.

254
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:40,088
This is really
a beautiful piece.

255
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:49,177
It's day one
of our shadow challenge,

256
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:52,780
and given Mr. Westmore's advice,
I'm resculpting the nose,

257
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:55,049
making it larger
and not as tiny and cute.

258
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:57,820
It's really eating up
into my time,

259
00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:59,722
but I think it's worth it,

260
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:01,123
because Oren Peli said
our creatures

261
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:03,626
need to be frightening.

262
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:07,229
Finally, my sculpture
is completed.

263
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:08,831
And I immediately start molding

264
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,599
faster than I've ever
molded before,

265
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:12,968
since I only have
one hour left.

266
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:14,837
- That's what you gotta do?
- Yeah.

267
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:17,540
You know, just everything.

268
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:18,974
Just everything in general.

269
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:21,710
Mold face, mold cowl,
sculpt chest, mold chest.

270
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:23,079
- Make arms.
- Make arms, make other arms.

271
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:24,680
Make some feet.

272
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,982
I'm not the fastest sculptor.

273
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:29,385
But when you're trying to force

274
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:33,155
bug legs into the jaw
and neck anatomy...

275
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:37,359
you need to take a lot of time.

276
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:39,762
That really has to be
done well,

277
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:42,665
in order for it to read
in the correct manner.

278
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,834
I hate cockroaches.
I hate them.

279
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,205
From the shadow,

280
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,140
you could only see
the four horns, the main horns.

281
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:55,377
But I want to make ten horns
because I want a great profile.

282
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:58,747
I decided to go with styrofoam.

283
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:01,450
It's easy to shape,
and it's lightweight,

284
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,918
so you don't have the actor
tipping over.

285
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,454
I'm feeling great.

286
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:07,590
I have more work to do,
but I'm in a great place.

287
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:12,128
You got 33 minutes.

288
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,672
At the end of the day,
I only have my face sculpted,

289
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:26,075
but the focal point of my makeup
is going to be

290
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:27,676
these big arm extensions

291
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:30,479
that look like
praying mantis arms.

292
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:33,682
I'm just starting
to sculpt them now.

293
00:12:33,717 --> 00:12:35,818
Time's up, everybody!

294
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:38,220
- Let's go do some barbecuing.
- I've got a lot to do tomorrow,

295
00:12:38,255 --> 00:12:41,157
and I'm just a nervous wreck.

296
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:51,200
Let's go.

297
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:53,302
It's day two
of our supernatural challenge.

298
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,905
Back to sculpting,
ladies and gentlemen.

299
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,940
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

300
00:12:57,974 --> 00:13:00,209
Already having my face
run in foam,

301
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:03,081
I have to finish my cowl,
do my rib piece,

302
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,101
and I have to finish
sculpting all 10 horns.

303
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,193
It's a lot of work
to do by myself...

304
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,596
This still has
to be shaved down.

305
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,931
...but I know
I'm going to get it done.

306
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,666
- Keeping the neck open, right?
- Yep.

307
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,968
Thanks.

308
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:19,202
All righty then.

309
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:21,571
Yep, that is awesome.
Let's mold you.

310
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:23,573
All I got to do is

311
00:13:23,608 --> 00:13:26,510
finish a face, mold that,
make a vest, mold that,

312
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:28,612
make some extra arms,
open up the molds,

313
00:13:28,646 --> 00:13:29,947
clean those out.

314
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:31,748
So you know, simple day.

315
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:35,352
I use a air hose to get
the plaster

316
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:37,220
into each nook and cranny,

317
00:13:37,255 --> 00:13:39,289
because if it's not
molded right,

318
00:13:39,324 --> 00:13:40,824
you won't see
all the work that you did

319
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:44,828
after sculpting something
so detailed.

320
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:55,339
I've got to make
a supernatural mouth

321
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:57,074
here on the back
of this carrier.

322
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:59,309
So I'm slapping on the wet clay
as fast as I can

323
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,677
and get the forms blocked out.

324
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:04,514
And it's kind of fishy-looking,
supernatural-looking.

325
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:07,284
Definitely not human-looking.

326
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:13,256
The horns are a very
integral part of my creature

327
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,325
because they set up
the whole silhouette.

328
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,660
And I need to make sure
that my design does

329
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:20,030
ultimately stay true
to the silhouette that I picked.

330
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:21,164
Yeah, that looks about right.

331
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,499
- Looks about right?
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:23,934
Okay, cool.

333
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:26,069
I also need to get
this cowl sculpted.

334
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:28,205
It needs to have
enough bulk on it

335
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:31,641
that I can attach these horns
and they would stay on.

336
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,977
That's going to look so epic.

337
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:39,149
- What's your concept?
- It's a goblin.

338
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:42,252
While I'm sculpting the cowl,
I'm trying to make sure

339
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:45,055
that the ears are
really long and pointed.

340
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:49,326
As I finish the sculpt, I bring
it over to the light station

341
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,028
that's been set up,
so we can check

342
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:52,429
the silhouette
of our character.

343
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:54,631
I'm feeling pretty confident

344
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:58,603
because it's the exact shapes
I'm seeing in my silhouette.

345
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:07,811
I want to make an insect
that not only is scary,

346
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,079
but also creeps me out.

347
00:15:09,113 --> 00:15:12,082
So the back has six inserts

348
00:15:12,116 --> 00:15:13,784
where these egg sacs
are going to be.

349
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:17,020
I am vacuforming spheres,

350
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:19,222
and I plan to get scorpions
and incorporating them

351
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:21,091
into the egg sacs,
making them look

352
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,160
like they're embedded
inside them.

353
00:15:27,031 --> 00:15:30,600
I need to finish the hands,
so I can vacuform them.

354
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:32,335
But I'm noticing that
they're a little bit too big.

355
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,172
- Cat?
- Yeah?

356
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:37,741
If I--
This I can vacuform.

357
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:41,344
You'd have to just
sculpt this separately.

358
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:44,581
Instead of fabricating
the hooves,

359
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,183
I just decided to sculpt them.

360
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:49,486
- This is a-done.
- It's looking good.

361
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,823
I have my face, chest, cowl,
and the two hands.

362
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:54,458
Molding time.

363
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:59,729
He's going to be making molds
the rest of the day.

364
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:15,912
Time is running out,
and I can't open my mold.

365
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:18,682
There is just
a lot wrong with it.

366
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:21,284
I'm in a sketchy place
right now.

367
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:26,456
I don't have anything
but a face at this point.

368
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,824
I'm questioning the fact

369
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:30,627
that I spent so much time

370
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:33,163
and effort making this cowl.

371
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:34,798
I'm really scared.

372
00:16:34,832 --> 00:16:36,333
Shit.

373
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:39,202
I can't do this.

374
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,101
Shit.

375
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,270
I can't do this.

376
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:50,405
It's day two
of our supernatural challenge.

377
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,142
Time is running out.
I can't even open my mold.

378
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,478
I'm really scared, and I know

379
00:16:56,512 --> 00:17:00,349
that the only way to save
my molding mistakes

380
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,913
is to walk away from it.

381
00:17:02,948 --> 00:17:06,384
In this situation
we have to think quick,

382
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:10,054
so plan B is to take a wig
to create the skull shape

383
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:12,156
that I'm looking for
while using

384
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,726
premade ear appliances to get
the silhouette that I need.

385
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,332
I only have a face.
I have a face and a wig.

386
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:25,736
And I'm sure that's going
to get me in trouble.

387
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,178
As I'm going forward with
making this whole cup-horn idea,

388
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:36,447
there's a lot of fabricating,

389
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,049
and I'm already so invested
in this process

390
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:42,820
that I can't change it
at this point.

391
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:46,290
I'm really starting to worry
that since they're so huge,

392
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,726
there's really no way
for me to know

393
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,195
if it's going to work
until the very end.

394
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:52,830
And that could go really bad.

395
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:56,634
I'd glue both sides down.
You'd be a-okay.

396
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,068
- We'll see.
- We'll--

397
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,909
I want to create arm extensions

398
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:10,625
that look like scorpion claws
or even praying mantis hands.

399
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,527
so I take L200,

400
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:14,062
which is a type of foam
that can be

401
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,731
cut, manipulated, heated,

402
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:18,900
bent so that it can make
really quick, fabricated pieces.

403
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,702
So I use it to fabricate
the hands,

404
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:21,970
and I paint them
the best I can.

405
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:24,473
- Almost-- There we go.
- It's working.

406
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:32,114
I'm running out of time
at the end of the day.

407
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:33,315
I need to get this arm molded

408
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,318
so that tomorrow
I can run it in poly foam.

409
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,354
I still have to mold the cowl,

410
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:42,357
so I'm trying to go
as fast as I can,

411
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:44,659
but I don't know if I'm going
to be able to finish this.

412
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:45,961
How many minutes time?

413
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:47,696
3:18.

414
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,698
Oh, my God. I hope
this shit opens tomorrow.

415
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,399
So Niko and I are running
around the mold room

416
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,136
like crazy people, just trying
to get these molds done,

417
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,838
and Tyler runs in there
and really helps me out.

418
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:59,941
We got it, we got it,
we got it, we got this.

419
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:02,744
We get it done, but Niko
still has to finish his cowl.

420
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,013
Put some here, put some here.

421
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,048
Okay. Done?

422
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,984
Yes, yes.

423
00:19:09,018 --> 00:19:11,286
- That's time, everybody.
- Look. We did it!

424
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,854
- Whoo!
- Nice, nice.

425
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,189
Thank you, thank you.

426
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:16,525
We finished it.

427
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,426
At the end of the day,
I feel pretty happy

428
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:19,661
that I have everything done.

429
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:22,230
I know I have a lot of work
to do tomorrow,

430
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:25,066
and I'm worried
that I can't make it all happen.

431
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:37,579
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you, man.

432
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:39,214
Whoo!

433
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,249
It's application day,
and we've got

434
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:45,053
four hours in the lab,
one more hour at last looks,

435
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,888
and I believe that's enough time

436
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:48,356
to make this thing
good and creepy.

437
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,808
- Corinne.
- Megan, nice to meet you.

438
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,243
You're like a goddess of pain.

439
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:09,945
Oh, my God.
You're scary.

440
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:13,048
My strategy today is to start
the application immediately

441
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:16,184
because there are so many
elements to this character.

442
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,477
The dental appliance,
the face, the cowl,

443
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:21,313
everything laying
over top of each other.

444
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,582
There is no room
for error today.

445
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:28,887
Your character
is very mischievous.

446
00:20:28,922 --> 00:20:31,757
Let me get around you.
Time is ticking down.

447
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,859
I've got to get the back piece
and the face piece on my model.

448
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:36,228
The back goes down perfect,
and I'm loving it.

449
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:38,364
Cool.

450
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:42,901
I open my mold,
and there's a huge seam.

451
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,403
It's going to take
a long time to fix.

452
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,872
My model has
no appliances on whatsoever,

453
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:49,341
and I just decide, look,
forget about these arms.

454
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:51,410
I need to worry
about just getting my model

455
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:52,611
applied and painted.

456
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:55,647
This is going to be
the end of me.

457
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,219
I finish applying the cowl
and face, and I realize

458
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:02,588
that his arms and his chest
are still just skin.

459
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:04,223
A little saran wrap to you.

460
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:06,325
So I start just gluing
this plastic wrap

461
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:09,661
all around my model to get
a sort of wrinkly texture.

462
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,196
- Pretty weird, huh?
- Yeah.

463
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:12,364
I've never done it before,

464
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:16,035
so I don't know
if it's going to work.

465
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:19,805
I look at him.
He's standing up.

466
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,841
And I'm like, "I'm doing, like,
a really big makeup."

467
00:21:22,876 --> 00:21:24,977
This is, like, one of the
biggest pieces that I have done

468
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,678
and super, super fast,

469
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:29,081
so I'm really impressed
with myself.

470
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:34,319
I'm feeling
a little bit nervous

471
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:37,790
because everyone else
has much bigger creatures,

472
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,291
so I have to have
a great paint job,

473
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:41,493
in order to make this
a great makeup,

474
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:44,396
versus a simple makeup.

475
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:48,200
All right, everyone,
that's 15 minutes.

476
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:00,680
_

477
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:01,970
_

478
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:03,449
I know it's missing the arms,

479
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:05,084
which is a very important part
of the makeup.

480
00:22:05,118 --> 00:22:06,218
At least everything's applied,

481
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:09,555
and he's got
his base coat of paint.

482
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:12,791
All right, everybody,
that's time!

483
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:16,161
I think I can pull the paint
together, but my model's

484
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:17,262
not going to match
the silhouette,

485
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:18,931
so I'm really worried.

486
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:21,533
The most important part
of my makeup isn't there.

487
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:24,436
Coming up...

488
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:26,538
These horns are
just too damn heavy.

489
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:27,606
Shit.

490
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,341
There's still
a lot of work needed

491
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,210
to pull my creature together.
It's not a good feeling.

492
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:32,945
I dig it a lot.
It's creepy-licious.

493
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,947
I'm at a loss of words
for this.

494
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:37,983
I didn't find it to be
particularly scary.

495
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:50,427
We have one of the shortest
hours in human history.

496
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:51,662
Turn around.

497
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:54,364
I just need to get
these huge horns to attach

498
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,767
that I don't know will work.

499
00:22:58,803 --> 00:23:00,070
Will you hold this for me?

500
00:23:00,104 --> 00:23:03,240
I need to add all of his
highlights and yellow accents.

501
00:23:03,274 --> 00:23:04,841
There's still
a lot of work needed

502
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,109
to pull my creature together.

503
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:08,178
It's not a good feeling.

504
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:11,848
Hold still, buddy.
Hold still.

505
00:23:11,883 --> 00:23:14,351
I'm trying to put the other
two side horns on that I made.

506
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:17,020
I sort of get one in.
I'm gluing the hell out of it.

507
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:18,055
Please stay still.

508
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:19,356
The horns are
just too damn heavy.

509
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,490
Shit.

510
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,492
It's just not working.
Damn it.

511
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,595
- 15 minutes left, everyone!
- Uh-oh.

512
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:35,472
All right, everyone.
That's time.

513
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,007
- Brushes down.
- Fuck!

514
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:40,310
I really screwed this one up.

515
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:55,525
Welcome
to the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

516
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,196
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

517
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,099
First, let's say hello
to our talented panel of judges.

518
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:05,369
Owner of Optic Nerve Make-Up
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

519
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,137
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

520
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:09,172
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

521
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:10,540
Hi, everybody.

522
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:11,708
- Hello.
- Hey.

523
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,244
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

524
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:16,079
- Hi, guys.
- Neville.

525
00:24:16,114 --> 00:24:19,483
And please welcome back
writer, producer, and director,

526
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:20,817
Oren Peli.

527
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:23,787
Hi, guys.
Good to see you again.

528
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:26,757
Looking forward to seeing
your creations.

529
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,759
All right, guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

530
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:30,427
was to select
an exaggerated silhouette

531
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:34,865
and create the supernatural
entity that cast the shadow.

532
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,199
Let's take a look
at your creations,

533
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:37,534
while the audience at home

534
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:40,537
tweets about their favorites
using #FaceOff.

535
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:03,093
I'm loving it.

536
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:05,629
It looks impressive
and-- and scary.

537
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:23,713
I love the fact the hair
is covering the face,

538
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:25,215
and the mouth
is coming out of the back.

539
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:28,718
It's very dark, and you don't
really know what it is.

540
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,838
I'm really excited.

541
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:50,073
This is a character
that I really love,

542
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:53,477
I had a lot of fun doing,
and he looks great.

543
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,727
I'm really worried.

544
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:13,930
He's probably the weakest makeup
this challenge.

545
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:17,934
I know I'm going to be
on bottom.

546
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:36,686
This guy looks really big
and really menacing.

547
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,923
I feel really proud of it.

548
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,742
She looks really creepy
and sneaky,

549
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,644
and I'm confident
with the paint job

550
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:02,679
and the success
of the actual makeup.

551
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:22,299
She's rocking it.

552
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,602
The shadow shape, the bug
quality to the whole character

553
00:27:25,636 --> 00:27:29,606
is really coming through,
and I'm feeling pretty good.

554
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:46,790
I'm loving my horns.

555
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:47,958
I think they're scary.

556
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:50,093
I just hope Oren
and the rest of the judges do

557
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,561
because there are a lot
of other makeups

558
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:55,565
that are more intimidating
than mine.

559
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:14,384
This thing looks so creepy.

560
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:17,387
If I'm not at top looks, I'm
at least safe with this makeup,

561
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:19,289
because if I think
it's this badass,

562
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:23,593
then the judges at least
have to think it's cool.

563
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:41,077
This silhouette looks great.

564
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:42,946
It looks very similar
to what I was given,

565
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,314
but it also has a little bit

566
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,651
of my own flair
and style to it.

567
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,135
I know
I'm up the old proverbial creek

568
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:06,569
without a paddle

569
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:09,139
because all the imperfections
are staring me in the face.

570
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:12,609
I can't even look at it.

571
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,515
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look

572
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,051
at our supernatural entities?

573
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,859
There's some really rad shapes
going on in the horns.

574
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,594
It's my favorite part
of this makeup.

575
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,431
It's really riffing off
of the shadow.

576
00:29:34,465 --> 00:29:37,033
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

577
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,238
Looks a little bit
like a diseased homeless guy.

578
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:44,507
Please turn, so we can see
your back, please.

579
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:48,511
Oh, yeah.
What is that thing?

580
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:51,481
We have to ask.
I don't understand it.

581
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,117
- Can you open your mouth?
- Yeah, let's see it.

582
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:56,319
Oh, yeah.
There we go.

583
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:58,321
I like the overall design,
but it feels a little bit

584
00:29:58,355 --> 00:30:00,623
- like a mask.
- It does.

585
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:05,562
I don't understand
the hard shapes.

586
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,263
Not very supernatural.

587
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:10,200
More like
an alien-insect type thing.

588
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:12,902
I'm worried. I see the judges
pointing out problems.

589
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,071
I know they're not happy
with it.

590
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:18,608
There's a good chance
that I could be sent home.

591
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:21,344
Who made your favorite
supernatural entity?

592
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:24,314
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

593
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,394
Turn your head sideways.
That's a cool silhouette.

594
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,997
That has nothing to do
with the silhouette in here.

595
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,099
I know I'm going to be
in the bottom.

596
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:35,500
I look at everybody else's,

597
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:40,205
and he's not
the strongest makeup.

598
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,407
Look at this brown iridescence
floating around in here.

599
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:43,675
It's really nice.

600
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,744
This guy looks
like he means business.

601
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:47,245
Like, if you see him
in a dark alley,

602
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,747
you're going to run
the other way.

603
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,615
Great.

604
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,186
Great paint job.

605
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,588
Very, very, very nice patterns.

606
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,890
Thanks.

607
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,060
I'm not sure what's going on,

608
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,261
- but it's cool.
- Yeah.

609
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:06,164
It's, like, half-human,
half-whatever.

610
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,768
This on purpose?

611
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:12,771
I think it ripped after he
put it on, so he colored it in.

612
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,272
I'm going to try playing
on the judges' mercy,

613
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,808
like, "Please, I'm--
I'm much better than this."

614
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:20,478
- It's not really scary.
- It's cute almost.

615
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,986
The judges have scored
your creations.

616
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,554
Let's find out
what they thought.

617
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,656
George,

618
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:33,491
Tyler,

619
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,460
Chloe,

620
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,796
Rashaad,

621
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,131
Matt...

622
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:43,968
Congratulations,
you are all safe.

623
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:45,136
You can head back
to the makeup room.

624
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:46,671
Thank you.

625
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,311
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

626
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,813
The judges will now speak
with each of you

627
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,282
to learn more about your work.

628
00:31:57,316 --> 00:32:00,118
Graham, please step up.

629
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:08,760
Graham, tell us how
you incorporated your shadow.

630
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:11,329
I tried to incorporate some
of the things that creep me out,

631
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:15,467
which are cockroaches, so I
threw in some creepy bug parts,

632
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:18,103
and this is what would really
end up scaring me now.

633
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:20,905
I love it.

634
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,275
I love the sculpture
of the face, particularly.

635
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,111
I dig it a lot.
It's creepy-licious.

636
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:27,512
Thank you.

637
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:28,847
You have a really great
transitional area

638
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,482
in the sternum.

639
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,816
It's done so well.

640
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:33,184
Thank you.

641
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:37,655
It definitely implies
something very off-putting,

642
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,790
so that's a gorgeous part
of this.

643
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,291
- Great work.
- Thank you.

644
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,160
Whatever this thing is,
I've never seen

645
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,962
anything like it before,
so it's very cool

646
00:32:43,996 --> 00:32:45,964
and creepy and original design.

647
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,799
Thank you very much.

648
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,801
- Graham, please step back.
- Awesome.

649
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:54,072
- Good job, dude.
- Daran.

650
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:00,245
Tell us about your concept

651
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,413
and how you incorporated
your silhouette.

652
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,250
I saw the shadow as a demon.

653
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,252
I wanted to keep my focus
on the back

654
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:08,987
as a mouth for the hump.

655
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,055
And this mouth
will swallow your soul.

656
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,225
Turn your character around.

657
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:19,597
That does not look
like a mouth at all.

658
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:21,199
I'm at a loss of words
for this, Daran.

659
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,568
It doesn't even look like
you finished painting it.

660
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,970
I don't think
this is a great makeup.

661
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,305
Sorry to disappoint.

662
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,475
I think that you have achieved
kind of a classic vision

663
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,877
of horror, but I--

664
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:36,014
I think you just went
way too abstract.

665
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:37,582
It's just
not very supernatural.

666
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,551
Looks very human.

667
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,788
- Daran, you can head back.
- Thanks, buddy.

668
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,093
Let's talk to Niko.

669
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:57,202
So tell us how you interpreted
your cast shadow.

670
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,003
Once I saw the shadow,

671
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,638
I saw a bull
because of the horns

672
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:01,773
and hooves,

673
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,575
but I wanted to make it
more human.

674
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,043
That's when I went
with a minotaur.

675
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:08,813
- This is really a beautiful piece.
- Thank you.

676
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,682
You didn't use
the actor's eyes.

677
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,351
I think that this is
one of the more successful

678
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,286
- ways of doing it.
- Thank you.

679
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,889
This is probably
the scariest one of the bunch.

680
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,757
It matches the shadow
really well.

681
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:21,659
It's menacing.
It's scary.

682
00:34:21,694 --> 00:34:23,895
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

683
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,330
Your work,
in terms of proportion,

684
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,965
is quite beautiful.

685
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:29,667
It's big enough to push
an already big model

686
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:33,271
into gigantic, but it's not
so big that it's clumsy.

687
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,840
- Well done.
- Thank you.

688
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:38,676
Niko, please step back.

689
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:39,944
Good job, baby.

690
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:42,547
Cat, please step forward.

691
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:47,919
Tell me about your concept.

692
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:49,587
How did you come up
with this particular design?

693
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:50,955
I hate bugs.

694
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,458
I think that's why I was drawn
to the silhouette.

695
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,860
It reminded me of a cross
between a beetle

696
00:34:55,895 --> 00:34:57,896
and a praying mantis.

697
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,267
For me, it looks like
he's wearing a mask.

698
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,168
So I didn't find it to be
particularly scary

699
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:05,570
or-- or supernatural.

700
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,705
Mm-hmm.

701
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,042
I abhor the decision to have
this hard surface on his face,

702
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,444
and I don't see the silhouette.

703
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:14,913
I don't think
it's a very good makeup.

704
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,348
- I've seen you do better.
- I agree.

705
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:19,417
I think
one of the main failures for me

706
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,586
is your paint job
is a little weak.

707
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,489
It's odd to see yellow splotches
on the face.

708
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,260
Cat, you can step down.

709
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,666
Tanner, you're up.

710
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,373
Tanner, tell us
about your character.

711
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,175
I wanted a very old demon.

712
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,777
As deer grow older and older,

713
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,612
their horns get
larger and larger--

714
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,815
his horns getting so big that
nothing's going to stop them

715
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,216
from growing.

716
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:55,386
You've got some serious issues.

717
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:57,155
I-- Yeah.

718
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:58,823
I noticed
that there's a gaping aperture

719
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:02,226
next to what appears to be
some sort of vacuum tubing.

720
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,562
It was going to be
another set of horns,

721
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:06,998
but I was running
into a lot of weight problems.

722
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,900
Not good.

723
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:11,169
Tanner, can you tell us
what you used on his body?

724
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,271
It looks to me like
you wrapped him in cellophane

725
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,539
and hoped for the best.

726
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:18,242
Yeah, that didn't
really work too well.

727
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,878
- Wow, I'm disappointed.
- Yeah, I am too.

728
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:22,180
The other bigger problem is

729
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:24,916
that he's just really far
from being camera-ready.

730
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,919
- Absolutely.
- Tanner, you can head back.

731
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:29,887
Thanks, man.

732
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,326
Corinne, please step up.

733
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,668
Tell us the story
behind this character.

734
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,371
When I was looking
at the movements,

735
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:48,039
I decided that it was a goblin

736
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,540
that creeps
in the middle of the night

737
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:52,310
and does nasty things
while people are sleeping.

738
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:54,045
Nobody knows what hit them.

739
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,815
She is definitely
a creepy, little thing.

740
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,450
That is
a magnificent paint job.

741
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,986
Her arms are amazing.

742
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:04,055
Thanks.

743
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,558
I think that this is
a beautiful, subtle makeup.

744
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:09,594
This character feels plausible.
It's beautiful work.

745
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,029
Thank you.

746
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,464
Seems like you've nailed
supernatural entity to me.

747
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:16,134
Crawling around the corner of a
bedroom when a kid is sleeping,

748
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:17,568
it would be scary as hell.

749
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:21,172
Massive success on that level
of this challenge, for sure.

750
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,974
Thank you.

751
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,410
Corinne, please step back.

752
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:31,149
All right, guys, the judges have
heard what you have to say.

753
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:32,884
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

754
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,153
while they deliberate.

755
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,858
All right, judges,
why don't we talk

756
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:43,161
about the looks you liked
the most this week?

757
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,295
Let's start with Graham.

758
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,830
I think he did a great job

759
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,533
at hitting the right notes
to tell the story

760
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,069
of a supernatural entity,
a shadow.

761
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,670
The chest was so cool.

762
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:55,840
That transition
from little finger things.

763
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,708
We've never seen anything
that looked like this before.

764
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,177
It's very cool and creepy.

765
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:00,511
All right,
let's move on to Niko.

766
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:05,950
That head was so
well-balanced, proportionally.

767
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:09,153
The sculpt of it was cool.
It was a riveting piece.

768
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:11,422
Out of all of them,
it's the one that evoked

769
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,424
the most genuine feeling
of fear.

770
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:15,526
Okay, let's move on to Corinne.

771
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:17,962
I thought this was
a really cool makeup.

772
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,363
I really enjoyed the paint job.

773
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,599
I especially liked
the treatment of the arms.

774
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:26,037
The particular challenge
aspect of trying to take

775
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,606
this shadow and create a makeup

776
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,208
of a creature
that could cast the shadow,

777
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:34,145
I think that she fulfilled that
the most accurately.

778
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:35,813
The quality,
the execution of it

779
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:38,616
- was really, really excellent.
- All right, judges.

780
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,451
Let's move on
to the bottom looks this week.

781
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:43,354
As you know,
you have the ability to give

782
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,856
special immunity this season.

783
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,624
- Yeah.
- Why don't we start with Daran?

784
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:50,628
For me, he did two things
that were a grave mistake.

785
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,431
The first one, an overly
simplistic idea from front view

786
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:56,367
and an overly complicated idea
from rear view.

787
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,603
Whatever was going on
in the back was just weird,

788
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,838
and I don't think
it worked on any level.

789
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:03,341
And the front looked human
with raggedy clothes.

790
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:05,510
He said that that back thing
was his focal point.

791
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,845
Well, if that's your focal
point, why isn't it finished?

792
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,680
All right,
let's move on to Cat.

793
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,682
The paint job,
I-I don't get it.

794
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,184
Looks like she just took
a brush,

795
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:16,287
and went bam, bam, bam,
and put polka dots on his face.

796
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:18,589
It looked like a guy
wearing an alien mask

797
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:21,792
- and not much else going on.
- She keeps saying it was a bug.

798
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,262
Doesn't look like a bug
to me at all.

799
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:25,596
Let's move on to Tanner.

800
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:28,199
This is one of the worst things
I've seen on this show.

801
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,534
Everything was falling off--

802
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:31,302
the chest piece,
one of the horns on the front.

803
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:34,772
The cellophane was unwrapping.
That was a bad choice.

804
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,440
He should've just
painted the skin.

805
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:38,876
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

806
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:40,144
Yeah.

807
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:43,114
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

808
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,387
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

809
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:54,192
Graham, we really liked
your cockroach-inspired makeup,

810
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,693
and we love
that you gave us something

811
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,862
that we've never seen before.

812
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,299
Niko, you handled
the facial sculpture

813
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:04,001
of your character
extremely well,

814
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:06,404
and the character was
very well-proportioned.

815
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:09,540
Corinne, we love
that you presented us

816
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,176
with a beautiful,
believable makeup,

817
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:15,313
and your shadow inspiration
was very clear.

818
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:17,481
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

819
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:20,318
The winner
of this challenge is--

820
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:26,929
- Who is the winner
of this challenge?

821
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:31,601
The winner
of this challenge is...

822
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:34,203
Niko.

823
00:40:34,238 --> 00:40:36,472
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

824
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:39,675
Your character
was scary, imposing,

825
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,477
and it matched up
with its shadow.

826
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:42,945
- Great job.
- Thank you.

827
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,314
I'm really happy.
I'm super stoked.

828
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:48,251
It's-- it's--
This is why I came here.

829
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:50,519
- Niko, congratulations.
- Thank you.

830
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:53,990
You and Corinne and Graham can
head back to the makeup room.

831
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:01,264
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

832
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:02,565
are on the bottom this week.

833
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:05,534
One of you will be eliminated.

834
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:07,637
Please step forward.

835
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:15,711
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

836
00:41:15,746 --> 00:41:19,582
Daran, it was obvious that
you tried to do way too much.

837
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,151
The paint, in particular,
was very rudimentary.

838
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:25,388
Cat, your makeup did not feel

839
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:26,989
like a supernatural entity
to us,

840
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:30,259
and we did not see the
relationship with your shadow.

841
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:33,029
Tanner, there were
significant issues

842
00:41:33,063 --> 00:41:34,697
with your overall character,

843
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:37,400
and it turned out
more cute than scary.

844
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:39,435
So who is going home tonight?

845
00:41:39,469 --> 00:41:42,338
The person going home
tonight is...

846
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:49,211
Tanner.

847
00:41:49,246 --> 00:41:52,114
Unfortunately, everything you
tried this week didn't work out.

848
00:41:52,149 --> 00:41:55,951
There were just too many
problems with this character.

849
00:41:55,986 --> 00:41:58,454
That means, Daran and Cat,
you are safe this week

850
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:01,190
and can head back
to the makeup room.

851
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:03,989
I'm sorry, brother.

852
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:11,534
Tanner, you've exhibited
some amazing raw potential.

853
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:13,869
Combined
with your great attitude,

854
00:42:13,904 --> 00:42:16,405
you'll go very far
in your career.

855
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,541
Thank you so much. It's been
an-- a wonderful experience.

856
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:19,975
Good luck, man.

857
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,879
Tanner, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

858
00:42:23,914 --> 00:42:25,514
It's been great
having you here with us.

859
00:42:25,549 --> 00:42:27,116
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

860
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,417
and pack up your kit.

861
00:42:28,452 --> 00:42:30,486
- Bye. Thank you.
- Good luck, Tanner.

862
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,121
Bye, Tanner.
Good luck, hon.

863
00:42:32,155 --> 00:42:33,489
I'm bummed.
I made errors.

864
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:35,324
That's the most
disappointing part.

865
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,892
I know
that I'm better than that.

866
00:42:38,195 --> 00:42:39,962
Oh, dude.

867
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,163
It's been crazy.

868
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:43,966
I've never worked so hard
and so fast.

869
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,036
I'm going to take away
a lot of great experiences.

870
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,238
And I'm proud of the makeups

871
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:51,941
and the things
that I've accomplished here.

872
00:42:51,975 --> 00:42:54,977
This experience has definitely
made me a better makeup artist,

873
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:57,297
so I'm going to keep going
buck wild with it.
