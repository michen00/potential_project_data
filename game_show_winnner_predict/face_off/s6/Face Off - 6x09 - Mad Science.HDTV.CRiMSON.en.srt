1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:01,730
The detail is impressive.

2
00:00:01,764 --> 00:00:02,965
There's real subtle sculpting.

3
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:05,471
Your paint job is beautiful.

4
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:07,703
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:09,638
The artists flew
halfway around the world

6
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:11,173
for inspiration.

7
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:13,342
Tokyo is absolutely amazing.

8
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:15,844
Daran's anime koi character
earned him his second victory...

9
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:16,878
Wow.

10
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:19,248
And Graham was spared
from elimination

11
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,283
by the judges'
one-time wild card immunity.

12
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:22,284
Wow.

13
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:23,285
Holy moly.

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,687
And tonight, the artists

15
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,522
are faced with
a maddening challenge.

16
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:30,826
This is going to take you
to a very dark place.

17
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,261
I'm so excited.

18
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:34,963
But with stakes this high,
some will break.

19
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,431
What's wrong?

20
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:37,899
- Fuck.
- Call the medic.

21
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,468
I feel this stab in my back.

22
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:40,469
I can't move.

23
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:42,070
I don't have a solid concept.

24
00:00:42,105 --> 00:00:45,707
I have to get on the ball
or I'm gonna go home.

25
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:47,175
It is a brilliant idea.

26
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,877
It feels alive.
Beautiful work.

27
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:50,312
It looks like she has
just something

28
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,281
stuck on her face.

29
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:54,383
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

30
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:55,917
from Kryolan Professional
Make-Up

31
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:58,787
to one of their 85
international locations,

32
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:02,024
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

33
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,992
and $100,000.

34
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:06,895
Who'll be the next great name
in movie magic?

35
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,067
<i>Face Off!</i>

36
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:14,469

38
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,394
The judges gave
this special immunity to me.

39
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,997
I did not expect that.

40
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:07,033
It's a cool feeling that
they're just keeping me around.

41
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:09,336
- What's up, buddy?
- What up, y'all?

42
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,837
Good morning,
Mr. Graham.

43
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,672
The immunity card is gone.

44
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:13,807
You're here, buddy.

45
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,141
- I know.
- That's awesome.

46
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,343
They used it
on the right person,

47
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,744
and that's all that matters.

48
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:20,146
The pressure's on me,
'cause they were like,

49
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,449
"Make sure
we didn't waste this."

50
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:24,551
So I got to make sure
that the next thing I make

51
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:27,020
is awesome-looking, you know,
well-constructed,

52
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:28,221
and fits the challenge.

53
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:29,923
I can't be on bottom again.

54
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:30,924
No way.

55
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:31,958
Let's go to work.

56
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:33,260
Let's go to work.

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,700
Uh-oh.

58
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:41,968
We walk through the door...

59
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:42,969
Ooh.

60
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:44,170
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, boy.

61
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,539
And the entire lab
has been changed

62
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:49,009
into this torture chamber.

63
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,944
What the hell?

64
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,779
This is creepy.

65
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:53,847
I'm so excited.

66
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,482
Wow.

67
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:56,483
Yes.

68
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:57,584
There are vials

69
00:02:57,618 --> 00:02:59,252
with these different creatures
in them,

70
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,554
medical instruments
I've never seen before,

71
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:02,555
never even heard of.

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,923
- Oh.
- Ah, man.

73
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,492
- So cool.
- Yeah.

74
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:08,028
It's just insane.

75
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,264
Hey, guys,
how do you like the new lab?

76
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:12,432
Awesome.

77
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:15,101
Somehow I had
a feeling you'd like it.

78
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,903
In Hollywood,
makeup effects artists

79
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:18,438
are often asked
to create something

80
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:22,142
truly horrific or vile.

81
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,611
That leads us
to our next challenge,

82
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:29,582
which will take you
to a very dark place.

83
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:30,884
We're gonna do something dark.

84
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,319
We're gonna
do something haunting.

85
00:03:32,353 --> 00:03:33,687
We're gonna do something real.

86
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,822
And I cannot wait.

87
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:39,159
<i>Silence Of The Lambs,</i>
<i>The Island Of Dr. Moreau,</i>

88
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:41,995
and<i> American Horror Story</i>
all feature scientists

89
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:44,597
who've gone mad and used
their scientific knowledge

90
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:47,634
to wreak havoc
on innocent victims.

91
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,269
And these demented doctors
won't stop

92
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:53,206
until they have satisfied
their bloodlust.

93
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,576
So in this spotlight challenge,

94
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,547
you are going to play
the role of mad scientist.

95
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,681
Whoa.
Oh, my God.

96
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:03,216
That's so cool.

97
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,851
And you're gonna create
a victim,

98
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:07,387
or perhaps more precisely,

99
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,856
a human guinea pig
that falls prey to your madness.

100
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,224
- Wow.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:15,729
I finally get to do something
organic and grotesque,

102
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,364
and I am so excited.

103
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:20,166
Of course, a mad scientist
is only as good

104
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:23,169
as his twisted tools,
so when I call your name,

105
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:25,638
I want you to select
one of these medical devices

106
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:29,209
to help inspire your victim.

107
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,378
Graham, you're up first.

108
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:34,681
I'm looking through
these bizarre medical devices

109
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:37,016
thinking, let's do something
I haven't done before,

110
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,052
something with electricity
running through it.

111
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,688
Electroshock machine.

112
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:43,022
Some cool stuff up there.

113
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:45,258
Antique amputation saw.

114
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:46,726
Leeches.

115
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,194
Embalming pump.

116
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,563
Rib cage opener.

117
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:52,332
Pneumatic bone auger.

118
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:54,000
Antique hand drill.

119
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:56,436
Trephine.

120
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,338
All right, I can already
see that evil look

121
00:04:58,372 --> 00:04:59,472
in some of your eyes.

122
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:02,008
Go ahead and pick your models

123
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,676
and get started
on your designs.

124
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:04,944
I'll be back later on
with my dad

125
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,379
to check in
and see how you're doing.

126
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:07,380
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

127
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:08,381
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

128
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,216
Bye.

129
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,090
We choose our models
and start our designs.

130
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:20,226
My tool is
the antique amputation saw,

131
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,795
and I already see
the concept in my head,

132
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:25,799
because for the longest time
I have wanted to do, like,

133
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,935
a classic Frankenstein-inspired
makeup

134
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:33,573
that looks like it stepped out
of a black-and-white movie.

135
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:34,741
Does it get any more
perfect than this?

136
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:36,776
I don't think so.

137
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,681
My tool is
the electroshock machine,

138
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:43,616
and my concept is

139
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,552
an electronically reanimated
corpse.

140
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,254
There's all this light wire
and cool LED lights

141
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:49,789
that we have in the lab

142
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:51,758
that I haven't even played
with yet,

143
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,661
so I'm going to do
a really clean, cool makeup

144
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:57,230
and get these lights
going in there.

145
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,399
The trephine is used
for creating

146
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:02,068
circular incisions
in the skull.

147
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,671
What am I gonna do with that?

148
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:06,139
I'm a little stumped
on this one.

149
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,408
I'm not a huge fan of horror.

150
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,443
I'm more of
a sci-fi creature guy.

151
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:12,679
Everyone else is getting
their characters

152
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,180
sketched out, ready to go.

153
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,449
I'm just drawing a blank.

154
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,186
My victim has a conjoined twin.

155
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:22,455
The sculpture is gonna
have some pulling to it

156
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,324
that's gonna fade into the back

157
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:26,726
where the other head
is gonna start.

158
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,129
And the embalming pump
is going to preserve the tissue,

159
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:35,134
so as a mad scientist,
I can further operate on them.

160
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,505
The first thing I need to do
is sculpt out the face.

161
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,407
There's a twisting motion
to my character,

162
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,410
so I start working the clay
to give the illusion

163
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:48,248
that something is pulling
the face from the back.

164
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:53,186
I chose the antique hand drill.

165
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:55,728
_

166
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,051
_

167
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,895
_

168
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,094
I get this sick idea.

169
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:04,264
This pregnant woman got
kidnapped by this mad scientist,

170
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,466
and the mad scientist
wants to steal the baby

171
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,101
that she has inside of her.

172
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,837
That is sick.

173
00:07:16,377 --> 00:07:19,112
I'm actually sculpting
three faces,

174
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:22,081
and I'm going to use
the pneumatic bone auger

175
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:23,716
to split them down the middle.

176
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,718
I've been waiting
for a realism challenge,

177
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:29,989
and I'm super excited
about this one.

178
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,191
I select the leeches.

179
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:33,660
I think they're really gross.

180
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:36,696
So I decided to put the leeches
in, like, different,

181
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,865
uncomfortable places
on the body.

182
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:42,835
I start thinking about
small silicon pieces

183
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,804
that I can
attach the leeches to.

184
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:47,907
An eye piece,
a really simple nose piece.

185
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,409
They're all separate elements,

186
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:52,745
and I'm going to be molding
them all at the same time.

187
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:57,517
That is vile.
Is that an ear?

188
00:07:57,551 --> 00:07:58,685
Does it not look like an ear?

189
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,587
No, it does.

190
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,590
I have the rib cage opener.

191
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,858
So my concept
is this mad scientist

192
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:09,062
opens his victims up
and stretches the skin.

193
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:10,763
I got to create
a couple prosthetics,

194
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:13,933
and then each one has to be
hooked and stretched.

195
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:17,403
And both parts will be
connected with hooks and thread.

196
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:19,806
It's a lot of work to do,
so we'll see.

197
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:25,745
I'm making
some out-of-mouth teeth

198
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,747
that are supposed to attach
to the lips.

199
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:31,818
To do that, I need to create
a snap of her life cast,

200
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:35,421
and a snap is a small impression
of a singled-out area.

201
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:39,192
Once this sets up, I can
sculpt the teeth that I want.

202
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:41,561
I sculpt the teeth
on top of that little snap,

203
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:44,764
and it's looking pretty creepy.

204
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,701
_

205
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:49,769
What are you doing?

206
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:51,671
Come on, are you really?

207
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,273
It turns out Tyler and I
have similar concepts,

208
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,808
but I'm not gonna
change my designs

209
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,810
'cause this is something
I always wanted to do.

210
00:08:57,812 --> 00:08:59,479
Hopefully,
Tyler's two-head thing

211
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:00,913
doesn't turn out
to look like mine.

212
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:02,649
Tyler's copying.

213
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:03,783
Oh, yeah.

214
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,451
I'm not copying anything.

215
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:06,653
Mine's completely different.

216
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:08,287
He's doing
a man and a woman face,

217
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:10,657
and I'm doing a parasitic twin.

218
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:13,459
It's nowhere--
nowhere near the same.

219
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:20,600
This is definitely
not a good position to be in.

220
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:23,803
I don't even
have a solid concept.

221
00:09:23,837 --> 00:09:26,506
Every other challenge,
I've gotten concepts fast.

222
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,408
I've got them sketched out,
ready to go.

223
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,110
And this one is a struggle.

224
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:32,311
I'm here for a reason.

225
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:33,746
I'm here to show what I have.

226
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,581
There's still
so much I want to do.

227
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,817
But everybody else is sculpting
and I have nothing,

228
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,320
so I have to get on the ball
or I'm gonna go home.

229
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,056
Coming up...

230
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,059
I feel this stab in my back.

231
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,393
Let's call the medic.

232
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:50,063
I'm worried
my concept's too disturbing.

233
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,964
I think it's one
of your finest makeups.

234
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,833
It's really quite ingenious.

235
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,435
This is less than riveting.

236
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,803
It's the first day
of the mad scientist challenge,

237
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:11,207
and we have to take inspiration
from a medical instrument.

238
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:13,909
I picked the trephine
because it looks cool,

239
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:15,945
but all I have on my sketch pad

240
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,180
is a face
with some holes in the head.

241
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:21,517
Everybody else is sculpting,
and I'm just drawing a blank.

242
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,352
Let's get some clay,
start playing.

243
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,221
I decided
to just grab some clay

244
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:27,089
and start putting it
on the face,

245
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:29,425
hoping I get an idea.

246
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:36,932
As I'm sculpting the leeches,

247
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:41,203
I realize that everything
I know leeches to be used for

248
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:43,039
is actually a good thing.

249
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:46,409
So coming up with something
that could be evil or twisted

250
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:48,811
is much more difficult
than I thought.

251
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,886
I finally think of a concept.

252
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Thank God.

253
00:10:57,954 --> 00:10:59,555
The back story
that I come up with

254
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:01,357
while I'm sculpting
the face--

255
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:04,226
there's this plastic surgeon,
and he went mad.

256
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,694
So he takes females

257
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,396
and instead of making them
prettier,

258
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:09,231
he makes them grotesque.

259
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:11,467
I think it's a great idea.

260
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:20,743
Hey, guys,
here for the walk-through.

261
00:11:20,777 --> 00:11:22,078
How are you?

262
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,313
I got
the antique amputation saw,

263
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:27,149
so what I'm doing is
a Frankenstein-inspired makeup.

264
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:28,150
So I'll--

265
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:29,418
Is this an ear right here?

266
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,419
Yeah.

267
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:31,487
Oh, I see it.
So you--

268
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:32,721
- Wow.
- Okay.

269
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:34,390
As long as you're moving
these body parts around,

270
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:35,624
you're gonna have
to be very careful.

271
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:38,094
These pieces are really
gonna have to look real.

272
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:40,329
Many years ago, I had
to sculpt up a pair of ears

273
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:41,363
for a special project.

274
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:43,899
Took me one day
just to do the ears.

275
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,502
You have to really capture
an ear

276
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:49,171
for that to read like an ear.

277
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,107
I chose leeches.

278
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:53,476
Placement of the leeches
is important.

279
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,446
Maybe there's a half a leech
burrowing into the skin

280
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,215
as opposed to just
gluing them onto the skin.

281
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,216
Right.

282
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,283
You want to make it as gross

283
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:02,585
as you possibly can too,
I think.

284
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:03,719
Right.

285
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:04,954
The purpose of my bone saw

286
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:06,856
is to split this thing in half,

287
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,726
and I'm gonna put
three faces on my model.

288
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,827
I'm gonna do male, female,

289
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,863
and then
some weird deformed thing,

290
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:15,898
like, down here
under the neck or chin.

291
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,500
You think I'm making a mistake
going with

292
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:18,567
a third face down below or--

293
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,169
It may get too confusing,

294
00:12:20,203 --> 00:12:22,404
because when I see it,
right away,

295
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,540
there is something else
going on here...

296
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:25,908
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,309
And you're actually
putting a fourth down there.

298
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:29,578
You want to concentrate on this,
really getting that perfect.

299
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:30,813
All right, thank you.

300
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,581
I picked the trephine.

301
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:35,351
It's used for making
circular cuts in the skull.

302
00:12:35,385 --> 00:12:38,854
My scientist finds women
who want plastic surgery.

303
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,723
And he's gonna use that thing

304
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:41,991
to drill holes in their head

305
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:44,627
and apply skin to their face
from other victims.

306
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:46,162
Whatever flesh tone
you pick out

307
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,364
as your medium one,
have lighter patches.

308
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:50,199
And the patch--
it's a little darker,

309
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,967
so it really looks like
a patchwork.

310
00:12:52,002 --> 00:12:53,002
Oh, yeah.

311
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:54,470
All right, guys.

312
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:55,571
It's looking pretty creepy.

313
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:56,572
Good luck to everybody.

314
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:58,607
Thank you.

315
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,282
I've got the face finished,

316
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:09,451
and I want to mold it
as fast as I can.

317
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:10,886
Once the face is molded,

318
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:13,255
I can move on to figuring out
the appliances

319
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,890
that'll hold each one
of the electrodes

320
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,826
that are going into her legs
and into her arms.

321
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,197
This makeup has to be perfect
because the judges saved me

322
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:23,365
and I just don't want
to be on the bottom again.

323
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:31,273
At the end of day one,

324
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:34,443
I feel like I've really
gotten the face sculpt

325
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:35,945
to a good place.

326
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,347
I notice that a lot of people
are already molding,

327
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:40,349
but I'm trying to stay calm
and remember

328
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,851
this is a piece that
I want to be well-sculpted,

329
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:45,154
and it is important
to take the time.

330
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,525
- Time?
- Seven.

331
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,195
I'm gonna clean that mold in,
like, five minutes.

332
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,763
I don't know if this face
is gonna be done

333
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:56,031
by the end of the day

334
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:58,067
because I still have
to open it and clean it.

335
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:01,904
I'm trying to go
as fast as I can.

336
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:05,474
Time is running out,
but I want to go for it.

337
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:09,211
I only have one minute left
to clean the mold.

338
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:20,055
It's time, guys.

339
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,290
Nice job.

340
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,424
Thank you, Rashaad.

341
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:23,726
- Any time, bro.
- Thank you.

342
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,694
By the time I close it,
time is up

343
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,696
and my mold is ready.

344
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,697
I got it.

345
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,099
You got it?

346
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:33,802
I probably need to stop
doing molds at last minute.

347
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,953
So it's day two
of our mad scientist challenge.

348
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:52,755
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

349
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,456
We have a face.

350
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:56,659
Look at how twisted
and demented this looks.

351
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:58,560
I asked Mr. Westmore
about the third face,

352
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,629
and he told me it might
get too busy,

353
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,097
so we came together
on the decision

354
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,466
that I should not be putting
a third face on this.

355
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:07,636
Can not even tell that
there's a person down there.

356
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:10,239
Cool.
That's what I'm going for.

357
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,975
I get my face piece,
and it looks gorgeous.

358
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,810
And I line it up with the cowl,

359
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:17,646
and there is the whole concept
I had in my head.

360
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:20,282
I can see the flow,
and I am just so stoked.

361
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:21,517
I think you got a winner there.

362
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:22,518
Isn't it neat?

363
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:24,720
I'm sculpting a simple cowl.

364
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:26,221
It's not gonna go
full down the neck.

365
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,723
It's just a cap

366
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:30,693
because I needed to show
incisions into the head

367
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:32,795
and I can't do that
with a regular bald cap.

368
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:35,497
And so I want it
to be thick enough to do that

369
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:38,300
but also thin enough
to look like a bald head.

370
00:15:44,274 --> 00:15:47,409
I have two box molds that
I need to pour gelatin into

371
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,844
to create the leeches,

372
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:50,646
but I'm nervous
because everyone else

373
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,215
has a much bigger
and broader design.

374
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:55,584
I'm really worried
I'm not doing enough.

375
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:01,557
Okay, I'm making
a spine in the back

376
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,092
that's gonna be ripped open.

377
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:04,960
Tool goes like this
and then rips open

378
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,595
the chest and the back.

379
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,832
I'm gonna mold these
and run them in foam latex.

380
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,734
I want to wait
until I have everything here.

381
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,969
And when I have
all the molds ready,

382
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:16,972
then I'll open them
all at once.

383
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:21,009
My mad scientist
is bringing back dead bodies

384
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:23,278
through
the electroshock machine.

385
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:25,814
This stuff is called El wire.

386
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,217
I want this wire
to sort of connect everything

387
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,119
like she's sort of
being powered by it.

388
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:32,421
I'm trying to do some R&D
to figure out

389
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:35,491
how to get them to work right,
which--

390
00:16:35,525 --> 00:16:37,893
I've shocked myself
a couple times.

391
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:51,907
You got you a pregnant girl?

392
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:52,908
Yep.

393
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,243
My character is pregnant,

394
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:56,979
and I'm trying to make it
really natural-looking.

395
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:59,515
So I do a test
using the hand drill.

396
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:05,120
And then I'm gonna
slice it open

397
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:08,190
like if the baby got out
of the belly.

398
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:09,725
I can't really open the--
I don't know.

399
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,859
There you go.

400
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,461
What, you never pulled
a baby out before?

401
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:14,696
Come on.

402
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,675
I'm holding the chest piece

403
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,911
and I'm washing the plaster
out of a bucket.

404
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,047
Ooh, you all right?

405
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:33,048
Oh.

406
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:34,049
What's wrong?

407
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,286
Fuck.

408
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,988
And all of a sudden,
I feel this stab in my back.

409
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,824
Let's call the medic over here.

410
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:44,426
I'm familiar with that pain,
and I know exactly what it is.

411
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:45,828
I have two herniated discs.

412
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,931
I can't move.

413
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:51,475
I mean, it's like
I'm totally freezed.

414
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,476
- Is it right in here?
- Yes. Yeah.

415
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,477
I'm actually worried

416
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:54,812
that this is gonna escalate.

417
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:58,682
So if that happens,
I'm out of the competition.

418
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:06,736
It's day two
of the mad scientist challenge,

419
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,205
and I have
this huge pain in my back.

420
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:11,841
I have two herniated discs,

421
00:18:11,876 --> 00:18:14,377
and I'm actually worried
that this is gonna escalate.

422
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,746
So if that happens,
I'm out of the competition.

423
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,887
I start sewing into the foam

424
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,222
because it's supposed to look
like patchwork.

425
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:27,924
Started sewing mine,
but that's gonna take

426
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:28,925
too long to do all that.

427
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,926
Yes.

428
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,461
I have to cut down

429
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,496
on the amount of sew work
I'm gonna have to do.

430
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:35,365
You can't paint those on
with a little bitty brush?

431
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,400
That would go faster,
but it won't look as good.

432
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:38,668
I'd save that for last looks.

433
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,736
Yeah, I think I might.

434
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,704
Make sure you do
everything else.

435
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,806
- Is it right in here?
- Yes. Yeah.

436
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,341
The medic helps me
with a ice pack.

437
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:48,778
It still hurts.

438
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:49,779
Got it?

439
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:50,780
Yeah.

440
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:51,848
But I still have to do a lot.

441
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,016
So I have to just get up

442
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,217
and keep working.

443
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:56,319
I'm hoping that I can finish
what I started.

444
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,097
I find myself
with one hour left,

445
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:10,700
and I still need to sculpt
a blender piece over the knee

446
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,036
so it looks like
he's missing a leg.

447
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,037
I'm just gonna do it.

448
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,939
- Time?
- 28 minutes.

449
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:18,374
I have to get this thing
molded by the end of today.

450
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,716
One minute.

451
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,717
That's time, people.

452
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,918
Time.

453
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:30,486
Brushes down.

454
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:31,788
I get it molded.

455
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:34,791
I need to clean it out
first thing in the morning

456
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,759
and run it in poly foam.

457
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,494
So I have a lot to do tomorrow.

458
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:42,398
Hopefully I can focus
and just do art.

459
00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:53,409
It's application day,

460
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:55,244
and we got four hours
in the lab

461
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,146
and one hour in last looks.

462
00:19:57,181 --> 00:20:00,016
My back hurts like crazy,
and, like, I'm limping,

463
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:03,252
but I don't have time for pain.

464
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,588
Let's keep going.

465
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:11,961
Let's get to
the important stuff, like you.

466
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:15,131
The first thing I do
is open up and clean out

467
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:16,899
my leg stump prosthetic.

468
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:20,203
My only issue now is that
I have an immense amount

469
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:21,971
of painting that I have to do.

470
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:24,574
I just hope
there's time to do it.

471
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:28,878
♪ ah ♪

472
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,413
Where's my baby?
Wahh!

473
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:34,484
Good to meet you.
I'm Daran.

474
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:35,485
- How are you?
- I'm good.

475
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:37,408
- How are-- Ooh, a baby.
- Yeah.

476
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:39,509
You¡re being tortured...

477
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:41,724
I'm ready to just get
through application today,

478
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,027
and I immediately take
the time to make sure

479
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:45,862
that these edges are well done.

480
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:48,998
You can't do
a minimalistic makeup

481
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,667
and have edges everywhere.

482
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:56,739
All right, sir,
are you ready for this?

483
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:59,342
My cowl is attached to a shirt,

484
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:00,777
so there's no rippage involved.

485
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:02,311
Right turn.

486
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:05,181
It's just great to see something
that just popped in your head

487
00:21:05,215 --> 00:21:07,283
starting to come to life
before your eyes.

488
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,685
Yep, it wor--

489
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,686
It works.

490
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,588
All right, good.

491
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:14,891
I start applying
the belly piece.

492
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,426
It fits her really well,

493
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,896
but I'm nervous about my concept
being too disturbing

494
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,497
for the judges.

495
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,032
I love babies, so...

496
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:25,334
The last thing that I want to do
is offend anyone.

497
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,375
All right, let's position this.

498
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:34,210
I'm applying the chest piece.

499
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,344
It's taking me forever

500
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,013
'cause my back
is slowing me down, man.

501
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,581
Let's turn you this way.

502
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:41,584
I hope I have enough time
to get this paint job done.

503
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:43,386
We'll see how it goes.

504
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:47,924
It's all about
the paint job on this challenge.

505
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,893
I go with a dark blood color,
which is an under-color,

506
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:52,395
and I think
I'm gonna end up using

507
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:53,429
about eight to ten colors

508
00:21:53,464 --> 00:21:55,231
to get this paint job
just right.

509
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:56,532
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

510
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:57,667
At this point in the game,

511
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,968
I'm just worried
that the judges

512
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,037
are gonna call us out
on application.

513
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,672
Let me get them edges
laid down.

514
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:04,874
I also need to get hair
on this thing perfectly,

515
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,109
or it just won't come together.

516
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:07,910
All right, you feeling
pretty stuck in there?

517
00:22:07,945 --> 00:22:10,713
Oh, yeah.

518
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:12,615
Would you hold this for me?

519
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:13,816
Thank you.

520
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:16,419
Before I put the face on,
I angle the lights

521
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:17,587
right next to her mouth,

522
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:18,721
but I need to make sure

523
00:22:18,756 --> 00:22:20,156
that they're not touching
her skin,

524
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,357
because if they get too hot,

525
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,359
that can start
to cause discomfort.

526
00:22:23,393 --> 00:22:24,927
Your face.

527
00:22:24,962 --> 00:22:27,463
There is the chance that
the lights won't even work.

528
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:29,766
That electricity
needs to show through.

529
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,368
That's the only nervous part.

530
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,342
Oh, poop.

531
00:22:39,376 --> 00:22:43,212
Physically and mentally,
I'm feeling a little numb.

532
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:45,114
I'm at a hard place
at this point.

533
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:48,151
I know I didn't do enough,
but all I can do

534
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,986
is push forward
with what I have.

535
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:55,458
I just start painting
on a grey scale

536
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:58,594
by paxing a light grey
over everything.

537
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,563
I want this to be
the cleanest makeup

538
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,832
that I've done
this whole competition.

539
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:05,835
So if I don't have the time
to do the leg piece,

540
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:08,638
I hope that they at least
see the time

541
00:23:08,672 --> 00:23:10,773
that was put into
the face sculpt.

542
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:13,409
Whether or not
they will appreciate that

543
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:16,345
is really up in the air
at this point.

544
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,713
How much time, five minutes?

545
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:18,848
Like, seven.

546
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,594
I'm running out of time,
and right now,

547
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:32,829
it's not looking impressive.

548
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:35,398
I still have to do
a lot of paint job,

549
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:38,301
the whole back,
the whole front.

550
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,769
All right,
everybody, that's time.

551
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:43,673
Brushes down.

552
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:46,509
I got to stay here
for my family,

553
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:48,578
my baby girl that's coming.

554
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:51,113
If I win this money,
it's for her,

555
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:52,515
so I'll do my best.

556
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:57,086
Coming up...

557
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,088
Let's finish this, man.
Let's finish this.

558
00:23:59,122 --> 00:24:00,790
It's not looking like
I really envisioned it.

559
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:02,758
- I'm really nervous.
- Brilliant idea.

560
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:04,861
It looks like she has
something stuck on her face.

561
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,062
Beautiful work.

562
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:15,912
Zip-a-dee-doo-da.

563
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:16,913
We get to last looks.

564
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:17,914
We got one hour,

565
00:24:17,949 --> 00:24:19,616
and it's gonna be so intense

566
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,585
because I have a lot to paint.

567
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:22,586
Let's finish this, man.

568
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,854
Let's finish this up.

569
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:24,955
My back is hurting,

570
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:26,757
but I'm not paying attention
to that.

571
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,593
I'm just doing the job
that I have to do.

572
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:31,995
I really need to focus on
getting the eyebrows on

573
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:34,030
and making them look
really sweaty,

574
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:36,433
really tying the wardrobe
and everything together.

575
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:37,434
_

576
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,802
- Yep.
- Nice.

577
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:43,039
I have to hand stitch

578
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:44,674
all of these stitches
in last looks.

579
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:47,310
I had budgeted ten minutes
to do that,

580
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:50,647
and now I'm realizing that
it's gonna take a lot longer.

581
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:53,083
So I've decided
to just sew half of it.

582
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,452
- Fuck.
- How should I walk?

583
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:57,754
Like each movement is
electrocuting you a little bit.

584
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:58,755
Yeah.

585
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,375
- You okay with it?
- Yeah.

586
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,370
That's it, everybody.

587
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:15,939
Time's up.
Brushes down.

588
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,275
I'm really nervous.

589
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,110
It's not looking
like I really envisioned it.

590
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,378
I don't know where I'll stand.

591
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:23,380
We'll see.

592
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:36,726
Welcome to
the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

593
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:39,229
Tonight,
one of you will be eliminated.

594
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:41,531
Let's say hello
to our talented judges.

595
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:44,734
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

596
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:45,735
Good evening.

597
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,970
- Hey.
- Hi, Glenn.

598
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,339
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

599
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:50,640
Hi, everybody.

600
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:51,808
- Hello, Ve.
- Hi, Ve.

601
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,977
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

602
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:56,012
- Hello, guys.
- Hi, Neville.

603
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:58,114
This week,
your spotlight challenge

604
00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:00,817
was to play the role
of mad scientist

605
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:02,352
and create a human guinea pig

606
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:05,589
who has fallen prey
to your madness.

607
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:08,725
I also asked each of you
to choose a medical device

608
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,527
to inspire your creations.

609
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:12,796
So let's take a look
at your victims.

610
00:26:36,587 --> 00:26:37,787
I'm still a little bit nervous

611
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:39,055
that she's offensive.

612
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,590
I hope the judges
understand it.

613
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,827
I hope at least I can be safe.

614
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:03,847
I absolutely executed
my vision on this one.

615
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:05,649
This is exactly
what I wanted to do.

616
00:27:05,683 --> 00:27:09,519
I'm loving this makeup.

617
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,172
I'm thrilled.

618
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:33,243
He looks like he belongs
in that era.

619
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,600
It really looks
pretty disturbing,

620
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,402
and I'm just really happy
with the character.

621
00:27:59,437 --> 00:28:02,839
I love it.
I love it.

622
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:23,927
I'm so happy
I got this second chance.

623
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,428
You can still see
all the lights

624
00:28:25,463 --> 00:28:27,530
through the bright light
that they shine on her,

625
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:32,335
and it looks fantastic.

626
00:28:51,122 --> 00:28:53,890
Everything I wanted
to bring across, you can see.

627
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:55,825
She's bloody, amazing.

628
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,995
I'm excited.

629
00:29:17,782 --> 00:29:20,016
As I'm looking at
everybody's and seeing mine,

630
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,218
I know I didn't
quite push the envelope

631
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:25,688
enough on this one.

632
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,609
My character walks out,
and I'm really liking it.

633
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:49,846
I mean, it's impactful,
and that chest looks gnarly.

634
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,881
And he looks dead
and looks abused.

635
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,356
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

636
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:03,159
at these poor souls?

637
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,734
I think he did
a pretty great job painting it.

638
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,770
I don't understand what
it has to do with the drill.

639
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:17,407
Yeah, and this is
really poor taste, I gotta say.

640
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:24,114
Let's have you open
your mouth as wide as you can.

641
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:25,648
That's so wild.

642
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:28,284
So important having
that little additional detail

643
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,285
at the sutures.

644
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,286
Mm-hmm.

645
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:33,123
Just elevates it so much.
Thanks.

646
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:37,327
Where are the stitches?

647
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,328
Got them started.

648
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:39,329
Yeah.

649
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:40,964
Really looks cool.

650
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:42,432
Let's see your hand.

651
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,367
- Wow.
- Okay, good enough.

652
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:47,003
Open your mouth all the way.

653
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:50,707
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

654
00:30:53,444 --> 00:30:55,278
What's interesting is,
both profiles work.

655
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,813
When you look
at this side of this head,

656
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:57,814
it still looks like a head.

657
00:30:57,848 --> 00:30:59,549
Come around.

658
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:00,984
- Stop there.
- Yeah.

659
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:02,352
I mean, that just looks like
he's turning this way.

660
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:03,353
Yeah.

661
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:05,922
Come back around please.

662
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:07,390
The paint job
on this is really nice.

663
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:09,425
- I agree.
- Thank you.

664
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:13,563
Go ahead and open your mouth.

665
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:14,864
Oh.
Oh, all right.

666
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,700
It looked better than
you thought it was going to.

667
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:21,037
This is a lot better
up close than from afar.

668
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:22,305
Yeah, it is.

669
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,374
Most of these light gags
don't really work

670
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:25,975
when they come out
on stage in full light.

671
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:26,976
This one does.

672
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,012
- It tells a story.
- Thank you.

673
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,350
Do you think
this is a skin transplant?

674
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:37,287
The jaw just doesn't
make sense there.

675
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:40,557
Turn.

676
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:43,126
He did some nice hair laying,
finally.

677
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,094
Back around, please.

678
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,963
Thanks.

679
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:49,899
- Okay.
- Ew.

680
00:31:49,934 --> 00:31:52,569
I am confused.

681
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,237
Is there a whole nose tip
on here?

682
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:55,872
Yeah, I can see-- yeah.

683
00:31:55,906 --> 00:31:58,508
So we've changed
the profile of the nose.

684
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,176
- What is this?
- Those are leeches.

685
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,545
No, I know, but they don't
look like leeches, do they?

686
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,780
No, they don't.

687
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:05,682
And what an odd decision,
when you could do

688
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,050
really crazy surgical stuff,

689
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,652
to spend time putting
a nose and the chin on

690
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:12,055
when we don't know what the guy
looks like to begin with.

691
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:14,524
I've made some really
poor decisions,

692
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,961
and I'm really worried
'cause I know I'm on the bottom.

693
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:23,166
What do you think
of tonight's designs?

694
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,202
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

695
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:29,919
What an odd decision,
when you could do

696
00:32:29,953 --> 00:32:31,287
really crazy surgical stuff,

697
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:33,423
to spend time putting
a nose and the chin on

698
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:35,591
when we don't know what the guy
looks like to begin with.

699
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:38,060
I've made some really
poor decisions,

700
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:41,898
and I'm really worried
'cause I know I'm on the bottom.

701
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:44,700
All this nice staining
on the skin,

702
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:46,169
that's really cool.

703
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:48,337
Turn around.

704
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:50,173
He's covering up
some of the best stuff.

705
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:51,874
- This is really nice.
- Yeah.

706
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:53,443
Yeah, the paint job's
really nice.

707
00:32:53,477 --> 00:32:54,944
Thank you.

708
00:32:59,116 --> 00:33:01,584
Well, the judges
have scored your creations,

709
00:33:01,618 --> 00:33:03,319
so let's find out
what they thought.

710
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:05,521
Tyler,

711
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:07,690
Graham,

712
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,059
Niko,

713
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:12,528
George,

714
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:13,996
congratulations.

715
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:18,234
You are all safe and can
head back to the makeup room.

716
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:28,077
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

717
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:30,279
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

718
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:32,081
to learn more about your work.

719
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:33,983
Chloe, you're up.

720
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,659
Chloe, I'd love to hear
the backstory of your character

721
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:46,629
and how you took inspiration
from your surgical implement.

722
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:49,165
The backstory is,

723
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,868
the mad scientist
was trying to be a surgeon.

724
00:33:51,902 --> 00:33:55,371
The saw was her mechanism
of choice.

725
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:57,740
And I wanted to make
this character

726
00:33:57,774 --> 00:34:01,377
look like it stepped out
of a black-and-white film.

727
00:34:01,411 --> 00:34:02,879
I think it's a brilliant idea.

728
00:34:02,913 --> 00:34:05,481
Super cool makeup.

729
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:09,285
Your choice to create
something that looks

730
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:11,654
as if it stepped off
of the silver screen

731
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:14,690
is indeed a laudable one.

732
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:16,626
I did
a black-and-white movie.

733
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,927
It was called<i> Ed Wood.</i>

734
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:19,695
Oh, I know.

735
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,297
And I found that
when you just use black,

736
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:22,465
there's so much blue in it,

737
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:24,233
which is what has happened
to your makeup.

738
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:26,168
It's kind of gone
to the blue side.

739
00:34:26,203 --> 00:34:28,170
You have to put in
some dark browns to make it

740
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:30,573
actually look like
a black-and-white movie,

741
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:31,674
but it's an awesome makeup.

742
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,675
Congratulations.

743
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:33,676
Thank you.

744
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,545
You had a concept
that was unique.

745
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,813
I think it's one
of your finest makeups.

746
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:39,448
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

747
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:41,150
Chloe, you can head back.

748
00:34:41,184 --> 00:34:43,452
Nice job.

749
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,091
Rashaad.

750
00:34:53,997 --> 00:34:56,032
Tell us
what medical instrument you had

751
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:57,967
and the story behind
this young lady.

752
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:59,602
The instrument is called
a trephine,

753
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:02,872
and my idea was a surgeon
who wanted

754
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:06,242
to make people
his own weird kind of dolls.

755
00:35:06,276 --> 00:35:08,311
He would use pieces
of other people's skin

756
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:10,046
on their faces.

757
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,213
I don't know.

758
00:35:11,248 --> 00:35:14,083
I'm not very happy
with this one, Rashaad.

759
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:17,687
The thing on the jaw
is just wrong.

760
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:20,556
It looks like she has something
stuck on her face,

761
00:35:20,591 --> 00:35:22,959
and you have this poor
patchwork skin thing

762
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:24,560
going on that isn't defined.

763
00:35:24,595 --> 00:35:25,861
Mm-hmm.

764
00:35:25,896 --> 00:35:27,396
I have a love-hate
with this one.

765
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:30,399
Could you mind just turning
a little bit so I can see that?

766
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:31,767
That's the love part.

767
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:33,903
And if you don't mind
turning the opposite direction.

768
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:35,338
Ah, there's the hate.

769
00:35:35,372 --> 00:35:36,372
It's that jaw.

770
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:39,075
- It's senseless.
- Mm-hmm.

771
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:42,011
This is less than riveting,
to be sure.

772
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,847
It doesn't feel like you had it
straight in your head.

773
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:48,618
It's just not
a fully realized concept.

774
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:49,852
Rashaad, thank you very much.

775
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:50,853
Please step back.

776
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:52,788
Thanks anyways.

777
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:58,828
Corinne, please step forward.

778
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,934
So tell us about your concept

779
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:07,436
and what medical device
you got.

780
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:09,572
Medical device I got
were leeches,

781
00:36:09,606 --> 00:36:11,774
and it was just the thought
of being tied down

782
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:14,877
and having them on you
is just really gross.

783
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:19,749
It feels like bondage Rambo
with some stuff stuck to him.

784
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:23,653
It's just so devoid
of visual interest.

785
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:25,988
I wish there was more here.

786
00:36:26,023 --> 00:36:28,858
I know.
I do, too.

787
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:30,559
There's nothing
about this makeup that is

788
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:34,196
in any way, shape, or form
expressive of you

789
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:36,666
as an artist
or something we haven't seen.

790
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,834
The work itself
isn't horribly done,

791
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:42,038
but it's a virtual black hole
of original thought.

792
00:36:42,072 --> 00:36:44,807
You have done
some really cool stuff for us,

793
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:46,942
but this is not one of them.

794
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:49,145
I got to say, though,
you did a great job

795
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,213
with the appliances
that you put on him,

796
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:53,115
but we don't see them.

797
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:56,786
I'm really disappointed
in you this week.

798
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,522
Corinne, thank you.
Please step back.

799
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:06,095
Daran, you're up.

800
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:13,992
Daran, tell us how
the surgical instrument

801
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,126
inspired this.

802
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:17,462
I chose the pneumatic bone saw.

803
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:21,066
This is an experiment
that was born and raised.

804
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,668
The mad scientist
decided he wasn't happy

805
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:26,338
with the male and female,
so he started splitting it,

806
00:37:26,372 --> 00:37:27,939
kind of messing around
with things.

807
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,741
The time that you had
to have pulled this off

808
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:33,778
at this level
is beyond impressive.

809
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:35,580
This well-trodden
two-head,

810
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:37,482
I've seen it done horribly.

811
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:39,918
This is stellar.

812
00:37:39,952 --> 00:37:43,288
It's so creepy that
the faces are a bit too big.

813
00:37:43,322 --> 00:37:44,756
I'm thrilled
with this thing, man.

814
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,591
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

815
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,792
I love this guy.

816
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:49,527
It's almost like
the two people are trying

817
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:52,297
to get away from each other,
which is a really cool idea.

818
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,732
It's really quite ingenious.

819
00:37:53,766 --> 00:37:54,999
That's awesome.
Thank you.

820
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:56,434
I think there's some
really gorgeous stuff

821
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:57,936
happening in the face.

822
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:02,207
There's nothing better than
when you satisfy the challenge,

823
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:06,311
but it doesn't feel
like it's just a concept.

824
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:08,279
This character feels alive.

825
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:10,248
So, beautiful work.

826
00:38:10,282 --> 00:38:11,449
Very cool.
Thank you.

827
00:38:11,484 --> 00:38:12,617
Daran, thank you very much.

828
00:38:12,651 --> 00:38:15,754
- Please step back.
- You're awesome.

829
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:21,025
All right, guys,
the judges have heard

830
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,227
what you have to say.

831
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,895
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

832
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,197
while they deliberate.

833
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:33,605
All right, judges,
so let's talk about the looks

834
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,039
you liked the most tonight.

835
00:38:35,074 --> 00:38:36,074
How about Chloe?

836
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,809
She did such
a great job of coming up

837
00:38:37,843 --> 00:38:39,177
with an original idea.

838
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:40,478
She pushed the bounds.

839
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:41,846
She thought out of the box.

840
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:43,314
Being in
that black-and-white genre,

841
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:45,150
I think it worked
really well for her.

842
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:47,252
All right,
let's move on to Daran.

843
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:49,521
That was really well done.

844
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:51,156
That mouth should really
bother us,

845
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,691
but he manages
to move our eye across

846
00:38:53,726 --> 00:38:55,627
from one face to the other

847
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:57,195
without tripping us up
with that mouth.

848
00:38:57,229 --> 00:38:59,063
All right, judges,
let's move on to the looks

849
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:00,265
you liked the least.

850
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,433
Let's start with Rashaad.

851
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:04,969
Oy, the teeth
out in the middle of its jaw.

852
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:06,438
It just reads like a mistake.

853
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:08,773
We don't know if
we're supposed to be seeing

854
00:39:08,808 --> 00:39:12,944
torn skin exposing the jaw
or if it's somebody else's jaw.

855
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,479
If he would have
actually done, like,

856
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:16,748
a patchwork face, like a doll,
that would have been cool,

857
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:18,483
with different colored skin.

858
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:21,186
It was not good.
There was just nothing there.

859
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,154
All right,
let's move on to Corinne.

860
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:24,456
Poor girl.

861
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,392
She was palpably uninspired.

862
00:39:27,426 --> 00:39:29,594
I find it an extremely
odd choice to have spent

863
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:32,464
so much time changing
the guy's jawline and nose.

864
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:35,467
It didn't contribute
to the idea of the surgery.

865
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,469
It wasn't like she was
putting them under the skin

866
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,504
or doing anything
interesting with them.

867
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:42,273
You know, she could have
done all kinds of cool stuff.

868
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:44,275
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

869
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,276
We certainly have.

870
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:46,344
Let's bring them back out.

871
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,422
Glenn, tell us about
tonight's top looks.

872
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:59,824
Chloe, we love that
you delivered

873
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:01,926
such a clean application,

874
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:05,530
but it was the risk you took
on such a bold concept

875
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:07,131
that really set you apart.

876
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:09,300
Daran, super impressed

877
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:11,736
with the sculpture
again this week.

878
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,040
The anatomical choices
in the face flowed beautifully.

879
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:17,108
All right, Glenn,

880
00:40:17,142 --> 00:40:18,676
who is the winner
of this challenge?

881
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:21,346
The winner
of this challenge is...

882
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:30,323
So Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

883
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:32,992
The winner
of this challenge is...

884
00:40:35,028 --> 00:40:37,263
Daran.

885
00:40:39,766 --> 00:40:42,702
We thought that your creation
was conceptually sound,

886
00:40:42,736 --> 00:40:45,538
and the execution
was outrageously good.

887
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:47,106
I don't know what to say
other than

888
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,474
thank you, thank you,
thank you.

889
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:50,409
The judges seem
to like what I'm doing.

890
00:40:50,444 --> 00:40:51,444
Hopefully I can keep it up

891
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:52,545
and keep doing what
I love doing.

892
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:54,080
Daran, congratulations.

893
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:56,616
You and Chloe can head back
to the makeup room.

894
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,252
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

895
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:05,458
Unfortunately,
that means the two of you

896
00:41:05,492 --> 00:41:07,026
are on the bottom this week,

897
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,896
and one of you
will be eliminated.

898
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,497
Please step forward.

899
00:41:19,506 --> 00:41:22,174
Glenn, tell us about
tonight's bottom looks.

900
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:26,445
Rashaad, your work this week
smacked of a concept

901
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,048
that simply was not
fully realized.

902
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:30,950
It just didn't work.

903
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:35,121
Corinne, your lack of concept
was quite disconcerting to us

904
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:38,624
and left us feeling very
underwhelmed with this makeup.

905
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,294
So who is going home tonight?

906
00:41:41,328 --> 00:41:45,765
The person going home
tonight is...

907
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:50,603
Corinne.

908
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:53,406
Your concept and makeup
were so simple,

909
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,308
and at this point
in the competition,

910
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:56,709
it's just not enough.

911
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:58,344
Thank you for the opportunity.

912
00:41:58,378 --> 00:42:00,179
That means, Rashaad,
you are safe this week

913
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:03,115
and can head back
to the makeup room.

914
00:42:08,722 --> 00:42:12,024
Corinne, you have delivered
some really amazing makeups.

915
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,893
You're gonna do really well
in this business.

916
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:14,894
Thank you.

917
00:42:14,928 --> 00:42:15,895
Corinne, I'm so sorry,

918
00:42:15,929 --> 00:42:17,730
but you have been eliminated.

919
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:19,565
It's really been great
having you here with us.

920
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,700
If you'd please head back

921
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:21,968
to the makeup room
and pack up your kit.

922
00:42:22,002 --> 00:42:23,569
- Thank you.
- Good luck, honey.

923
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:25,371
I'm disappointed.

924
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:27,206
Concept is something
I struggled with

925
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,808
throughout the competition.

926
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,476
I wish I'd been able to show

927
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,845
a bigger and better
kind of idea.

928
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:36,916
What?

929
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,417
I didn't put
nearly as much effort

930
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:41,687
into this particular challenge
as I should have.

931
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:47,093
But being here has been
such a great push as an artist.

932
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:49,528
I love makeup.
I love effects.

933
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:51,831
I love doing this for a living,

934
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:52,965
and I'm really excited

935
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,971
about the possibilities
for the future.
