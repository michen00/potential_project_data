1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:01,795
Damn, you did a great job.

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:03,096
That's a lot of good decisions.

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,032
You've really done
a beautiful job this week.

4
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:07,934
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:09,269
Tyler's Whangdoodle brought him

6
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,037
a staggering third victory.

7
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:12,038
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:15,308
And Chloe was sent home.

9
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:17,043
Now, six artists remain,

10
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:18,178
and tonight they'll tackle

11
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:20,313
a challenge
of genetic transformation...

12
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:21,614
Oh, that's so cool.

13
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:23,416
I've been waiting
for a challenge like this.

14
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:26,019
...and draw one artist closer
to the finale.

15
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,688
If I don't get this done,
this is gonna send me home.

16
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:30,256
They're so important
to my design,

17
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,425
but they are taking me
so freaking long.

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,660
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:36,062
It's like constant pain.

20
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:37,897
This makeup
doesn't really work.

21
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:38,998
It's really quite beautiful.

22
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:40,533
You really have to turn
your game up

23
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:41,935
at this point, man.

24
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,571
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

25
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:45,905
from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

26
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,975
to one of their
85 international locations,

27
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,078
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

28
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:53,980
and $100,000.

29
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:57,010
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

30
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:02,188
<i>Face Off!</i>

31
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:04,591
Welcome to<i>Face Off.</i>

32
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,447
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

33
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:50,403
I need to step it up.

34
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,405
I was again
in the bottom looks.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,807
But you don't know
what could happen,

36
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,108
you know?

37
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:56,676
The competition is getting
tighter though.

38
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,878
Much tighter.
It's the real deal now.

39
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:01,147
The challenges are getting
more extreme.

40
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:03,183
Competition's getting tight.
Everybody here is a threat.

41
00:02:03,217 --> 00:02:05,118
And I just need to make sure
I stay

42
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:06,119
on top of my game
and keep coming up

43
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:07,120
with original things.

44
00:02:07,154 --> 00:02:08,221
- All the girls are gone.
- Yep.

45
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,657
All the girls are gone,
except for Niko.

46
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:18,064
- Ooh.
- Look at this.

47
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:19,299
This is cool.

48
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,068
We end up at the Gnomon School
Of Visual Effects.

49
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,436
That is beautiful.

50
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:24,871
This is a very famous school.

51
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:26,439
They have top-notch students
here.

52
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:28,374
This is gonna be cool.

53
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,509
Ooh.

54
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:30,743
Oh, my goodness.

55
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:33,046
We get into
this freaking cool room.

56
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,280
All these computers,

57
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:36,616
and then there's McKenzie
and Neville.

58
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,353
It's like, "Oh, my God.
This is gonna be cool as hell."

59
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:41,354
Hey, guys.

60
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:42,555
- Hello.
- Hey.

61
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,691
Welcome to Gnomon School
Of Visual Effects.

62
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:46,326
This state-of-the-art facility

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,361
has produced some
of Hollywood's premier

64
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:50,997
digital effects artists,
like Neville here,

65
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:53,466
who is on the advisory board,
so I'm gonna let him

66
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,734
tell you a little bit
more about it.

67
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:56,336
Gnomon is widely considered

68
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,304
the MIT of visual effects.

69
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,940
Past students,
which include yours truly,

70
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,942
have contributed
to blockbuster films

71
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:05,678
such as<i> The Avengers,</i>
<i>Prometheus,</i>

72
00:03:05,713 --> 00:03:07,480
and<i> The Wolverine,</i>
just to name a few.

73
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,450
Visual effects
are a really great tool.

74
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:13,019
Visual artists sketch out
the character

75
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,588
and then it comes to us
to actually build it,

76
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:16,756
so I'm really excited.

77
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,057
All right, so let's talk about

78
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:19,559
this week's challenge.

79
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:22,295
Films like<i> Spider-Man</i>
and<i> The Hulk</i> tap

80
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,763
into the hidden power
of genetics...

81
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,965
Sweet.

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,601
...where special genes
or mutated DNA

83
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:32,572
give extraordinary abilities
and sometimes radically alter

84
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:33,840
one's physical appearance.

85
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:35,041
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:36,576
Talking about mutants here.

87
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,413
We're doing mutants.

88
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:41,481
Everyone in the room,

89
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,316
we're like-- just, like,
"Oh, my God.

90
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,684
This is our challenge."

91
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:46,219
I think we're all,
like, mutant nerds.

92
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:48,421
On each of these monitors

93
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:50,657
is a special strand
of mutated DNA

94
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:54,394
representing
a unique trait or ability.

95
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:57,764
Your spotlight challenge
is to select one of them

96
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,532
and create an original mutant

97
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,001
who physically manifests
that trait.

98
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:03,903
- Oh, that's so cool.
- Thank you, thank you.

99
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:05,405
I've been waiting
for a challenge like this,

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,406
so I'm excited.

101
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,509
George, you're up first.

102
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:12,612
George, you have
impenetrable skin.

103
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:14,847
Niko, you have magnetism.

104
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:18,251
Rashaad, you have elasticity.

105
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:21,054
Tyler, you have wallcrawling.

106
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,455
Graham, you have tunneling.

107
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:27,093
Daran, you have
panoramic vision.

108
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,127
All right, so, what
are you gonna be looking for

109
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:29,362
in their final makeups?

110
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,663
We're gonna be looking for

111
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:32,732
these specific physical traits
manifested,

112
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:33,967
and I want to make sure

113
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,769
that you guys really
push yourselves creatively

114
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:39,205
because you got these wonderful
DNA strands to work with.

115
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,573
Now, in Hollywood,

116
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,643
makeup artists have to keep up
with the latest trends.

117
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:45,011
For many, that means

118
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,080
using digital technology
to help perfect

119
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:49,282
their designs before
they even begin sculpting.

120
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:52,919
Today, our friends at Pixologic,
makers of Zbrush Software,

121
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,787
have been kind enough
to bring us

122
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:57,090
some amazing
visual effects artists

123
00:04:57,124 --> 00:05:00,026
who will help bring
your designs to the next level.

124
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,094
Oh, awesome.

125
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,128
That's pretty cool.

126
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:04,597
I've never seen Zbrush work,

127
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:07,667
and now we get to sit down
with a Zbrush artist

128
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,236
and start firing ideas out
and watch them appear,

129
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,305
which is incredible.

130
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:14,307
Now, you've each
been assigned to one

131
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:16,242
of these talented artists
and will have two hours

132
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,645
to collaborate with them
on your design.

133
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:19,979
So, go ahead and get started,

134
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,781
and I will see you later on
back at the lab.

135
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:23,249
Good luck.

136
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:25,485
Hello.

137
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,286
- I got tunneling.
- Tunneling.

138
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:28,287
- Okay, crazy.
- Yeah.

139
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:30,623
It needs to have
a strong head...

140
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,859
- Right.
- ...neck, shoulders, and arms

141
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:34,894
with more, like,
vermin-like features.

142
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:36,896
So, like, we'll pull the jaw
back a little bit maybe?

143
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,231
Yeah. Yeah.
That looks good.

144
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:39,232
That's already looking
kind of mole-like.

145
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,233
Something kind of like that?

146
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,267
Immediately I thought

147
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:43,636
sort of subterranean
mole-like man.

148
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:45,204
Also, he's wearing a helmet

149
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:47,073
to help him dig
as he's going through

150
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:49,575
all these tunnels.

151
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,444
I don't want to go
with something too, too big.

152
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:52,545
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:53,980
More, like, cool-looking,
you know?

154
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:55,381
I don't want to be, like,
a little animal, you know--

155
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,649
Yeah. Yeah.
No, no, no. Totally.

156
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,551
I get impenetrable skin.

157
00:05:58,585 --> 00:06:00,920
The mutant is
a military officer

158
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,355
who is experimented on,

159
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:05,825
and he starts turning into
an armadillo kind of look.

160
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:07,660
Oh, dude.

161
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:10,596
That's so cool, man.

162
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,733
Like, even if you want
to incorporate

163
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,201
- the elastic things, like...
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:18,371
...perhaps, like, on the corner
of the nose, but really small.

165
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:20,506
My mutant gene is elasticity.

166
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,442
My concept is this octopi guy

167
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,645
who has the ability
to stretch and expand,

168
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,213
and he's got these tentacles
on his back,

169
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,315
and he's got
this elongated head.

170
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,817
So I'm explaining this
to Stefano

171
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:32,852
and he's working it into
the computer,

172
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,220
'cause as soon
as I tell him what I want,

173
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:35,922
he's already doing it
on the Zbrush.

174
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:37,323
So it's amazing.

175
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:38,424
I like the way it looks now,
'cause then that helps

176
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:39,892
break up
the human form somewhat.

177
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:41,928
Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,966
That is cool.

179
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,569
That's gonna look cool, man.

180
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,571
It does remind me of a bat
and a fly kind of--

181
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:53,673
because I got wall crawling,

182
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:54,974
my concept for my character

183
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:58,277
is this villain mutant
that's in mid-mutation

184
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,213
and very fly-like.

185
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:03,416
It has these big hands
that can propel him up a wall.

186
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,818
To me, that looks like that
can stick to something.

187
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:12,291
Metal doesn't attract so
he can actually push it back.

188
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:13,326
- Oh, push it back.
- Yeah.

189
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,963
Oh, that's great.

190
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:18,297
Thank you so much.

191
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:19,365
All right, guys.
It's time.

192
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,900
Let's head back to the lab.

193
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,802
It was absolutely awesome.

194
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,170
Good to meet you too.

195
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,205
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

196
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,982
All right, here we go.

197
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,183
It's day one
of the mutant challenge.

198
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:40,686
We have five hours
in the lab today.

199
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,655
My mutation
is panoramic vision,

200
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:44,190
and I'm gonna make
this protrusion

201
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:46,159
coming out of the head
out of gelatin

202
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:47,460
that you can see
from any angle,

203
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:49,762
which will be
an extension of her eye.

204
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:52,298
I've gotta get a piece of foam
and draw out

205
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:55,001
my design
for the gelatin piece,

206
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,436
cut that out,
and stick it to my clay,

207
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,639
which has gotta
be sculpted separately.

208
00:07:59,673 --> 00:08:01,140
I just hope the judges
are gonna be able

209
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:04,177
to read this later on.

210
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:11,217
I get magnetism, and I'm like,

211
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,685
"That's super, super cool."

212
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,021
My concept
is this villain mutant

213
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:18,391
that transforms himself into
this power source of magnets,

214
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:21,260
so I want to do the muscles
all built in coils

215
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:23,296
and have some magnets
in the hands

216
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,131
so he can control his power.

217
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,567
The first thing I start
working is on the face,

218
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,302
but I need to make the cowl,

219
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,536
and I need to do a chest piece

220
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:32,238
and also work in the hands,

221
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:35,908
so I have a lot of work to do.

222
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,616
My creature has these big hands

223
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,119
and the little hairs that flies
use to climb up a wall.

224
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,288
Her chin ends here...

225
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,290
- Oh.
- ...'cause she's tiny.

226
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,492
My model's face
is very, very small

227
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:57,730
but my character's face
is very long.

228
00:08:57,764 --> 00:08:59,332
- That longer--
- Yeah, that-- It's weird.

229
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:01,534
Oh, yeah.
She has, like, really small--

230
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,436
- I'm gonna have
to actually build clay

231
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,205
to get that elongated look.

232
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:09,809
Hello, guys.

233
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:10,810
- Hey.
- Hi, everybody.

234
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:12,445
- Hey.
- Here for a walkthrough.

235
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,213
There's gonna be a cowl
that is gonna integrate

236
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,015
with this,
which is gonna start here,

237
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:17,450
all around the back,

238
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:19,085
- up to here.
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,086
- So, right there?
- Yeah.

240
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,220
Edit yourself.

241
00:09:21,255 --> 00:09:22,922
This whole first impression

242
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,557
is more important
than in the back.

243
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,125
If you're gonna have
to spend half a day...

244
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,493
- Yeah.
- ...sculpting and molding.

245
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:28,594
Okay. Got it.

246
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:30,696
All of this
is going to be eyeball.

247
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:33,132
It's really a story
that the judges need to know.

248
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,601
They would totally not
understand what's going on.

249
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:37,169
I would think if there
was anything else

250
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,305
that you could put in there,

251
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,573
like little veins or something.

252
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,774
Oh, okay.

253
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,910
Well, I got the mutation
of magnetism.

254
00:09:43,944 --> 00:09:44,911
Okay.

255
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:47,313
His whole skin
is made in coils.

256
00:09:47,347 --> 00:09:49,849
Be careful that you don't
get them too flat

257
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,150
so it looks like a wrinkle.

258
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:53,119
If you want to do
that second layer,

259
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:54,487
you just take your clay

260
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:58,124
and roll 'em out,

261
00:09:58,158 --> 00:09:59,392
and then lay it
on top of there.

262
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:00,393
- All right.
- Okay?

263
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,994
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck.

264
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,429
I was trying to think
of an elastic animal

265
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:05,298
that can stretch and contract.

266
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:06,899
So I decided
to go with an octopus.

267
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,235
Accentuate the pulling
and the stretching

268
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,236
- in the face...
- Right.

269
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,971
...to sell the idea
as elasticity.

270
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:13,339
- Okay. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:15,708
I got the tunneling mutation.

272
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,777
So, instantly
I thought mole rat.

273
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,478
You really need to paint
this well

274
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:21,280
to bring out
all the little details.

275
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,615
And this is also something

276
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:24,183
that can have
a lot of dirt on it.

277
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:27,253
Take a big sponge with
Kryolan brown or something

278
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:28,254
and give it a squirt
and give it

279
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:30,156
- a smear of paint.
- Okay.

280
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,691
I have wallcrawler.

281
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:33,759
So, I had that concept
of, like, a bat-fly

282
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:36,429
that can actually, like,
stick to the wall and climb up.

283
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:37,897
Mm-hmm.
You're pretty tight here.

284
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,465
You're not leaving yourself
much forehead here.

285
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:40,499
Mm-mm.

286
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:41,867
I would, just to allow
for shrinkage.

287
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,135
Okay.

288
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,037
All right, guys.
It's looking really good.

289
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:46,272
- Bye.
- Thank you.

290
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:47,273
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

291
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:49,308
Bye-bye.

292
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,880
So, to create this character,

293
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:57,183
I'm gonna need to make
a face and a cowl

294
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,085
to build out
the muscle structure.

295
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:03,456
I'm making the face so it's
scrunched into the design,

296
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,858
based on the idea
that he's just built out

297
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:09,362
so much that's kind of got,
like, this henchman-y look.

298
00:11:10,897 --> 00:11:12,865
I am concerned that a mole

299
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,066
isn't that
interesting-looking,

300
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,968
so I hope I don't
get knocked down

301
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:17,236
for being too safe.

302
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,270
That's so you.

303
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,940
Like, the fun-- it's you.

304
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,013
The clock is ticking,

305
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:28,948
and I'm still working
on the detail

306
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,616
of the sculpture of the face.

307
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,151
That's a huge problem.

308
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:35,755
Doing these coils
like Mr. Westmore told me

309
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:36,922
is actually
time-consuming

310
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,157
because you have
to make sure that you make

311
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,892
those lines really perfect.

312
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:42,495
If not, the judges
will not get the concept.

313
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,365
I don't know if I'm going
to be able to do them all.

314
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,235
I'm like, "Oh, shit.
What do I do now?"

315
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:51,537
If I don't get this done,

316
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:55,274
this is gonna send me home.

317
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,642
Coming up...

318
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:57,977
Oh, fuck!

319
00:11:58,011 --> 00:11:59,078
Ooh, George.
You all right?

320
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:01,547
Fuck, man.
My body hurts like crazy.

321
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:03,682
This is your weakest showing
to date.

322
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,117
Nobody's gonna get it.

323
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:07,119
This is really
quite exceptional.

324
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,362
It's the first day
of our challenge,

325
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:20,033
and I'm having some trouble
with the face piece.

326
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,269
My mutant has the ability
to control magnetism.

327
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,738
So he's all built in coils,

328
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,875
and it's taken me more time
than expected to make them.

329
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,543
I really want to focus

330
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:31,911
on having a really good piece,

331
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:34,347
so I want to take my time
to do this right.

332
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:36,649
I don't like it,
but it probably has

333
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,685
to be finished tomorrow.

334
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:46,325
I'm definitely taking
Mr. Westmore's advice to heart,

335
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,328
and to incorporate more
of the elasticity in the face,

336
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:50,797
I pull the corners
of the eyes out,

337
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,565
pull the corners
of the mouth out,

338
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,167
pull the corners of the nose.

339
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:57,770
Once I finish sculpting,
it's time to mold.

340
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:01,741
I need to get this ready to go
pretty quickly,

341
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:04,677
because when you get the face
done and run in foam,

342
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,079
you can line it up
with the cowl

343
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:09,115
and make sure everything
is perfect.

344
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:15,321
Is that supposed to be,
like, her bone?

345
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:16,355
No bone.

346
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,890
Like, an extension of the eye.

347
00:13:17,925 --> 00:13:19,358
Nice.

348
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:21,160
I've got my face sculpted.

349
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:22,361
And my plan on this one
is to run

350
00:13:22,396 --> 00:13:24,030
some strips
of LED lights underneath,

351
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:26,666
which will actually give
the gelatin a glowing feeling.

352
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,167
Mr. Westmore was not sure

353
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,769
if the judges
are gonna get the concept,

354
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:31,003
so I'm hoping this will help

355
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:34,307
this panoramic eye read better.

356
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:39,245
So, I finish sculpting the face

357
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,980
and I start blocking out
the cowl.

358
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:42,648
I hear you sighing.
What happened?

359
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,083
My shoulder's locked, dude.
Yeah.

360
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:47,186
What'd you do,
slap the clay on?

361
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,221
I think so.

362
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:49,622
Making this gigantic cowl

363
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,991
has taken a toll on me
physically,

364
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:53,426
and I'm not 20 anymore.

365
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,262
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

366
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:57,730
This thing is slowing
me down, man.

367
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:59,398
So I'm a little worried
about it,

368
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,634
but we'll see how it goes.

369
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:04,670
You got 33 minutes!

370
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,515
All right, guys, that's time!

371
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,216
Right here.

372
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:21,053
At the end of day one,
I've got a face done,

373
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:22,889
I've got the nose molded
and done,

374
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:25,925
but there's still
a whole lot to do.

375
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,093
I got to make a cowl.

376
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,695
I need to figure out
how to pad out the arms.

377
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,965
And I definitely need to make
some cool mole talons.

378
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,934
I'm worried that I'm gonna
have a tough time

379
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:37,970
getting everything
sculpted right.

380
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:47,613
It's day two
of our mutant challenge,

381
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:51,617
and we have 9 1/2 hours today.

382
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:54,120
Because my character
is in mid-mutation,

383
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:56,455
I want to make sure
I get that round back

384
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,257
and the thick parts of the neck

385
00:14:58,292 --> 00:15:02,028
and really make this character
look demonic and fly-like.

386
00:15:02,062 --> 00:15:05,131
Because my model is so small,

387
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,732
instead of sculpting
separate pieces,

388
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,768
I'm doing
a pull-over bodysuit.

389
00:15:08,802 --> 00:15:11,571
I think everybody
at this point's like,

390
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,039
"Okay, got to step it up."

391
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:15,508
So I got to get this out
because it's my main piece

392
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:19,545
that is gonna just make it
or break it at this point.

393
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:27,086
Day two is going
to be very important.

394
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,454
I need to finish the cowl,

395
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:31,023
so I start sculpting
out the muscle structure

396
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,024
for this thing.

397
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,025
I'm a little bit worried

398
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,894
because it might be too simple.

399
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:36,395
But since it seems
like it's gonna be

400
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,663
a lot of sculpting,

401
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm trying
to go as fast as I can.

402
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,740
Today, I'm finishing
the detail on the face,

403
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:50,710
finishing the cowl,
and start sculpting the chest.

404
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:53,207
I got to do it at super speed.

405
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,717
My shoulder is,
like, hurting right here,

406
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,085
but I'm gonna keep going.

407
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,720
If I can lift my finger
to sculpt,

408
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:03,756
I'll freaking do it.

409
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:12,531
I'm trying to work as fast
as I can with the coils.

410
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,467
I'm bouncing back from the face

411
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:17,069
to the chest
so they can look cohesive.

412
00:16:17,104 --> 00:16:19,772
And I want to mold them
almost at the same time.

413
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,073
First with the face,
and then as soon

414
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:25,111
as I finish the face,
I can start with the chest.

415
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:33,019
I've got both pieces sculpted
for the gelatin eye.

416
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:35,921
So at this point,
I am molding them together,

417
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:38,624
and I'll be pouring the gelatin
in before the end of day.

418
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,826
Feeling pretty crunched
for time right now.

419
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,062
I know this one's
going to take a lot to do.

420
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:44,530
There's a lot of pieces to this

421
00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:47,566
and everything's got to line up
and look just right.

422
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,939
I finish the cowl,
so now I need to make

423
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:56,442
some big mole claws.

424
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,411
I find some pre-made horns

425
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:00,212
that kind of look like claws.

426
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:02,481
Anybody have
a little bit of extra plaster?

427
00:17:02,516 --> 00:17:05,017
Yeah.
Absolutely.

428
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:06,552
And I realize, like,

429
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:08,287
I have to wait
for this stuff to set.

430
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:09,455
Great.

431
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:11,257
Now what the fuck
do I do with these?

432
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:14,060
I don't know what to do
with all this crap.

433
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:20,766
I'm sittin' around
with 'em like a jackass.

434
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:30,309
I finish sculpting

435
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:33,112
the chest piece,
the face, and the cowl.

436
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:36,782
And I'm trying to mold them
all at the same time.

437
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,050
Damn it.

438
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:40,252
Every time I do molds,
my body hurts like crazy.

439
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:43,789
The whole physical toll
of the competition

440
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:44,890
is getting to me.

441
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:45,991
Oh!

442
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:46,992
Ooh, George.
You all right?

443
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:48,094
- Fuck, man.
- You all right?

444
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:49,428
Fuck.

445
00:17:49,463 --> 00:17:51,097
It's like constant pain
all the time.

446
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,568
It's hard to think, I'm tired.

447
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:58,037
And I'm like, "Oh, my God."

448
00:17:58,071 --> 00:17:59,972
Shit.

449
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,907
I still have a lot of work
to do,

450
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:05,778
but this is gonna slow me down
and I know it.

451
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:09,014
I'm afraid I'm going home,
for sure.

452
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:15,731
Fucking shoulder.
Shit.

453
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:18,434
It's day two
of our mutant challenge.

454
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:19,935
I am very worried 'cause I need

455
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,237
to get three things molded
by the end of the day,

456
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:25,741
and it's actually hurting
my shoulder a little.

457
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:28,077
But I've dealed
with this pain all my life,

458
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:31,113
and I'm gonna keep going,
no matter what.

459
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:42,858
I sculpt out the tentacles

460
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:43,926
that are gonna go on the back.

461
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,661
And instead of sculpting
two tentacles,

462
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:49,365
you just sculpt one
and make a flat plaster mold

463
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:53,268
that can be used
for both sides.

464
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:56,972
They came out beautiful,
ready for application day,

465
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:59,908
and I am happy.

466
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:02,111
At this point,
everything's done

467
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:03,746
on my wallcrawling character.

468
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,448
But the biggest thing
are these little hairs,

469
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:08,717
and I find these foam noodles.

470
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:12,287
I can just use those
and melt 'em.

471
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:15,691
So I'm cutting them
in various sizes.

472
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:19,094
So the entire day,
I am melting and pinching

473
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:20,129
and they look great,

474
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:21,530
but I'm literally making

475
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:22,998
over 100 of these things

476
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,199
because they're so important
to my design,

477
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:26,735
but they are taking me
so freaking long.

478
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,772
I know it's gonna eat up
my application time tomorrow.

479
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,781
I'm doing all these molds
at the same time

480
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:40,382
and I'm looking at the clock,

481
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,717
and I'm almost done.

482
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,786
I'm like,
"Wow, I did it."

483
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,354
All right, guys.
That's time.

484
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:48,691
Time to go home.

485
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:50,192
It's been a very hard day
physically,

486
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:52,161
and tomorrow I got a lot to do.

487
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:53,162
A lot to do.

488
00:19:53,196 --> 00:19:56,198
We'll see if I get it done.

489
00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:05,574
Wow, dude.
What a day.

490
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:06,975
Definitely what a day.

491
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,378
I miss my wife
and my parents and my brother.

492
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:10,446
- Everybody, man.
- Yeah.

493
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,647
I really miss my wife.

494
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:13,148
I need that little boost
of confidence

495
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,216
that she brings to me.

496
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,751
I hope my wife is okay, man.

497
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:18,353
She's alone there
with her belly, our baby.

498
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,922
- In a month, dude!
- In a month?

499
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:21,023
I'm gonna be
a father in a month!

500
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,624
That's crazy.
I got a longer wait.

501
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,293
- You miss your family, dude?
- Oh, definitely.

502
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:25,294
Definitely.

503
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:26,795
I miss my family,

504
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,131
but I try to stay focused

505
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:30,165
because this is all for them.

506
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,266
Come on, I need--

507
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:32,267
Let's go get something
to eat, man.

508
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:33,546
I need something.

509
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:39,608
Let's get it. Whoo.

510
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,944
It's application day.

511
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:44,279
We have four hours in the lab,
one hour in last looks.

512
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:45,647
I run in, check my pieces.

513
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:47,616
Yay, they came out.

514
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,085
All I really have to do
is cut the seams off,

515
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,854
make sure everything
is patched,

516
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:54,590
dried, and ready to go.

517
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,193
How are you?

518
00:20:58,228 --> 00:20:59,394
Our models arrive.

519
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,396
- Ohh, I'm so excited.
- Are you ready?

520
00:21:01,431 --> 00:21:02,531
You have no idea. Yes!

521
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:03,699
I am so ready.

522
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,168
And I start
getting everything on Megan.

523
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:09,171
I get the suit on her,
and of course, it's too big,

524
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:11,573
so I end up cutting the face

525
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:13,809
and pulling the cowl down
around her face with glue.

526
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:16,345
I put my appliance over that

527
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:17,379
and everything's
lining up right.

528
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:19,081
I'm like, "This is great."
Perfect.

529
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:21,517
You look so scary.

530
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:25,187
Let's put the head first.

531
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:26,622
I start applying the cowl,

532
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,024
and I'm noticing huge gaps
in the shoulders.

533
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,193
Wait, wait, wait.
Let go of that.

534
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:32,394
It's gonna be
a little problematic.

535
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:36,031
I end up cutting foam
to stuff into the cowl

536
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:37,833
to make the whole thing tight.

537
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:38,867
And it's perfect.
It works.

538
00:21:38,902 --> 00:21:41,670
- Oof.
- You okay?

539
00:21:41,704 --> 00:21:42,971
Okay.
Don't scare me, man.

540
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:52,681
"Here we go again."

541
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:56,051
"Time to make another tunnel."

542
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:57,352
I start comin' up
with this idea

543
00:21:57,387 --> 00:22:00,389
for the tunneler
where he's kind of disgruntled

544
00:22:00,423 --> 00:22:02,925
because everyone else
has a cool power

545
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,226
and his is tunneling.

546
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,061
"You think you're strong?

547
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:09,198
I'll tunnel right through
your house."

548
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,632
I'd be jealous if I were him.

549
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,801
You know, somebody has,
like, wallcrawling abilities

550
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:15,571
or impenetrable skin,
and I can tunnel.

551
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,105
But I tell the guy, you know,

552
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,841
"We're gonna make you
the coolest tunneler

553
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,075
you can be."

554
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,618
And he'll go--
he'll snap one day.

555
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:23,445
_

556
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:28,550
All right.
Let's try this.

557
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:29,885
Well, it's extremely important

558
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,753
that these strips of LED lights

559
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:35,357
line up perfectly to make
the translucent gelatin glow.

560
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:36,892
Perfect.

561
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:39,294
I manage to get everything
glued down all the way around.

562
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,696
So, I'm gonna stand you up now.

563
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,830
I'm gettin' ready to start
painting this thing,

564
00:22:41,865 --> 00:22:43,031
and my model stands up

565
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,033
and the LEDs
get caught on the chair...

566
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,735
Shit, I just pulled that
all the way through.

567
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,136
And pulled out of the cowl.

568
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:50,005
Absolutely not good.

569
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,506
So, I try to run these LEDs

570
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,141
back up to the head,
but it's impossible

571
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:55,711
because my hand
won't fit up in there.

572
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:57,512
I'm gonna have to scrap
the LED idea.

573
00:22:57,547 --> 00:22:59,014
Okay, we're movin' on.

574
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:00,916
The lights were a pretty
important part of my makeup,

575
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,952
so I'm gonna be in trouble.

576
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:08,690
Okay, I'm gonna
go under your chin.

577
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:10,626
I have the face piece,

578
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,427
arm pieces,
and the chest applied,

579
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:14,363
and I still have time to paint.

580
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:15,364
We're going to win this.

581
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:17,766
- Do it.
- Let's do this.

582
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,301
I start doing some dry brushes

583
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:23,805
with my copper Kryolan aquacolor
on top of every coil.

584
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,408
So it still looks shiny
through the makeup,

585
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:29,468
and I'm really happy about that.

586
00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:32,872
Once I get my base color down

587
00:23:32,906 --> 00:23:35,741
I go glue each individual hair

588
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:38,110
into every single hole
that I made on the cowl.

589
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:39,612
I can't have any empty holes.

590
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:41,680
Every one has to be filled.

591
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:43,716
But there is so many of them

592
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,151
that I'm gonna have
to make these hairs

593
00:23:46,186 --> 00:23:49,188
in last looks, I think.

594
00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:51,690
I'm gettin' worried
because I spent

595
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,058
a lot time in my application

596
00:23:53,093 --> 00:23:54,593
trying to fix the LEDs,

597
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:57,496
so I still have
to finish my paint job.

598
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:00,533
We got six minutes.

599
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,807
All right, everybody.
That's it. Time.

600
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:11,610
I feel like I'm really
behind on this one.

601
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:13,012
I don't have
the gelatin pieces glued down.

602
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:15,080
I'm freakin' out a little bit,

603
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:19,218
but I'm hopin' that everything
works out in last looks.

604
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:21,220
- Coming up...
- You all right?

605
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:22,821
Yeah, it's my arm.

606
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:23,822
I can't go home on this.

607
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:24,823
This is ridiculous.

608
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:26,692
I'm fabricating in last looks.

609
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,427
That is superb.

610
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,529
It's not one
of my favorite makeups.

611
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,310
Whoo-hoo!

612
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,980
Same spot, different day.

613
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:45,551
I still have a lot of work
to do going into last looks.

614
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:49,355
Sit down, my friend.
We got a lot to do.

615
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,957
I'm just now startin'
to glue down the suction cups.

616
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,292
I need these to go on

617
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:54,760
because that's
what's gonna sell

618
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,831
my whole theme of elasticity.

619
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:01,700
You all right?

620
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,302
Yeah, it's my arm.

621
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,970
Sink or swim, George!
Sink or swim!

622
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:06,805
It's wearing out, dude.

623
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,141
I'm so sick of making
these things.

624
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,043
I have to make more
of these hairs.

625
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,378
This is ridiculous.

626
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:15,080
I can't believe
I'm fabricating in last looks,

627
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:17,569
but these hairs are so important
that I have no choice.

628
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,110
_

629
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:20,928
- Okay.
- Thank you.

630
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,296
At this point,
I'm gettin' worried

631
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:24,131
'cause I don't have the gelatin
pieces glued down

632
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,366
and I'm not sure
if they're gonna fit right.

633
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,002
I'm racin' through
to figure out

634
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:29,570
what's most important,
because this hour's

635
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:32,673
feeling like 15 minutes.

636
00:25:40,015 --> 00:25:41,349
All right, everybody.
That's it.

637
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:42,550
Brushes down.

638
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:46,020
I think that
was the fastest hour yet.

639
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:47,622
That was the fast one.

640
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:49,256
Well, the paint job definitely
suffered on this one,

641
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,858
but I just hope the judges
can understand

642
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,894
- what I was goin' for.
- Yeah.

643
00:26:01,837 --> 00:26:05,606
Welcome to
the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

644
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:09,543
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

645
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:12,213
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

646
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:14,415
Owner of Optic Nerve

647
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,117
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

648
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:17,685
- Good evening, Glenn.
- Glenn.

649
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:19,954
Three-time Oscar-winning

650
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:21,155
- Gentlemen.
- Ve.

651
00:26:21,189 --> 00:26:22,590
- Hello, Ve.
- Hey, Ve.

652
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,925
Creature and concept designer,

653
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,927
- Hello, guys.
- Hi, Neville.

654
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,562
And joining us tonight

655
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:30,631
is a member of
the<i> Face Off</i> family.

656
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,967
She's an Academy Award-winning

and she won the Bafta

660
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,743
Please welcome back
Valli O'Reilly.

661
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:44,979
Hi.

662
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:47,782
I am such a fan of her work.

663
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,083
So this is the woman
to impress here.

664
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,184
Valli, great to see you again.

665
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:51,485
Good to see you too.

666
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,155
I'm excited to see what you guys
have come up with.

667
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:55,823
All right, this week,
your spotlight challenge

668
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:58,893
was to select
a special genetic trait

669
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,928
and use it
to create an original mutant

670
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:03,230
who physically manifests it.

671
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:04,865
So, let's take a look
at your mutants

672
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,367
while the audience
at home tweets

673
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:09,537
about their favorites
using #FaceOff.

674
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:34,829
It's got a cool paint job.

675
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,597
He's got those
awesome, big claws.

676
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:39,633
So I'm really happy
with what I've done.

677
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:03,363
He's got a strong profile,

678
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:06,716
and it's going
with the background,

679
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,386
so I think
he's a strong character.

680
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:32,108
I'm loving the size
of this thing.

681
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:33,643
It's looking very impressive.

682
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:37,680
I can't go home on this.
This is-- this is good.

683
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:58,734
At this point,
I just hope that the judges

684
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:00,536
appreciate my originality.

685
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,637
I'm not sure
if they're gonna get

686
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:02,838
what I was goin' for,

687
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:05,875
so I'm definitely
worried on this one.

688
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,532
This makeup was stressful
in the beginning,

689
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,567
but I'm happy with it.

690
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:53,256
It looks so creepy.

691
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,293
There's something about it
that just tells a story,

692
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,328
and I hope the judges get that.

693
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,601
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

694
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,637
at our mutants?

695
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:13,743
That's a nice claw.

696
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:14,878
Let's see how much
you can move your hands

697
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:17,514
- with those things.
- Wow.

698
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:19,516
That looks like
it's coming off.

699
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,651
One of these things looks like
it was coming off.

700
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,853
Oh, yeah.
That's startin' to fall apart.

701
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,522
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

702
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,858
Some really beautiful shapes.

703
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,426
The paint is tight, man.

704
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,861
He left himself a lot of time.

705
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,028
That must have been
the pre-paint.

706
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,097
- Yeah.
- Nice colors.

707
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:35,866
Thank you.

708
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,534
I don't get what this is.

709
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,135
Is it a hide or is--
it almost feels like

710
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,539
rock textures
being attempted in some places.

711
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:43,673
Do you think
there should have been

712
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,709
a little more definition
in the skin tone?

713
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,210
- For sure.
- You know, a little, uh--

714
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,478
It's very flat.

715
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,680
Thank you.

716
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,349
Wow.

717
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,185
It's like a blue turtle,
which is not a good thing.

718
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:56,453
Those are cool shapes.

719
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,922
They just need to be
emphasized with the color.

720
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:01,458
I'm worried about
what the judges are thinkin'.

721
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,893
I know there
are a lot of problems

722
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:06,296
and I could be going home.

723
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,398
Who made your favorite mutant?

724
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:11,434
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

725
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:15,986
Wow.
It's like a blue turtle.

726
00:31:16,021 --> 00:31:18,456
I didn't have a chance
to finish my paint job,

727
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,125
but hopefully the judges
will see what I was going for.

728
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,761
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

729
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:28,065
This is reminiscent
of Geiger work.

730
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,868
Are those teeth?

731
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:33,104
- Feels like it.
- That's cool.

732
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:35,773
Look at that.
This is all foam, guys.

733
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,508
It would have been so easy
to make the mistake

734
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,176
of making it bronze,

735
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:41,645
and there's so much flecking
and stuff to break it up.

736
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,450
Thank you.

737
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:48,719
I like this one much better
close up.

738
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:50,221
There's really nice color
transitions.

739
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:51,288
There's a lot of colors
in there,

740
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,556
- blending them together.
- Yeah.

741
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:54,525
- The eyes are really creepy.
- Yeah.

742
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,894
- You can see all that pink...
- Mm-hmm.

743
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,095
All throughout this paint job.

744
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,130
Yeah.
Beautiful.

745
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,165
Thank you.

746
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:07,138
The judges have scored
your creations,

747
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,507
so let's find out
what they thought.

748
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:12,777
Rashaad...

749
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:16,147
George...

750
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,882
The two of you are safe
this week

751
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,450
and can head back
to the makeup room.

752
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:22,486
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

753
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:29,193
The rest of you
are the best and the worst.

754
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,861
The judges would now
like to speak

755
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:32,830
with each of you to learn
more about your work.

756
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:35,466
Niko, please step forward.

757
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:45,042
Tell us about your concept

758
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,744
and how you worked
with your artist

759
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,012
to create this character.

760
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:51,382
The DNA that I got,
it was magnetism,

761
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,050
so we came up with this design

762
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:58,055
that he has all these coils
and generates all the magnetism.

763
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:01,025
It's gorgeous.

764
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:02,526
You went off
in your own direction

765
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:04,962
and integrated this coil idea.

766
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:06,463
I quite like that.

767
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:08,666
It's a very unique way to have
approached this challenge.

768
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,801
- Well done.
- Thank you.

769
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,336
I really like this character.

770
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,305
I love the metallic look of it.

771
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:16,707
You did a really magnificent
paint job.

772
00:33:16,741 --> 00:33:17,741
Nicely done, Niko.

773
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:19,109
Thank you so much.

774
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:21,846
It's a bit more
of a costume design

775
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,514
than it is a makeup design,

776
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:26,283
but it doesn't change
my opinion about it

777
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:28,018
being a really
good-looking character.

778
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:29,620
Thank you so much.

779
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:31,755
I really see how much time

780
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:34,892
and how meticulous you were
with your applications.

781
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:37,795
You did a great job
with this challenge.

782
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:39,597
Thank you so much.

783
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:42,633
Niko, if you'd please
step back.

784
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,571
- Good job, brother.
- Thank you.

785
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:50,608
Graham, please step forward.

786
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:58,549
Tell us how you got
the inspiration

787
00:33:58,583 --> 00:34:00,284
for your character.

788
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,519
I decided to play
with the naked mole rat look.

789
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:04,455
But at the same time,
I threw in, like,

790
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:06,690
the star-nosed mole just
to make it more interesting.

791
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:07,791
I got to tell you,

792
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:10,794
it's not one
of my favorite makeups.

793
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:13,097
I don't like the way
your cowl and your face piece,

794
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:14,498
they don't even blend together.

795
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:17,434
I don't think your hair work
was very well applied.

796
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,637
For me, this makeup
doesn't really work.

797
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:22,239
My biggest problem is

798
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:25,476
you did go with kind of
the most obvious choice,

799
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,644
and I just don't think

800
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,979
it actually
played out very well.

801
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,849
I wasn't sure it was a mole
when I first looked at it.

802
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:34,018
I thought it was
some kind of slug,

803
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:36,420
and the teeth pop out too much.

804
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:38,022
I might have chipped them
a little more

805
00:34:38,056 --> 00:34:39,657
to make them not come apart

806
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:42,326
from the rest of the character.

807
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,595
I hear that.

808
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:48,232
Graham, thank you very much.
If you'd please step back.

809
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:54,238
Tyler, please step forward.

810
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,579
Tell us about
your genetic mutation

811
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:04,615
and how it inspired
this creation.

812
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:05,950
When I sat down with my artist,

813
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:08,452
we were thinking of
some sort of fly or insect

814
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:09,787
that can crawl up a wall.

815
00:35:09,821 --> 00:35:11,555
I wanted to use
the little hairs

816
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,324
to make it look
like that's how this thing

817
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:15,893
could stick like a spider
on the wall or a fly.

818
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:17,394
It's really quite beautiful.

819
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:20,731
You've done such
a large-scale character,

820
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,700
and the thing that
I noted first

821
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:25,336
was just the beauty
in the face,

822
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,938
but particularly around
the nose and the mouth.

823
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:31,141
Congratulations.
It's really quite exceptional.

824
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,343
Thank you.

825
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:33,344
As soon as this thing
walked out,

826
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:35,879
I thought, "That is superb."

827
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:38,382
Immediately upon looking at it,

828
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,651
I can put together
its back-story

829
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:43,487
and that is so important
with a character like this.

830
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:46,023
It's exactly what I'm expecting
out of this challenge.

831
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:48,692
You nailed the quintessence
of mutation.

832
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:51,795
When I got up close,
I went, "Wow."

833
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,966
The paint job is
so well executed, so subtle.

834
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,668
I loved the really beautiful
layering

835
00:35:57,702 --> 00:36:00,471
of all those really
great, subtle colors.

836
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:02,339
It's those nuances
that make a makeup

837
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:03,474
really successful,

838
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,009
which I believe
you have really done.

839
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:08,445
- Thank you.
- Tyler, please step back.

840
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:15,219
Daran, if you'd
please come forward.

841
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:21,859
Tell me about your concept.

842
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,394
I chose the panoramic vision.

843
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:25,429
Instead of going literal,
with a bunch of eyeballs

844
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:26,697
or one huge eyeball in the back

845
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:27,965
I wanted to make
a spread-out thing

846
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,133
that looked like the eye

847
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:31,135
without the pupil or the iris.

848
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:33,771
And this would, like, pop out
when she needed to see.

849
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:36,140
So, I guess the white parts
that you had

850
00:36:36,174 --> 00:36:38,175
are supposed to be part
of the eyeball, right?

851
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:40,677
Yes, everything white
is supposed to be the eye.

852
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:41,979
I didn't get the message.

853
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:45,482
When I look
at what's presented,

854
00:36:45,517 --> 00:36:48,619
panoramic vision,
it didn't tell me that.

855
00:36:48,653 --> 00:36:52,122
Makeup-wise, this is
your weakest showing to date.

856
00:36:52,157 --> 00:36:55,626
I think that the anatomy
is really wonky on this.

857
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,462
Make sure that however cool
your design is,

858
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,963
when it walks out here,

859
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:02,499
it tells us what it is
that it's supposed to be.

860
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,935
You really have to turn
your game up at this point, man.

861
00:37:04,969 --> 00:37:06,603
Oh, yes.
I agree.

862
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,772
It doesn't look
like panoramic vision.

863
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:12,476
The ordinary person is not gonna
know what the heck you did.

864
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,578
You got to think
about that, honey.

865
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:15,779
You just can't just, like,

866
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:17,648
throw your weird ideas
out there

867
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:19,283
and hope that
they stick on the wall,

868
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,952
because, you know,
nobody's gonna really get it.

869
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:23,220
Okay.

870
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:26,256
Daran,
if you'd please head back.

871
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:31,528
All right, guys,
the judges have heard

872
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:32,796
what you have to say.

873
00:37:32,831 --> 00:37:33,864
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

874
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,032
while they deliberate.

875
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:38,068
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

876
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:42,806
All right, judges.

877
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:43,841
Why don't we talk about
the looks

878
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,309
we like the most this week?

879
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:46,443
Let's start with Niko.

880
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:48,245
I dug that makeup.

881
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,581
I love the antiqued quality
of it.

882
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,183
It was
an organic-looking makeup.

883
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:56,720
He had a big idea,
and he chose to focus

884
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,856
only on that which he could do.

885
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,391
It's one of Niko's
strongest works, for sure.

886
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:03,193
There was so much detail
in that makeup.

887
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:05,162
He must work fast.

888
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:06,964
All right.
Let's move onto Tyler.

889
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:08,999
The subtlety of that paint job,

890
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,534
it was so well handled.

891
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,669
And that really soft pink
around the eyes

892
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:14,505
was mimicked throughout
the makeup.

893
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:16,373
There was just
a lot of great decisions.

894
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:18,208
The fact that the hands
are all stretched out

895
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:20,344
felt like it was still
transforming.

896
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:22,779
Tyler's got
a really good sense of form.

897
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:24,781
When you got up close,
it had really

898
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,284
elegant, beautiful
little details

899
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:28,485
in its form language.

900
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,754
He followed
the challenge perfectly.

901
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,055
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

902
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,491
Let's move on to the looks
we liked the least.

903
00:38:34,526 --> 00:38:36,226
How about Graham?

904
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:39,229
I thought that tunneling
was such a great mutation,

905
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:41,665
but going with a mole rat

906
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:45,035
was just
the lowest hanging fruit.

907
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:47,538
It's, like,
the obvious, go-to thing.

908
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:50,807
He didn't follow the challenge
to the fullest.

909
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:52,976
His has suffered massively,
in my opinion,

910
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:55,379
from the obliteration
of the human form.

911
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:57,147
I did not empathize
with his character.

912
00:38:57,182 --> 00:38:58,448
I didn't want to know
more of its story

913
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:00,017
because I felt like
I knew its whole story.

914
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,852
It's a mole. It tunnels.
I get it.

915
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:03,120
And what about Daran?

916
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,089
It was so out of the box
conceptually

917
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:08,692
and it also wasn't
a beautiful makeup,

918
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:10,794
and this
is dangerous territory.

919
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:13,697
The question is, do we want
to see what he does next?

920
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,465
The notion of the sclera

921
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,668
creating this graphic mask
was kind of cool,

922
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:20,737
but just
the dark blue prosthetic--

923
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,806
- it was horrible.
- Yes.

924
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,341
It really was pretty,
pretty terrible.

925
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,043
Very pedestrian paint job.

926
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:28,078
It's so below
his normal skill level

927
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,013
that I'm kind of shocked
he brought it out.

928
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,449
So, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

929
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,184
- Yes, we have.
- Yeah.

930
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:37,221
Let's bring them back out.

931
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:43,760
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

932
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:46,863
Niko, we thought your sculpting

933
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:48,699
displayed
some impressive detail,

934
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:50,834
and the paint job
and the overall design

935
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,502
were really well handled.

936
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:55,405
Tyler, very cool idea to create

937
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,541
the character
mid-transformation,

938
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,409
and we thought that you
did an expert job

939
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:02,679
creating something
that evoked emotion.

940
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:05,816
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

941
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,853
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

942
00:40:13,531 --> 00:40:14,665
All right, Glenn,

943
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,266
who is the winner
of this challenge?

944
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:20,737
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

945
00:40:20,772 --> 00:40:22,773
Tyler.

946
00:40:26,544 --> 00:40:28,478
It is rare that
a character strikes

947
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,914
such a fine balance
between villainous

948
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:32,749
and empathetic.

949
00:40:32,784 --> 00:40:34,484
Astounding work tonight.

950
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:35,519
Thank you.

951
00:40:35,553 --> 00:40:37,521
Holy cow, I won again.

952
00:40:37,555 --> 00:40:40,357
I'm, like,
so honored and blessed.

953
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,792
Now it's getting close

954
00:40:41,826 --> 00:40:44,428
and I'm in top five,
so for the first time

955
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:45,962
I'm thinking,
"Maybe I could win this."

956
00:40:45,997 --> 00:40:47,698
Tyler, congratulations.

957
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:50,100
You and Niko can head back
to the makeup room.

958
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:51,172
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

959
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:53,550
- Good job.
- You're a monster, dude.

960
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,667
Thank you.

961
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:59,876
Unfortunately,
that means you two

962
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:01,445
are on the bottom this week,

963
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:04,348
and one of you
will be eliminated.

964
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:07,384
Please step forward.

965
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:14,758
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

966
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:18,462
Graham, though we did
like parts of your makeup,

967
00:41:18,496 --> 00:41:20,197
your concept was clearly

968
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:21,765
the first thing
that came to mind,

969
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:23,867
and that is rarely
the right path.

970
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,337
Daran, your concept
was wildly interesting,

971
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:29,306
but what you had in your head

972
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,708
just didn't translate
into the makeup.

973
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,610
We didn't get it visually.

974
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:35,779
So who is going home tonight?

975
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:39,816
The person going home
tonight is...

976
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,087
Graham.

977
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:45,722
As we get closer to the finale,

978
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:48,825
we're looking for truly
stand-out makeups.

979
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,796
Unfortunately, yours
was just too conventional.

980
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,364
That means Daran,
you are safe this week

981
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:56,133
and can head back
to the makeup room.

982
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,768
An absolute pleasure, brother.

983
00:41:57,802 --> 00:42:02,939
- Likewise, man.
- Thank you, guys.

984
00:42:02,974 --> 00:42:05,208
Graham, I'm confident
that we're gonna

985
00:42:05,243 --> 00:42:08,979
get to see the best from you
in the future professionally.

986
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:10,647
I love the chance
that you guys gave me.

987
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:12,149
Thanks a lot.

988
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:14,851
Graham, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

989
00:42:14,886 --> 00:42:18,088
It has been so great
having you here with us.

990
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:20,090
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

991
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:21,224
and pack up your kit.

992
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:23,126
- See you, guys.
- Thank you, Graham.

993
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:24,995
Good luck, honey.

994
00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:26,997
Yeah!

995
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:28,732
I don't have one regret.

996
00:42:28,766 --> 00:42:30,000
I've loved everything
that I've done

997
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:33,737
and I've had tons of fun
doing it all.

998
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:36,440
That's the end of Graham.

999
00:42:36,474 --> 00:42:38,775
I got to create
some great makeups

1000
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,578
and put them in front of
some really talented judges.

1001
00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:42,579
Yeah.

1002
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:44,014
Okay.

1003
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:46,883
I've proven to myself that
I know how to do this stuff,

1004
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:50,153
and I not only
can technically achieve it,

1005
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:52,556
but artistically as well.

1006
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,592
I feel like I can do
almost anything at this point.
