1
00:00:00,752 --> 00:00:01,819
This is really cool.

2
00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:04,021
It looks like a big blob
of Silly Putty.

3
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:06,023
You've got a beautiful piece.

4
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:07,891
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:10,094
In a season of new extremes,

6
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:11,962
15 talented makeup artists

7
00:00:11,997 --> 00:00:14,798
competed in a classic
fairy-tale challenge.

8
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,800
Chloe's undersea beast
earned her a victory...

9
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:22,306
and Margaret was sent home.

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,842
Now 14 artists remain,

11
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,610
and tonight they'll face
a challenge

12
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:28,779
- of interplanetary intrigue.
- Yes!

13
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:31,882
I want to make something
that nobody's ever seen.

14
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,817
But some will crack
under the pressure.

15
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:35,773
I am kind of having
a hard time.

16
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,000
_

17
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:39,423
Please, just make a decision
and get it done.

18
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,325
I'm afraid that
I'm gonna make a mistake.

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,426
I need to not look at it
for a second.

20
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,328
- Okay.
- We don't have time

21
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:45,796
to play around.

22
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,698
This whole thing was
so impressive.

23
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:50,067
- You guys did some weird stuff.
- Here's the bad part--

24
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,769
- I'm thinking,
"I'm going home."

25
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:54,371
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

26
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:55,506
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

27
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,009
to one of their
85 international locations,

28
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:01,845
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

29
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,747
and $100,000.

30
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:06,116
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

31
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,955
<i>Face off!</i>

32
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,358

34
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:06,476
- How you doing?
- So-so.

35
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,695
I feel bad about Margaret
that left, you know?

36
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,315
Yeah, it sucked last night,
for sure.

37
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,768
I feel guilty,
like I'm responsible.

38
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,019
I took full responsibility,

39
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,005
but the judges made
their final decision,

40
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,456
and it was Margaret.

41
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,260
So, you know, what happened
is in the past now,

42
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:24,978
but I'm gonna try to do my best
on the next makeup

43
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:26,814
to make sure that I don't end up
on the bottom again.

44
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:27,965
- Right on.
- Thanks.

45
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,967
Instead of squandering
this opportunity,

46
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:33,270
I'm just gonna keep doing
what I think is right.

47
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,448
- Oh, my God.
- We're at this farm,

48
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,600
and we're walking down
this dirt road...

49
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:47,885
You first.

50
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,654
- ...and we walk into a cornfield.
- Whoa-ho-ho.

51
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:52,956
And this is pretty cool.

52
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,558
Where are we?

53
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:58,979
Oh, man.

54
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,999
There's this blank space
in the cornfield,

55
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,100
and there's McKenzie

56
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:05,702
in the middle
of all these briefcases.

57
00:03:05,737 --> 00:03:08,105
I'm like, "Hmm."

58
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,208
- Awesome.
- Hey, guys!

59
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,376
Hi!

60
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,311
I'm sure glad you found me
out here.

61
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:15,946
So, whether it's UFO sightings,

62
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,383
abductions, or even
the remarkable construction

63
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:22,385
of Stonehenge and the pyramids,
humans have long sought

64
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:26,023
the answer to one
of life's greatest mysteries--

65
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:27,591
are we alone in the universe?

66
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,692
- I don't know.
- Oh, yeah!

67
00:03:28,726 --> 00:03:30,427
In case you haven't noticed,

68
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:32,713
you're currently standing in
the middle of what many believe

69
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:36,567
to be one of the telltale signs
of life on other planets--

70
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,635
a crop circle.

71
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,670
Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:42,105
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,707
I'm pretty familiar
with crop circles.

74
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:47,578
I love UFO conspiracies,
so I'm very, very stoked.

75
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:49,046
So, in the last 30 years,

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,716
over 10,000 crop circles
have appeared around the world.

77
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,686
Now, while government agencies
like the CIA and Interpol

78
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,688
officially consider
these hoaxes,

79
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:59,656
conspiracy theorists believe

80
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:02,092
that they're actually
intergalactic distress signals

81
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,728
from alien civilizations.

82
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,330
And that, my friends,
is the basis

83
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:08,031
for this week's
spotlight challenge.

84
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,667
- Oh, yes.
- Whoo!

85
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:11,835
I love aliens.

86
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,304
There are so many different ways
this could go,

87
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,690
and my creative juices
are really starting to flow.

88
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:19,142
Inside each of these briefcases

89
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,078
is an aerial photo
of a crop circle,

90
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:24,147
along with a dire message that
the aliens may have been trying

91
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,133
- to communicate to us.
- Sweet.

92
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,985
So, working in teams of two,

93
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,404
your spotlight challenge is
to choose a briefcase

94
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:33,223
and create the life-form that
could have sent the message.

95
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,659
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice, nice.

96
00:04:35,693 --> 00:04:39,730
Your randomly selected
teams are Niko and Corinne,

97
00:04:39,764 --> 00:04:41,281
Chloe and Graham,

98
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:44,001
George, Bethany,

99
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,454
Tess and Daniel...

100
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,040
Cat and Matt,

101
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:52,009
Daran and Tanner...

102
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,844
All right.

103
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,046
Of course,
then Rashaad and Tyler.

104
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,016
Yes!

105
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,020
Please stand
next to your new teammate.

106
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,572
Now it's time to choose
your briefcases.

107
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,491
Niko and Corinne,
you're up first.

108
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:15,032
"We need water."

109
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:20,537
"Gravity changing."

110
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:25,309
"Polluted,
toxic environment."

111
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,247
"Our sun is dying."

112
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:34,551
We have
"Ice caps melting."

113
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:37,788
"Overcome with disease."

114
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,125
"Global famine."

115
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,493
Make sure the judges see

116
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,629
evidence of your aliens'
dire circumstances

117
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:46,997
in the final makeup.

118
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:50,367
All right, time to get started.
Good luck.

119
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,502
Bye.

120
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:56,073
- "Toaders."
- "Toaders"!

121
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:57,074
Rashaad and I come up
with a name,

122
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,843
"The Toaders,"
from planet Toad.

123
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,328
When they eat,
they could fill up.

124
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,213
- Mm-hmm.
- These guys are gluttons,

125
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:04,381
and they send out

126
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,583
this false message
to other planets that,

127
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,385
"We're hungry.
We need food."

128
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,705
When those civilizations give
them the okay to come in,

129
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,191
they just take over
and consume everything.

130
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:16,026
So they're a greedy,
greedy race.

131
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,528
One of the greediest.

132
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,032
I'd want it to look like
an alien sore.

133
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,167
Maybe, like, fungus
was growing on them

134
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:25,769
instead of just, like,
a big boil.

135
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,406
Our concept is, a team of aliens
have crash-landed on our planet,

136
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,809
and the fungus on our planet
takes them over.

137
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,578
Cool alien with cool skin?

138
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:38,248
- That's really gonna sell it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

139
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:40,384
We're gonna do
some melting face, right?

140
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:41,435
With the skin peeled off,
you know?

141
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,171
Mm-hmm.
I think it will be pretty veiny.

142
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:46,406
We have "Polluted
and toxic environment,"

143
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:50,193
and our character is a gatherer

144
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:51,895
who goes out
into the wastelands

145
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:54,664
and gets things she can
to bring back to her people.

146
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:55,799
And the respirator...

147
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,502
Will at least be married
into the neck.

148
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:03,006
- We can do a cowl.
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,243
Um, maybe not a full cowl
into the shoulders?

150
00:07:06,277 --> 00:07:08,378
Our alien
looks really sunken in

151
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:11,148
because he's
from a really dry planet.

152
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,983
So we're going to incorporate

153
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,952
a cracking in the back
of the cowl to make it appear

154
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:18,422
that the alien is dry.

155
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:24,261
Um, so we have the possibility
of goggles, tribal tattoos,

156
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:25,762
dried mud to help
keep them cool.

157
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,231
We have dry skin texture.
What do you think?

158
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:30,267
Uh, I'm not in love
with the goggle idea.

159
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,853
Matt's so iffy
about the design,

160
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,337
and we spent
so much time talking,

161
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:36,106
we didn't get
a clear concept drawn.

162
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,774
So I know when we get
to the lab,

163
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,427
it's gonna be a little hard.

164
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,180
All right, everyone,
let's go back to the lab!

165
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:49,853
So we get back to the lab.

166
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,506
We got five hours
of work today.

167
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,057
We pick our models

168
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,493
and start figuring
this thing out.

169
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:57,994
Tanner and I hit it off
right out of the gate.

170
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:00,363
We're feeling pretty good about
partnering up with each other.

171
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:03,266
You'll have to see if you can
just keep up here with me.

172
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:04,801
I want to try to make something
that nobody's ever seen.

173
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,970
So our alien eats through
the fingers,

174
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,606
and because our message is
the "Ice caps are melting,"

175
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,775
their land is getting flooded,
and therefore their food

176
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:13,376
and nutrients are being
flooded over.

177
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,178
So I figure there's
a filtering system

178
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,948
that would kill any bacteria
through their fingers.

179
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:19,900
Get some water handy.
Dump it.

180
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:22,652
Since the hands are gonna be
such an important part,

181
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:26,039
we just started mixing up
this huge batch of alginate,

182
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,491
and I dip my hands in there

183
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:28,925
and just keep them really still

184
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,594
so we can get a positive
of my hands

185
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:33,580
so that I can sculpt on
so that we can make gloves.

186
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:36,116
- You ready to break free?
- Once it's finally done,

187
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,235
I just wiggle and slip
my hands out.

188
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,686
We just mix up
a little batch of 1630,

189
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,606
dump it in each hand, and then
we just wait till it cures.

190
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,141
And we got hands.

191
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:47,878
And then I can finally start
sculpting my hands.

192
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:49,446
So they go
in the same direction,

193
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,848
let's give it a feeling.

194
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:54,151
The whole thing's looking good.

195
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:57,053
I'm sculpting the face
and the gross skin texture,

196
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,556
and George
is blocking out the cowl.

197
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,892
We're gonna show
that it's a toxic environment

198
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:04,895
by putting boils and burns
on her skin.

199
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,096
We are synchronized.

200
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:14,688
So we're still sticking
with the big ear?

201
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,006
Are we pronouncing the brow

202
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,175
a little bit more
kind of thing or...?

203
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,843
Because me and Matt
didn't decide

204
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:22,479
on a clear-cut design
before we got to the lab,

205
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:24,981
we're both kind of figuring it
out in the clay.

206
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:28,118
Their skin has evolved darker
because of the sun.

207
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,286
I agree.

208
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,388
So we decide to go
with an expanding sun

209
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,956
for the "Sun is dying" theme.

210
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,359
So we want a tribal,
African creature

211
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:41,164
with ears really big
as a way to cool them off.

212
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,736
I dig on science fiction,

213
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,355
and I'm teamed up with Chloe,

214
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:50,707
who won the last challenge,
so I'm at ease.

215
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:53,743
For our alien,
we get "Gravity's changing."

216
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:55,579
I'm thinking,
the gravity is expanding,

217
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:58,648
so this alien's features
should be stretched out.

218
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:00,734
Just try to push
all those forms.

219
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:03,270
Graham really wants to get
the face ready to run in foam

220
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:05,605
so that we can match it up
to the cowl.

221
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,424
I'm gonna try for that,
but I want to make the face

222
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:13,063
as perfect as possible
because it is the focal point.

223
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,334
Rashaad is sculpting the face,

224
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,702
and I'm sculpting
the whole cowl,

225
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:21,838
and we got to get that face
piece molded immediately.

226
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,540
If we get it out today,

227
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:25,091
tomorrow it's one less thing
I have to worry about.

228
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,177
- I love that. Love that.
- Thank you.

229
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,678
_

230
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,130
You need to tell me those
things sooner than later...

231
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,781
- Okay.
- Because you're only hurting

232
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,617
both of us by keeping
your mouth shut.

233
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,353
We both keep kind of trying
to change things,

234
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:37,520
figure it out as we go,

235
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:38,955
but we're losing so much time,

236
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,790
and I'm starting to get
a little worried

237
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:43,360
that our concept is reading
way too animal.

238
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:48,061
_

239
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,517
There's aspects
of the cowl, ears, and face

240
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:51,935
that Cat's not happy about.

241
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:54,471
I don't want to get too far
into this and be like,

242
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:56,539
"It's-- it's crap."

243
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,608
It's obvious
that we haven't talked enough

244
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,644
about what we want
out of this whole creature.

245
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:02,379
I'm just trying to see
where you're going with it.

246
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:05,165
I'm still really, really uneasy
about our concept.

247
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,050
I really don't want to go home,

248
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:09,552
not this early in the game.

249
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,754
Coming up...

250
00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:13,290
Her indecisiveness
is making me nervous.

251
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,383
_

252
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:16,192
_

253
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:17,827
This is not good.
I'm going home.

254
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:19,396
This is an impressive makeup.

255
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,530
Who did all the painting?

256
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:23,099
I didn't agree
with some of the decisions.

257
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:35,066
_

258
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,952
Today is the first day
of our alien challenge,

259
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:39,738
and I'm not feeling
very confident on our alien.

260
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:41,840
I'm starting to get
a little worried

261
00:11:41,874 --> 00:11:44,509
that our concept
is reading way too animal.

262
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:46,428
Cat's not happy
about our design,

263
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:47,996
so we're hoping
that Michael Westmore

264
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,283
will have some good advice
on how to keep it alien.

265
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:01,076
- Hey, guys!
- Hey.

266
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,394
We're here
for a walk-through.

267
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:04,279
- How are you?
- Hey!

268
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:05,747
- Hey, Tess, Daniel.
- Hi.

269
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:07,882
So tell us
what crop circle you got

270
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,751
and what the message was.

271
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:11,052
That's our crop circle,

272
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,854
and our message was
"Overcome with disease."

273
00:12:12,888 --> 00:12:14,105
Okay.

274
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,308
Our alien is going to have
a disease from mold.

275
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,826
We're actually going to have

276
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,210
some mushrooms and stuff
coming out as mold.

277
00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:21,079
I think the painting would
be very important with that,

278
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,031
otherwise it's gonna look
like tumors or growths...

279
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,449
- Right.
- And different sizes.

280
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,285
Make sure you have some,
you know, some Portobellos...

281
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,254
- Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah.
- And, uh, some Shiitakes...

282
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:31,539
- Yeah.
- That's what we plan on doing.

283
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:33,041
Our biggest worry is that

284
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:34,976
you're gonna think we made an
animal hybrid and not an alien.

285
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,679
Like, right now it is reading
pretty much animal hybrid.

286
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:38,897
What could they do?

287
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,682
I think you're being
too subtle.

288
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:41,750
Maybe bigger cheekbones

289
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,319
or change
your ear configuration.

290
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:45,804
Like a conical shape?

291
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:47,188
- Yeah.
- Great.

292
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:49,824
And we were thinking of going
with a darker-skin base.

293
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,426
Uh, don't get black.

294
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,961
All of a sudden,
it becomes a silhouette.

295
00:12:52,995 --> 00:12:54,329
- You lose the detail.
- Yeah.

296
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:55,330
Awesome.

297
00:12:55,364 --> 00:12:57,699
These guys
are basically gluttons.

298
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,801
They go to different planets
and take over

299
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:01,169
and eat all the food
that's there,

300
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:02,537
and then they have to move on.

301
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:04,306
Make sure you stay away
from flesh tones.

302
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,440
Yeah.

303
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,075
I mean, you can
be creative with this,

304
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:09,243
like even cutting stencils
and airbrushing spots on it.

305
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,411
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:11,946
So many frogs have those spots
on them and everything.

307
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:13,448
I think you've got
a great start.

308
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:14,916
Thank you.

309
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,318
He's going through dehydration?

310
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:18,753
Yes.

311
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,655
I don't think you're really
selling the concept,

312
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:22,290
having it so smooth.

313
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:24,192
Your character looks hydrated.

314
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:25,927
This crackling you're doing
along here

315
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,862
needs to be much deeper, okay?

316
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:29,264
- All right.
- Okay.

317
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:30,998
Color-wise,
are you going to metallize?

318
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:32,367
So this is all gonna
be gunmetal,

319
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:36,271
and then these lines between
are gonna be dark red.

320
00:13:36,305 --> 00:13:39,441
Areas down in here, you could,
even with a little silver,

321
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,743
- just dry-brush some areas.
- Oh, yeah.

322
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,311
And it'll make
your metal pop out.

323
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,713
- Mm-hmm.
- Great. Thank you.

324
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:47,148
All right, guys,
we're heading out. Good luck.

325
00:13:47,183 --> 00:13:49,784
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

326
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,144
Around the eyes,
what do you want me to do?

327
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:00,962
- Just a little black?
- Black, yes, sir.

328
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:02,497
Rashaad is finished
with the face,

329
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:05,166
so I decide to mold it.

330
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,671
And Rashaad can start putting
some details

331
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:12,140
into the cowl
just like his face,

332
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:13,541
so we can have
more of a cohesive feel.

333
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:16,745
- It's exactly how I pictured it.
- Cool.

334
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:20,148
I'm sculpting the cowl,
and it's looking great.

335
00:14:20,182 --> 00:14:21,699
I'm actually getting
pretty impressed

336
00:14:21,751 --> 00:14:23,785
by the way I'm able to elongate
all this anatomy.

337
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:25,820
I'm thinking the vertebrae
starts getting stretched

338
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,939
- up into the skull.
- That would be really cool.

339
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:30,658
I would prefer to get
this face molded today,

340
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:33,795
but I'd rather Chloe be happy
with her design

341
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,163
than to rush her through this.

342
00:14:35,197 --> 00:14:36,631
Six minutes.

343
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,188
By the end of the day,

344
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,540
I still haven't finished
sculpting the face piece.

345
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,258
Time!

346
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:49,911
Tomorrow I'll look more
at what Graham's got going on

347
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:51,629
and try and kind of
match it up,

348
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,048
but I definitely need
to move faster

349
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:56,284
so it's ready in time for foam.

350
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:07,962
It's day two, and we have
9 1/2 hours in the lab.

351
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:09,864
We just got to hit
the ground running.

352
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:11,566
Time is flying, no time.

353
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,502
Daran needs to finish
fine-tuning the face,

354
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,404
and I need to get
these hands done.

355
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,473
We need to get
these things molded

356
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:20,642
and then start on the cowl.

357
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,811
I like it!

358
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:24,345
It's looking sweet.

359
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,814
After we speak
with Mr. Westmore,

360
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:27,649
we're seeing
the alien aspects come out.

361
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,501
I say, "I'll paint it,"
but I mean,

362
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,035
"We'll talk about it."

363
00:15:31,086 --> 00:15:32,954
We're pretty sure
that if we paint this properly,

364
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:34,923
the alien forms will pop out.

365
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,941
I'm gonna start prepping
my station for the mold.

366
00:15:36,976 --> 00:15:38,309
Cool.

367
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:46,484
I finally finish sculpting
the face.

368
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,970
Graham's going to do
all of the molding.

369
00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:51,473
I'm glad I got extra time
to make it better.

370
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,774
Do you feel like
we're ahead of schedule?

371
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:55,777
No.

372
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,278
Our character has these weights

373
00:15:57,313 --> 00:16:00,615
on her wrists and her ankles
to keep her from floating away.

374
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:04,385
So I'm working on them.

375
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,689
Vacuforming
doesn't really work out,

376
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:09,624
so now I'm gonna mess
with some L200

377
00:16:09,658 --> 00:16:11,893
and see if that will work.

378
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:13,811
Chloe keeps changing
her decision,

379
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:15,897
so it's making me worry.

380
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:19,867
Are we gonna get these done?

381
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:22,603
So, as soon as I finish
the cowl, I start molding,

382
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:24,072
and Bethany starts doing props.

383
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,808
We want to create a respirator

384
00:16:26,842 --> 00:16:29,611
to show that she can't breathe
the air outside.

385
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,347
So, for the respirator piece,
we use this stuff

386
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:35,083
called epoxy putty,
and it's a plumber's putty.

387
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:37,785
The only thing with that is
you have to work really fast

388
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,888
because it sets very quickly.

389
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:41,639
All we have to figure out
from there

390
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,324
is how she can breathe in it.

391
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,733
I think I've kind of
just lost my, uh...

392
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,268
my sight for doing this ear.

393
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:54,485
Matt's having
a really hard time

394
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,970
figuring out
how to mold our cowl

395
00:16:56,005 --> 00:16:57,739
because it has
these really huge ears.

396
00:16:57,773 --> 00:17:00,942
You don't think this is gonna
be sturdy enough to do this?

397
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,961
- No.
- There's-- there's--

398
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:05,446
- The angle's really scary too,
you know?

399
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:06,564
Finding the right place

400
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,066
to put the dividing wall
is very crucial.

401
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,286
If you mess that up, it can
totally mess up your mold.

402
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,554
You won't be able to open it.

403
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:13,855
Do you mind just taking over
for a minute?

404
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:14,989
I need to not look at it
for a second.

405
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:16,507
Okay, totally fine.
Yeah.

406
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:18,209
I'm getting a little flustered
with it,

407
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,862
and I'm afraid
that if I keep looking at it,

408
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:22,580
I'm gonna make a mistake.

409
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:24,215
Matt is just a nervous wreck.

410
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:28,303
Oh, well, we don't have time
to play around.

411
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:32,239
As I'm making these weights,

412
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:35,510
I'm realizing
that the L200 isn't working.

413
00:17:35,544 --> 00:17:36,911
It's just kind of messy.

414
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:38,263
I feel like I can't figure out

415
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,348
what I'm gonna do about this
to make it work.

416
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:42,850
It's looking more like jewelry.

417
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:46,387
They need to look like
they're contraptions

418
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:48,806
rather than jewelry.

419
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:50,224
It's not really going

420
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:53,061
the way that I was hoping
that it would go.

421
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:55,630
Chloe is really struggling
with her design.

422
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,166
Please, just make a decision
and get it done.

423
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,333
_

424
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,169
Okay, sculpt them.

425
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,839
_

426
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,741
I have a picture in my head,

427
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:10,161
but for whatever reason,
I can't get it out.

428
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,814
I have to have these weights,
because without it,

429
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:16,084
my makeup isn't going to make
any sense.

430
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
_

431
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,549
Okay, sculpt them.

432
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,751
It's day two
of the alien challenge,

433
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:29,220
and Chloe is supposed
to be making gravity weights,

434
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:32,273
but her indecisiveness
is making me nervous.

435
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,275
_

436
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:37,094
Please, just make a decision
and get it done.

437
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:39,230
The weights are
an important part of our design

438
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:42,266
because they keep her
from floating away.

439
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,102
But I'm just not sure
what I want,

440
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,738
and we're starting
to run out of time.

441
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:50,541
So I'm just trying to get
this done at this point.

442
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:54,712
Rashaad is fabricating
some armor,

443
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:56,030
some plates,
and things like that

444
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,983
to make our alien
look gargantuan and nasty.

445
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:00,117
And I come up
with these little arms

446
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:02,003
to help our Toader
eat and eat and eat.

447
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:04,505
- Lookit, lookit, look at that.
- Look at how perfect, yo.

448
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,842
Fuck yeah!

449
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,084
You make the mushrooms.
I make the kit.

450
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:21,873
Daniel and I have our sculptures
molded and ready for foam.

451
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,775
Now he has to hop
on the mushrooms,

452
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:25,977
and I got to get
that medipack done.

453
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,945
Daniel molds the mushrooms
in silicone

454
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,315
so that we can run them
in a rigid foam tomorrow.

455
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,683
That way, we're gonna be able

456
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:36,053
to have the mushrooms
sprouting out from all over.

457
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,288
That'll look cool.

458
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,681
I finish sculpting plate molds

459
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:50,468
with the texture
of the weights in them.

460
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:53,137
Now I'm gonna bring them over
to Graham for the molding.

461
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:55,556
- Oh, those are cool.
- Sorry that took so long.

462
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,192
I look at the sculpts,
and I think,

463
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:00,695
"This probably could have been
done in five minutes in L200."

464
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:02,396
But, hey,
at least we have something.

465
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:03,564
I'm molding it.

466
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,516
We're gonna use it,
so I'm happy.

467
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,952
I'm gonna keep cleaning out
that mold.

468
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:09,237
- Okay.
- You jump on those hands

469
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:12,623
- and finish them up?
- Yeah.

470
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,458
So cool, dude.

471
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:16,077
It looks cool.

472
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:17,428
So it's almost the end
of the day,

473
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:20,915
and I notice Rashaad and Tyler's
really awesome alien,

474
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,834
and it's gonna be quite big.

475
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:25,169
And I'm like, "I don't think
we're gonna be in top votes."

476
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:28,155
Are you thinking any lights
for this character?

477
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,341
Lights?

478
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,109
Niko is questioning
if we're going big enough,

479
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:35,213
and I tell him to,
"Just stop judging yourself

480
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:37,498
based on what other people
are doing,

481
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,483
and let's trust our ideas."

482
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:43,154
All right, everyone,
that's time!

483
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:45,923
I know our alien
will not be very big.

484
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:49,293
So I hope Corinne and I will not
look bad for the judges.

485
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,005
Let's check it out, check it out,
check it out, check it out.

486
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,624
Today is application day,
and we got four hours to apply

487
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:05,509
and one hour for last looks.

488
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,280
The first thing we do
is check out our foam pieces.

489
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,666
- Oh, my God.
- All right?

490
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,117
Look, it's all ripped.

491
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,186
The whole cowl-- it's totally
ripped in the middle,

492
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,354
all the way to the chin.

493
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:19,090
And that's actually
my responsibility, my piece.

494
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:21,609
- Fuck, man.
- Yeah, "Fuck, man."

495
00:21:21,643 --> 00:21:23,511
That's right.
I'm going home.

496
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:24,845
That's it.

497
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,681
'Cause we're not doing
something very big.

498
00:21:26,715 --> 00:21:29,300
So, on top of that,
having it ripped,

499
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:31,519
- it's like, "Come on."
- How's the rest of it?

500
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,737
The back is okay.

501
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:35,656
We have to figure out
how to save this.

502
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:37,692
It's okay.

503
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:42,280
- How we doing? How we doing?
- All right.

504
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:49,153
- Matt?
- Yeah.

505
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:50,104
- I'm Dan. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

506
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:51,422
You're gonna be
the mighty Toader.

507
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,257
The Toaders are coming.

508
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,042
Ooh, I like the ears on it.

509
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:56,994
All right, all right,
all right!

510
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:00,064
Before I can apply, I have
to fabricate the mushrooms.

511
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:03,401
I pour rigid foam into my mold,

512
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:07,338
and I wait for that to set up
in about ten minutes,

513
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:09,140
and then I have the mushrooms,

514
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:12,126
which are pretty awesome
at this point.

515
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,581
There we go.

516
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:23,621
I make these protrusions
on the outside of the face.

517
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:24,655
They're made out of gelatin,

518
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,190
to give a different feel
to the alien.

519
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:28,592
I've never put gelatin
and foam together,

520
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:29,961
so it's a little bit scary,

521
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:31,112
but we're supposed to be going
bold and extreme,

522
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,730
so I'm gonna try
something new here

523
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:34,365
and see if gelatin
will stick to foam.

524
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,785
Perfection!

525
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:40,204
Release the Toad.

526
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:42,272
Can you just turn
your head towards me?

527
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,343
Corinne is doing a really good
job with the painting,

528
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:49,263
and I'm actually really excited
over what I'm looking.

529
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:54,185
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, this is ugly.

530
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:55,519
I'm really sweating it here.

531
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:58,055
You know what?
I'm making a wound here, okay?

532
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,824
Just like a huge crack
happened here.

533
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:02,393
Maybe some toxic liquid
jump into it

534
00:23:02,427 --> 00:23:03,995
and melted the helmet here,

535
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,197
and she's all wounded
and melted skin and everything.

536
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,398
Let's make that wound with a--

537
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:08,632
- Third degree?
- Yeah.

538
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,484
I think that'll be faster
than applying.

539
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,269
- Yeah.
- Stand up for me.

540
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:14,939
Matt's really confident in his
ability to paint dark skin tone.

541
00:23:14,973 --> 00:23:16,640
Okay, chin up for me,
like that.

542
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:19,377
I look up, and I'm like, "Whoa.

543
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:20,911
This is looking
a little bit muddy."

544
00:23:20,946 --> 00:23:22,546
His head gets a dark color

545
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,348
over top of everything
I just did.

546
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:25,883
Is it supposed to be like that?

547
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,235
Mr. Westmore warned us
against going too dark,

548
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,571
but I don't think
we're taking his advice.

549
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:31,756
I'm a little worried right now.

550
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,657
Cat's not happy
with the paint job,

551
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:35,826
and there's lots of things
I really want to change,

552
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,763
but it's too late, so I'm gonna
do my best to move forward.

553
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:41,265
How much time we got?

554
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:44,085
- 19 minutes.
- 19 minutes?

555
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:49,807
♪ madness,
madness, madness, madness ♪

556
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,075
So I'm a little nervous.

557
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:53,094
We still have to do a lot
of painting on the face,

558
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:55,912
and we got only one hour
to finish this in last looks.

559
00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:56,981
We need some more sickness
in the eyes.

560
00:23:57,015 --> 00:23:58,733
We have to go in it
with the color too.

561
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,184
That looks awful.

562
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:02,303
George is nervous
because of the rips,

563
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:06,624
but you never know
what the judges are thinking.

564
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:07,691
That's time, people!

565
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:10,277
Brushes down!
That's time!

566
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:13,397
George and I are feeling
pretty stressed now.

567
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:17,301
This is not where we wanted
to be before last looks.

568
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,270
Coming up.

569
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:20,771
I'm gonna push it up a little
bit more into your gums.

570
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:22,440
Oh, no, they're gonna know

571
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:24,141
that it's a ripped cowl.
I'm going home.

572
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,644
This whole thing
was so impressive.

573
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,012
You're pushing the envelope.

574
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:29,847
I didn't agree
with some of the painting.

575
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:33,017
Here's the bad part--
It's not gonna cut it.

576
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,924
Let's make it happen!

577
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,627
It's last looks,
and we have one hour,

578
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:48,028
and I am freaking out a lot

579
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:50,597
because we still have
so much painting to do.

580
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:53,750
She just has a base coat
and some light highlights,

581
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:57,538
so we both attack the face
as hard as we can.

582
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,010
We need to be in, like,
super final details

583
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,461
in the next 20 minutes.

584
00:25:04,495 --> 00:25:06,179
We have to fix this paint job.

585
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,615
I feel like the paint
is a little too far gone,

586
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:10,117
but I do my best.

587
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:12,286
We got 30 minutes, guys!

588
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,322
I'm gonna push it up a little
bit more into your gums.

589
00:25:15,356 --> 00:25:17,558
Can you get some shadow colors?

590
00:25:20,094 --> 00:25:22,296
That's time, everybody!
Good job!

591
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,197
She's gorgeous.

592
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,882
Thank you.
You were a trouper, man.

593
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:27,401
He looks really good up close.

594
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:29,603
It's not as bold and extreme
as it probably should be,

595
00:25:29,637 --> 00:25:31,722
but it's not
a solid brown color,

596
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,673
so I'm happy with what it is.

597
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:35,042
I feel good.

598
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:47,955
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

599
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:50,591
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

600
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,493
First, let's say hello to our
talented panel of judges--

601
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:56,563
owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick...

602
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,382
- Good evening.
- Hey.

603
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,984
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

604
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:02,803
- Hello.
- Hi.

605
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,905
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page...

606
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,174
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

607
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,525
And joining our panel tonight

608
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:10,527
is a writer, producer,
and director

609
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:14,514
whose work includes
<i>Priest, Dark Skies, Legion,</i>

610
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:18,151
and SyFy's <i>Defiance,</i>
returning this spring.

611
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:21,088
Please give a warm welcome
to Scott Stewart.

612
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:24,591
Thank you.

613
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,827
Scott, thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

614
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:28,195
It's my pleasure.

615
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:29,980
Looking forward to seeing
what you guys come up with.

616
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:31,348
Scott has done amazing work.

617
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,916
And if anybody knows aliens,

618
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,267
it's definitely gonna be
this guy.

619
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,053
All right, guys, this week
your spotlight challenge

620
00:26:36,104 --> 00:26:39,306
was to use a crop circle
and its decoded distress signal

621
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,743
to inspire
an original alien creation.

622
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:44,511
Let's take a look
at your new life-forms.

623
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:10,036
She looks awesome.

624
00:27:10,054 --> 00:27:11,771
It's retro.
It's female.

625
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:15,909
It's also kind of eerie-looking,
but also kind of sexy, I'd say.

626
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,196
We think
she's absolutely beautiful--

627
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,198
completely different
than everybody else's,

628
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:40,500
so we're very happy.

629
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:58,919
He looks amazing.

630
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:00,303
We're thinking we're tops,

631
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:02,255
even possible in the run
for a win.

632
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:22,676
I'm pretty amazed
at what we were able to do

633
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,910
in the last hour,

634
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,812
and I'm pretty happy
with the overall look.

635
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,168
I'm really happy
with everything.

636
00:28:48,202 --> 00:28:49,553
Tess-- she's happy.
She's smiling.

637
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:52,038
And I think that all in all,
we pulled it together

638
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:55,142
and did a really good job.

639
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:15,061
I'm feeling
a little bit better.

640
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,396
I think my biggest worry

641
00:29:16,414 --> 00:29:18,031
is that our concept's
not that original,

642
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:20,801
but it came together.

643
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,754
I love the way he looks.

644
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:45,058
Not like a big, huge monster--
he looks like a piece of art.

645
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:53,517
Judges, it's time to have
a closer look at our aliens.

646
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:00,907
Oh, interesting.

647
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:03,577
- Can you move your fingers?
- Very clever.

648
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:05,349
_

649
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,410
_

650
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,681
I like the way
they've integrated

651
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,215
the silver tones in there.

652
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,585
Yeah, it gives it texture
and depth.

653
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,977
This is
a very advanced concept,

654
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,496
using gelatin
integrated with foam latex.

655
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,698
It's creepy.

656
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:25,999
- Yeah.
- It freaks me out.

657
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,901
Hey--
Oh, little lights in there.

658
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:30,470
Thanks.

659
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:35,475
Just really nice forms.

660
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:38,511
This is separating pretty bad
on his chest here, these edges.

661
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:40,247
Thank you.

662
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:47,020
That paint work feels like
a bad watercolor painting.

663
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,556
Tilt your head back.

664
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,225
Oh, no, they're gonna know
that it's a ripped cowl.

665
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,827
These guys are expert,
so they know.

666
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:56,329
This is not good.
I'm thinking, "I'm going home."

667
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,367
Who made your favorite

668
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,669
crop-circle-inspired alien
tonight?

669
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:05,571
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

670
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:11,072
That paint work feels like
a bad watercolor painting.

671
00:31:11,107 --> 00:31:13,108
The judges go up close
to the makeups,

672
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:15,777
and honestly, I'm thinking,
"I'm going home."

673
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:20,282
I wonder about the decision

674
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:24,986
to leave all of these
huge surfaces devoid of paint.

675
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:27,989
It seems like the beginnings
of a really cool idea.

676
00:31:28,024 --> 00:31:30,225
Cool.
Thank you.

677
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:33,445
This is another one
of those makeups

678
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,897
where they didn't do
a good paint job,

679
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:39,167
so you can't even highlight
the work that they did do.

680
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:42,003
Thanks.

681
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:46,274
Look at this beautiful
paint job.

682
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:47,742
Could have done
with a little bit

683
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:49,911
more skin texture, wrinkles,
I think.

684
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:51,246
- Very interesting.
- The nails are fantastic.

685
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,747
- The nails.
- Yeah.

686
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,816
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

687
00:31:58,688 --> 00:32:01,223
So, Scott, what did you think
of tonight's aliens?

688
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:02,290
I have to say, guys,

689
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:04,042
the quality of the work
is excellent,

690
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:05,961
especially considering
the amount of time

691
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:06,995
you guys had to do it.

692
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:08,830
Thank you.

693
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:11,283
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations.

694
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,368
Let's find out
what they thought.

695
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:15,670
Tess and Daniel...

696
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:18,139
Graham and Chloe...

697
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:20,842
Rashaad and Tyler...

698
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:22,978
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

699
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:26,615
and can head
back to the makeup room.

700
00:32:31,921 --> 00:32:35,123
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

701
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:36,691
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

702
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,443
to learn more about your work.

703
00:32:38,494 --> 00:32:40,962
Niko and Corinne,
please step forward.

704
00:32:48,404 --> 00:32:50,322
Begin by telling me
about your concept

705
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:53,458
and about who did what
on this makeup.

706
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:55,994
Our crop circle was,
"We need water."

707
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:57,829
So we wanted to go

708
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,216
for a very dehydrated type
of a feel.

709
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,668
Corinne sculpted the face
and the neck piece,

710
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:05,086
and she did most of the paint.

711
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:08,390
And I sculpted the cowl,
the chest, and the hands.

712
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:12,861
In last look, we went together
and finished all the paint work.

713
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:15,030
That's extremely impressive,
because I wouldn't have guessed

714
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:18,433
that two people
were painting on him.

715
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:20,468
These color notes
that you've brought down

716
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:23,605
along the side of his face
and on to his neck,

717
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:25,840
from afar, it gives a shade
and counter-shade,

718
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:28,276
but up close, they're actually
really nice details.

719
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:31,379
That's really advanced
painting technique.

720
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:32,681
- Thank you.
- Really well done.

721
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:34,966
This is definitely
an impressive makeup.

722
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:38,620
It's beautiful, color-wise.
The palette is fantastic.

723
00:33:38,654 --> 00:33:39,688
Can you turn around?

724
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:41,439
I want to see
the back of him as well.

725
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,724
All of this breaking up,

726
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:44,626
explosion in the back
of his head,

727
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,161
is really a cool idea.

728
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:47,662
You can turn around.

729
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,499
Not to mention,
the fabulous green fingernails.

730
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:53,535
They are awesome.

731
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,937
- Very well done, you guys.
- Thank you.

732
00:33:55,972 --> 00:33:57,806
I just think
the overall presentation

733
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,091
feels very strong and cohesive.

734
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:01,276
So great work.

735
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,844
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

736
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:05,013
Niko and Corinne,
please step back.

737
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:13,555
George and Bethany.

738
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:20,829
Tell me the concept
for your alien

739
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:23,031
and how you divided up
the work.

740
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:26,067
She's a gatherer that goes out
into the wastelands

741
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:27,936
and gets whatever she can

742
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,804
and brings it
back to her people.

743
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,440
Bethany did the face.
I did the cowl.

744
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:34,175
Okay, and who did all
the painting?

745
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,294
I did the cowl, mostly,
and she did the face.

746
00:34:36,345 --> 00:34:39,547
From afar, this makeup
was so impressive

747
00:34:39,582 --> 00:34:40,849
and then when we got up close,

748
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:44,019
I was really
kind of disappointed.

749
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:46,220
You fell down
in the facial sculpture.

750
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:49,024
It's really kind of rough.

751
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:51,659
Underneath the chin,
it's broken apart,

752
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:53,445
and there's this big reveal
of her throat.

753
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:54,729
What is that about?

754
00:34:54,747 --> 00:34:56,031
Actually, that was an accident.

755
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:57,782
It came out ripped in the--
right here.

756
00:34:57,817 --> 00:35:00,251
That's a good case of turning
lemons to lemonade,

757
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:03,238
but the face doesn't really
evoke any kind of sympathy.

758
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:05,707
You've talked about
a few story elements to us.

759
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:06,975
She was gathering stuff.

760
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:09,310
We should see
the effects of that.

761
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:11,780
So I think
it's about taking more time

762
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:14,866
to think these things through.

763
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:17,185
George and Bethany,
please step back.

764
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:26,111
Daran and Tanner.

765
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:31,783
So tell us about your concept.

766
00:35:31,817 --> 00:35:34,736
Ice caps are melting
and covering over their food.

767
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,837
They don't eat anything solid,

768
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:36,955
so everything is through
the fingertips.

769
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:39,457
I sculpted the face
and the protrusions.

770
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:40,575
Tanner sculpted the hands.

771
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:42,710
Some big concepts here,

772
00:35:42,745 --> 00:35:45,930
and I actually love that you're
really pushing the envelope.

773
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:46,948
And part of it is because

774
00:35:46,982 --> 00:35:48,550
there's some freaky things
going on

775
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:49,717
with these special glands.

776
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:52,787
You guys did some weird stuff.

777
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:55,256
- Yeah.
- We're pretty weird.

778
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:58,726
The use of soft color,
I think, is really wonderful.

779
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:00,495
It's really weird,
in a good way.

780
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:01,796
Thank you.

781
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:05,033
It looks alien, but it
looks reasonable. It looks rational.

782
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:08,186
You managed to capture
this organic look

783
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,604
that I really, really,
really enjoyed.

784
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:11,639
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Awesome. Thank you.

785
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:12,891
Daran and Tanner,

786
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:15,777
- you can head back.
- Thank you.

787
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,281
Good job, brother.

788
00:36:20,316 --> 00:36:21,983
Cat and Matt,
please step forward.

789
00:36:27,823 --> 00:36:30,258
Tell me about how
you approached the concept.

790
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:31,626
Also, who did what?

791
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,295
Our decoded phrase was
"Our sun is dying."

792
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,897
We decided to go with a planet

793
00:36:35,931 --> 00:36:38,166
that was getting hotter
and hotter

794
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,767
and a species of alien
that had to,

795
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:42,103
over time, adapt to the heat.

796
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:44,339
Matt started the face.

797
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:48,276
I started blocking out the cowl.
Matt blocked out the chest.

798
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,677
The first impression is strong,

799
00:36:49,712 --> 00:36:52,580
but when you get close,
particularly up in the head,

800
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:55,016
it feels like one color.

801
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,152
There was just
a missed opportunity there

802
00:36:57,186 --> 00:36:58,236
to take it to another level.

803
00:36:58,287 --> 00:36:59,587
I didn't agree

804
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:02,190
with some
of the painting decisions.

805
00:37:02,224 --> 00:37:04,309
I just think that it
kind of got lost in the paint.

806
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,894
Okay, it's got
this conical shape,

807
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:09,631
but you didn't develop the rest
of the facial features.

808
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:11,416
And here's the bad part--
the "Swamp thing" nose,

809
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:13,601
which looks great
on swamp thing.

810
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:16,237
Anyone else, not so much.

811
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:17,672
I really think

812
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,175
a little bit more
groovy paint job on the face

813
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:22,177
would have made this thing
really spectacular.

814
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:25,246
We don't want to just see, like,
a muddy, brown face.

815
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:28,850
So you have to think about this
when you're painting it.

816
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:30,718
Cat and Matt,
you can step down.

817
00:37:30,753 --> 00:37:32,787
Thank you.

818
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,893
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you had to say.

819
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:40,595
Will you please head
back to the makeup room

820
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:42,163
while they deliberate?

821
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:44,132
Thank you.

822
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:48,303
All right, judges, why don't
we talk about the looks

823
00:37:48,337 --> 00:37:49,904
you liked the most this week?

824
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:51,105
Let's start
wi Niko and Corinne.

825
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,942
It's a really cohesive
head-to-toe character.

826
00:37:53,976 --> 00:37:56,211
They put a little bit
of luminescent paint

827
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:59,447
on the crop-circle design
so the whole thing wasn't flat.

828
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:01,199
It felt organic
to the character.

829
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,319
The exact amount of darkness
they achieved around the eyes.

830
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:07,054
It's not so dark-- they didn't
just blacken it, you know?

831
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:09,524
It feels like Corinne led
the paint job.

832
00:38:09,558 --> 00:38:12,427
Then again, Niko sculpted
that great cowl--

833
00:38:12,461 --> 00:38:14,429
- beautifully done.
- Beautifully done.

834
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:17,565
All right, let's move on
to Daran and Tanner.

835
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,734
I thought that it was
extremely uncomfortable.

836
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:21,502
An alien shouldn't be
comfortable to look at.

837
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:24,806
So I think they won in that
category-- that's for sure.

838
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,509
They made such good use
of gelatin being translucent,

839
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:29,711
and they didn't overpaint it,

840
00:38:29,745 --> 00:38:31,229
so it stuck out
against the foam.

841
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:34,082
The ideas are so adventurous.

842
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:37,518
The one struggle I had was
telling the story in the design,

843
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:39,120
but it's so winning

844
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:41,055
in all the other ways
in which it needs to be.

845
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:43,725
All right, let's move on
to the looks we liked the least.

846
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:44,892
Let's start
with George and Bethany.

847
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:47,695
When she walked out,
she had a great profile,

848
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,364
and then she took off
the respirator

849
00:38:49,398 --> 00:38:51,399
and it fell apart.

850
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,801
And to skip the quality
on the face

851
00:38:53,836 --> 00:38:56,287
and deliver a nice cowl,
it's just not gonna cut it.

852
00:38:56,322 --> 00:38:57,755
You have to do that first.

853
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:00,842
It seems like Bethany is
very responsible for the face.

854
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:02,694
All right, let's move on
to Cat and Matt.

855
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:04,379
There's just not really

856
00:39:04,413 --> 00:39:07,665
an interesting alien design
in there.

857
00:39:07,716 --> 00:39:09,317
Yeah. It sounded like
there was a lot of conflict

858
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:10,585
between them about it too.

859
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,120
At some point,
I thought somebody was about

860
00:39:12,154 --> 00:39:14,756
to throw somebody under the bus
and then kind of stopped.

861
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,491
I'm not sure the chest that
they did was worth the work

862
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:17,692
that they put into it.

863
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,394
I'm not really sure
what that accomplished.

864
00:39:19,428 --> 00:39:23,398
They did think about things
from the story point of view.

865
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:24,882
I appreciated
what they were doing.

866
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:26,801
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

867
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:27,769
We have.

868
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:29,704
Let's bring them back out.

869
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:39,380
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top teams.

870
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:40,548
Niko and Corinne,

871
00:39:40,582 --> 00:39:44,185
your character
made a strong impression

872
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,821
due largely in part
to your excellent sculpture

873
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:48,556
and your beautiful paint job.

874
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,692
Daran and Tanner,

875
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:52,193
you had an adventurous concept

876
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:55,930
that resulted in a fascinating
and well-executed makeup.

877
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,765
All right,
which team came out on top?

878
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,183
The top team tonight is...

879
00:40:05,176 --> 00:40:07,244
Glenn, which team
came out on top?

880
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,146
The top team tonight is...

881
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:15,386
Niko and Corinne.

882
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,906
You worked
extremely well together,

883
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,574
creating a cohesive makeup

884
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:23,494
and one of the nicest paint jobs
that we have seen.

885
00:40:23,528 --> 00:40:27,131
- Thank you.
- Niko and Corinne, great job.

886
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:29,750
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

887
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,202
Glenn?
Our winner tonight is...

888
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:35,906
Corinne.

889
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:37,508
Thank you.

890
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,576
We felt
that you were the driving force

891
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:42,746
behind your very successful
alien character.

892
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:43,764
Thank you very much.

893
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:45,349
I'm really excited.

894
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:48,118
It gives me confidence to know
that I have the ability

895
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:50,204
to continue to compete
in this competition.

896
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,122
- Corinne, congratulations.
- Thank you.

897
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:55,792
You, Niko, Daran, Tanner,
you guys are all safe.

898
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,054
Please head
back to the makeup room.

899
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,176
Thank you.

900
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:01,031
Good job, buddy.

901
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,218
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

902
00:41:04,252 --> 00:41:06,637
are on the bottom this week,

903
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:09,106
and one of you
will be eliminated.

904
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,574
Please step forward.

905
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:21,018
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

906
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:22,686
George and Bethany,

907
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:26,090
from a distance, your makeup
made a great impression.

908
00:41:26,124 --> 00:41:29,927
But up close,
the details were unrefined.

909
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:34,431
Cat and Matt,
your makeup had a solid concept,

910
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,434
but the sculptural detail
and the paint job

911
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:39,703
just didn't do it justice.

912
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:41,438
So who is going home tonight?

913
00:41:41,456 --> 00:41:43,607
The person going home
tonight is...

914
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:51,799
Bethany.

915
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,784
Our biggest issue
with your makeup,

916
00:41:53,818 --> 00:41:56,286
unfortunately,
was the sculpture of the face.

917
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:59,957
That means, George, Cat, Matt,

918
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,442
you are safe this week.

919
00:42:01,476 --> 00:42:03,394
You can head
back to the makeup room.

920
00:42:03,428 --> 00:42:05,596
Thank you.

921
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:12,403
Bethany, thank you
for bringing your artistry

922
00:42:12,437 --> 00:42:14,405
and passionate makeup
to <i>Face Off,</i>

923
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:15,873
and we wish you
all the best of luck.

924
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:17,274
Thank you guys so much.

925
00:42:17,308 --> 00:42:20,911
Bethany, I am so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

926
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:22,913
Will you please head
back to the makeup room

927
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,581
and pack up your kit?

928
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:27,067
- Thanks, guys.
- Good luck.

929
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:32,022
It's just frustrating
to not be able to show

930
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:33,957
everything that I can do.

931
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:38,362
Aw.

932
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:39,963
This is definitely not the end.

933
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:43,133
This has just made my passion
grow even stronger.

934
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:44,768
I'm gonna miss you guys.

935
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:46,937
I've learned so much
about myself--

936
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:50,374
just what I can do.

937
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:52,509
I'm not done
with makeup at all.

938
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,429
I would really like to keep
kicking ass.
