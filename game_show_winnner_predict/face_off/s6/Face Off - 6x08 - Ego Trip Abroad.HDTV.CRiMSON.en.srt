1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:01,431
Absolutely stunning.

2
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:02,833
So well handled.

3
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:04,703
You did one hell of a job.

4
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:07,370
<i>Previously on Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,779
George's wizard
earned him his first win.

6
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,685
Finally!

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,389
And Cat was sent home.

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,626
But the biggest surprise of all
was revealed backstage.

9
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:20,174
I'm taking you all to Japan.

10
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:22,743
Are you kidding me? Japan?

11
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:24,745
<i>Konnichiwa!</i>

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,180
Now eight artists remain,

13
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:27,648
and they'll journey
across the globe

14
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:30,084
for extreme inspiration.

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,821
Being in Tokyo
is absolutely amazing.

16
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:35,923
Please welcome Kazuhiro Tsuji.

17
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,425
Kazu is one
of the greatest makeup artists

18
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:39,660
in the whole world.

19
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:42,280
You must create
an anime character of your own.

20
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,664
I love anime.

21
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,499
You know
it's not gonna be that simple.

22
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:46,901
- This is it.
- Some much color.

23
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:48,469
The anime district.

24
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:50,171
Oh!

25
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:54,809
The whole thing
is exquisitely executed.

26
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:55,977
It's really nice.

27
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,545
I think you've done
a great job.

28
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,480
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

29
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:01,582
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

30
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,467
to one of their 85
international locations,

31
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:09,523
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,
and $100,000.

32
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:12,493
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

33
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,632
<i>Face Off!</i>

34
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,067

00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:05,112
We're getting ready
to go to Japan.

37
00:02:05,146 --> 00:02:07,615
I wish I could share
all this with Cat.

38
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,183
One of her dreams
is to go to Japan,

39
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,301
and I want to make her proud

40
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:12,119
of whatever
we have to do there.

41
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,454
This is, like,
the biggest thing

42
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:14,622
they've ever done on <i>Face Off.</i>

43
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,773
And we're part of it.

44
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:18,025
This is my first trip
out of the country.

45
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:19,293
I'm so excited.

46
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:22,396
- We're going to Japan!
- <i>Konnichiwa.</i>

47
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,167
Being in Tokyo,
the sights, the smells.

48
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,852
Everything feels like
a different world,

49
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:46,937
and it's absolutely amazing.

50
00:02:51,192 --> 00:02:54,528
We arrive
at this world-class fish market.

51
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:56,463
It's a very hectic,
amazing environment.

52
00:02:56,498 --> 00:02:58,565
- Oh!
- Ah!

53
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,168
It's a ritual thing--

54
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,770
before they cut the fish,
you give it a kiss.

55
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:03,887
Tyler, right here.

56
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,055
All right, fine.

57
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:06,874
Oh!

58
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:11,895
Oh, my God.
That is so good.

59
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:14,848
And the sushi
is absolutely amazing.

60
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:16,734
- So great.
- So good.

61
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:22,890
This is just absolutely crazy.

62
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:24,291
Here we are in Tokyo

63
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,594
in the middle
of Shibuya Crossing.

64
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:30,531
It feels like
Japanese Times Square--

65
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:32,866
so many different billboards
and colors

66
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,968
and people and personalities.

67
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:37,771
McKenzie really wanted us
to be inspired by Japan,

68
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,239
and I'm like a kid
in a candy store.

69
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:41,308
I just collect reference photos
of the architecture,

70
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:44,945
the colors, textures,
even the outfits.

71
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,815
I'm here to be inspired
to do more art.

72
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,717
This is, like, the coolest gift
I've ever been given.

73
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,720
It's just nonstop incredible.

74
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:54,021
Tokyo!

75
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:05,799
Oh, this is a really nice view.

76
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,267
This Japanese garden--

77
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,737
everything's so beautiful,
so peaceful.

78
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,339
- What do you got over there?
- This thing's pretty cool.

79
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:14,058
This is definitely

80
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:17,044
a very powerful experience
for us.

81
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:18,262
It's all hitting me--

82
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:20,381
everything, from being
in this competition

83
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:24,051
to being so blessed.

84
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:25,986
Honestly, I want to stay
for a while.

85
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:33,127
I just can't believe
we're here.

86
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,778
We probably won't be able
to sleep tonight

87
00:04:34,813 --> 00:04:37,231
because we're trying to take in
as much as possible.

88
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:46,440
I wouldn't mind living here.

89
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,808
Unbelievable.

90
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:50,027
We're walking through
this quiet, little street,

91
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,862
and we approach
this temple gate

92
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:54,765
that looks like it's been there
for hundreds of years.

93
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:55,816
So cool.

94
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,619
The gate opens
to this beautiful lake.

95
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:01,088
- Check out the turtle!
- Wow, dude.

96
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,906
Then we get to the top
of the bridge,

97
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,658
and all of a sudden--

98
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,996
You guys hear that?

99
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,967
- Oh, man.
- So cool.

100
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:15,402
This is so cool.

101
00:05:15,437 --> 00:05:17,370
What do you think, Georgie?

102
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:19,940
This is amazing, dude.

103
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:28,181
- Nice.
- Wow.

104
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,183
So cool.

105
00:05:29,217 --> 00:05:31,118
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

106
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:33,454
Welcome to Shomyoji Temple.

107
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:37,624
This stunning structure
was built nearly 1,000 years ago

108
00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:40,126
to represent
the land of perfect bliss.

109
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:41,795
Now, it is here,

110
00:05:41,813 --> 00:05:44,698
surrounded by the haunting sound
of the cicadas,

111
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:46,567
that your next
foundation challenge

112
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,201
will take place.

113
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:52,122
Now, let me introduce you
to today's special guest judge.

114
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,841
Industry insiders
have called him

115
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,744
the best makeup-effects artist
in the world,

116
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:59,813
and he has a long list
of impressive credits,

117
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:02,749
including <i>Men In Black,</i>
<i>The Grinch,</i>

118
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:04,918
<i>Planet Of The Apes,</i> and <i>Looper.</i>

119
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:08,555
Please welcome two-time
Academy Award-nominated

120
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:11,191
makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji.

121
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:13,752
_

122
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:16,079
Kazu is one
of the greatest makeup artists

123
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,414
in the whole world.

124
00:06:17,448 --> 00:06:18,665
I am so excited.

125
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,133
Thank you so much
for being here.

126
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,451
Thank you.

127
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,303
Today's foundation challenge
is inspired

128
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,506
by one of the most
iconic characters

129
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,608
in Japanese folklore--

130
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:28,742
the oni.

131
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:34,528
_

132
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,899
_

133
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,652
The masks you see
on the models are examples

134
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,604
of traditional Japanese oni.

135
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:43,090
Now, since they come
from the spirit world,

136
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:44,491
these colorful entities

137
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:47,327
don't always have
normal human features.

138
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:50,330
Oftentimes they are depicted
with extra eyes,

139
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:52,065
claws, fingers, even toes,

140
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,867
so, in this
foundation challenge,

141
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:58,188
you must create an original take
on a Japanese oni.

142
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,642
I'm really excited.

143
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,377
At the same time,
I'm really nervous.

144
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,546
Kazu is such a perfectionist.

145
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,714
This is really gonna have
to be a clean makeup

146
00:07:07,748 --> 00:07:09,249
in order to impress him.

147
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,518
So, Kazu, what will you
be looking for

148
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:12,769
in today's final makeup?

149
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:15,953
_

150
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,502
_

151
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,952
_

152
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,908
_

153
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,934
_

154
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:29,019
All right, guys,
you have two hours

155
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,838
to create your oni characters.

156
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:35,158
The winner of today's challenge
will earn immunity.

157
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:39,346
Good luck,
because your time starts now.

158
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:47,137
I see this white
and purple kimono

159
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:49,289
and think of a character

160
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:52,125
who waits for samurais
when they die.

161
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:53,977
That's kind of like
their last battle,

162
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,795
to either go to heaven
or to go to hell,

163
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:58,932
and they have to fight her.

164
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,684
My concept is a demon

165
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:02,736
who captures people
and drowns them,

166
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,972
so my character's
gonna be very dark, gloomy,

167
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,857
and gray and wet.

168
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,775
I'm very excited
for this challenge.

169
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,545
We've got Kazu here,
so it's time to impress him.

170
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,180
My plan is to use
some of the architecture

171
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,716
and structure around me
as an influence.

172
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,718
I'm using seven prosthetics
on this makeup.

173
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:19,386
Hopefully I can get 'em all
applied in time

174
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,387
to get them painted--

175
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,805
a weathered bronze look

176
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,727
to match the buildings there
in the background behind me.

177
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,362
The oni is a Japanese demon,

178
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:29,696
so I'm gonna try and throw in

179
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:32,666
a little bit of extra everything
to dehumanize her.

180
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,602
I'm thinking, "How many horns
can I fit on this thing's head?

181
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:37,004
How many ears
can this thing have?"

182
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,122
But at the same time,
I want this to look like

183
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:40,507
it came out of a painting--

184
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,076
kind of like it's a statue
that's come alive.

185
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:49,616
I really want to bring out
the shape of the Japanese oni--

186
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:52,819
defined brows,
cheeks, and nose.

187
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:55,222
And I want to use blacks
and reds and golds

188
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:57,524
to help pull in the culture
around us.

189
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,499
It's kind of strange
to do something horrible,

190
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:06,933
when this is so beautiful.

191
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:10,871
My oni feeds on the sorrow
of their victims.

192
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:15,575
I'm using forehead prosthetic,
a chin piece, making her pale.

193
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,512
Somehow it's coming.
It's coming to me, you know?

194
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,400
- Okay, yeah, that's hot.
- Five minutes, everybody!

195
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,791
Anybody know how to tie
a kimono around here?

196
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:35,495
Time's up!
Everybody, brushes down!

197
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,563
Whoo.

198
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:37,564
- Hey, George.
- Hello.

199
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:38,949
- How are you?
- How are you?

200
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,500
- Good.
- Tell us about your oni.

201
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:43,437
She attacks by sorrow,
by making you cry to death.

202
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,939
I like the color
you used on the eyebrow

203
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:47,724
and the red on the eyelid,

204
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,243
but the way you painted
those tear stains--

205
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,180
it doesn't look like
it fall down from the eyes.

206
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:54,314
Yeah.

207
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,416
I chose to make
two different noses--

208
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:59,252
one's reversed--
and then six different eyes.

209
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,587
I love the paint job you did.

210
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:01,888
I was actually looking

211
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:03,156
at the roof over here
on the structure.

212
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,891
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

213
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:07,444
I wanted to create a character
who is in the death realm,

214
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:08,612
waiting for samurais,

215
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:10,764
and if they have the courage
to beat her,

216
00:10:10,798 --> 00:10:12,032
then they go to heaven,

217
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,467
and if they lose,
they go to hell.

218
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:15,235
I think the color coordination
looks good,

219
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:17,604
but I see too much
of a brushstroke.

220
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:18,772
Oh, okay.

221
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:20,874
I immediately wanted
to grab the robe

222
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:23,376
so I could use that
as inspiration--

223
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:25,845
reds and blacks
being really dominant

224
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:28,281
and golds
being an awesome accent.

225
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,483
This is a nice paint job.

226
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:30,801
It fits really well,

227
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:33,053
and it has a lot of shape
going on around the face.

228
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,488
It looks nice.

229
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:37,624
Just to be able to do
makeup in Japan

230
00:10:37,658 --> 00:10:39,476
is so cool.

231
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,961
And I'd like to get immunity

232
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:43,213
so I can step
out of my comfort zone

233
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,065
for the next
spotlight challenge.

234
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,139
So, Kazu, who created
your favorite looks today?

235
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:53,607
Daran...

236
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:56,376
Your makeup is quite unique
and different from others,

237
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,945
but I still can tell
it's an oni character.

238
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,946
Thank you.

239
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,282
Corinne, I love your paint job,

240
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,917
and application
was well finished.

241
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,018
Thank you.

242
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:06,953
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

243
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:09,022
The winner
of today's challenge is...

244
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,894
Coming up...

245
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,228
You know
it's not gonna be that simple.

246
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:16,296
Ooh.

247
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,215
Chloe's design
is similar to mine.

248
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,250
I'm really worried.

249
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:21,268
Fuck!

250
00:11:21,302 --> 00:11:22,569
I expect much better from you.

251
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:25,071
We have no idea where
you come up with this stuff.

252
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:26,586
It looks so cheesy.

253
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,285
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

254
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,388
The winner
of today's challenge is...

255
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:40,658
Daran.

256
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:41,860
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

257
00:11:41,894 --> 00:11:44,729
Overall, it was
a great original concept.

258
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:46,564
Coming from you,
that's absolutely amazing.

259
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,099
Congratulations, Daran.

260
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,101
As the winner
of today's challenge,

261
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,603
you have won immunity

262
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,371
in the next
spotlight challenge.

263
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:55,974
Just to impress Kazu
was incredible--

264
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,525
not only that,
but winning the immunity

265
00:11:57,576 --> 00:11:59,611
here in Japan,
it's just mind-blowing to me.

266
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:02,147
Kazu, thank you so much
for being here with us today.

267
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,533
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

268
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:06,785
All right, now let's talk

269
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:08,987
about this week's
spotlight challenge.

270
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,089
- Ooh.
- The impact of Tokyo

271
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:14,526
on today's pop culture
is undeniable.

272
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,295
Films like <i>Pacific Rim,</i>
<i>The Matrix, Kill Bill,</i>

273
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,731
and <i>2001 A Space Odyssey</i>

274
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:24,669
have tapped into one of Tokyo's
biggest exploits-- anime.

275
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,005
With that in mind,

276
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,173
your spotlight challenge
is to create

277
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:32,727
a hyper-stylized anime character
of your own.

278
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:35,513
- Whoa.
- I'm really excited.

279
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,583
I'm not sure how to make anime
into a makeup,

280
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:40,018
but I love anime.

281
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:43,555
But you know
it's not gonna be that simple.

282
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,057
Your anime characters
must also be

283
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:49,060
an alter-ego version
of yourself.

284
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:50,195
Ooh.

285
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,597
An anime
alter ego of ourselves--

286
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,698
it's just insane.

287
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,433
This gets cooler and cooler.

288
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,153
I want you to make sure
that you source something unique

289
00:12:58,204 --> 00:13:00,772
about yourself to incorporate
into your makeups.

290
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:03,992
Now, tomorrow I'm sending you
to Akihabara,

291
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:06,511
the anime capital of the world.

292
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:08,713
You'll have an opportunity
to consult

293
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,183
with genius anime artist
Hidetaka Tenjin.

294
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:15,153
He's worked on anime series
like the ever popular

295
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,122
<i>Macross</i> franchise.

296
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:18,306
All right, well, good luck,

297
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,358
and I will see you all
back in Hollywood.

298
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:22,443
- Thank you.
- Bye.

299
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,007
This is it.

300
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,376
- The anime district.
- So much colors.

301
00:13:40,913 --> 00:13:41,980
Awesome.

302
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:43,982
So we get to Akihabara,

303
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:45,834
and I'm, like,
jumping up and down.

304
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,952
I can't wait to go explore.

305
00:13:47,987 --> 00:13:50,155
I'm just seeing
all these different characters,

306
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:52,307
and my mind
is just going crazy with,

307
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:55,026
"What am I gonna do?"

308
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,395
- Oh, look, you--
- Chloe's right there.

309
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:00,014
- Look at that.
- This is so cool.

310
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:01,049
I've pictured myself

311
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,634
as a cartoon character
plenty of times,

312
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:05,503
so I think this challenge
is gonna suit me just fine.

313
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,105
Immediately
I know what I want to do.

314
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,441
It's a mad scientist turning
into a big plant monster.

315
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:11,559
There's my hair.

316
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:12,977
That's a Graham hair
right there.

317
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,379
My wife
is gonna love this makeup.

318
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:16,114
Alyssa's so
into this whole world.

319
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:17,382
She would be freaking out.

320
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,734
So I got to win this time.
I got to win, please.

321
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:22,220
- There you go.
- Oh, thank God.

322
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:25,089
I am super excited
to be here in Akihabara.

323
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,525
I want to do something
Halloween-inspired,

324
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,294
'cause I love Halloween.

325
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,396
Part of the challenge
of making an anime makeup

326
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,931
is really gonna be the eyes.

327
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:35,500
They have a lot of
their expression in their eyes.

328
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:38,636
They got oversized eyes...

329
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,671
- Yeah.
- Small noses.

330
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,573
Let's keep looking.

331
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,374
- That's anime.
- Awesome.

332
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:45,210
- Yeah.
- Oh, man, let me see.

333
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:47,111
Ooh, look,
it looks exactly like you.

334
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,414
- This is the right inspiration.
- Ooh!

335
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,899
You know where
we're going, right?

336
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,233
Yes.

337
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:54,719
- We go to @home cafe...
- Yay.

338
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:57,405
Which is a cosplay cafe.

339
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,157
This place
is straight out of an anime.

340
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,025
Check this out.
Oh, yeah.

341
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,735
_

342
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:06,431
<i>- Princess?</i>
<i>- Princess?</i>

343
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:13,471
We get 30 minutes to sketch,
and then Tenjin walks in...

344
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:16,274
- Hi.
- ...which is super exciting.

345
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:17,905
_

346
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,478
My alter ego
is a Robin Hood character

347
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,847
who takes from the rich
and gives to the poor.

348
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,415
I love that whole idea.

349
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,282
_

350
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:28,386
I wanted to make it
kind of like a gun and a sword

351
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:29,854
in one weapon.

352
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:31,644
_

353
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:32,790
- Make it bigger?
- Yes.

354
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,759
- The same size as him?
- Yeah.

355
00:15:34,793 --> 00:15:37,094
That's cool.
I didn't even think of that.

356
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:38,463
I'm definitely gonna go

357
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:39,831
for making the weapon
twice the size.

358
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:40,832
This is anime.

359
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,105
They always got
oversized weapons.

360
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:42,687
_

361
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:44,435
Thank you.

362
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,871
My alter ego
would have to involve

363
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,439
some sense of freedom.

364
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:51,309
Fish have freedom
to roam the open seas,

365
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:52,810
so I'm gonna wrap koi fish

366
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:55,146
around the head of my character

367
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,732
and give the model
an actual fish face as well.

368
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:00,527
_

369
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:01,528
_

370
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,954
- Water?
- Water.

371
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:05,189
You're trying to get me
in trouble, man.

372
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:06,975
You're trying to get me to do
more than I can do.

373
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:09,694
In order to show
that the koi fish

374
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:11,129
are jumping out of the water,

375
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:14,098
I'm going to incorporate waves
into the cowl.

376
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,700
So I'm very happy
that we had the opportunity

377
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:17,268
to get Tenjin's advice.

378
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,336
Yeah, I like that.

379
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,704
He was very helpful
to everybody.

380
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:21,500
_

381
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,641
Thank you.

382
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,977
All right, guys,
time to go back to LA.

383
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,395
Let's pack it up.

384
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,747
The whole trip has been
just amazing,

385
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:31,749
and we want to stay
a little longer.

386
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:35,153
But there's a lot of work to do,
so let's get to it.

387
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,154
Bye!
See you!

388
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:37,955
- Bye!
<i>- Arigato!</i>

389
00:16:37,973 --> 00:16:39,590
This experience
has made me realize

390
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,125
where my talent can take me.

391
00:16:41,143 --> 00:16:43,528
The world opens up.

392
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,863
We're definitely
leaving Japan inspired,

393
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:47,832
but also more focused
and more driven,

394
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:50,535
just knowing that it's gonna
take that much more effort

395
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,070
to make it into the finale.

396
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,581
So it's our first day
in the lab.

397
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:06,017
We get to choose our model.

398
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:08,019
And I want to incorporate
my knowledge

399
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:10,622
in martial arts
in this character.

400
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,157
My concept is a samurai

401
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,259
that's just a normal kid
in the day,

402
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,961
and in the night,
he's like a superhero.

403
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:20,231
So the first thing that I want
to work on is my face.

404
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:24,202
My character's name
is Soulstice.

405
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:26,571
She is
a soul-sucking vigilante.

406
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:28,173
It's kind of a play on words,

407
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:29,374
'cause she's a soul sucker,

408
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:31,843
but also, I was born
on the summer solstice.

409
00:17:31,877 --> 00:17:34,879
She's still gonna be sexy
and definitely have red hair.

410
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:36,414
That's frickin' close.

411
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:41,920
- Cool.
- Thank you.

412
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:43,354
It's gonna have,
like, a helmet.

413
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:45,723
My alter ego has,
like, an armor suit

414
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,625
that's gonna enable him to fly.

415
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,561
I always wanted to be
like superman,

416
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,596
and this guy's
gonna let me do that.

417
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,232
I got to do a face, cowl,
and a suit.

418
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:56,501
It's just crazy.
I got so much to do.

419
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:00,271
I block out the face

420
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:03,408
so I can start creating
the shape of the eyes.

421
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:06,795
I vacuform the eyes

422
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:10,148
and then use the vacuform pieces
to complete my sculpture.

423
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:11,983
That looks good.

424
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:19,157
My concept
is a super-fast version of me

425
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,559
who can handle
a lot of projects at once,

426
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:24,262
and I want to give
my character multiple arms.

427
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:27,298
Instead of sculpting arms,
I just figured,

428
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,633
"Why don't I just mold
my own arms

429
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:32,237
and I'll have them
be holding something?"

430
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:34,372
I'm pouring alginate in this
paper tubing that I made--

431
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,742
it's a molding compound
that's safe to use on skin--

432
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,944
and putting my arm in
and letting it set up.

433
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:41,312
Fill it with stone

434
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:42,647
and repeat the process
for my other arm.

435
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,449
Oh, he did his hands.

436
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:47,402
Looking around the lab,

437
00:18:47,436 --> 00:18:52,390
I notice that Chloe's design
looks similar to mine.

438
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,458
Yeah, Corinne's got something
like that too.

439
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,161
It's really nerve-racking

440
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:58,729
because we've heard again
and again from the judges,

441
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:01,299
"Make sure that you're doing
something different

442
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,867
from each other."

443
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:05,236
Since Chloe and I
are the only two females left,

444
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:06,921
our characters
are already gonna have

445
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:08,473
some of the same elements,

446
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:10,875
so I'm really scared
at this point.

447
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,731
It's day one of our anime
alter-ego challenge,

448
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:22,235
and Chloe's design is looking
really similar to mine.

449
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,236
It's cool.

450
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,756
Yeah, Corinne's got something
like that too.

451
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,542
Even though our makeups
kind of look the same,

452
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,211
Corinne and I
paint differently,

453
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:33,313
and I think
they'll look different enough.

454
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:36,182
We've heard again
and again from the judges,

455
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,984
"If you see someone
doing similar

456
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,987
that you make sure that
you're doing the better job."

457
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:44,190
So I've taken the time
to really get the eyes right,

458
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,609
'cause I'm not changing
my design.

459
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,495
It's only fueled me
to show them that I'm better.

460
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,521
I'm making this sculpture
of my hair,

461
00:19:58,555 --> 00:19:59,973
like, really, really big.

462
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,908
- Rashaad.
- Yeah?

463
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,711
Is that a whole block of clay?

464
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,980
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

465
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,556
Hey, guys, that's time.

466
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,691
Now that the sculpture is done,

467
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,059
I have another big mold
to make,

468
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,545
and I still have
to fabricate my weapons,

469
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:25,231
so hopefully
I can finish it all tomorrow.

470
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,556
Here we go again.

471
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,908
So it's day two.
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

472
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,410
I've got to get
this cowl sculpted,

473
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,445
get the fish detailed,
and sculpt the waves

474
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,180
that Tenjin thought
I should add.

475
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:43,549
It's kind of scary to be trying
to make a cowl this big

476
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:44,951
and with this much detail,

477
00:20:44,985 --> 00:20:46,953
so I'm not sure
if I'm gonna be able

478
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,439
to pull this off or not.

479
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:54,093
- Tyler.
- Scary.

480
00:20:55,262 --> 00:20:56,829
I have a wig.

481
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,197
Tyler, on the other hand,

482
00:20:58,232 --> 00:21:01,734
is doing, like, a hard plastic
mannequin-style hair.

483
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:02,885
I think it's hilarious.

484
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,937
- You just put it on like a cap.
- Fantastic.

485
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,105
Apparently I look good in it.

486
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,641
Back to you, Graham.

487
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:10,910
That's hilarious.

488
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,180
Right now
I'm trying to figure out

489
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,015
the arm prosthetics.

490
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,817
First I start to make
the shell of it

491
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:19,285
out of L200 foam.

492
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:21,220
- Where's your hand, right there?
- Yep.

493
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:23,122
I then work
on the shoulder harness.

494
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:26,225
Then I have to make
a skin of latex on top of that

495
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,394
and create textures
with plastic wrap.

496
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:29,612
It's taking forever,

497
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:31,481
and I'm realizing
how much painting's

498
00:21:31,532 --> 00:21:33,399
actually going to be necessary,

499
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:36,002
and it's a lot.

500
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:47,847
So I hand-painted
vacuform the eyes.

501
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:50,950
I think they look very different
from Corinne's makeup.

502
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,486
She was a little bit concerned,

503
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,656
but I'm happy
that they look different.

504
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,959
This dude is tired, man.

505
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:02,428
I got the face
and the cowl done,

506
00:22:02,463 --> 00:22:03,579
but I still have a lot to do.

507
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,932
I have to do the suit,
rockets, and wings,

508
00:22:05,966 --> 00:22:07,633
and I don't think
I'm gonna have enough time

509
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:08,634
to make all that.

510
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:10,303
Damn, I made
the same mistake again.

511
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:11,537
It's hard to think.
I'm tired.

512
00:22:11,572 --> 00:22:12,989
What's wrong with me, man?

513
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,041
It's not coming along
like I wanted.

514
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:17,810
- Fuck.
- We got 15 minutes, guys!

515
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:22,014
Rashaad.

516
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:27,620
All right, guys, it's time.

517
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:29,305
So time's up,

518
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:30,790
and I'm only halfway
with my suit.

519
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:33,009
So I have to finish it tomorrow
on application day.

520
00:22:33,043 --> 00:22:36,596
So, if anything goes wrong,
I'm gonna be in big trouble.

521
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:46,139
- Let's go.
- It's application day.

522
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:47,373
We have four hours in the lab

523
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,976
and one more hour
at last looks.

524
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,444
The arm still looks like

525
00:22:51,478 --> 00:22:53,880
it needs a couple more coats
of latex,

526
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,782
but I'm really thinking
about all that painting

527
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:58,384
that's gonna have to go on,
and that's making me worried.

528
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,056
- What's going on?
- Hey, man.

529
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,392
I'm gonna turn you
into a superhero version of me.

530
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,694
I got, like, a ton of stuff
to do with your hair.

531
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:12,248
My plan for application day
is to finish the wig,

532
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:15,134
and then I'll start application
and painting.

533
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:17,453
Okay, squish it on your face.

534
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,704
The first thing I need to do

535
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:21,140
is make sure that the eyes
are really well set

536
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:22,492
into this appliance

537
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:25,144
and the model
has good enough vision

538
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,696
to act with these pieces on.

539
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,614
Is it still lined up
with your eye?

540
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:30,817
Yeah.

541
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,318
You look just like me.

542
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:35,321
Might have to help me out here.

543
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,023
Painting time.

544
00:23:37,057 --> 00:23:38,257
So I start painting the pieces.

545
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,692
I've got to get
a base color put down,

546
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:40,993
which I need to keep light

547
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,129
and then build up dark
on top of that.

548
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:45,381
One koi is gonna be
a yellow-orange,

549
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:48,017
and the other one-- I'm gonna do
a white with some red.

550
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,002
We took a lot of pictures
in Japan of the koi,

551
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,537
so I'm referencing that.

552
00:23:51,572 --> 00:23:53,138
So this is definitely
a challenge for me.

553
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:55,274
I've never tried
to paint like this.

554
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,643
Pretty badass.

555
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,278
Much better.

556
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:03,015
The cowl and the face
and everything's on,

557
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,951
but I have
to finish the suit now.

558
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,937
So I'm putting it on a model
to see if it fits correctly,

559
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,022
and I have to cut
and paint all these things,

560
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,457
but it's looking sloppy.

561
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,160
I mean, it's not the kind
of thing that I like to do.

562
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:16,195
15 minutes, everybody.

563
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:23,152
Is that too tight?

564
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:24,904
We have, like,
two minutes left,

565
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,089
and I'm starting to panic
about everything

566
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,008
that I have to do.

567
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:31,711
Fuck!

568
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:33,262
I slam into Graham's face.

569
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,416
I can feel my lip get cut
on the inside.

570
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:38,984
You all right?

571
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:41,787
I know that we only have,
like, seconds at this point.

572
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,422
Sorry about that.

573
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:46,092
That's time, guys.

574
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:47,927
My face is bleeding.

575
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,029
My model is not
all the way painted.

576
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,898
It's just-- it's a mess.

577
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,701
Coming up...

578
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:57,236
Ah, crap.

579
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,171
A lot is going wrong
in this last hour.

580
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,606
Hold it in place.
I'm gonna tape it, okay?

581
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,609
I'm applying like crazy,
but it's looking so crappy.

582
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:05,378
The execution is subpar.

583
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:07,313
It looks like
you didn't have enough time.

584
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:10,016
I think
you've done a great job.

585
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,040
It's last looks.

586
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:20,143
We have one hour, and I still have
to put the whole armor.

587
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:22,245
Hold it in place.
I'm gonna tape it, okay?

588
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,279
I'm applying like crazy.

589
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,814
Please hold there.

590
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:27,784
Finally I get it to a point
where he's at least not naked,

591
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,619
but it's looking so crappy.

592
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,788
Shit.

593
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,389
Close your eyes.

594
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,392
Ah, crap.

595
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:38,360
A lot is going wrong
in this last hour.

596
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:39,695
Leaves are coming off.

597
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,231
Oh, broken airbrush-- great.

598
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:43,799
And now the airbrush
doesn't work.

599
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:44,934
This is not ideal here.

600
00:25:44,968 --> 00:25:46,969
I can't hand-paint
a whole tree,

601
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:49,305
not with all the other things
that I've got to do.

602
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:53,876
I don't like the paint job.

603
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:54,944
And one last time.

604
00:25:54,978 --> 00:25:56,412
It's definitely
better than it was,

605
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:58,381
but I've never done
a paint job like this,

606
00:25:58,415 --> 00:25:59,749
so I'm nervous.

607
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,923
All right, everyone,
that's time!

608
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:07,957
- Brushes down!
- Whoo!

609
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,760
I'm really disappointed,

610
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,645
especially when I tried
really hard

611
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:14,397
to do something for my wife.

612
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:16,699
It's just lame.

613
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,011
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

614
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,081
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

615
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:34,984
First let's say hello
to our talented panel of judges.

616
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:36,953
Owner of Optic Nerve
Make-Up Effects Studio,

617
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:37,954
Glenn Hetrick...

618
00:26:37,988 --> 00:26:39,689
- Hey, guys.
- Hello, again.

619
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,325
Three-time Oscar winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

620
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,378
Hi, all you jet-lagged kids.

621
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:48,264
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

622
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:50,233
- <i>Konnichiwa.</i>
- Hey, Neville.

623
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:52,068
And joining us again tonight

624
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:53,769
is two-time
Academy Award-nominated

625
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:56,355
makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji.

626
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,608
It's great to have you
back again.

627
00:26:58,642 --> 00:26:59,976
Great seeing you again

628
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,078
and looking forward to see
what you come up with.

629
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:03,312
Thank you.

630
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:05,648
This week
your spotlight challenge

631
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:08,451
was to create
an original anime character

632
00:27:08,485 --> 00:27:09,986
that is your own alter ego.

633
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,889
So let's take a look
at your anime creations.

634
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:38,314
This isn't the cleanest
application I've done,

635
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:40,449
but I hope
the judges will appreciate

636
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,351
the character as a whole.

637
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:03,806
I actually love the makeup,
'cause it's something different,

638
00:28:03,824 --> 00:28:05,524
something
I've never tried before,

639
00:28:05,576 --> 00:28:08,477
so I'm very excited
about this one.

640
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:27,930
I'm feeling very good
about this makeup.

641
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:30,132
I even think he looks better
than my sketch.

642
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,620
This is my favorite makeup
I've done.

643
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:53,756
She looks just like
I want her to look,

644
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,691
and I love it.

645
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:16,211
I see myself
a little bit there.

646
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:18,648
The hair looks wacky
and big like mine.

647
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:20,316
I just hope the judges like it.

648
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,703
I think
it's really, really funny.

649
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:44,273
It's definitely me,
but in anime form.

650
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,179
I'm not feeling good
about this, honestly.

651
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:10,433
The face is okay,
but the armature looks ugly.

652
00:30:30,854 --> 00:30:32,855
It's not the way
I wanted to paint it,

653
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:35,157
but it definitely looks like
what I had sketched out.

654
00:30:35,192 --> 00:30:36,692
I still like it.

655
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:44,483
Judges, it's time
to take a closer look

656
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:45,818
at our anime characters.

657
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:56,545
- Did a good job on the wig.
- Mm-hmm.

658
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,380
They should spend more time
on the eyes.

659
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:00,583
It just looks like
a sharpie painted...

660
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:02,651
Yeah.

661
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:06,989
Wow.
It's all one piece.

662
00:31:07,023 --> 00:31:09,258
Can you turn around for us?

663
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:10,493
That's a lot of scales.

664
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:12,027
In such a short amount of time,

665
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:13,596
he did lots
of complicated detail.

666
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,998
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

667
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:20,569
This isn't wardrobe.
This is all stuff that he did.

668
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:22,505
Yeah, that's a lot of work too.

669
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:24,323
- That's a neat prop.
- Yes.

670
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,678
She really tried to get
that reflectivity--

671
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:31,213
the way they draw anime.

672
00:31:31,248 --> 00:31:34,316
I get it.
The eyes are pretty accurate.

673
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,319
It looks like Niko.

674
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,588
He really hits
this counter-shading,

675
00:31:39,622 --> 00:31:41,724
the way that they blend
the paint in the anime.

676
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:43,759
I wish he would have brought
it up on the face a little.

677
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,128
Yeah, it's not good contrast
on the face.

678
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:47,530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

679
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,635
This thing
looks like Waldo on LSD.

680
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:58,273
Is this vacuform?

681
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,109
- Yeah, it's a vac--
- That's a good idea.

682
00:32:00,143 --> 00:32:02,778
All right.
Thank you.

683
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,714
I think the face
is the best part of it.

684
00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:06,782
Yeah.

685
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:09,618
Up close, far rougher
than far away.

686
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:10,986
The suit is falling apart.

687
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:12,621
It's just horrible.

688
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:15,941
I'm very worried
that I could be going home.

689
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:18,093
Shit.

690
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:19,862
We want to know what you think

691
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,030
of tonight's transformations.

692
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,899
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

693
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:29,618
Up close, far rougher
than far away.

694
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:31,153
The suit is just horrible.

695
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:33,122
It looks like it's falling apart
in front of the judges,

696
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:36,091
so, for me,
it's not looking good.

697
00:32:38,645 --> 00:32:40,029
The colors blend together.

698
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:41,880
It's hard to see the form.

699
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:43,966
I like what he did
with the hair.

700
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,001
Okay.
Thank you.

701
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:54,276
The judges have scored
your creations,

702
00:32:54,311 --> 00:32:55,844
so let's find out
what they thought.

703
00:32:55,879 --> 00:33:00,115
Daran, Corinne,

704
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,887
George, and Graham.

705
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:08,057
You are the best
and the worst this week.

706
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:09,141
The rest of you are safe

707
00:33:09,175 --> 00:33:11,393
and can head back
to the makeup room.

708
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:16,198
The judges will now like
to speak with each of you

709
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:17,399
to learn more about your work.

710
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,935
Daran, please step forward.

711
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,710
Tell us about your concept
and what inspired it.

712
00:33:27,744 --> 00:33:29,244
My alter ego is a person

713
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,996
who wants to break free
of society.

714
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:32,614
For me,
that's either birds or fish.

715
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:34,350
Because of Japan
and I love koi,

716
00:33:34,384 --> 00:33:36,352
I decided to go with the fish
on this one.

717
00:33:36,386 --> 00:33:40,856
The attention to detail
is quite impressive.

718
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:44,543
The scaling on the fish,
in particular, is gorgeous.

719
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:47,763
Also, working with
an animal form as an alter ego

720
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:50,866
is very prevalent
in anime fantasy.

721
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,167
So I think
you've done a great job.

722
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:53,302
Awesome.
Thank you.

723
00:33:53,336 --> 00:33:55,671
The transition
from the water up on to the fish

724
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:56,939
is quite beautiful.

725
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:59,508
The whole thing
is exquisitely executed.

726
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,210
- It's a beautiful makeup.
- Thank you.

727
00:34:01,244 --> 00:34:04,329
I am a fan of not using
the actor's eyes,

728
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:05,881
and I think you've done
a very good job

729
00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:07,816
making it even more discreet.

730
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:10,252
It feels like
it's a nasal opening.

731
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,221
That's what I was going for.
Thank you.

732
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,856
You have a great sense
of proportion,

733
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,958
and you create
something totally different

734
00:34:15,992 --> 00:34:17,326
from other people.

735
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,061
- It's really nice.
- That means a lot to me.

736
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,864
- Thank you very much.
- Daran, please step back.

737
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,805
Graham, please step forward.

738
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,546
Tell us the concept
behind your anime character.

739
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,881
I spend a lot of time
in a lab making monsters,

740
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,183
and I love plants.

741
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:42,351
This was a scientist

742
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:45,437
who turned himself
into a plant monster.

743
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:48,157
It looks like a reject

744
00:34:48,191 --> 00:34:51,326
from Poison Ivy's Lab.

745
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,663
The plant-life arm
and the whole thing--

746
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:56,031
I don't get that part of it.

747
00:34:56,066 --> 00:34:57,766
Yeah, I really wish
I could have done

748
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:59,034
a lot more painting.

749
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:00,619
The painting
would not have helped.

750
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,305
I expect much better from you.

751
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:07,476
Was this as an image
in your head when you started?

752
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,779
This is pretty close
to what I had illustrated.

753
00:35:10,814 --> 00:35:13,482
I really just bit off
a little more than I could chew.

754
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:16,218
It looks like
you didn't have enough time.

755
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:19,121
I don't understand
the big googly eyes

756
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:20,555
as part of the lenses.

757
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:22,391
The hair feels anime to me,

758
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:24,860
but a little shock of hair
on the top of this thing's

759
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:27,029
not gonna save it.

760
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:28,764
Graham, please step back.

761
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:36,405
Corinne, please step forward.

762
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,279
Tell us
about your alter ego here.

763
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:46,515
I love Halloween,

764
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:48,884
and she's a giver of tricks
and treats,

765
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:50,686
depending on what's deserved.

766
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,187
I think you've done a great job

767
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:56,792
capturing the essence
of what anime is.

768
00:35:56,826 --> 00:35:58,994
There's subtle sculpting
that feels anime,

769
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:00,229
particularly around the eyes.

770
00:36:00,263 --> 00:36:01,763
It's very delicate.

771
00:36:01,797 --> 00:36:04,299
I love that you drew
on the reflectivity.

772
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:06,768
That's very much in line with
the stylized drawing of eyes

773
00:36:06,803 --> 00:36:09,204
and the way that they teach
anime eye drawing.

774
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,505
- Well done.
- Thank you.

775
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:14,743
I think this character
is the most anime character.

776
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:17,746
What you did proportion-wise
is pretty nice.

777
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,747
Thank you.

778
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,716
Corinne, you can step back.

779
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:25,854
Good job, little lady.

780
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:28,056
George, please step up.

781
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:34,263
Tell me about your concept.

782
00:36:34,297 --> 00:36:36,615
Well, this blue crystal
is a meteorite,

783
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:39,168
and it's transforming me
into a mechanical superhero.

784
00:36:39,202 --> 00:36:41,236
And he's a peacemaker.

785
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:43,972
If I look at just the head,
it's good,

786
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:48,043
but that whole thing--
it looks so cheesy.

787
00:36:48,077 --> 00:36:51,380
This thing read, as soon
as it walked out, anime to me,

788
00:36:51,414 --> 00:36:53,281
but there are
some horrible decisions

789
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,833
that set you back.

790
00:36:54,884 --> 00:36:56,685
Why all the hard angles
on the face?

791
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:59,288
'Cause the crystal
is trying to transform my body

792
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:00,956
by making me
part of the whole suit.

793
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,424
But it's not sculpted that way,

794
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,459
and it sure as hell
is not painted that way.

795
00:37:04,494 --> 00:37:06,395
- It's all one color.
- I agree.

796
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,864
I actually like
the sculpt of the face,

797
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:11,666
but it just doesn't go
with anything else.

798
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:14,536
The overall execution
is so subpar

799
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:17,573
and particularly subpar
for you.

800
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,975
George, please step back.

801
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:25,681
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

802
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:27,499
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

803
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,851
- while they deliberate.
- Thank you.

804
00:37:34,624 --> 00:37:36,792
All right, judges,
why don't we talk

805
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:39,294
about the looks
you liked the most this week?

806
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:40,362
Let's start with Daran.

807
00:37:40,396 --> 00:37:42,764
Just to sculpt a koi--

808
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,499
the form itself is one thing.

809
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:48,237
Then to sculpt those scales
with such specificity

810
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:49,605
was really impressive.

811
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:52,307
I think the paint job
is really beautiful.

812
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:55,911
How he put the layers over it
is really nicely done.

813
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:57,379
The way it was kinetic
in the fact

814
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:59,815
that the fish
were swimming around his head--

815
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:01,316
I thought it was gorgeous.

816
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:03,285
All right,
let's move on to Corinne.

817
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:05,187
I thought
this was pretty fantastic.

818
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:06,755
I thought
the character was adorable.

819
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,573
She looked like
a cartoon to me.

820
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,025
Since it's anime,

821
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,294
the whole silhouette
is really important,

822
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:14,763
and the way she put the hair
around the head

823
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:17,465
and the balance with the face
and the size of the eyes,

824
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:19,167
that's a great thing
about that makeup,

825
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:20,502
is the proportion.

826
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:22,671
Let's move on to the looks
you liked the least.

827
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:25,407
- Let's start with Graham.
- This was a mess.

828
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:27,609
That big tree trunk tube
of an arm,

829
00:38:27,627 --> 00:38:29,962
and those big old goggles
took up most of the face.

830
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:31,463
You couldn't even see
an expression,

831
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:34,166
even if the thing was trying
to make an expression.

832
00:38:34,217 --> 00:38:37,552
It's probably his least
successful makeup he's done.

833
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:39,805
I did not see anything
that resembles

834
00:38:39,856 --> 00:38:42,024
Japanese influence at all
in that makeup.

835
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:44,860
This feels like
he had some wonky idea

836
00:38:44,894 --> 00:38:47,362
about doing a half-plant,
half-person,

837
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:48,730
jammed it into this challenge,

838
00:38:48,765 --> 00:38:50,399
and it went horribly wrong.

839
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,234
He is definitely better
than this.

840
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:53,669
All right,
let's move on to George.

841
00:38:53,703 --> 00:38:56,138
Here's another one
who's better than this.

842
00:38:56,172 --> 00:38:58,507
I love George's design sense.

843
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:01,476
It was just buried
under terrible fabrication

844
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,211
and terrible paint.

845
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:04,646
His attempt at weathering

846
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:08,149
looked like he literally had
paint on his hands

847
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,552
and just smeared it
on the white surface.

848
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:11,987
With George and Graham,

849
00:39:12,021 --> 00:39:15,324
I see the lack of planning
to carry to the end.

850
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:17,459
So, judges,
you have your special immunity.

851
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:20,195
Is that something you would like
to consider giving away tonight?

852
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:21,930
We have people on the bottom

853
00:39:21,964 --> 00:39:24,232
that have really showed skills
in the past.

854
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:27,169
Both are better
than what they've done tonight.

855
00:39:27,203 --> 00:39:28,670
You could say that about anyone

856
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:30,205
as we get deeper
into the competition.

857
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,207
Judges, have you made
your decisions?

858
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:37,312
Okay.
Let's bring them back out.

859
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,555
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

860
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:50,292
Daran, you gave us
a bizarrely beautiful creation,

861
00:39:50,326 --> 00:39:52,694
and we were truly impressed
with the level of detail

862
00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:53,995
in that sculpture.

863
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,132
Corinne, we thought
that you did an excellent job

864
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:59,334
capturing the spirit
of this challenge,

865
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,036
and your character was fun,

866
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,839
as well
as quintessentially anime.

867
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:05,841
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

868
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,076
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

869
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:15,723
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

870
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:18,993
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

871
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:22,363
Daran.

872
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,836
We have no idea where
you come up with this stuff,

873
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:31,206
but this was
an outrageously great makeup.

874
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,607
- Well done.
- Thank you very much.

875
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,025
I appreciate that.

876
00:40:34,076 --> 00:40:36,411
Winning the foundation challenge
with kazu as the judge

877
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:38,246
and then winning
the spotlight challenge,

878
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,313
it's pretty damn exciting.

879
00:40:39,331 --> 00:40:40,849
Daran, congratulations.

880
00:40:40,883 --> 00:40:43,418
You and Corinne can head back
to the makeup room.

881
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:51,059
Unfortunately,
that means the two of you

882
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,994
are on the bottom this week,

883
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:56,364
and one of you
will be eliminated.

884
00:40:56,398 --> 00:40:58,266
Please step forward.

885
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:07,242
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

886
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:09,043
Graham...

887
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:11,212
You started
with some interesting ideas,

888
00:41:11,247 --> 00:41:15,516
but somewhere along the way,
you went way off course.

889
00:41:15,518 --> 00:41:18,653
George,
your technical execution

890
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,289
is well below
what you're capable of.

891
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:23,875
So who is going home tonight?

892
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:25,960
The person
going home tonight is...

893
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:33,885
Graham.

894
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:36,120
We didn't see
the anime inspiration,

895
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:38,856
and the execution
was way off as well.

896
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:41,175
That means, George,
you are safe this week

897
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,111
and can head back
to the makeup room.

898
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:44,212
Thank you.

899
00:41:44,246 --> 00:41:46,681
Sorry, bro.

900
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:52,420
Graham, it is a real shame
to see you go

901
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:55,373
because you showed such promise
in earlier challenges,

902
00:41:55,407 --> 00:41:56,958
so much so that I thought

903
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:59,560
you might have made it
to the finale,

904
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:01,829
which is exactly why
we've decided to use

905
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:05,833
our special immunity tonight
and save you from elimination.

906
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,986
Wow.

907
00:42:08,037 --> 00:42:10,722
Make sure we didn't waste
this one opportunity

908
00:42:10,756 --> 00:42:11,872
we have this season.

909
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,142
Thank you
for this awesome chance,

910
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:16,144
and I think
this is a great catalyst

911
00:42:16,178 --> 00:42:18,313
- for my next challenge.
- I hope so.

912
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:20,481
All right, Graham,
that means you are also safe

913
00:42:20,516 --> 00:42:22,450
and can head back
to the makeup room.

914
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:24,385
- Thank you very much.
- Make it count.

915
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,821
You won't be sorry.

916
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:28,089
Holy moly.

917
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:30,908
I didn't expect
the judges to use that on me.

918
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,327
It's almost like a win.

919
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:37,332
Guess who they saved.

920
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:40,368
Shut up!

921
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:42,971
This special immunity

922
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:45,106
that they've never awarded
anybody ever

923
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,008
in the history of <i>Face Off--</i>

924
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,142
they gave it to me.

925
00:42:48,177 --> 00:42:49,844
You deserve it, my friend.

926
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:51,112
- They believe in you.
- Me!

927
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:54,248
This second chance
is giving me a push

928
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:56,050
to do even better.

929
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:58,453
So I'm ready
for the next challenge.
