1
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:02,793
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,830
The artists brought Patrick's
complex alien designs to life.

3
00:00:06,898 --> 00:00:08,365
I have to impress Patrick.

4
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:10,801
It's gonna be a catastrophe
if it doesn't work.

5
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:13,503
Despite major
problems, Ian claimed victory.

6
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:16,139
And in a shocking
double-elimination,

7
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:19,276
Tara and Jerry went home.

8
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:21,178
Now, six artists remain.

9
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,346
And tonight...

10
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:26,950
They'll face an extraordinarily
difficult new challenge.

11
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,085
Oh, my goodness.

12
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:30,353
What the hell am I going to do?

13
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:33,790
But for some, the intense
pressure is too much to handle.

14
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:34,791
It's fucking horrible.

15
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:35,792
I hate this.

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,827
Are you kidding me?

17
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:38,829
Sue has lost her damn mind.

18
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,097
I'm out of time.

19
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:42,165
I don't wanna go home for this.

20
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,200
What the hell
were you thinking?

21
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:44,935
I could easily see myself

22
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,002
being a bottom look.

23
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,370
The build turned into this

24
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,272
ballet of idiocy.

25
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,275
And to make it to the top,

26
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,778
they'll have to impress our
award-winning panel of judges.

27
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,380
- Ve Neill, three-time
Oscar-winning makeup artist

28
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:01,351
whose work includes <i>Beetlejuice,</i>
and <i>The Amazing Spiderman.</i>

29
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:03,253
Patrick Tatopoulos,

30
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,189
production designer on this
summer's <i>Total Recall</i>

31
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:09,226
and director of <i>Underworld,</i>
<i>Rise of the Lycans.</i>

32
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,161
And Glenn Hetrick,

33
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:13,430
cutting-edge makeup artist on
<i>The Hunger Games</i>

34
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:15,899
and custom designer
for Lady Gaga.

35
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,502
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic

36
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:22,339
and earn $25,000 in makeup
supplies from Alcone,

37
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:25,942
the reinvented
2012 Toyota Camry hybrid,

38
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,145
and $100,000?

39
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:31,014
Only one will win <i>Face Off!</i>

40
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,875
Sync and corrections by n17t01

41
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,653
Oh, it's too early.

44
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,091
It's a little weird
being only six of us left.

45
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,092
Yeah.

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,093
There's only six of us left in

47
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,029
the house and it makes the final

48
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,697
goal that much easier to see.

49
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,400
I cannot wait to see
my boyfriend...

50
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:24,935
Be able to call the family...

51
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:26,236
Yeah.

52
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:27,437
At this point in the competition

53
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,973
I'm getting really,
really homesick.

54
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,075
It didn't matter
what I was doing

55
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:33,877
as long as I could go home
and see the family

56
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,645
and tuck the kids in at night.

57
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,981
You know, that gave me, like,
this invincibility boost.

58
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,849
Yeah.

59
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,886
Each day that goes by without
them you get, like, just...

60
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,454
More and more drained.

61
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:45,689
Yeah, more doubt, you know?

62
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,724
More-- You lose that confidence.

63
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,692
It's really hard.

64
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,628
I'm always thinking about them.

65
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:57,634
I just can't think
about missing them.

66
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:00,737
I want to see their faces every
day, but at the same time,

67
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,673
I've gotta remain in this
competition and I've gotta

68
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:07,777
put all that emotion and just
turn it into these characters

69
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:10,614
and really brute force
through this thing.

70
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:24,060
Walking up, we really have no
idea where we're going.

71
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,062
We see these giant towers.

72
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,298
Just huge structures, you know?

73
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:31,201
They're pretty amazing.

74
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,476
Welcome to the Watts Towers.

75
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:40,844
What do you think?

76
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:41,845
It's beautiful.

77
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:44,781
Amazing.

78
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,884
Once upon a time, this was
just an empty ordinary lot,

79
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:49,919
indistinguishable from
anything else around it.

80
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:53,256
But with imagination and vision,
it was transformed into

81
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,125
an urban artistic oasis.

82
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:57,027
Turning something mundane
into something

83
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:58,928
actually quite extraordinary.

84
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:04,334
That is the underlying premise
for your challenge this week.

85
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:08,171
You're being whisked away to the
fantastic and whimsical world...

86
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,739
Of Tim Burton.

87
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:10,907
Are you kidding?

88
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:11,941
Yes.

89
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:13,476
I'm a huge fan of Tim Burton

90
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,511
since I was a kid.

91
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,512
<i>Edward Scissorhands,</i>

92
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,479
<i>Beetlejuice,</i>

93
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,814
The Penguin... That...

94
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,950
Childlike, sweet center,
wrapped in a twisted

95
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:23,153
barbwire concoction
of black and white.

96
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,556
It's a crazy juxtaposition
that just really works.

97
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,391
This challenge is made for me.

98
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,394
Tim has a way of taking
people with ordinary lives

99
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:33,596
and professions and
turning them into

100
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:36,099
wild and wacky feature
characters for his films.

101
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,436
Such as everyone's favorite
topiary artist and hairstylist,

102
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:43,139
the misunderstood loner,
Edward Scissorhands.

103
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,208
Your spotlight challenge
this week is to create

104
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:48,545
a whimsical character inspired
by an everyday profession,

105
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:51,581
worthy of being featured
in a Tim Burton film.

106
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:52,816
- Oh, my God.
- So...

107
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,584
How awesome.

108
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,152
These are your choices...

109
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,188
Plumber...

110
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,924
Ice cream man, chef,
baker, toymaker,

111
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:04,661
mailman, cellist,
farmer and bellhop.

112
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,496
So let's see who's
gonna go first.

113
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:09,966
Sue.

114
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:13,103
The first one on the list that
I really want is toymaker.

115
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,437
Toymaker.

116
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:16,306
Sue grabbed toymaker.

117
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:19,109
Then I'm thinking,
I gotta get baker.

118
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:20,076
Baker.

119
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:21,177
But then Beki grabs bake

120
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:22,712
- cellist.
- Ice cream man.

121
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,115
- Lo and behold, one-by-one,
they all start to disappear.

122
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:26,649
Plumber.

123
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,184
Yep.

124
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:29,786
RJ.

125
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,354
Bellhop.

126
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:32,589
Okay, that's cool.

127
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:33,823
Now before you head
back to the lab,

128
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:35,024
why don't you just
take a minute to sketch

129
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:37,961
and let this beautiful
place inspire designs.

130
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:40,397
Tomorrow, I'm gonna be doing
a walkthrough with ve,

131
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:43,299
who's actually worked on
five Tim Burton films.

132
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:46,836
So make sure to bring your
"A" game, guys.

133
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:47,837
Cool, cool.

134
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:51,341
I'll see you all tomorrow.

135
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,909
I'm totally hyped
about this challenge.

136
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,079
I can't wait to get
my hands into this.

137
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,213
Sitting in front
of the Watts Towers,

138
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:59,082
the shape of the tower
speaks to me,

139
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,417
and so I just start drawing this

140
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,219
huge pointed cone on top
of my character's head.

141
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:06,990
He's an ice cream inventor.

142
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:09,993
His lab exploded,
fusing his anatomy and DNA

143
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,096
with his own creations,
so now he's this chocolaty,

144
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,899
ice-cream-sprinkled,
waffle-cone-headed clown.

145
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,370
If you think about
Burton characters,

146
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:22,338
they're not heavily
makeup oriented.

147
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:23,506
That's what we were
just talking about.

148
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:25,475
Think about how
subtle all those

149
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:27,210
makeups were in
<i>Alice In Wonderland.</i>

150
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:28,878
I already see this character.

151
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,281
She lives in the realm of
<i>Alice In Wonderland.</i>

152
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,450
She's in love with the hatter,
who works next door.

153
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:36,853
Becomes toxified by
chemicals that he uses.

154
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,855
I'm gonna make a big cupcake
and a cherry.

155
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:40,690
I already know what I wanna do
when I get back to the lab.

156
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:42,392
All right, guys,
let's head out.

157
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,360
I feel like mine's just gonna
be sweet and simple.

158
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:46,262
No pun intended.

159
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:58,508
We get back to the lab and,
because I was the last one

160
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,710
to choose the profession,
I got the first draw

161
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:02,312
for the head cast.

162
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:05,782
And I picked Landon, because I
had worked with Landon before.

163
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,251
Landon really sells
anything you put on him.

164
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,287
He's also really tall and lanky.

165
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:14,090
Just like 90% of
Tim Burton's characters.

166
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:22,699
I'm very nervous
about this challenge

167
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:25,168
because I'm going very
subtle on appliances

168
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,970
and more fabrication-heavy.

169
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:28,438
Tim Burton does
a lot of gear work,

170
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:30,139
uh, steampunk kind of feelings.

171
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:33,409
And I'm thinking plumber would
be very mechanically inclined.

172
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:37,514
So I'm building a hydraulic
plunger backpack.

173
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,683
I'm only doing two appliances
that are on the face.

174
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:44,153
With this eyepiece, I figure
he was working on a radiator

175
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:48,157
and steam blasted him in the
face and burnt his eye.

176
00:07:48,225 --> 00:07:52,962
I go over and horde all
of the really dense foam.

177
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:58,635
I'm thinking the bellhop has
become part of the luggage.

178
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:01,804
So he has drawers in his chest
like a trunk would have,

179
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,641
and he can open his drawers
and pull out clothing.

180
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:13,116
Immediately, I start sculpting
my original design,

181
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:16,653
which was almost like she's
becoming a cello herself.

182
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,655
And then I came up
with this design,

183
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,023
which is a little more sleek,
and it uses

184
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,192
more the model's face.

185
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,529
I wanted to see if I could bring
in another character,

186
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:29,699
and so what I decided to do
was actually take the cello

187
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,734
and put a face up
here in the corner,

188
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,538
almost like the cello was
morphed into a human

189
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:41,377
and it's her love.

190
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:45,248
For my toymaker, my concept
is, in this remote village

191
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,684
where no one can have kids,
and this toymaker

192
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,320
decides to start
making toy children.

193
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:52,388
So this entire town
is carrying around

194
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,357
these creepy-looking
marionettes.

195
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:59,295
I'm really worried, only because
I've never made a puppet before.

196
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:01,230
Whoa.

197
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:09,038
I got my eyepiece sculpted and
it's looking really cool.

198
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:12,208
But then I walk by Sue
and I look at her sculpt

199
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:13,977
and I'm, like, "oh, my God."

200
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,979
We're doing the same thing.

201
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:18,648
Sue and I are both doing
a one eye covered.

202
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:19,949
Oh, really?

203
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,517
I'm freaking out right now.

204
00:09:21,585 --> 00:09:23,419
Sue?

205
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,623
Are you kidding me?

206
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,890
I hate this.

207
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,827
I don't think I can
use this appliance.

208
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:33,596
This could kill me.

209
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:34,831
Coming up...

210
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,699
Sue is doing another
old-age makeup.

211
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,535
I don't think Beki is
gonna use any appliances.

212
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,937
There's that voice
in my head that says,

213
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:41,971
"you didn't do enough."

214
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:42,972
I don't think he looks like

215
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,007
a Tim Burton character.

216
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:44,941
I love that.

217
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,821
- We're creating
a Tim Burton-like character

218
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:56,657
based on very ordinary
professions and making them

219
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,826
extraordinary and whimsical.

220
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:02,663
I got my eyepiece sculpted and
it's looking really cool.

221
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,801
Then I walk by Sue and
I'm like, "oh, my God."

222
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:10,104
We're doing the same thing.

223
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:13,374
I know that Ian has a huge
advantage over me

224
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:16,010
by being more experienced
at fabricating,

225
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,813
and all I have is my
originality.

226
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:24,819
Did you take the eye out, Sue?

227
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:28,789
Yeah, I'm going to have it
on the actual mechanism.

228
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:30,091
- Oh, gotcha.
- So that...

229
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:31,992
They can see both of the eyes.

230
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,160
Thank God.

231
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:34,462
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

232
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,263
That's gonna be crazy.

233
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,699
I'm going to make a
little headpiece with

234
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,769
a magnifying glass that
a lot of toymakers have

235
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:44,572
when they're tinkering
with stuff.

236
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:49,543
Day one's winding down
and I still don't know

237
00:10:49,611 --> 00:10:51,278
what I'm gonna do
for the paint scheme.

238
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,446
There's a lot of different
possibilities.

239
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:54,281
That's time, everybody!

240
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,684
Hopefully, I'll get some
good sleep, think about it,

241
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:59,453
and have an idea
tomorrow morning.

242
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:11,732
Second day in the lab.

243
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,868
We got ten hours today,
which is great.

244
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,670
I come in, look at my
silicone appliance...

245
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,407
There's no way I can
even use these.

246
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,843
I have to blend the edge of the
appliance and the skin

247
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:24,678
and make the edges invisible.

248
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,580
But the edges are
just too thick.

249
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:28,048
It's fucking horrible.

250
00:11:28,116 --> 00:11:30,851
Like,
I'm gonna have to redo it.

251
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:35,923
I feel like I'm doing
really well today.

252
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:39,393
I feel like everything that I'm
planning on is on schedule.

253
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:41,762
Is that big enough or should I
make this dome bigger?

254
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,331
I have a little bit
more time than usual

255
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,134
to focus on some
smaller details.

256
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,777
I'm looking around
and I notice that Beki

257
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:59,613
is still working on her cupcake

258
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,483
that's in no-- nothing else.

259
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,986
So I don't know what's really
going on with her.

260
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:08,088
By the end of today,
I would like

261
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:11,058
to have the cupcake completed.

262
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:13,561
I'm gonna add some pigments,
and just put that on top

263
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,095
so it looks like it actually has
real icing on it.

264
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:16,497
Are you gonna mold that?

265
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:19,700
Yeah, so that it, like,
is shiny and hardens.

266
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:22,002
I don't need to
sculpt a crazy face.

267
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,305
I'm just gonna be
hiding her eyebrows

268
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,506
and doing a dental appliance,

269
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:29,677
which I can do on
application day.

270
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,279
Morning everybody.

271
00:12:32,347 --> 00:12:33,781
Morning.

272
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:34,982
- I am here with Ve.
- Morning.

273
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:35,883
We're gonna do
a little walkthrough

274
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,251
and check out your work.

275
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,587
Ve is the perfect person
to judge makeups

276
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,021
based on Tim Burton's work,

277
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,723
because she's brought his
creatures to life.

278
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,291
I got the bellhop.

279
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,694
Growing up I remember,
in a magazine, you had a...

280
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:50,531
A print out of how you applied
your penguin on Danny Devito

281
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,900
with the pieces and
how you based it out

282
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,802
with the packs first
and then you went in

283
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:56,670
with the colors afterward
and all that stuff.

284
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:57,571
- Right.
- So I think I'm gonna try that.

285
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,440
If you match the prosthetics

286
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:02,509
to their skin tone first,
then you have, like,

287
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:06,113
a blank canvas again
so when you go to apply

288
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,915
the pale makeup,
it goes on a lot easier.

289
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,516
Right, I think that's
what I'm gonna try and do.

290
00:13:09,584 --> 00:13:11,885
Ooh, this is cool.

291
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,255
Thanks, it's-- it's more
of a-- a tragic villain.

292
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:15,823
How are you gonna color it?

293
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,893
I'm going for a white with
maybe some purples and reds,

294
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:22,429
and I want some,
like, brown chocolate syrup.

295
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:23,330
You know?

296
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:24,665
For some of the red--

297
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,899
Instead of the reds,
you see chocolate syrup.

298
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:26,800
- Good luck.
- It's going good.

299
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:28,202
Thank you.

300
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,505
I'm going more fabrication
instead of makeup.

301
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:33,574
I'm only gonna have
two appliances going on.

302
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,743
One of them is his eye.

303
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,911
Can I see your appliance?

304
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,380
Oh, and you're doing it
out of silicone?

305
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:40,681
These edges are kind of
thick, aren't they?

306
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:42,182
Yeah, that's what
I was looking at too.

307
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,417
I'll fix it.

308
00:13:43,485 --> 00:13:44,718
I might even
re-sculpt another one

309
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,720
if I can't get it to look good.

310
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:48,989
I actually went through
a few different designs.

311
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:51,225
It's just a-- a face prosthetic.

312
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,359
Sometimes less is more.

313
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:53,627
I mean, you know, you don't

314
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:54,762
necessarily
have to cover their,

315
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:56,263
you know, face with prosthetics

316
00:13:56,331 --> 00:13:57,665
to get a Tim Burton character.

317
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:59,700
If it's better to use
your time more wisely

318
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:02,102
giving your great paintjob
and working on your props,

319
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,506
then perhaps that
one prosthetic could be enough.

320
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,042
The other thing I wanna bring
to this is-- it's kind of risky,

321
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:11,612
but I was working on some cello
designs with a face in it.

322
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,149
And she has a flowing emotional
dance with this cello, so...

323
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,150
Wow.

324
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,319
This dynamic with her cello is

325
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:19,887
a lot of the stuff
I'm feeling inside,

326
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:21,822
being away from my wife,
being away from the kids.

327
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,024
This is the stuff
I'm going through

328
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:25,426
so that's a release for me.

329
00:14:25,493 --> 00:14:28,128
My concept is that
there's a toymaker

330
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:29,830
in a very remote
town where somehow

331
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:31,932
everyone in the village
has become sterile...

332
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,734
...there's no kids
and everyone starts...

333
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:35,369
...it's very gloomy
and there's no...

334
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,071
...and then what ends up
happening is that

335
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:38,806
all his friends
start dying off...

336
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:40,741
...so this toymaker starts
making these puppets...

337
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:42,076
...he takes their brains

338
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:46,914
and then sticks them
onto the puppets.

339
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,349
They're gonna have brains
on top of their heads?

340
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,516
Yes.

341
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:50,451
I'm gonna have the tops
of the head

342
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:51,819
just shaved off...

343
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:54,254
And then have a brain on top
and then cover it.

344
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:55,422
What's this going on over here?

345
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,558
Um, I'm making him a fat suit.

346
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,159
- Wow, that's a lot of work.
- That is a lot.

347
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:02,096
I know that the judges want
to see a full makeup from me,

348
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,864
more than just a headpiece.

349
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:06,266
So I have to step it up.

350
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,001
You see this is kind
of an opportunity for us

351
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:11,138
to go sort of minimalistic
with our makeups,

352
00:15:11,206 --> 00:15:14,174
but maybe bright and vibrant
with the makeup job

353
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:15,743
that we actually
apply to the face.

354
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,246
So your Tim Burton thing is
more about the whole look of it.

355
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,382
The stripes and the colors
and the swirls and the--

356
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:22,716
Yeah.

357
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,385
I really think that
I'm creating something

358
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:27,221
that's nice and that I'm not
doing anything that's too much.

359
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,093
How do you think they're doing?

360
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:34,928
I like Rayce's character.

361
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:36,997
I like the way he's
making that cello

362
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:39,833
and giving her that
swoop on her forehead.

363
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:41,802
I'm a little concerned
about Ian.

364
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,805
Yeah, he seems...
troubled with his concept.

365
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:48,842
He seems a little indecisive
about where he's going.

366
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,245
Sue is really biting off a lot.

367
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:54,181
I'm afraid she might not be
budgeting her time well.

368
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:56,817
You know, if she pre-paints it,
she'll probably do okay,

369
00:15:56,885 --> 00:16:01,722
but, I mean, that's a lot of
work for one person to do.

370
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,056
- Beki--
- And the giant cupcake.

371
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:04,558
And the ginormous cupcake?

372
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,126
I think because of the fact

373
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:08,095
that she's not
doing prosthetics,

374
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:09,863
she's really gonna
have to do, you know,

375
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,933
a really fabulous paintjob
and really pull off

376
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,503
a great Tim Burton character.

377
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:18,972
All right, guys,
it's looking good.

378
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,207
Good luck, we'll
see you tomorrow.

379
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:21,208
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye.

380
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:24,044
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

381
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:32,219
Sue is doing another old-age
makeup, it looks like.

382
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:36,056
I feel that that's really
the wrong way to go with this.

383
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,127
I'm looking around the room.

384
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:41,728
I see that everyone
else is sculpting

385
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:46,700
these crazy faces, and because
my makeup is very simplistic,

386
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:48,602
I start getting worried.

387
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:54,508
I just think that
everyone else is going

388
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,944
so crazy with the
fucking appliances

389
00:16:57,011 --> 00:17:00,881
and the facial pieces that
mine's gonna be, like...

390
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,484
I don't know.

391
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:05,052
Beki I don't think is
gonna use any appliances.

392
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,589
She's building a great cupcake,
but other than that,

393
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,357
I don't think
she's doing anything.

394
00:17:10,425 --> 00:17:13,994
I don't have a full
facial prosthetic.

395
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:15,362
Maybe I'm wasting time.

396
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,264
I don't know.

397
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:28,041
Beki, I don't think is gonna
use any appliances.

398
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:32,079
She's building a great cupcake,
but other than that,

399
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:35,749
I don't think she's
doing anything.

400
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:37,517
Maybe I'm wasting my time,
I don't know.

401
00:17:37,585 --> 00:17:40,887
But I also feel very
strongly about my character

402
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,856
and how she will look
on application day.

403
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:46,193
So I'm gonna stay
with my original concept.

404
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,995
I'm not going over-the-top
crazy this time.

405
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:57,437
Maybe I don't understand
the concept here.

406
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,072
You have <i>Planet Of The Apes,</i>

407
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,774
you have <i>Sleepy Hollow,</i>
<i>Big Fish,</i>

408
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,609
and <i>Willy Wonka And The</i>
<i>Chocolate Factory,</i>

409
00:18:02,677 --> 00:18:04,211
which are all
very different films.

410
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:08,081
Burton has all these different
genres he's worked in,

411
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:09,616
and I don't really know
what the judges want.

412
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:13,386
It's really frustrating,
this one.

413
00:18:13,454 --> 00:18:16,256
Today is ice cream day.

414
00:18:16,324 --> 00:18:17,891
So I finish my sculpt
and I begin molding

415
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,794
a square form
of a waffle sheet,

416
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:23,163
and I'm gonna run
latex for a skin

417
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:25,098
and polyfoam for
the ice cream cones.

418
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,100
So it will be lighter
and squishier.

419
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:31,304
I only have one mold, and I have
to make 12 different pieces.

420
00:18:31,372 --> 00:18:34,708
So it's all drying
and pouring latex.

421
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:39,946
And that's what's taking
a lot of time.

422
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:46,553
There's so much to do.

423
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:47,821
I'm really worried.

424
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:49,990
This could be the challenge
that I go home.

425
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:53,894
I just have a lot of stuff
going on, and I need to edit.

426
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:56,029
I'm not going to do
two puppets at this point.

427
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:57,063
Are you kidding me?

428
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:58,965
What was I thinking?

429
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:05,038
When I start to
paint the backpack

430
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:08,475
and age it up a little bit with
some water, it starts to pop.

431
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:11,778
It's really starting to come
together and look metallic.

432
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,581
It's looking pretty good,
I'm kind of excited now.

433
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,423
That's time, guys.

434
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:35,435
When we get to the house, I'm
really worried at this point,

435
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:36,903
but at the same time,

436
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:39,573
it seems like Beki's really
worried too.

437
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,042
God, it is really daunting
though, how everyone else--

438
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:43,510
Yeah, oh, yeah.

439
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:45,679
Is bringing out
the big guns on this one.

440
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:47,981
Yeah, I mean, I-- I started
getting really nervous

441
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,351
when everyone was sculpting
a face, and I was like,

442
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:52,519
"I'm just gonna
bring out a cupcake."

443
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:53,954
Well, it seems
like everyone else

444
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:56,756
is very well-rounded,
and I need to prove myself from,

445
00:19:56,824 --> 00:19:58,191
you know, last challenge.

446
00:19:58,259 --> 00:19:59,926
Sue's feeling
a little apprehensive.

447
00:19:59,994 --> 00:20:03,864
I do believe that she is
skating on very thin ice.

448
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:05,832
And if she can't pull all
those pieces together,

449
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,200
she will have a problem.

450
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:10,270
I'm definitely not gonna go
without a fight.

451
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:23,416
It's day three,
application day.

452
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:25,218
We have four hours
to work on our models

453
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:29,022
and apply the prosthetics
and the makeup.

454
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,991
That's good.

455
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:32,492
It's the final six people,

456
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,196
so all stakes are high
for everybody.

457
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:38,999
And it gets pretty intense
on application day.

458
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,704
When you have that four hours
and it's ticking by so fast,

459
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:46,840
you start really
understanding your time.

460
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:51,478
Even rolling out paper towels
takes about a minute.

461
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:54,281
I could have spent a minute
doing something else.

462
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,517
Nice to meet you.

463
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,686
- I missed you so much.
- Aw.

464
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:01,922
- Nice to meet you finally.
- Nice to meet you. Tommy.

465
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:03,423
I start painting
the prosthetic.

466
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,025
Before I apply it,
I'll put at least

467
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:06,526
a good hour in
there of painting it.

468
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:09,930
That way, I know for sure that
my paintjob's gonna be spot on.

469
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:12,432
See if this'll be
uncomfortable for you.

470
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
All right, close your eye.

471
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,368
I apply the eye prosthetic

472
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:16,703
and I start to paint him.

473
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:18,772
He looks exactly like
a Tim Burton character.

474
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,807
It's weird how much you look
like Johnny Depp.

475
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,209
I'm gonna go with it.

476
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:24,511
You're the bellhop.

477
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:27,113
You're gonna pull
pantyhose and scarves

478
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:29,382
and then a big girdle out of
this little tiny drawer.

479
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:31,084
And then you can--

480
00:21:31,152 --> 00:21:33,720
- Ring your bell, okay?
- That's funny.

481
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,188
I'm feeling really good.

482
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:36,957
See if you can get that on.

483
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:38,925
Everything is on schedule.
Perfect.

484
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,595
Thank God, because having
a butt-pile of work to get done

485
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:44,331
on application day
will screw you up.

486
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:46,232
Hang on.

487
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:53,740
I need some kind of help
to pull this through.

488
00:21:53,808 --> 00:21:57,844
I'm really behind, but if you
can help me if you don't mind...

489
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:01,481
And I'm thinking if models can
help blow-dry themselves,

490
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,683
why not help cutting
some things up?

491
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:06,619
You're gonna cut all these
up as little stickers

492
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,288
and stick 'em on
the back of these.

493
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:11,191
- And then--
- Yeah, of course.

494
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:18,732
Oh, my God.
Yeah. Thank you so much.

495
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,834
Sue has lost her damn mind.

496
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:22,369
I have another project for you.

497
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:24,237
- Okay.
- See how this hair's kinky?

498
00:22:24,305 --> 00:22:26,072
- Yeah.
- Just straighten it our for me.

499
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,875
I feel like a crazy
toymaker right now.

500
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,615
Go like this for me.

501
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:38,018
I'm looking around,
and Sue's running a sweatshop

502
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:40,954
in the other corner of the room.

503
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:48,161
What the hell is she doing?

504
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:57,737
Maybe it's the calm before the
storm, but I'm feeling good.

505
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:06,746
This is the only time

506
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:08,681
where I might actually
have time to spare.

507
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:10,350
But then there's always
that little voice

508
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:11,885
in my head that says,
"well, maybe

509
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:15,155
that's because
you didn't do enough."

510
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:16,756
That's time, everybody.

511
00:23:16,824 --> 00:23:19,793
I only have one hour
backstage to finish.

512
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,661
I don't even
have his makeup on.

513
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,464
What the hell am I going to do?

514
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,769
Coming up...

515
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:31,237
Oh, my goodness.

516
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:34,107
I'm out of time.

517
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:35,775
I'm seriously impressed.

518
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:37,043
Wow.

519
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,045
I love the costume,
I love the makeup.

520
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,880
All I can see is
this ballet of idiocy.

521
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:52,007
We only have one hour left,
and I need to paint,

522
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:54,476
I need to do an actual
character makeup on him,

523
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:58,280
and on top of that, I still
need to finish the puppet.

524
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,918
Last looks, it's ridiculous.

525
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,686
There's never enough time
within that hour.

526
00:24:04,754 --> 00:24:06,655
It actually feels like
it's 15 minutes.

527
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:08,056
Like,
it just flies by so quick.

528
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:09,024
Yeah.

529
00:24:09,091 --> 00:24:10,425
Do you know how to hold this?

530
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:11,293
Oh, my goodness.

531
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,963
I'm running out of time.

532
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:17,766
I don't know how I'm
gonna pull this out.

533
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:23,939
All right, guys, time's up.

534
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,840
Put 'em down.

535
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,583
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

536
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:39,421
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

537
00:24:39,488 --> 00:24:40,689
Say hello to your judges.

538
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,490
Owner of optic nerve makeup
effects studio,

539
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:43,491
Glenn Hetrick.

540
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,293
Good evening.

541
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:46,661
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

542
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:47,829
Hi, everybody.

543
00:24:47,897 --> 00:24:49,297
Creature designer and director,

544
00:24:49,365 --> 00:24:50,598
Patrick Tatopoulos.

545
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:51,700
Hello.

546
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,635
And joining our panel
this week,

547
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:56,237
she is one of Tim Burton's
go-to actresses

548
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:58,473
for films like <i>Beetlejuice,</i>

549
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:00,108
<i>The Nightmare Before Christmas,</i>

550
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:03,278
and the upcoming film,
<i>Frankenweenie.</i>

551
00:25:03,346 --> 00:25:05,280
Please welcome
Catherine O'Hara.

552
00:25:05,348 --> 00:25:07,482
Hi.

553
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,684
This woman is a comedic icon.

554
00:25:09,752 --> 00:25:11,853
So it's exciting
for everybody, really.

555
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,621
This is kind of a reunion
for you and Ve.

556
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:14,689
It is.

557
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:16,257
We did <i>Beetlejuice</i> together.

558
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,493
She did some wonderful
special effects makeup

559
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,428
and made me look
frighteningly gorgeous.

560
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:21,663
I did.

561
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:22,831
Catherine, thank you
so much for being here.

562
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:23,798
Thank you.

563
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:25,333
So this week,

564
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:27,902
your spotlight challenge was
to take an ordinary profession

565
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,638
and create a character
worthy of being featured

566
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:32,140
in a Tim Burton film.

567
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,608
Let's see what you've
come up with.

568
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:35,510
First up is Ian.

569
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,255
I think he looks
damn cool onstage.

570
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:09,177
He looks like a, afterlife plumber.
I really like it.

571
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,268
I love the character.

572
00:26:33,335 --> 00:26:35,837
It's colorful and striking,

573
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:38,673
and it's exactly
what I wanted it to look like.

574
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,831
I love the ice cream man.

575
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:06,234
He's so colorful,
so delicious-looking,

576
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:09,037
and he's just
a-- a feast for the eyes.

577
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,998
I'm just so proud of myself.

578
00:27:37,066 --> 00:27:39,834
I can't believe
I pulled that off.

579
00:28:09,832 --> 00:28:12,033
I think I can see my character
in a Tim Burton movie.

580
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:14,235
But then I also put
my twist on it

581
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:16,504
because I'm tired
of being a runner-up.

582
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:19,307
I didn't come here to just
be... almost good enough.

583
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:52,674
I'm just loving it.

584
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,375
I'm starting to grin
from ear-to-ear.

585
00:28:54,443 --> 00:28:57,178
And I really think I did
a good job, myself.

586
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:06,154
All right, judges, why don't
you take a closer look?

587
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:12,894
They make all the props too?

588
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:14,729
- Yeah.
- Wow.

589
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:17,165
The back prop
is cardboard and hot glue.

590
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,933
So I'm sitting there as Glenn's
pulling on it.

591
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:22,704
It's gonna fall apart.

592
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,809
Open your mouth... All the way
so I can the bottoms too.

593
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:31,246
Before it was painted
and everything,

594
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:33,014
it was six hours on the cupcake.

595
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:35,783
I don't know about the cherry.

596
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:37,585
Yeah, no, this is
one big piece, yeah.

597
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:40,722
Oh, no thanks, I ate.

598
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:42,957
It looks good.

599
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:44,859
Is that silicone?

600
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:53,534
Mine's the only one
that looks super realistic,

601
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:56,404
but it may not be
the most Burtonesque.

602
00:29:56,472 --> 00:29:58,906
So, I'm starting
to get really worried.

603
00:29:58,974 --> 00:30:00,708
I don't wanna go home for this.

604
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,454
Mine may not be
the most Burtonesque,

605
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:09,323
so I'm really worried.

606
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,158
That's cool.
Wow, yeah, nice movement.

607
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,063
It's anybody's game,
and I could easily see myself

608
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:18,465
being a bottom look, just
'cause they're all so close

609
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:20,868
and they all depict different
areas of Tim Burton.

610
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:22,636
Can you spin this around so we
can take a look at the back?

611
00:30:22,704 --> 00:30:25,439
This is really cool.

612
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:31,612
Yes.

613
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:33,981
Thank you.

614
00:30:36,818 --> 00:30:39,586
I'm laughing and having a
heart attack at the same time.

615
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,759
So, Catherine,
you know what it takes

616
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,828
to make a great
Tim Burton character.

617
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:49,363
How do you think they did?

618
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,498
I'm seriously impressed.
Wow.

619
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:54,234
When I think of Tim Burton,
I think of beautiful balance

620
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:57,337
between dark and light
and creepy and funny,

621
00:30:57,405 --> 00:30:58,338
and it's all there.

622
00:30:58,406 --> 00:30:59,339
Great characters.

623
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:00,340
Congratulations.

624
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,376
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

625
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,077
All right, well,
the judges would like to speak

626
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,046
with each of you to learn
more about your work.

627
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,481
Matt, you're up first.

628
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:08,382
All right.

629
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:14,288
Tell me more about the makeup.

630
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:16,490
I sculpted the waffle sheet,

631
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:18,725
wrapped a sheet of foam
around for the cone,

632
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,595
I used polyfoam for
the ice cream itself,

633
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:24,264
and some 3rd degree
for this chocolate.

634
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:27,901
This is more of what I've been
looking for out of you.

635
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,337
The balance of what you did,
integrating the actual

636
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,773
cones into the makeup
was very wise.

637
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,142
I love the costume,
I love the makeup.

638
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,110
If Tim Burton was gonna
make a horror movie,

639
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:40,247
this guy would be in it.

640
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,682
I did not think
he was too scary at all.

641
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:45,118
I think he's really funny,
and I see that he thinks

642
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,521
he can get out of the truck
and meet the kids.

643
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:50,357
It looks like he doesn't have
any idea how scary he looks.

644
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:53,660
Very <i>Beetlejuice</i> to me.

645
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:55,095
All right, Matt,
you can step back.

646
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,564
Thank you very much.

647
00:31:57,632 --> 00:31:59,466
Beki, you're next.

648
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,072
Okay, Beki,
I would like to know

649
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:06,907
what the hell
were you thinking?

650
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,008
No, what's your story?

651
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,611
Oh... I'm like, "um..."

652
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,312
I'm sorry.

653
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,514
She is a baker.

654
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:15,015
She falls in love
with this hatter.

655
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,151
He ends up leaving, and it
makes her completely crazy.

656
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,786
You've got the stripes down.

657
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,388
You've got
the Tim Burton stripes.

658
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:24,358
Unfortunately, this just echoes

659
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,660
something that already exists.

660
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:29,863
I'm not sure what is it
you did with all of your time.

661
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:31,431
Can you tell me?

662
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,634
I basically got the concept
together, I made the teeth,

663
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,104
um, made the big gigantic
cupcake and the cherry.

664
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,139
I gotta tell you,
I'm really disappointed

665
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,474
in how this came out.

666
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,543
You spent so much time
making that cupcake,

667
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,546
and I was hoping it was gonna be
some fantastic paintjob.

668
00:32:45,613 --> 00:32:47,147
It's just kind of sloppy.

669
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,617
A lot of other people made a lot
of props and did prosthetics,

670
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:52,019
and this is just
kind of a letdown

671
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,555
as far as I'm concerned.

672
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,256
I think you have a great sense
of shapes and proportion.

673
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:57,858
You have that,
I wanna give that to you.

674
00:32:57,926 --> 00:32:59,459
Where you--I think you
made a mistake is,

675
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,695
I feel like those teeth
don't belong to her.

676
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:04,932
Like, you put the mouth
as an add-on.

677
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,433
Beki, thank you very much.

678
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,335
You can step back.

679
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:12,406
And, Rayce,
please step forward.

680
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,879
Tell us a bit about the story
of your character.

681
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:21,448
This is actually someone
she deeply cares about

682
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:22,883
that she has transformed,

683
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:26,219
and she actually keeps it alive
by playing the cello.

684
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:27,287
It's like a heartbeat.

685
00:33:27,355 --> 00:33:28,722
Just very, very impressive.

686
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,492
I like that you're playing with
the shape of the cello.

687
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,428
To curve it and having
her starting to move

688
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,464
in that same language, it's,
to me, very elegant and poetic,

689
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:38,966
and I like to see something
like that for a change.

690
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,767
Thank you so much.

691
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:44,004
It's so soulful and-- and,
uh, romantic, and I imagine

692
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:47,774
Danny Elfman music along with
this would be so beautiful.

693
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:49,743
Rayce, I really have to
applaud you this week.

694
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:51,912
You did something
completely different.

695
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,547
It doesn't look like
your signature work.

696
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:56,283
That cello, to me, is exactly

697
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,285
what this challenge
is all about.

698
00:33:58,353 --> 00:34:00,087
And the fact that
you've pulled pieces

699
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:03,690
of the instrument into her face.

700
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:05,359
Really, excellent job.

701
00:34:05,426 --> 00:34:07,160
And your airbrush
work is really great.

702
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:09,863
You had airbrushed her clothing
as well, which was a good idea,

703
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:11,865
because it homogenized
the whole look.

704
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,066
It's just beautiful.

705
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,301
Thank you so much.

706
00:34:14,369 --> 00:34:17,204
Rayce, you can step back.

707
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,509
Sue, you're up.

708
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:28,782
Do you feel that
you accomplished

709
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,017
everything that
you set out to do?

710
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:32,285
I knew that I had
a lot on my plate,

711
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:36,056
but I think I accomplished
the things I wanted to do.

712
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,891
I don't really think
he looks like

713
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,326
a Tim Burton character at all.

714
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:43,630
I-- I was wondering if you even
knew who Tim Burton was

715
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,532
when I saw this guy
come out here today.

716
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,169
Right now, he's just kind of,
like, a creepy old dude that's

717
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:51,505
playing with these creepy dolls.

718
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:53,774
I think the most
Tim Burton part

719
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,143
of your thing is
your little puppet.

720
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,312
All I can see is this
hodgepodge of ideas

721
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,715
that are sort of
jammed together.

722
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:05,652
The build turned into
this ballet of idiocy,

723
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,155
where nothing
went together at all.

724
00:35:08,222 --> 00:35:09,690
I think that you were successful

725
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:12,526
in creating the silicone
appliance, but it looks

726
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:15,328
very, very reminiscent of
the old-age that you did.

727
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,135
Sue, you can step back.

728
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,037
Ian?

729
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,642
All right, Ian,
tell us your story.

730
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,111
He's supposed to be
a plumber in the afterlife.

731
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:32,946
What about prosthetics?

732
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:35,982
He has a foam latex chin,
and a foam latex eyepiece.

733
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,185
It's very Burtonesque,
to the point where

734
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:41,922
I don't see your work in it.

735
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,356
You did all of this
work on your props,

736
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:45,792
but--and you put them
all on the back.

737
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,697
I wish you would have done
so much more to the front.

738
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:52,599
I--I do not think
it's a total flunk.

739
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,434
You definitely got
the part about

740
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:57,738
it being a Tim Burton character.

741
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:59,573
Your scenic work on every one

742
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,907
of your props is
absolutely stunning.

743
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,210
You think and you work
differently on the props

744
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:04,745
than you work on the makeup.

745
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:06,179
That said, probably,
you played it

746
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,716
a little safer
than everybody else.

747
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:11,218
Ian, thank you very much.

748
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:13,420
You can step back.

749
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:15,322
RJ.

750
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,899
So, RJ, give us your backstory
on this bellhop.

751
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:28,001
I don't know if he's somewhere
between living and dead,

752
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:30,237
but he's kind of stuck
in this hotel.

753
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:32,439
As you can tell, he steals

754
00:36:32,507 --> 00:36:34,708
the ladies' undergarments
from their luggage.

755
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,143
You did a great job.

756
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,244
Thanks.

757
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:38,378
This whole chest piece

758
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,580
with the curlicues and the hat

759
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:42,315
are all fantastic.

760
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:44,518
I can definitely see him
in a Tim Burton movie.

761
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,688
RJ, this character is you.

762
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:51,858
I am not kidding.

763
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,393
I'm completely impressed
with this.

764
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,962
The quality of the detail,
the attention to the detail,

765
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,531
everything is so tight.

766
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:01,902
It's very, uh, organic, and very
architectural at the same time.

767
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,671
You created such a strong
character, you and your actor,

768
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,139
that you could totally put him

769
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:08,041
right in the hotel
in the afterlife.

770
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:10,877
And my grandma called a dresser
a chest of drawers.

771
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:12,012
I love that.

772
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,781
I think that
present here, in almost

773
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:19,519
every facet of your character,
is Burton's signature style.

774
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,588
And you still managed
to make it your own.

775
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,590
- Thank you very much.
- Well done.

776
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,493
RJ, thank you very much.

777
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:30,864
- Good job, buddy.
- Oh, my God.

778
00:37:30,932 --> 00:37:32,666
All right, the judges have
heard what you have to say.

779
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:34,534
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

780
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:37,470
while they make their decisions.

781
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,709
Why don't we start with the
looks that you liked the most.

782
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:44,077
Matt's ice cream man.

783
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:45,312
I love it;
Thought it was funny.

784
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:46,813
Funny, good, dark--

785
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:48,248
I like the fact that he
brought the cone

786
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:51,151
up on the head, into the
shoulders and everything.

787
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:53,720
The use of the candy was the
most interesting thing to me.

788
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:55,522
The way he used
the candy as, like--

789
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,923
- The candy.
- Thousands of colors.

790
00:37:56,991 --> 00:37:58,358
Why don't we move on to Rayce?

791
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,093
I really like this makeup.

792
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:02,562
It all just kind of blended
so beautifully together,

793
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,431
and it's very Burtonesque.

794
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:05,765
You can just see this character

795
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,434
coming out of one of
Tim's drawings.

796
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:08,869
The airbrush work
was great, I mean,

797
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:10,971
he even took it
into her clothes.

798
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,207
Even in bringing the musical
instrument up onto her face

799
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:16,443
by using elements of it's
design in the prosthetic,

800
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,677
I-- I was thrilled with it.

801
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:19,546
Everything in his
story your saw...

802
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:20,747
- Mm-hmm.
- In the makeup.

803
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:22,048
You know,
where some of them seemed

804
00:38:22,116 --> 00:38:23,750
to tell a story,
and it was like, "really?"

805
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:25,485
Okay, let's move on to RJ.

806
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,587
I think that was so cute,
that makeup.

807
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,522
I really like that.

808
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,892
- Very high quality build.
- Oh, yeah, amazing.

809
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,394
It was very cleanly built.
Detail were stunning.

810
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,730
Extra credit for
being able to succeed

811
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,565
having had the last pick.

812
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:40,367
He could have been in
<i>Beetlejuice</i> easily--

813
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:42,135
- Yep.
- Or a world just like that.

814
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:44,037
Let's move on
to some of the looks

815
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:45,572
you didn't think were so hot.

816
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,973
Let's start with Sue.

817
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,475
It looks like a Halloween

818
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:50,610
costume that was
thrown together

819
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:51,778
the night before a party.

820
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,780
It is hard to believe that Sue

821
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:55,882
has seen Tim Burton
movie in the past.

822
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,618
She flopped on the paintjob.

823
00:38:58,686 --> 00:38:59,819
It was very flat.

824
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:00,820
- It was just kind of, like--

825
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,255
It was quite flat, yeah.

826
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:03,690
- Like beige putty, you know?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

827
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,292
All right, what are your
thoughts on Beki's work?

828
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,093
Everybody else did
all this stuff,

829
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:08,762
and you made
a frickin' cupcake?

830
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:10,730
I think it's lame that
she picked one character

831
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:14,801
from a Burton film and then tied
this character directly to it.

832
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:16,703
That's not what we asked for.

833
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,672
All right,
let's finish up with Ian.

834
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:21,641
Boring, safe, and
therefore disappointing.

835
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,143
If he would have put
the work that he did

836
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,545
into the back on the front, it
would have been something that

837
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,480
was visually exciting
when the guy walked out.

838
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:30,317
You look at all the characters
are being-- "Oh, wow, wow. What?"

839
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,685
And this one was
just, like, there.

840
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:34,154
Creatively speaking,
it's a little bit lacking.

841
00:39:34,221 --> 00:39:36,122
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

842
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,357
I think so.

843
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:40,193
Okay.
Let's bring 'em back out.

844
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,104
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about the top looks.

845
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,574
The top looks tonight are...

846
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,309
Matt...

847
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:58,411
Your character
was very well-balanced,

848
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,214
and it really captured
the essence of Burton.

849
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,549
Rayce...

850
00:40:02,616 --> 00:40:04,250
Great work integrating
the profession

851
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,119
of your character
into the makeup.

852
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:07,687
And RJ...

853
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:09,990
Your makeup was a
very complete vision,

854
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:13,493
and had some really great
stylistic elements.

855
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,729
All right, Glenn, then who is
the winner of this challenge?

856
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:18,531
The winner of
this challenge is...

857
00:40:26,487 --> 00:40:29,122
All right, Glenn, then who is
the winner of this challenge?

858
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,958
The winner of
this challenge is...

859
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,498
Rayce.

860
00:40:42,403 --> 00:40:43,836
Congratulations.

861
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:45,438
Thank you guys so much.

862
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:48,441
Pulling pieces of the cello
up into her makeup

863
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:50,610
was an excellent,
excellent decision.

864
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:53,780
And overall it was a
very complete character.

865
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:55,848
For the first time
in this competition,

866
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,650
I actually win.

867
00:40:57,718 --> 00:41:00,153
- Rayce, congratulations.
- Thank you.

868
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:01,721
You can head back
to the makeup room.

869
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:05,525
This thing that I've been
chasing for eight challenges

870
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:06,793
finally happens,

871
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,163
and I just wanna scream
right now, you know?

872
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:11,764
I feel so good.

873
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:14,901
RJ, Matt, you are also safe.

874
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:16,269
Please head back
to the makeup room.

875
00:41:16,337 --> 00:41:17,537
Thank you, guys.

876
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:19,439
Thank you.

877
00:41:25,913 --> 00:41:28,281
Unfortunately,
that means you three were

878
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:29,616
the bottom looks of the week.

879
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:31,884
One of you will be eliminated.

880
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:33,820
Would you please step forward?

881
00:41:41,495 --> 00:41:44,364
All right, Glenn, why don't you
tell us about the bottom looks?

882
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:48,735
Sue, your makeup was a misfire
this week, and it seems like

883
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:51,571
it would have been better
on a different challenge.

884
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:55,308
Beki, you spent too much time
working on the props,

885
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:58,711
and what makeup you did present
was poorly executed.

886
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:04,751
And, Ian, your makeup was anemic
and lacking in creativity.

887
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:09,055
Who is going home tonight?

888
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:11,991
The person leaving tonight...

889
00:42:15,296 --> 00:42:17,130
is Beki.

890
00:42:19,433 --> 00:42:21,301
Beki, I think you have
a lot of potential.

891
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:23,803
I think you just have to, like,
get out there and do more.

892
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,238
Thank you.

893
00:42:25,306 --> 00:42:27,106
Beki, I'm sorry that
you've been eliminated.

894
00:42:27,174 --> 00:42:28,941
Would you please head back
to the makeup room

895
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:30,877
and pack up your kit?

896
00:42:30,944 --> 00:42:32,178
- Thank you.
- Bye.

897
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:34,414
Good luck, Beki.

898
00:42:34,481 --> 00:42:36,516
I'm gone.

899
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,750
Are you kidding me?

900
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:42,155
The hardest part
about leaving right now

901
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:44,223
is that I got so close to
the end you could taste it.

902
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,060
And... then I get to go home.

903
00:42:47,127 --> 00:42:49,495
It's a once in a
lifetime opportunity.

904
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:50,763
I'm glad I was able to take

905
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:52,598
advantage of it
as far as I could.
