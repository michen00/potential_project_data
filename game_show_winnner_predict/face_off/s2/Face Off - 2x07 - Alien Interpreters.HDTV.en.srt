1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,133
Previously, on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:05,236
The artists tackled
old-age makeups on triplets.

3
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:08,206
How much more difficult
could this possibly be?

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,476
Sue's realistic sculpt
took her to the top.

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,645
- And Heather was sent home.
- Damn.

6
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:15,613
Now eight artists remain.

7
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,115
Tonight they'll
face a challenge

8
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:18,816
unlike any other.

9
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:20,318
Yes.

10
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,353
I have to up my game now
or I'm going home.

11
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:24,088
Sue's sculpts suck.
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:25,223
I don't know what to do.

13
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,125
My makeup's
gonna be a catastrophe.

14
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:29,594
This is an utter disaster.

15
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,496
On stage
a shocking twist is revealed.

16
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:32,730
Oh, [Bleep].

17
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:34,933
I feel like
I'm gonna go home now.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,701
Very, very inventive.

19
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,603
It looks like
a big Halloween mask.

20
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,005
What the hell am I doing?

21
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:43,041
And to make to the top,
they'll have to impress

22
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:45,677
our award-winning
panel of judges.

23
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:47,211
Ve Neill,
three-time Oscar winning

24
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:50,214

28

<i>Underworld Rise Of The Lycans.</i>

29
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,260
And Glenn Hetrick,

and custom designer
for Lady Gaga.

32
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,700
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic

33
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,202
and earn $25,000
in makeup supplies

34
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,671
from Alcone,

35
00:01:12,738 --> 00:01:16,074

And $100,000.

37
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:22,153
Only one will win Face Off!

39
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,155
Another morning,
another person gone.

40
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:05,556
I can't believe
I made it this far.

41
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,225
Everyone here
is a hell of an artist.

44
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:13,297
It feels great.

45
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:14,866
Oh, I just want
to hold on to this win

46
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,167
as long as I can.

47
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,336
I'm so happy
I finally proved myself.

48
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:20,371
It's very interesting
that they had

49
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,140
sculptural critiques for me

50
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,609
and they had
no sculptural critiques for Sue,

51
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:25,877
and it's a horrible sculpture.

52
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:27,311
You could never
put that on a film.

53
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,514
I absolutely
should have won that one.

54
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:30,748
I feel like I got my revenge.

55
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:33,050
I feel like
I shut a lot of people up.

56
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,386
It's that drive, being humbled

57
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,121
and then rising
to that occasion.

58
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,891
It's getting to the point
where you have to up your game

59
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,225
or you're the one
who's going home.

60
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,426
- All right.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:45,062
- Let's do this.
- Ha ha.

62
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,831
Whoo!

63
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:53,304
♪

64
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,607
- Whoa!
- What in the hell is that?

65
00:02:58,677 --> 00:03:00,011
- Wow.
- Nice.

66
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:01,579
We walk into the lab today,

67
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,915
and there's
a hovering police car

68
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,416
and drawings.

69
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:06,651
Really elaborate pieces.

70
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:07,618
What the hell is this from?

71
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,787
- Wow.
- I want one of those.

72
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,556
- I wanna ride in it.
- Hey, guys.

73
00:03:11,623 --> 00:03:12,790
Hi.

74
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,759
So these
incredible concept sketches

75
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,994
are actually designed
by our special guest

76
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,563
for this week's
spotlight challenge.

77
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,631
Ooh, nice.

78
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,533
There are
these beautiful sketches.

79
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,536
We're just stunned
by how cool these drawings are.

80
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:28,306
This police hover car
was also from the mind

81
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:29,874
of today's guest.

82
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:32,577
This will be featured
in the new <i>Total Recall</i> film

83
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:34,045
opening this summer.

84
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:35,179
- Yeah!
- <i>Total Recall.</i>

85
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,682
- Oh!
- Ooh.

86
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,750
<i>Total Recall</i>
is one of my favorite movies.

87
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:43,387
I love all the different mutants
and the aliens.

88
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:45,690
You'll each select
one of the drawings

89
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:48,326
to serve as the basis
for your work this week.

90
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:49,894
Which is...

91
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:52,797
To create an original alien.

92
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,899
Yes.

93
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,167
Finally.

94
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,002
How awesome.
I'm so excited.

95
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,503
So let's go ahead and bring out

96
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,339
our special guest--

97
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,842
The production designer
on the upcoming <i>Total Recall.</i>

98
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,410
Oh, my gosh.

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,648
Patrick Tatopoulos
is the best of the best.

100
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,650
So if he's gonna
say anything about my work,

101
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:13,651
I'm gonna listen.

102
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,286
Hello, guys.

103
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,721
Thank you.

104
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,122
Thank you, guys.

105
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,557
Patrick here has collaborated

106
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,459
with all sorts
of artists and directors.

107
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:25,062
Today he's going to be working
with each of you.

108
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,131
He's not just a guest.

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,200
He's also going
to be your client.

110
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:30,268
This is awesome.

111
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,335
Holy schnikes.

112
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,803
Patrick, he's so cool.

113
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,839
And the idea that
we're gonna get to talk to him

114
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,440
even more is really cool.

115
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,876
Now after you've had a chance
to work on your own designs,

116
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,244
Patrick's going
to meet with you

117
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:42,680
and chat about your ideas.

118
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,215
Okay, tell us
just a little bit about

119
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,083
the designs
that you brought in today.

120
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,285
The first one on the right

121
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,153
is more of
a bat kind of a creature.

122
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,955
Probably lives on a planet
that's got expanses

123
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,690
that he can travel through.

124
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,392
But the second one
is more obvious.

125
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,227
There's a bit
of a cyborg vibe to it.

126
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,229
The no face,
no eyes kind of thing.

127
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,830
It's more traditional in a way.

128
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:04,168
Third one is kind of like
a werewolfy bat creature,

129
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:05,736
yet introduce hair

130
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:08,039
which is very rare
on alien creatures.

131
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,541
The very last one
is also almost

132
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,143
a kind of a cave dweller.

133
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,711
There's a lot
of flying creatures in here

134
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,646
so the wings are going
to be something to play with.

135
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:16,914
All right, guys.

136
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,216
Now that you know more
about these concepts,

137
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,319
you're going to each need
to pick a model

138
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:22,920
and a sketch.

139
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,388
First up...

140
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:27,124
Matt.

141
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,026
Ooh, I would not
have gone for that one at all.

142
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,929
- Mm-mm.
- Sue.

143
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,298
Rayce.

144
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,533
Oh.

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,767
Right up Rayce's alley.

146
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,003
Jerry.

147
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,338
I'm kind of feeling it.

148
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,640
Ian.

149
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,775
Competition's on.

150
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,211
RJ.

151
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,213
Beki.

152
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,948
Tara.

153
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,484
I think I'll do this one.

154
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:54,552
Okay, so Patrick
what are you gonna be

155
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:55,753
looking for from these guys?

156
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,021
What I really would like
you guys to do

157
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,422
is bring it a little further.

158
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,658
That's the way
I work with my team usually.

159
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,660
Every artist can actually
bring something to the table.

160
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:05,262
I'm really looking for that
from you guys.

161
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,431
So after you've had a chance
to work on your own designs,

162
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:08,899
Patrick's gonna meet
with each of you

163
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,568
to chat about your ideas.

164
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:12,103
Good luck, guys.

165
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,006
'Cause your time starts now.

166
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,845
We have 1/2 hour to sketch.

167
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:23,180
The design is important
because you need to know

168
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:24,615
where you're going
and what steps

169
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:28,686
you need to take to get there.

170
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:32,456
I took Patrick's image,
put it into the program,

171
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:36,127
used the tablet
to draw what I want to change

172
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,162
and that's how
I design most of my makeup.

173
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,131
I'll take a photograph
of the person

174
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,967
and then just literally draw
on top of their face.

175
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,438
My character
is really big and scary

176
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,807
and this monster type thing.

177
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,776
I really like
the arms on this guy

178
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,512
but I've never made
arm extensions before.

179
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:57,348
And I'm, like,
"well, how can I do this?"

180
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:03,687
- My design, it's very bat-like
but I'm keeping it feminine.

181
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,089
And I'm gonna have
a big, pointed head

182
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,158
and giant ears coming out.

183
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:08,426
I'm nervous as heck,
it's gonna be

184
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,061
a hell of a challenge
to do this.

185
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,328
I was on the bottom last time.

186
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,397
I have to impress Patrick
this time.

187
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:19,236
While I'm conceptualizing
the creature,

188
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,405
I'm thinking about
going with a very sterile

189
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:22,807
albino look to it.

190
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,041
I knew that would be unique
compared to the rest

191
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,844
of the creations.

192
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:29,680
The creature that I chose
was a cyborg.

193
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,382
I liked the idea
of the tubing going on

194
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,716
in the picture.

195
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,718
And so the sculpt itself
will have tubes that go

196
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,354
on the face,
that come down into the body.

197
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:40,291
I feel that flipping the gender
from Patrick's male to female

198
00:07:40,358 --> 00:07:43,094
will make it even more my own.

199
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:48,065
I know this
is gonna be challenging,

200
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:49,800
so immediately
I just start sculpting

201
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,902
and I'm trying to do this
as fast as I can.

202
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,105
Because I need
to get the face sculpted,

203
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,140
molded, and ready for foam
by the end of the day

204
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,043
so that tomorrow
I can have the face all done

205
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,177
so I can pre-paint.

206
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:01,612
Whoa!
Oh, that's cool.

207
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,447
You just drew that
on the computer real quick?

208
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:05,850
You crazy freak you.

209
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:08,085
I wanted to keep it kind of
where the eyes are distinct,

210
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,020
and I like all the appendages.

211
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,755
I just wanted
to bring them down,

212
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:13,958
almost like a suit.
Wow, that's a lot.

213
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,829
My creature's a bat
so he could be more humanoid,

214
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:21,465
not so elaborate.

215
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,934
Plus it's a girl-- I could
sleek her down, you know?

216
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,569
Ian is stressed.
Ian's always stressed.

217
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:28,105
You know,
that just his schtick.

218
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,641
Make her a sexy bat.

219
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,277
I don't want her to be sexy.
I want her to be creepy.

220
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,146
Then make her a creepy bat.

221
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,686
I'm not very good
at making very mean faces,

222
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:43,954
so it's funny--

223
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,257
I have to like really force it
to be mean.

224
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:48,592
These are not
the "phone home" kind of aliens.

225
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,127
These are
the "I'm gonna eat your face

226
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,462
and talk to you later".

227
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,899
The "you are lunch" alien.

228
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,036
My design
is fairly close to Patrick's.

229
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,772
The face is going
to have layers of vacuform

230
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,274
to make it look like

231
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:05,709
you're seeing through
a clear pectin.

232
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:08,546
So I'm going to go
in a b-movie monster direction.

233
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:16,720
Patrick coming over
for the client meeting soon.

234
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:19,123
I'm worried my design
is too complicated.

235
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,859
That is a ton of appliances.

236
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,395
I'm not sure
I'll be able to finish in time.

237
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:27,331
It's gonna be a catastrophe
if it doesn't work.

238
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,066
There's no way, dude.

239
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,337
- Coming up.
- Sue's sculpt sucked.

240
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,206
Jerry is on fire today.

241
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:37,641
- Hard as a [Bleep] brick.
- Shut up.

242
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,579
I think that
you've missed the mark here.

243
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,314
I'm so impressed.
Well done.

244
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:50,864
I can't figure out
how the hell I'm gonna do this.

245
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:52,466
I'm sculpting
a giant cowl piece

246
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:57,204
that has really broad shoulders
to get that big haunch.

247
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,006
Bringing Patrick's
drawings to life

248
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,374
is really difficult

249
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:02,042
with all of these
separate components.

250
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,645
I think I made my design
way too complicated.

251
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,352
Patrick walks in,
and I'm very eager

252
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,087
to make a great impression

253
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,389
seeing as Patrick's our client.

254
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:16,790
- Hello, Matt.
- Hi.

255
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:18,325
Tell me a little bit about it.

256
00:10:18,393 --> 00:10:19,760
It just says nightmare to me
when I see this.

257
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,128
It's very dark.

258
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,696
I was thinking maybe
going completely different

259
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:25,699
and going with a light tone,
like a real sterile feel to it.

260
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,801
Mm-hmm.
When you work on film

261
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:29,203
and create, like,
an albino creature,

262
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,238
bring a little brown
and sepias to it

263
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:32,473
so it doesn't look so bright.

264
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,508
- Yeah, something to think about.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:35,909
When I look
at a design like this,

266
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:38,545
it's interesting, but it looks
a little too tight.

267
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:40,481
It starts looking
definitely like a man.

268
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:43,083
You want to emphasize
that whole humpback thing.

269
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,618
You're gonna need mass.

270
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,188
Every time Patrick judges,
he always brings up silhouette.

271
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,524
He really liked what I did,
and he said it also

272
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:53,293
changed the profile,
just like he always talks about.

273
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,828
I'm definitely feeling
more confident.

274
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,364
What I would like to do
is create these arm pieces

275
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:59,466
that will come up out
so it almost seems like

276
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,801
her arm is powered
with something.

277
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,070
Got you.

278
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:05,038
Yeah, like
almost blackish colors--

279
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,974
- Yeah, right.
- Coming up and around.

280
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,209
What I'm really working on
is what I'm gonna build,

281
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:11,178
how I'm gonna build it
with the time allowed.

282
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,716
So, yeah, tell me.

283
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:17,384
I'm gonna give him some jeans,

284
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:19,186
that fell down a shaft and--

285
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:22,956
- Turned into--
- Somehow fell into something.

286
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:25,092
Good, that sounds exciting.
I love that.

287
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,027
I kind of like this idea
of this red character

288
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:29,796
with some of these, you know,
just some browns and some grays.

289
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:35,869
Yeah.

290
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:38,205
What do you like about this?
What's inspiring you?

291
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:40,874
You know what's kind of fun
is that it's a really mean face,

292
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,809
and I don't really
do many mean faces.

293
00:11:42,877 --> 00:11:44,945
So I decided that he's an alien
that's living on the street

294
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,813
as a man,
and he's transforming.

295
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,115
There's gonna
be a lot of fabrication.

296
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:51,852
I found these in the back
and I'm, like,

297
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,387
it would be pretty cool
to somehow extend the arm,

298
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:55,455
- just starting from here.
- I like that, and you know,

299
00:11:55,523 --> 00:11:56,790
you have that choice

300
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,325
because those hands
are not very human,

301
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,827
so you can make those claws
much simpler.

302
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,397
Patrick loves the fact
that I'm gonna try to do arms.

303
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,566
He thinks if I pull this off
it'll look really great.

304
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,200
Hopefully it'll work.

305
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,636
I'm a little slower
than most people at fabrication

306
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:12,105
so I'm just gonna
stick with the head

307
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:14,675
and I wanna spend more time
on the costuming.

308
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:22,149
I see.

309
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,350
If we went in
and started drawing

310
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:26,119
on top of this
and came up with something

311
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,621
like a dinosaur kind of thing

312
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,089
coming out
of the top of the head.

313
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:30,490
Yes, expanding
the head and face.

314
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:31,625
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:37,831
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

316
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,000
All right, good to see you, RJ.

317
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,772
I designed this creature
that has all these spikes

318
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,975
coming out
of the back of the head.

319
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,010
So for day one
I need to figure out

320
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:51,445
how I'm gonna do this.

321
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:53,680
So I'm making
plastic spines first

322
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:57,217
because I have to see stuff
on my sculpture

323
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:59,519
and see the whole picture
before I start sculpting.

324
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:02,122
So at least I know
that I have something.

325
00:13:04,025 --> 00:13:07,294
I start to try
to make these arms really huge,

326
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,129
and I think
that would really add

327
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:11,164
something cool
about this character.

328
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:13,000
God help me, I hope this works.

329
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,434
You so crazy, girl!

330
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,103
I know, I know.

331
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,006
I don't know why I chose a bat.

332
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:21,241
Ian is very insecure
with his talent.

333
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,477
He second-guesses himself
all the time.

334
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:25,679
I'm just trying to figure out
what my niche is gonna be,

335
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,914
'cause everyone's
got some bad-ass thing going.

336
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,350
Ian's worst enemy
is his own insecurities.

337
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,653
I really hope
he can learn to get over that.

338
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:40,827
The front
of my head mold is huge.

339
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:42,663
I'm being very ambitious.

340
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,064
I need somebody
to smack me in the head

341
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:45,766
next time
I make a big sculpture.

342
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,869
The X factor
isn't even on there yet.

343
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,537
The one thing
I have up my sleeve

344
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:51,938
are these spines.

345
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:54,808
Because no one else
is doing so much applique work.

346
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,010
I'm a little worried
for Sue because she's spending

347
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:58,545
a lot of time just on the head

348
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:01,782
and she's counting on the
intricate little nail details

349
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:03,083
to really pull it out.

350
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:04,084
I'm just worried
that it's not gonna be

351
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:05,419
conceptually strong enough.

352
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,454
Look how cool he's gonna look.

353
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,258
Wait, how are you
gonna do all that?

354
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:12,626
I'm not.

355
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:15,262
I ran out of time
on the last individual challenge

356
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,031
and now I'm planning
on doing four more pieces?

357
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:19,866
And there's a part of me
that's, like,

358
00:14:19,934 --> 00:14:22,002
"what the hell am I doing?"
You know?

359
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,510
Sue's sculpt sucked, I'm sorry.

360
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,512
It was-- It was awful.

361
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,881
We're in the mold room,
and everyone was stressed out

362
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,350
but Jerry is definitely
on fire today.

363
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,619
Some people have obviously
been sculpting for 20 years

364
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:41,722
and some have been
sculpting for six months.

365
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,957
I don't know why Jerry
is so degrading of Sue.

366
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,826
I was shocked
that I was criticized

367
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:48,528
on parts of my sculpt
and Sue wasn't.

368
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,464
For Jerry to say that

369
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,132
he should
at least win something...

370
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,367
Especially if you have
the most experience

371
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,836
you should
be winning everything.

372
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,838
I shouldn't say it sucked,
I should say

373
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:00,807
it's too cartoony
and Halloween for my taste.

374
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,843
God bless him,
but don't degrade someone

375
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,778
because
you're feeling threatened.

376
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:15,188
Hey, guys.
Time's up, that's it.

377
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:17,057
Time's up?

378
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,759
I've got a lot
of mold making to do tomorrow.

379
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:19,860
I'm a little nervous
about that.

380
00:15:19,927 --> 00:15:22,129
I've never made
such a big foam piece.

381
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:24,798
I'm really curious to see
how it moves and comes out.

382
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:39,112
Today's second day in the lab

383
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,915
and we only have ten hours
to do a full creature.

384
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,784
That's no time at all.

385
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,357
We walk into the lab,

386
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:52,993
and the first thing I do
is check on the arms.

387
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,728
Oh, [Bleep].

388
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:58,732
I open them up
and, ugh, it's all pieces.

389
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,168
The mold didn't fill up
the way I wanted it to.

390
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:02,869
Well, that didn't work.

391
00:16:02,937 --> 00:16:05,539
- Well, that's a [Bleep] bummer.
- Yup.

392
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:07,874
It wasn't just a lite bit.
It was an epic fail.

393
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,643
It's not even together at all.

394
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,811
It's just bad.

395
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,312
The arms are
the most important part

396
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,446
of my makeup.

397
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,782
I'm 90% sure I'm going home.

398
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:26,144
Oh, no.

399
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,745
Well, that didn't work.

400
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,681
First thing I do
is walk in and go check on

401
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,115
the arm situation,

402
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:35,720
and I open them up,
and, ugh, it's all pieces.

403
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,822
Well, that was
a long shot anyway.

404
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,825
I was worried about the claw,
and sure enough

405
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:43,861
the mold didn't fill up
the way I wanted it to.

406
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,432
So next thought is
I can make the arms again.

407
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,669
But I'm not sure
if I'm going to have enough time

408
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:53,071
to get them sculpted and molded

409
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,039
before the end of the day.

410
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:07,051
Once you're sculpture
is done, you need to mold it.

411
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,088
The mold will capture
all the information

412
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,622
from your sculpture.

413
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,225
I need to get
the face prosthetic molded

414
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:17,061
and the entire back of the head
by the end of today.

415
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:20,865
Nope.

416
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,400
Yeah, [Bleep] it.

417
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:25,203
I go back to check on the mold,
and I can see

418
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,139
on the inside of the pods
that the neck is cracked.

419
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:29,607
At this point,
it's just too late

420
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,175
for me to run
this piece in foam.

421
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:34,846
So I decide that I'm gonna
run it in polyfoam,

422
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:37,382
which dries very quickly

423
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:41,285
but it's not as flexible
as foam latex is

424
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,154
because there's no latex in it,
it's just the foam.

425
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:48,626
What are you
gonna do with that?

426
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,595
It's his arm extension.

427
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:52,029
But I mean what
are you making it out of?

428
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:53,631
- Polyfoam?
- Oh, yeah.

429
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,899
It's what I have,

430
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,033
so I figure
it's better than nothing.

431
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:59,103
And it's actually
coming together.

432
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:07,345
And then all of sudden,
the mold collapses.

433
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:10,415
Oh, my gosh,
this is an utter disaster.

434
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,316
Fail.
Epic fail.

435
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:13,651
What happened?

436
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:17,889
The mold just fell over
and collapsed.

437
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:19,624
There's no point in trying
to rescue that any further.

438
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,426
It's-- it's gone.

439
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:22,760
I've lost the fight.

440
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:25,496
My creature is not
gonna have arm extensions.

441
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:31,035
Okay, guys!

442
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:33,938
Time!

443
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:47,718
Today is application day.

444
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:49,620
We have four hours
for application

445
00:18:49,688 --> 00:18:51,289
and then an hour of last looks,

446
00:18:51,356 --> 00:18:53,458
which is terrifying.

447
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,201
Yeah, it's beautiful.

448
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,174
- Hi, I'm Sue.
- Linda.

449
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:15,246
We got a, uh, albino alien

450
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:16,881
cave-dwelling creature.

451
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,049
This is the most
I've ever done--

452
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,685
Had to do in a four-hour
time span.

453
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:23,955
It's about eight pieces,
and it's a full body paint job.

454
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:26,257
I am worried,
but it has to get done.

455
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:27,758
- You're gonna be like this.
- Okay.

456
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,927
Except you're gonna
have spikes everywhere.

457
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:31,195
Okay, cool.

458
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:33,498
So you're gonna
be really dangerous.

459
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,835
- How are you doing today?
- I'm good.

460
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:38,870
- Good.
- How are you?

461
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:40,037
I've been better.

462
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:42,173
This piece did not
come out at all.

463
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,175
Immediately I can see
both ears are missing.

464
00:19:44,243 --> 00:19:45,810
They didn't fill.

465
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:47,745
My edges are really thick.

466
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:51,015
It's got a huge tear
from the shoulder to the neck.

467
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,150
It's [Bleep] up.

468
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:56,954
Salvaging it is gonna
take most of my time.

469
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:01,425
It's comfy.

470
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:02,960
- It should-- Yeah.
- You did a good job, Jerry.

471
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:06,564
I feel great.
My pieces are all done.

472
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:08,933
It's just a matter
of putting them on and painting.

473
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,769
Oh, there we go, there we go.

474
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:14,705
All right.

475
00:20:14,773 --> 00:20:16,507
♪ I don't know what I'm doing ♪

476
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:19,310
I'm trying to go for speed today
so I have enough time to paint,

477
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:20,745
because I don't have arms

478
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:23,347
and I don't have much
cool craziness going on.

479
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:26,017
So I'm slapping those things on
as fast as possible.

480
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:36,093
How'd your stuff come out?

481
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:39,997
That head dried up
hard as a [Bleep] brick.

482
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:41,599
Shut up.

483
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:46,604
Because of its rigidness now,
it's not fitting properly.

484
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:48,739
Damn, it's stiff.

485
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,908
I have to figure out
a way to attach a strap

486
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:52,610
to the inside of this thing

487
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:55,179
so that it will actually
stay on him.

488
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:58,482
The other thing about it is
I can't attach the face

489
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,818
without attaching
the back of the head.

490
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,153
I can't attach
the back of the head

491
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,388
'cause I can't force him
to sit in that all day.

492
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:06,490
That means the face
and the head are just gonna

493
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,293
have to wait
until the last looks.

494
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:13,331
It'll look like a scar.

495
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,800
- All right.
- But it won't look like a tear.

496
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,335
- All right.
- A scar is fine.

497
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,170
I'm doing everything I can
to hold this thing together.

498
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,871
I take the ears
that are torn off

499
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:22,540
and I glue one back on.

500
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,342
And the other one
is just not salvageable.

501
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,410
So it's gotta be
a wound or something.

502
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:28,045
As long as I can
get the front looking decent,

503
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:29,614
it'll be okay.

504
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:33,651
Getting that cowl on her,
patching it and seaming it...

505
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,152
Took over three hours.

506
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,288
We only had four hours
to apply the makeup.

507
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,124
It's gonna be a hell of a feat
if I pull this off.

508
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,596
I'm realizing that
time is running out.

509
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:50,134
I still have to start
applying the nails.

510
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:52,803
And at this point,
I can't get my original design

511
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:55,239
with having these
extra spines out.

512
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:59,143
Take a deep breath.

513
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:00,978
My model is starting
to get painted up and I'm, like,

514
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,147
"aw, crap,
he needs some claws."

515
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:06,050
I don't know if I'm gonna
have time to do two hands.

516
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,125
Here I am just still sitting
on the floor

517
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:15,593
playing with friendly plastic.

518
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:16,994
Give me your hand.

519
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:18,429
I'm worried,
but it's gonna pull together.

520
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:19,997
This is what I do.
I'm gonna make it work.

521
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:21,332
It's gonna be okay.

522
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:26,804
All right, guys!
Everybody, time's up!

523
00:22:26,872 --> 00:22:28,139
Done!
Put 'em down!

524
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:30,241
Time's up.

525
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,143
I've been in situations
like this before

526
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,411
and somehow pulled it off.

527
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,446
I still have
a lot of cool pieces

528
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:37,114
so I'll make something cool
out of them.

529
00:22:38,884 --> 00:22:40,051
Coming up...

530
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,622
The head sculpt is amazing.

531
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,790
Geordi Laforge, I love you.

532
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:47,658
Looks like
a big Halloween mask.

533
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:49,026
I feel like
I'm gonna go home now.

534
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:51,862
This is a stellar makeup.
It's very cool.

535
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:00,515
We have hour left
for last looks.

536
00:23:00,582 --> 00:23:01,983
Most people have an idea
of where they're going

537
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:03,751
with theirs--
I don't have a clue.

538
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,220
Plus more problems
keep coming up

539
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:08,823
like where the cowl ends
and my model's skin begins.

540
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:10,091
It tore right here.

541
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,794
I have to put cotton there
and blend it.

542
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,333
I know I have very little time

543
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,368
to do all the finishing touches

544
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:23,304
so I'm gonna impress
the judges with the paint job.

545
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,886
That's time, everybody!
Stop your work!

546
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:41,789
Ugh.

547
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:43,858
- Oh, damn.
- No!

548
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:44,926
Well...

549
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:49,263
This is not what
I had envisioned at all.

550
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:03,378
Welcome to
the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

551
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:05,246
Say hello to your judges.

552
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:07,048
Owner of optic nerve
makeup effects studio,

553
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,117
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

554
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,552
- Three-time Oscar winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

555
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,920
Hi, everybody.

556
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:14,288
Creature designer and director

557
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:16,524
and your client this week,
Patrick Tatopoulos.

558
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:17,792
Hi, guys.

559
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,794
And joining
our panel this week,

560
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:21,462
he's a producer and director

561
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,498
with an incredible array
of awards

562
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:27,435
including a Peabody,
a Grammy, 13 Emmys.

563
00:24:27,503 --> 00:24:29,270
But he's perhaps best known

564
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:31,305
for his starring role
as Geordi Laforge

565
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:33,441
in the <i>Star Trek</i> franchise.

566
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:36,144
Please welcome
my friend Levar Burton.

567
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:39,013
Yeah!

568
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:43,684
We've got Levar Burton
hangin' out.

569
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,753
Geordi Laforge, I love you.

570
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,155
Thank you.

571
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:48,589
It's Geordi Laforge.

572
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:49,757
It's great
to have you here with us.

573
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:51,192
Great to be here, thank you.

574
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,794
All right, so this week
your spotlight challenge

575
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:56,097
was to use one
of Patrick's concept sketches

576
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:58,666
as the basis
for an original alien.

577
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,868
Tonight, we're
going to be doing things

578
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:03,137
a little bit differently.

579
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:06,441
I'm thinking "what now?"

580
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:09,343
Two of you will be eliminated.

581
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:10,478
Oh, [Bleep].

582
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:11,679
What?

583
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:14,882
Now I'm scared to death.

584
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,884
I thought there was
a possibility of me going me,

585
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:18,920
and now that's
double that possibility.

586
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,122
I'm really worried now.

587
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,624
So let's see
what you've come up with.

588
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,853
From far away the face
looks so strikingly different

589
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,387
from the rest of the body.

590
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:55,456
I'm realizing that,
wow, it looks like

591
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:58,159
I almost did nothing.

592
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,578
All the tubes
silhouetted nicely.

593
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:19,614
I'm very proud of myself today

594
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:22,250
for pulling off something
so elaborate

595
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:24,785
in a very small amount of time.

596
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:44,839
I think I pulled off
the paint job.

597
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,007
It's not too weird.

598
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:47,542
And I love the way
the red looks

599
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,444
because it really stands out.

600
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:12,900
I botched the paint,
but if I were to grade

601
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:15,570
my makeup on the time given...

602
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:18,139
Seven?

603
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,560
So many points of that makeup

604
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:40,561
I was gonna give up.

605
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,129
It was unsalvageable.

606
00:27:42,197 --> 00:27:44,365
But if I go home,
you know what?

607
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:46,634
It's been a good run.

608
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:09,590
I feel really great
'cause I've accomplished

609
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:10,858
what I wanted to do.

610
00:28:10,926 --> 00:28:13,928
It sticks out,
it's exactly what I envisioned.

611
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:38,419
As my makeup comes out onstage

612
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:39,987
I'm really happy
with that silhouette.

613
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:43,157
That's what I promised Patrick
and as far as I'm concerned,

614
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:44,625
I delivered what
I promised my client

615
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:47,228
I would deliver.

616
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,849
As my makeup walks out I think,

617
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,085
"ooh...It's looking flat."

618
00:29:11,153 --> 00:29:13,020
I made sure
to make the skin match

619
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,388
and I was really proud of that.

620
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:17,191
But then the contrast
just wasn't there.

621
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:22,463
Judges?

622
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,265
Why don't you
take a closer look?

623
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,538
Wow.

624
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:35,809
Could you turn sideways
for us, just stand in profile?

625
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,277
I'm nervous as hell.

626
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:38,712
It's hard to tell
what the judges are thinking.

627
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,747
I really wish I knew
what they were writing.

628
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:42,683
Try to open your mouth for us.

629
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,151
- That's it, that's it, yeah.
- Nice mouth.

630
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,552
Kind of already there,
isn't it?

631
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,088
It's just silver paint.
That's cool.

632
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:49,623
Pretty good move on the mouth.

633
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,758
Yes, it is.
Interesting fissure,

634
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:52,860
you know, the way
this is broken up?

635
00:29:52,927 --> 00:29:55,329
Yeah, that's cool.

636
00:29:55,396 --> 00:29:56,964
This one is seeing
the bottom lip.

637
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:58,098
There should have been teeth.

638
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,634
He's this toothless
green gremlin.

639
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:03,470
Without the teeth
I don't have a fighting chance.

640
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,199
The judges walk up,
and I feel awful.

641
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,968
This one is seeing
the bottom lip.

642
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:11,169
There should have been teeth.

643
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:13,304
I would love to be confident
in myself

644
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:14,673
but without the teeth
I don't think

645
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,641
I have a fighting chance.

646
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:20,779
What do you suppose
all this is-- The chunky stuff?

647
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:21,846
That must be just something
he mixed up.

648
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:23,281
Hmm.

649
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:25,150
It's too bad
he didn't soften the color.

650
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:26,484
His color is terrible.

651
00:30:26,552 --> 00:30:28,219
Yeah, he should have
softened the color.

652
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:32,023
- Can you see my hand right now?
- No.

653
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:33,258
- How about now?
- No.

654
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:34,159
He won't be doing stunts
in this outfit.

655
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:35,593
Yeah.

656
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:38,596
I couldn't see anything
in the visor either.

657
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:40,732
I like the fact
that it's that dark red color.

658
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,167
That's nasty.

659
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:45,203
I like the liquid tubes.
That's pretty cool.

660
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:47,439
Yeah, I like that.

661
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:49,174
They're examining everything.

662
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:51,042
I don't think mine's
the worst one up there,

663
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,378
but unfortunately
you see the hands.

664
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:54,679
She didn't do anything
to her hands.

665
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:56,614
Nothing to the hands.

666
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:58,083
I'm really worried.

667
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,284
I feel like
I'm gonna go home now.

668
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:05,590
So Levar, you've seen
a lot of alien makeups

669
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:07,425
in your time with <i>Star Trek.</i>

670
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:08,626
How do you think they did?

671
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:10,528
I have to say
that the quality of work

672
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:11,696
is really impressive.

673
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:12,997
Especially given
the amount of time

674
00:31:13,065 --> 00:31:14,199
that they had to do it.

675
00:31:14,266 --> 00:31:15,500
Great.

676
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:18,069
Well, the judges
have scored your creations

677
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,038
so let's hear
what they thought.

678
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:23,374
Beki.

679
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:25,844
Matt.

680
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:27,212
You are both safe.

681
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,380
Will you please head back
to the makeup room.

682
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,349
- Thank you.
- Good job.

683
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,921
The rest of you
were the best and the worst

684
00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:38,523
of this week.

685
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:40,558
So the judges would now
like to speak with each of you

686
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:42,160
to learn more about your work.

687
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:45,029
Rayce, you're up first.

688
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:52,837
Tell me a little bit
about your approach here.

689
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:54,405
The original sketch
had a lot of tubes coming out

690
00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:56,508
so I decided to fuse them
onto his skin,

691
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:59,611
almost like
it was crawling on him.

692
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:04,048
That is an absolutely
impressive amount of sculpting.

693
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:05,884
To have accomplished
in the time that you have.

694
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:08,987
And it's not just
the amount that you did,

695
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:12,056
it's the fact that
your symmetry is so tight.

696
00:32:12,124 --> 00:32:14,526
- I'm extremely pleased with it.
- Thank you.

697
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:17,462
I really liked this.
It's really kind of organic

698
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,798
and very superhero-like.

699
00:32:19,865 --> 00:32:21,432
- Really well done.
- Thank you so much.

700
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,667
The design
was more complicated,

701
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,102
there was a lot
of little forms on there

702
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,770
that were not really necessary.

703
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:26,971
And I'm glad you take them off.

704
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,907
It's much sleeker.
Fabulous work.

705
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:30,175
Thank you so much.

706
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,243
I was really impressed
by the eyes.

707
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:35,880
It was a very unusual treatment.
Very, very inventive.

708
00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:37,215
I really appreciate it.
Thanks, guys.

709
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:40,084
Okay, Rayce.

710
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:43,321
Sue, you're up.

711
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:47,826
I think it was
really clever that you

712
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:50,028
took all those fake fingernails
and stuck them in there

713
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:52,564
as a quill-type thing.

714
00:32:52,631 --> 00:32:54,599
But I'm really disappointed
that you actually did nothing

715
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,669
to her hands,
not even paint them.

716
00:32:57,736 --> 00:32:59,370
You need to think about
when you have a design

717
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,473
of a full creature like that
to not concentrate on one part

718
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,442
and super detail it,
because as a design thing

719
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,411
it's the biggest mistake
you can make.

720
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:09,180
You forget there
is a bigger picture out there.

721
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:10,582
I've gotta tell you,

722
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:12,016
I think that you've
missed the mark here.

723
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:14,552
And it has to do with anatomy.

724
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,554
I don't see enough
of the essence

725
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:18,056
of Patrick's design.

726
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,526
It reads monkey to me.

727
00:33:21,594 --> 00:33:24,529
All right, Sue,
please step back.

728
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:29,067
Jerry.

729
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:32,570
- Ve, let's start with you.
- Okay, Jerry.

730
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:35,707
You chose these colors why?

731
00:33:35,774 --> 00:33:37,575
I like them.

732
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:40,178
Well, I think that might
have been your biggest mistake.

733
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:44,215
It just looks like
a big Halloween mask to me.

734
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:47,685
For me I think your
color choice indicates aquatic.

735
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,754
The wings, the fins,

736
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:53,258
all of that
really said fish to me.

737
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,960
I feel that's
a little limited...Creatively.

738
00:33:56,028 --> 00:33:58,396
Like, I'm not gonna do
water, blue, demon, red.

739
00:33:58,464 --> 00:33:59,797
It's just not gonna happen.

740
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:01,366
I think you have to really
take into consideration

741
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:05,536
the frames of reference
for the audience.

742
00:34:05,604 --> 00:34:06,905
The makeup failed for me.

743
00:34:06,972 --> 00:34:08,873
Even though I think
that you had a good idea,

744
00:34:08,941 --> 00:34:11,676
it's not the paint for me
on this one.

745
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:14,479
All right, Jerry, thank you.

746
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:17,382
Ian, you're up.

747
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:20,885
How do you think that you did?

748
00:34:20,953 --> 00:34:24,389
- One to ten?
- Overall I'd say five or six.

749
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:26,090
I disagree.

750
00:34:26,158 --> 00:34:27,692
I think much higher.

751
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,527
I think you're selling
yourself short this week.

752
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:30,862
Heh.

753
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,998
I actually think
this is a stellar makeup.

754
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:36,401
Particularly
the color combination.

755
00:34:36,468 --> 00:34:38,036
I love what you did
with the paint.

756
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:39,971
I'd actually love to see
a version of this makeup

757
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,806
where you had weeks
to work on it.

758
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:42,840
- Wow.
- It's very cool.

759
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:44,008
- Thank you.
- Well done.

760
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:46,077
I have three words
for you, Ian.

761
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:49,380
Awesome, bitchin', and groovy.

762
00:34:49,448 --> 00:34:50,715
Thank you so much.

763
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:52,383
You took my design
as an inspiration

764
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:53,851
and you made a design
that's about ten times

765
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:56,287
as good as mine,
that's the way I feel.

766
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,623
The wings are your design,
they were not in the drawings.

767
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:00,491
That's one of the best part
of your makeup.

768
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,592
Thank you.

769
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,894
This makeup tells a story

770
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:04,429
without even saying anything.

771
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:06,631
The chewed ear--
and I'm so impressed

772
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:09,000
with the accentuation
of the shoulders.

773
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:10,535
Incredibly bat-like.

774
00:35:10,602 --> 00:35:11,669
Well done.

775
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,572
Thank you so much, everyone.

776
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,840
All right, Ian, thank you.

777
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,175
Thank you.

778
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:23,715
RJ, you're next.

779
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,320
RJ, I want to say
you took the design

780
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:31,356
and really got
to another place with it.

781
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,858
I wanted you to do that,
and I think that's great.

782
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:36,761
Now, those big arms
feel a little bit

783
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:38,129
out of proportion.
They may be a little bigger

784
00:35:38,197 --> 00:35:39,831
than they were on the drawing.

785
00:35:39,898 --> 00:35:42,133
But you've got
a very cool face going on.

786
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:44,836
The mouth
is functioning beautifully.

787
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:46,170
Thank you so much.

788
00:35:46,238 --> 00:35:48,272
I think that
the head sculpt is amazing.

789
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,708
The back of it reminded me
of a Mayan temple.

790
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,577
It's interesting
architecturally,

791
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:54,812
you get a real
clear sense of anatomy.

792
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,181
I really love it.
Excellent job.

793
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:59,350
Thank you.
Wow.

794
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:00,251
Thank you, RJ.

795
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:06,491
Tara?

796
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,897
Well, I'll start off
by saying he was supposed to

797
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,233
have some arm extensions

798
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,503
and then at the last hour
it toppled

799
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,171
while I was molding it.

800
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,205
What's going on with the mouth?

801
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:23,241
What happened there?

802
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,942
Um, I did make teeth as well.

803
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,911
- Uh-huh.
- And...

804
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,579
When he'd open
and close his mouth

805
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,281
they were hitting his lips,
so at the last minute

806
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:32,817
I ripped them out.

807
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:34,419
I think you
second-guess yourself

808
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,454
when it comes
to decision making.

809
00:36:36,522 --> 00:36:38,022
It is about time management.

810
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,857
Without the arms
and without the teeth,

811
00:36:39,925 --> 00:36:41,459
I'm not sure
what your design was.

812
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:43,861
The idea was
that he was an alien

813
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:45,129
hiding out on earth as a human.

814
00:36:45,197 --> 00:36:46,164
He was transforming.

815
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:47,565
I don't see it.

816
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,200
When you have
an incident like that

817
00:36:49,268 --> 00:36:51,202
and you lose something
that's a very specific,

818
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,204
iconic part of the creature,

819
00:36:53,272 --> 00:36:54,639
what you need to do
is bring something else

820
00:36:54,706 --> 00:36:56,741
to the table
for the client to react to.

821
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:02,680
Tara, thank you.

822
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:08,286
All right, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

823
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,555
If you would please
head back to the makeup room

824
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:13,491
while they
make their decisions.

825
00:37:15,994 --> 00:37:17,428
All right, guys,
so let's talk about

826
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:19,497
some of the looks
that you liked the most.

827
00:37:19,565 --> 00:37:21,232
Let's start with Rayce.

828
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,769
It was really sleek,
it was really sparse.

829
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,537
But it had
a lot of detail in it.

830
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:28,673
His paint job is also bringing
this whole thing together.

831
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,675
Oh, yeah, it really
pulled it all together.

832
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:32,677
- I mean, you could shoot that.
- Yeah, absolutely.

833
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:33,945
- That was camera-ready work.
- Yeah.

834
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,780
All right,
so let's move on to RJ.

835
00:37:35,848 --> 00:37:38,583
What I did like about RJ
is that he tried to do it all.

836
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,817
I agree.

837
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,018
I really do dig the head.

838
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:42,420
- I think it's interesting.
- Yeah.

839
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:44,088
It kind of looks like
a dinosaur going into battle

840
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:46,224
ready to strike.

841
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,359
Okay, let's move on to Ian.

842
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:49,927
He spent all that time
with all the veining

843
00:37:49,995 --> 00:37:52,864
and making it look really
natural and really skin-like.

844
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:55,166
He did not leave any aspect

845
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:58,236
of this makeup unattended to.

846
00:37:58,303 --> 00:37:59,470
- Very cool.
- All right.

847
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,339
Some of the looks
you liked the least.

848
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:04,308
Sue started a great makeup,
and she stopped.

849
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:06,511
Next to Ian,
Sue's work really paled

850
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:07,778
by comparison.

851
00:38:07,846 --> 00:38:09,514
I don't see
Patrick's design there.

852
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,982
Yeah.

853
00:38:11,049 --> 00:38:12,950
All right,
let's move on to Tara.

854
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:14,018
It feels to me
like this creature

855
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:16,854
lost its arms, lost its jaw,

856
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:19,357
but she didn't reinvent I.

857
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,192
I mean, she didn't
even fight on stage.

858
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,593
She was, like,
"yeah, I know."

859
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:24,262
I don't know why
she ripped the teeth out.

860
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:26,564
If the guy wasn't bleeding,
why'd you rip the teeth out?

861
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:28,366
All right, let's discuss Jerry.

862
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,867
There's a huge issue
with Jerry.

863
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:32,570
He was unable to deal with
criticism from the clients.

864
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,405
Fighting back is not
the way you do business.

865
00:38:34,473 --> 00:38:35,840
You can't do that.

866
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:38,910
Jerry's just not
executing any of his makeups

867
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:40,811
with the passion
and the level of detail

868
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,380
that I'm looking for.

869
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:44,215
It just seemed sloppy to me,
like he just doesn't care enough

870
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:48,352
about the details,
about making something pristine.

871
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,755
All right, judges, have
you made your decisions then?

872
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:52,623
- I think so.
- I think so, yeah.

873
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:53,558
- We have.
- Let's do it.

874
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:56,460
Let's bring them back out.

875
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:04,202
All right, Glenn,
why don't you tell us

876
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:05,736
about the top looks.

877
00:39:05,771 --> 00:39:09,173
The top looks tonight are...

878
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:10,441
Rayce.

879
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:13,578
You did a remarkable amount
of quality work

880
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:17,114
with awesome symmetry
and great organic design.

881
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:19,383
Ian.

882
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:23,087
For a cleanly executed vision
that transcended the design.

883
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,923
And RJ, a bold extension
of the core elements

884
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,426
of Patrick's design,
while still maintaining

885
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,595
and making it your own.

886
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:33,097
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

887
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:36,834
Tonight's winner is...

888
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:40,746
All right, who is the winner

889
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:42,315
of this challenge?

890
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:44,951
Tonight's winner is...

891
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:50,323
Ian.

892
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:54,694
Everything about your character

893
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:56,295
worked really well together.

894
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:58,631
And your paint job,
from the colors to the way

895
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,100
that you applied it,
was excellent.

896
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:02,368
Thank you.

897
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:04,704
- Ian, congratulations.
- Thank you.

898
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:06,939
Patrick actually
has a surprise for you.

899
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:08,774
Congratulations.
You really impressed us tonight.

900
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:10,343
And we thought
you may be interested

901
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,546
in getting a couple of tickets
to the premiere of <i>Total Recall,</i>

902
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:14,714
and I'd love to see you there.

903
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,682
Oh, my God.
I would love that.

904
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,318
- I--I wanna go.
- Wow, thank you so much.

905
00:40:19,386 --> 00:40:20,820
- Wow.
- Cool.

906
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:25,491
Pushing through and surpassing
my expectations, it feels great.

907
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,293
I think I'm starting
to actually believe in myself.

908
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:28,561
- Wow.
- Congratulations.

909
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:30,429
You can head back
to the makeup room.

910
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:32,498
Thank you very much.

911
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:38,204
RJ, Rayce,
you are also both safe.

912
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:41,641
Please head back
to the makeup room.

913
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,078
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

914
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,747
are in the bottom this week,

915
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:50,149
and two of you
will be eliminated.

916
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:51,951
Will you please step forward.

917
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:00,593
Glenn, tell us about
the bottom looks.

918
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:03,229
Tara, you suffered
from poor time management,

919
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,764
and your
decision-making skills

920
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:07,066
let you down from the start
this week.

921
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,568
Jerry.

922
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,470
Unfortunately, your painting
was the fatal flaw for you

923
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:13,005
this week.

924
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:16,576
And Sue, you spent too much time
on your face sculpt,

925
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,945
neglecting the rest
of the body.

926
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:21,781
So who is the first person
going home tonight?

927
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:25,151
The first person
leaving tonight...

928
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,954
Is...

929
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:32,692
Tara.

930
00:41:32,759 --> 00:41:34,227
You're very talented,

931
00:41:34,294 --> 00:41:37,897
but need to learn to trust
your gut.

932
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,999
Absolutely right.
Thank you.

933
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,567
I'm going home.

934
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:42,802
I understand.

935
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:44,737
I feel like I dropped the ball
a little bit

936
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:47,907
the last couple of challenges.

937
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:55,381
Oh, I wanna hug you.

938
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,387
All right, Glenn,
who is the second person

939
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,389
leaving us tonight?

940
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:06,759
The second person
going home tonight is...

941
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:13,266
Jerry.

942
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,668
You had a good design.
We just couldn't get past

943
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,937
the way that
the paint was applied.

944
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,239
Jerry, I'm sorry
that you've been eliminated.

945
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:21,941
It's been great
having you here with us.

946
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:23,075
Will you please
head back to the makeup room

947
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:24,710
and pack up your kit.

948
00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:27,747
- Good luck, Jerry.
- Thank you.

949
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:29,682
I don't agree with it.

950
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,017
But I'm okay with it.

951
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,755
I go home.

952
00:42:35,822 --> 00:42:37,967
Unfortunately,
because of my background

953
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:40,653
of my portfolio, there were
certain expectations.

954
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:43,986
And I did not live up to those...

955
00:42:43,987 --> 00:42:47,381
My first * is and always will be
special effects and monsters and

956
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:49,168
movies and all that kind of stuff.

957
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:54,008
I'm excited to go out with
more confidence and

958
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:56,614
make the career go on *.
