1
00:00:01,604 --> 00:00:04,338
This is the search for the
next big name in movie magic.

2
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:06,974
<i>Face off</i> is back.

3
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,509

4
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:11,078
all kinds of incredible talent.

5
00:00:11,146 --> 00:00:14,015
14 amazing artists rose to the top

6
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,150

7
00:00:16,218 --> 00:00:19,754
of imagination and transformation.

8
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:22,957
This season, the challenges
are tougher.

9
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:24,158
You're going to have to be
all alone in the dark.

10
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:26,794
That is a mess.

11
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:30,865
Your models will be completely
submerged in a water tank.

12
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:32,800
Something's wrong.
We're in big trouble.

13
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:37,371
Everything here
is incredibly dangerous.

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,442
I find the application of
color shockingly inadequate.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:45,246
- The pressure is more intense.
- I'm ready to pull my hair out.

16
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:46,948
My heart is racing.

17
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:50,151
And our celebrity guests
are blown away.

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,752
Very, very inventive.

19
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,921
All of that was just working for me.

20
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,523
It's great.
Scary, but funny.

21
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:57,225
But to come out on top,

22
00:00:57,293 --> 00:00:58,459
they will have to impress
our award-winning

23
00:00:58,527 --> 00:00:59,994

00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:43,764
and they're already
in a caravan of cars

52
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:47,468
with blacked out windows on
their way to a mystery location.

53
00:02:47,536 --> 00:02:50,104
They have no idea where they are
or where they're going,

54
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,906
but they're about to find out.

55
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:55,109
My name is rj.

56
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:57,411
I used to work as a makeup
artist in l. a.,

57
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,982
but my dad got sick, so i moved home

58
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,351
and i've been a teacher
for the last eight years now.

59
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:05,052
Shout out to my kids.

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,822
To get on the show,
i was up for the internet vote.

61
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,558
I had to do this makeup at comic-con

62
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:13,327
and pray that enough people
voted for me to win.

63
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:16,597
I am so grateful to be here
it is like winning the lottery.

64
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:20,434
My name is tara.

65
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:23,904
I've been doing makeup for 4 1/2 now.

66
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,907
I don't wanna be making things
in my kitchen anymore.

67
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:29,910
IT'S A DISASTER.

68
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:31,746
my name's ian cromer.

69
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:33,347
I'm a baby in effects.

70
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:35,049
I just got out of school.

71
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:38,185
I wanna learn from those people.

72
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:40,121
My name is brea joseph.
Oh, wow.

73
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,956
I own a special
effects/makeup company.

74
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:44,625
We supply simulated injuries
to law enforcement

75
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:46,193
and medical support forces.

76
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,595
This is go time.

77
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:50,398
I have practiced and practiced
with a baby on my hip.

78
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:51,466
So i'm ready to bring it on, man.

79
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,603
My name is heather.

80
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:58,205
I've been a professional makeup
artist for nine years now.

81
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,442
People underestimate me based
on my appearance and my voice.

82
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,811
People think i'm all sunshine
and butterscotch.

83
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,212
I could use that to my advantage.

84
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
How you doing?
What's up?

85
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:09,016
- Jerry.
- Hi. You look like a rock star.

86
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:11,786
I am positive that i am
gonna be the old guy.

87
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,587
I have 20 years of experience.

88
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:17,892
But i'm actually excited to see
if any of them have the chops

89
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,261
to challenge me.

90
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,595
Hi.

91
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:22,897
My name is sue lee.

92
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,099
I just graduated from
special effects school.

93
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,702
What i really love
about special effects makeup

94
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,971
is i can make creatures
from my world of fantasy

95
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,308
and have other people look at it
and inspire them.

96
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:37,311
My name is miranda.

97
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,480
I won a couple of competitions
after graduating

98
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:40,981
from makeup school,

99
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:42,583
and my work was featured
in <i>makeup artist magazine</i>

100
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:43,884
a few times.

101
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:45,553
It's actually on the back cover
right now.

102
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:51,459
My name is greg lightner.
Hey, guys!

103
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:54,495
I've been doing special effects
and makeup since 2007.

104
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:56,997
Monsters are my favorite.
I love my zombies.

105
00:04:57,065 --> 00:04:59,100
What's going on, man?
How you doing? Nix.

106
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,768
I'm known for my body paint.

107
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,903
This is the ultimate challenge.

108
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:06,107
I like to compete against
people that are the best.

109
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,810
So the bigger the competition,
the better.

110
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:11,545
All the contestants finally arrived.

111
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:13,314
Yeah!

112
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,718
Then we see this long
stretch black limo,

113
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:19,921
and i'm like, it has to be her.

114
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,831
Hey, everybody.

115
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:33,200
And there's mckenzie.
Oh, my gosh.

116
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:36,871
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to <i>face off.</i>

117
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,408
Season two is going to be
full of surprises,

118
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:44,545
and your first challenge starts now.

119
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:46,113
We're about to do this, really?

120
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,182
My heart is beating like crazy.

121
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,153
Behind that door
lies a whole other world.

122
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:54,622
It's one of the world's
largest back lots...

123
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,259
universal studios hollywood.

124
00:05:58,327 --> 00:05:59,794
Follow me.

125
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:02,196
Universal studios.
The lot.

126
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:05,333
This is every makeup artist's dream.

127
00:06:12,174 --> 00:06:13,607
Oh, wow.

128
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:15,910
Tons of movies have been
filmed here...

129
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:19,580
and now to be on the back lot
as an artist

130
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:22,883
in universal studios
is just... it's amazing.

131
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:24,118
One side's a giant building.

132
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,553
The other side's a cafe.

133
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:28,689
There is all these cameras,
trailers, and lights.

134
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:31,325
Then you look further down
and you see this tent.

135
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:34,562
Our models are already there
sitting and waiting for us

136
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,597
with their kits in front of them.

137
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:39,333
My palms instantly start sweating.

138
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:43,237
You are now standing
on the famed new york city set.

139
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:45,472
Just like thousands of makeup
artists before you,

140
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,608
you'll be working here on set

141
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:50,177
during your first
foundation challenge.

142
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,446
Foundation challenges
give you an advantage

143
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:54,715
going into the spotlight challenge

144
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:58,586
where someone will be
eliminated each week.

145
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:01,288
Inside these trailers is
everything that you need

146
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:02,823
to complete your looks.

147
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:06,160
Wardrobe, makeup, and even props.

148
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:08,929
Before we get started,
i've got a surprise for you.

149
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:11,298
Guys, come on out.

150
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,337
You all know ve neill,

151
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:18,973
three-time oscar winning
makeup artist

152
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,841
and our series judge.

153
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:23,010
And of course, you know conor,

154
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:25,613
the winner of the first season
of <i>face off.</i>

155
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,014
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

156
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,682
Oh, my god, i'm crying
'cause i'm so excited.

157
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,084
They're my idols.

158
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:31,886
They both just flew in
from north carolina

159
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:34,355
where they were working together
on the upcoming film

160
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:36,257
<i>the hunger games.</i>

161
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,758
Wow.

162
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:40,628
Conor was in the shoes
that i'm standing in right now,

163
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,763
and now he's working with ve.

164
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,031
It's a dream.

165
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,700
So ve, what made you choose
to hire conor?

166
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:49,904
Conor is an exceptionally
talented makeup artist.

167
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:51,472
And it was a no-brainer for me.

168
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,008
Ve actually placed
a lot of faith in me

169
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:55,276
from the get-go,

170
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,811
and i really appreciated
the opportunity.

171
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,115
Ve and conor will be your
judges for today's challenge.

172
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:03,384
You'll be creating
an entire character

173
00:08:03,452 --> 00:08:05,419
complete from head to toe.

174
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:07,855
Now what you create today
should really show us

175
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:10,357
who you are as an artist.

176
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:13,494
But you must use something
from each of the three trailers

177
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:15,162
to complete your final look.

178
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,997
The winner will receive immunity

179
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:18,599
in this week's spotlight challenge

180
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,001
and cannot be eliminated.

181
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:22,703
I need that immunity.

182
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,538
All these people voted for me.

183
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:26,040
So i don't wanna be the first person

184
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,675
that gets sent home.

185
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:30,477
You have 2 1/2 hours
for this challenge.

186
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,246
2 1/2 hours to do a full character.

187
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:33,580
It's gonna be nuts.

188
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:37,685
Your time starts now.

189
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,823
- Tim, nice to meet you.
- Evan, hi.

190
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:44,792
It is completely hectic.

191
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,728
I'm just trying to get something
that'll work for a mermaid.

192
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:50,130
We can do this yellow skirt.

193
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:51,198
Let's go over there to wardrobe,

194
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:52,333
find you something.

195
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,767
My name is rayce.

196
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,169
Currently i'm working
as a tattoo artist.

197
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:56,937
I've been married for ten years,

198
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,739
and we have four kids.

199
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,674
This is a huge opportunity
for me and my family.

200
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:03,110
We're gonna turn you into a cat.

201
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:04,411
My name is athena,

202
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,946
and i'm originally from the ukraine.

203
00:09:06,014 --> 00:09:08,349
I've been doing body painting
for about seven years.

204
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,184
I won several awards,

205
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:12,219
but the more i start leaing
special effects

206
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,722
the more i realize
that's what i wanna do.

207
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,691
I see this awesome cat nose
prosthetic.

208
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,727
Now my character is coming to life.

209
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:22,029
It's perfect.

210
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,165
My name is matt.

211
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,101
I've been working in the special
effects makeup world

212
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,435
for five years.

213
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:29,870
I'm completely self-taught,

214
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:32,206
and i'm a big fan of
the horror industry.

215
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:34,842
So i'm thinking my makeup's
gotta be something horror based.

216
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,413
I'm going for a high-end zombie.

217
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:41,515
Working on like a voodoo
witch doctor.

218
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,117
My name is beki ingram.

219
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,019
I've been an artist all of my life.

220
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,054
I was drawing before i could talk.

221
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,923
I can turn anything
into a piece of art.

222
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:52,693
Body paint, beauty, cirque.

223
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,228
It's gonna be glorious.

224
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,899
Here we go.

225
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:03,003
Have you ever worn
false eyelashes before?

226
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:05,873
I'm really into zombies
and beauty makeup.

227
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,374
So i guess we're going burlesque.

228
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,977
Stripper, zombie.

229
00:10:10,045 --> 00:10:12,546
Blood, guts... that is my thing.

230
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,516
I'm gonna turn you into like
i'm zipping your skin off you.

231
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,051
So if i can get it to look

232
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,553
like he's being zipped
out of his own skin,

233
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:22,056
i'm hoping that'll take me
over the edge.

234
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:27,161
We're gonna do a ghoulish biker girl.

235
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:29,229
Okay.

236
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,798
My model is tiny.

237
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,868
I instantly see elf for my character.

238
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:39,506
As i look around,
i can't imagine myself losing.

239
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:43,077
The zippers that i chose
are way too heavy.

240
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,579
I go to get better zippers,
and all the wardrobe's gone now.

241
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,448
How? How?

242
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:50,517
And the more i'm stressing out,
the worse it's getting.

243
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,886
I'm not gonna give up.

244
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:54,822
20 minutes left.

245
00:10:55,991 --> 00:10:57,558
Be right back.

246
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:00,227
It's drop dead time.

247
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:03,697
The countdown is getting closer
and closer and closer.

248
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:12,706
All right, everybody.
Time is up!

249
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:13,974
Brushes down.

250
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,275
Hey, rj.

251
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,177
So tell us about your creation here.

252
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:19,746
Well, she's kind of like
a ghoulish sandy, i think,

253
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,448
from <i>grease.</i>

254
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:24,551
My boyfriend's back, but he's
in that helmet kind of thing.

255
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:26,320
The complete picture is terrific.

256
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:27,921
You did great on the blood
and everything.

257
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:28,956
- I like it.
- Thanks.

258
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,757
Nice job.

259
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:34,461
This is a leopard/humanoid warrior.

260
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,963
You did a nice job.

261
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,397
Do you do a lot of body painting?

262
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:39,333
Yes, this is kinda my forte.

263
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,468
I'm really impressed
by all the detail

264
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,936
and your color choices.

265
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:45,539
But up close, you see a lot
of the streaks and stuff

266
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:49,643
from the paint brushes.

267
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:52,179
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

268
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,448
- Hi, brea.
- Hello.

269
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:56,383
Why don't you tell us
about your creation here?

270
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:59,319
He is actually... his costume,
the human skin.

271
00:11:59,387 --> 00:12:01,188
I like your concept,

272
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:02,890
but you tried to do too much,
i think.

273
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,092
Using the teeth
on the outside of the face

274
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,561
was a really bad choice,

275
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,130
and everything
is very poorly blended.

276
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:13,333
- Thank you, brea.
- All right, thank you.

277
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,968
I'm a little intimidated of ve.

278
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:16,370
She doesn't mince words.

279
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:19,339
Kinda went for a little elf queen.

280
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,375
I had a feeling there'd be
a lot of monstery stuff,

281
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:23,944
so i wanted to do something
a little different than that.

282
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:26,647
It's all very cohesive
and really well put together.

283
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:27,981
I agree with ve.

284
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,650
You blended your edges nicely.

285
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:31,218
Made some cool color choices.

286
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:33,353
Nice job.
Hi, nix.

287
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,955
How does this reflect you
as an artist?

288
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,590
I wanted to go more of like
an avant garde,

289
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:38,325
desert circus.

290
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,694
I figured with the mustache,
i'd become the ringleader.

291
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:43,063
Nothing seems to be going together.

292
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:44,798
I think if you could've
followed through

293
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,500
with a similar design
that you have on her face

294
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,669
like on the tops of
her shoulders or her knees

295
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:50,437
or something, then i think you'd have

296
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:53,173
- a cohesive design.
- Right, i understand.

297
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:55,409
I came here with my "a" game.

298
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,512
But after seeing
everybody else's work,

299
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,514
i'm worried.

300
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:03,350
Honestly, i even feel
a little intimidated now.

301
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:04,652
For sure.

302
00:13:12,427 --> 00:13:13,727
Judges...

303
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:15,062
how do you think they did?

304
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,730
I think everybody did
a pretty great job.

305
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:19,566
I think some of you might have
missed it a little bit.

306
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:23,036
Who didn't do so well?

307
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:24,738
Brea...

308
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:26,506
i think you bit off a little
more than you could chew.

309
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,475
And nix.

310
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:31,979
I just feel that it was
completed incohesive.

311
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,848
Who were your top picks?

312
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,683
Rj.

313
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:39,286
You did a great application.
Liked your colors.

314
00:13:39,354 --> 00:13:41,622
Overall, great look.

315
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,823
And jerry.

316
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:44,324
Very clean makeup job,

317
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:46,526
and i think that makeup
could be put on film

318
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,128
flattered.

319
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,463
So who's our winner?

320
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:51,131
The winner is...

321
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:02,175
who were your top picks?

322
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:04,478
Rj, great job today.

323
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:05,946
Overall, great look.

324
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:09,349
And jerry, that makeup
could be put on film.

325
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:12,052
Who's our winner?

326
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,388
The winner is...

327
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:16,757
jerry.

328
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,292
Thank you.

329
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,594
I don't mean to sound cocky
or arrogant,

330
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:23,330
but my goal is to win
every single challenge.

331
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,432
I'm off to a really good start here.

332
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,967
Jerry, congratulations.

333
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:29,636
You have earned immunity in
this week's spotlight challenge

334
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:31,972
and cannot be eliminated.

335
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,675
Well, i know it was a tough day
for all of you,

336
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:35,642
so why don't you go to the house

337
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,546
and i will see you tomorrow.

338
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:48,889
- The house was so awesome.
- Wow.

339
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:51,158
- Oh, my god.
- Look at that!

340
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:54,127
There's a gigantic blow-up
of anthony's body painting

341
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:55,262
from the last season.

342
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,731
Look at this.

343
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,100
So many of these contestants are...

344
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,435
- oh, my god.
- Kids.

345
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,603
I'm thinking the absolute
worst part of this

346
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,806
is living with these people.

347
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:17,918
So yesterday, we're at
universal studios back lot.

348
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:22,422
And today we're
on hollywood boulevard.

349
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,925
So we walk towards
the grauman's chinese theater.

350
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:26,760
So i'm super excited already

351
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:29,129
because it's like
a legendary theater.

352
00:15:29,197 --> 00:15:31,365
It's really cool
to be walking in here,

353
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:35,059
and i'm ready to find out
what the challenge is gonna be.

354
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:41,074
Welcome the iconic
grauman's chinese theater.

355
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,844
Beautiful.

356
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,645
I'm so excited.

357
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:48,248
My feet are standing on top
of stars of famous people,

358
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:50,083
and it's just... wow.

359
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,284
Well, this has been the setting

360
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:53,220
for countless movie premieres,

361
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:56,890
including one of the all-time
greats, <i>the wizard of oz.</i>

362
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:00,026
Now every great film begins
with a great idea.

363
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:02,496
In this case, it was a book.

364
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:04,865
Published in 1900,
original copies of the book

365
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:09,436
are now valued at over $150,000.

366
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,671
I present to you a first edition copy

367
00:16:11,739 --> 00:16:17,944
of l. Frank baum's
<i>the wonderful wizard of oz.</i>

368
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,950
We got like <i>the</i> book.
Not just a printing.

369
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,619
It's <i>the</i> book.

370
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,121
Now working in teams, you're
going to have to re-imagine

371
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:32,125
and modernize four of the iconic
main characters from the book:

372
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:35,662
the tin woodman, the scarecrow,
the wicked witch of the west,

373
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,165
and the cowardly lion.

374
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,834
You will be split
into two teams of seven.

375
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:42,836
But the teams are gonna be
a little different

376
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:46,440
than what you're used to.

377
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:49,743
Because this week,
it's the men versus the women.

378
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:52,379
- Wow.
- Yeah.

379
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:54,714
I'm like excited it's girl
against boys.

380
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:57,184
Fellas, watch out,
'cause we're about to bring it.

381
00:16:57,252 --> 00:16:58,485
Come on!

382
00:16:58,553 --> 00:16:59,719
This being our theme,
it's gonna be amazing.

383
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:01,154
And guys versus girls.

384
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:04,391
From what i've seen,
our team is gonna take it.

385
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:05,892
Now because you'll be reimagining

386
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,527
these iconic characters,

387
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:10,030
the judges will definitely
be looking for originality

388
00:17:10,098 --> 00:17:13,166
in addition to clean execution
of your make-ups.

389
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:15,068
They'll also be paying
special attention

390
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,169
to the continuity of your makeup.

391
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,704
So in other words,

392
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,440
your characters have to look
like they all belong together.

393
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:22,442
All right, guys,
you can head to the lab,

394
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,379
select your models, and get started.

395
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:40,060
Wow.

396
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,528
Walking into the lab
for the first time

397
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,463
is so exciting.

398
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:48,401
We have every single product
that you could ever fathom.

399
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,738
So we immediately group up
and choose the life casts,

400
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:55,242
which are plaster molds
of a model's face.

401
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,844
We get to choose the head casts

402
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,646
that we think would be best suited

403
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:03,149
for our particular character.

404
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:06,219
Go.

405
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,988
This is a really huge challenge.

406
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:11,391
We have to reinterpret four
of these classic characters.

407
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,059
Is that who we picked for scarecrow?

408
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,728
We start using this visio tablet.

409
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:16,062
It's crazy.

410
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,430
We got perfect measurements
for each person.

411
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:19,633
And i was like
"yeah, this is awesome."

412
00:18:19,701 --> 00:18:21,301
We really need to represent

413
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,537
all the female special effects
artists out there.

414
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:26,239
We wanna show we're girls,
we can do prosthetics well.

415
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,174
Okay, so what are the themes?

416
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:29,776
I was the first loser
on the first day.

417
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,711
The foundation challenge.

418
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,313
So i'm thinking okay,
they're probably looking at me

419
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:34,981
like they don't wanna be on my team.

420
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,283
So now i know i have to work
twice as hard.

421
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,817
Let's start one at a time.

422
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,719
We'll all put our ideas
and design onto one,

423
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:40,687
then we'll go to the next,
go to the next.

424
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,389
Who's a good sketcher?

425
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:43,890
You are?

426
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,092
During the design phase,
we conceptualize and sketch out

427
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,661
these characters on paper.

428
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:50,864
And from there, we can take the
concepts and narrow 'em down.

429
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,832
- What is the theme?
- Tribal.

430
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,467
Tribal african mysticism.

431
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,003
Let's make the witch
freaky with scarification.

432
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:59,072
That's when it gets tricky
and starts looking cheesy.

433
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,107
I'm not for tribal at all.

434
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:04,177
We start brainstorming
different themes.

435
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:05,679
I want it to be horror.

436
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:09,082
We were thinking heavily
corroded post-apocalyptic.

437
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,184
There's all kinds of ideas
bouncing around,

438
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,653
and people automatically
start attacking.

439
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:15,655
What the hell?
Come on, guys.

440
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:16,823
Tribal doesn't have to be primitive.

441
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:19,092
But we compromised fairly quickly,

442
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,395
and we decided that our concept
is tribal post-apocalyptic.

443
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:26,099
We are all gonna add these
elements of metal

444
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,134
to our characters.

445
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:29,903
It seems like we're all
breaking into groups.

446
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,504
It seems like like you and i
are on the witch group.

447
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,039
I'm not scared to work with brea.

448
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,341
Brea's not gonna hold me down.

449
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,609
I'm gonna amp her up.

450
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:38,511
I think if we were to elongate
the chin out,

451
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,981
the lips would definitely
look fuller.

452
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,116
- That's what i was picturing.
- All right, cool.

453
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:45,218
Visually, i want
the wicked witch to come off

454
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:47,454
beautiful, almost like poison ivy,

455
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:48,955
where it looks nice
but you don't wanna touch it

456
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,490
because you could get hurt.

457
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,660
Do we wanna give her ears,
or we just biting off too much?

458
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:56,129
When creating by committee,
it's awful.

459
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:58,932
Is he still kind of human
underneath, or is he all straw?

460
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,200
Time keeps ticking away,

461
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:02,502
and i'm trying to be a team player

462
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,571
even though the more
we're getting into it,

463
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:06,206
the more i'm fearful that...

464
00:20:06,274 --> 00:20:08,341
this is just not the direction
we should be going.

465
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,977
- Do you wanna do the lion?
- I'll go and do the lion, yeah.

466
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,113
So athena's my partner,

467
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:15,382
and we're doing this repressed lion

468
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,283
that's been in servitude.

469
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:21,821
He finally escapes,
he's aged, he's not pretty.

470
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,623
That's my style.

471
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,259
Let's do the vacuum forms
first before anything else.

472
00:20:26,327 --> 00:20:28,061
The girls immediately start working.

473
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,963
Power, heat.

474
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,666
With the power tools
and the sculpting.

475
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:36,636
Sculpting is laying clay on the
replica of your model's face

476
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:39,439
to create a prosthetic.

477
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,141
So we're going full throttle.

478
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,946
And we notice that the guys
are still talking.

479
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:48,715
I think we need to figure out tone.

480
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,450
You guys wanna go steam punk, right?

481
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:51,985
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

482
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:54,220
It's frustrating
that jerry's contradicting

483
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,423
stuff that we're saying,
and he has immunity.

484
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:57,791
Let's break down the pieces.

485
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:59,426
We're still going in circles,

486
00:20:59,494 --> 00:21:00,860
trying to figure out

487
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,362
what we're doing and where we're at.

488
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,031
We're doing too much deliberation.

489
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,833
Okay, let's just be decisive.

490
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,602
What are we thinking?

491
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,771
WE'RE...

492
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,540
coming up...

493
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:14,774
who's doing what?

494
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:16,342
We haven't gotten that far yet.

495
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,344
Instead of sitting,
how about doing something?

496
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:20,513
I'm still on my own.
It's making me crazy.

497
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,515
This is the best design.

498
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,918
Let's just focus on a few
particular atrocities.

499
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,553
And who's going home tonight?

500
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,791
You guys wanna go steam punk, right?

501
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,026
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

502
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,627
We're wasting time.

503
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,262
The team is undecided
on which direction

504
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,465
we're gonna go in because we keep...

505
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:41,367
coming up with one idea and
then changing it to another.

506
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,336
A guy like clive barker
does <i>wizard of oz.</i>

507
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:46,005
Let's just be decisive.

508
00:21:46,073 --> 00:21:49,309
We finally decide
our concept is a horror look...

509
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:51,745
a dark feel to the characters.

510
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,947
So the overall tones
are supposed to be

511
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,882
very desaturated.

512
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,284
Who here feels they're
the strongest sculptor?

513
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:01,087
- Or who wants which project?
- I'll sculpt anything.

514
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:02,355
Honestly, i'd like to do
an appliance,

515
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:03,690
but if...

516
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,291
i'm gonna handle the witch's face.

517
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,693
Okay.

518
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:09,229
The witch is afraid of water,
water kills the witch.

519
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:11,431
So she should be
kind of dried out and huskish.

520
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:12,932
Is that your sketch for the lion?

521
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,200
- Yeah.
- I love that, dude.

522
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:15,735
I think you should do the lion.

523
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:17,437
I mean, your concept's beautiful.

524
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:20,039
Rj, you're doing hands and claws

525
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:22,942
for the witch and for the lion.

526
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,344
I'm feeling a little steamrolled here

527
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:26,045
because they assigned the four faces,

528
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:28,214
and ian and i got what was left over.

529
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:31,051
Whatever you want me to do i'll do.

530
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,791
Should i even carve around her ear?

531
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,726
Yeah, yeah, leave her ears exposed.

532
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:41,327
You guys wanna give an opinion

533
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:43,596
before i start putting detail
into it?

534
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:47,200
I kinda miss these angles.

535
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:50,003
So does everyone agree to do
a straight line here

536
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,404
instead of having it rounded?

537
00:22:51,472 --> 00:22:53,339
- I like straight line.
- All right.

538
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:56,743
The tin woodman
severed his arms and head,

539
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:58,211
and they come back as tin.

540
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,348
So we're like oh, well,
maybe his torso's still human.

541
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,017
You like where this is going
at least?

542
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,451
Very much, actually.

543
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,487
Oh, thanks.
Go, team.

544
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:10,523
So i end up with the scarecrow
on my own.

545
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,092
Old-fashioned scarecrows were
just made with a pumpkin,

546
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,061
but i wanted to do it with a twist.

547
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:18,147
So there's a piece of metal over
his eyes and over his mouth.

548
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:26,673
If you're a cowardly lion,
you're probably starving.

549
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,875
You'll have a smaller frame,
you'll be a little nicked up.

550
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,446
I heard you're casting your own foot.

551
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:34,914
Oh, i am, yeah.

552
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:37,617
I am casting my fist
and my feet for the lion,

553
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:40,186
and it's a little hard
to do it for one person.

554
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:44,190
That's why it's taking me a while.

555
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:47,160
My concept is a different
take on the scarecrow

556
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:49,729
with a cone head
and an elongated mouth

557
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:52,699
that goes to his collarbone
with teeth.

558
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,168
I'm working with heather
on the tin woodman.

559
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,136
We're going more towards steam punk.

560
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:58,771
So he's having to go
steal human hearts,

561
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,006
and those are decomposing

562
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,609
so he has to keep going
and getting more.

563
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:06,779
I've already got the forms down.

564
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:07,981
I'm good with time, and i look over.

565
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:10,350
And i see athena... what's she doing?

566
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:12,285
Why isn't she sculpting the feet yet?

567
00:24:12,353 --> 00:24:13,920
Did you sculpt those
for articulation?

568
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:15,255
I did it on my hands.

569
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:16,789
He might not fit in this.

570
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:19,759
Athena wasted all this time
making a cast of her hands

571
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:22,329
when it's gonna be
on a big male model.

572
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,500
Still trying to figure out
like what's going on in here.

573
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,102
I really like it.

574
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,638
At one point,
i decided to walk around.

575
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,806
- That is really cool.
- Thank you.

576
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:36,576
- 'cause he looks aged.
- That's what we're going for.

577
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:39,012
The girls are better sculptors
than the men.

578
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,049
I would definitely go check it out.

579
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:45,818
- OH, THAT'S... COOL.
- YOU LIKE IT?

580
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:48,254
- yeah.
- Damn, you're doing a good job.

581
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,757
Thank you.

582
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:52,558
We're gonna have
to figure out something.

583
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,328
- They've got some bad-ass stuff.
- I know.

584
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:58,131
We've got a pretty good idea
of where we stand,

585
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:00,300
and then we look over
at the girls' side,

586
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,635
and oh, my god...
we're in trouble.

587
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:04,304
The girls are kicking our ass
right now.

588
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:07,540
The guys are not gonna win
if it comes down to sculpture.

589
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:10,143
It's gonna be about putting
in that extra 10% creatively.

590
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:13,313
So we need to really examine
what we're doing.

591
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,014
Can we have a little pow-wow
for a second?

592
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,316
Sure.

593
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,484
I'm just worrying a little bit now

594
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:22,689
that the tin man
only has mouth open and closed,

595
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:25,491
and on our scarecrow
the mouth doesn't move at all.

596
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,027
They're both basically masks.

597
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:29,395
Okay, so what's your solution?

598
00:25:29,463 --> 00:25:32,398
It needs to be resculpted.
I hate to say it.

599
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:35,368
I'm sculpting the scarecrow,
creating my drawing,

600
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:37,437
and all of a sudden
this concept's not gonna work.

601
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:38,805
It ticks me off a little bit.

602
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:41,274
I thought we all agreed
that this was the concept.

603
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,276
But i wanna be a team player
and i just know that this

604
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:44,777
is gonna bite me in the ass,

605
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,012
especially since there's
only minutes left

606
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,381
before the end of the day.

607
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:50,183
- Drill a hole here...
- okay.

608
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:51,718
'cause we should be able to...

609
00:25:51,786 --> 00:25:53,119
you think that will shine
all the way through?

610
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:54,854
- Yes.
- Hey, guys?

611
00:25:54,922 --> 00:25:56,890
We've got five minutes.

612
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:11,104
Guys, time is up!
Let's go!

613
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:21,447
It's the second day of the challenge,

614
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:23,516
and it's men versus women.

615
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,419
Our theme is tribal post-apocalyptic.

616
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:27,553
Today, we need to get our molds made

617
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:29,622
and everything prepped and ready

618
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,425
because tomorrow's application day.

619
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:38,264
Brea and i are creating
a very beautiful witch.

620
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:39,599
We have a scepter with a light in it,

621
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,200
which is pretty cool.

622
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:44,437
And since she's got these like
almost like tibetan talons.

623
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:48,808
And then we'll be painting 'em
a metallic color.

624
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,009
The guys' <i>wonderful
wizard of oz</i> concept

625
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:52,111
has a horror tone.

626
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,946
It's dark, a little twisted,
a little disturbing.

627
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:57,750
As a team, it feels like we
finally got our groove on.

628
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:07,060
Hey, everybody.

629
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,429
I have glenn hetrick,
one of our series judges,

630
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:10,930
here with me today.

631
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,765
All of a sudden, glenn walks in.

632
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,034
We're gonna do a walk-through
and see how you're doing.

633
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,670
That is very intimidating

634
00:27:17,738 --> 00:27:20,406
to have someone of that stature
and experience come in

635
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:21,974
and look over your work.

636
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,277
Right now, i'm working
on the lower bottom half

637
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:26,112
of the tin woodsman.

638
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,480
This is your concept?

639
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:29,615
No, i contributed the scarecrow.

640
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:31,551
Why are you doing this one then?

641
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,753
Um, we actually are delegating
the responsibilities.

642
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:35,154
We're all all over the place.

643
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:37,657
Is this sketch you have here
your original concept?

644
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:40,560
I went through a few
different variations.

645
00:27:40,628 --> 00:27:41,928
We ended up going with this one.

646
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:44,797
But we took pieces from that.

647
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,933
- Who's in charge?
- We have jerry right now.

648
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:49,335
Seeing as how he has immunity,
do you think he's the best

649
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:50,770
person to be in charge right now?

650
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,872
Not... not really.

651
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,474
Is there a team leader.

652
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:57,343
No, we decided to be
total open democracy.

653
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:58,578
Everything's voted.

654
00:27:58,646 --> 00:28:00,546
I'm working on the witch's fingers.

655
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:03,349
And i'm also working on
a piece for the lion's chest.

656
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,851
Kinda doing a little bit
of everything.

657
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,319
Would you say there is one person

658
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:07,753
that has taken the lead on all this?

659
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,055
- There isn't a lead.
- No.

660
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:10,656
I'm getting confused,

661
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:12,091
because we've asked this question,

662
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,559
and i'm getting two completely
different answers.

663
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:15,828
Is there a leader
or is there not a leader?

664
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:17,363
Okay, that's it.

665
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,866
I'm not gonna get my ass chewed
because we have no plan.

666
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:22,969
This is gonna be a huge disaster.

667
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,240
Would you say there is one person

668
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:28,708
that has taken the lead on all this?

669
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:29,976
- There isn't a lead.
- No.

670
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:31,310
I'm getting confused.

671
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:32,912
Is there a leader
or is there not a leader?

672
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,514
There wasn't a clearly defined

673
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:35,681
"okay, i'm gonna be
the leader of this group."

674
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:37,717
Yeah.

675
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:39,752
Okay, on the day
when you're applying,

676
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,053
who's doing what?

677
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,221
We haven't gotten that far yet.

678
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,389
Pick something.

679
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:45,158
Come up with a battle plan

680
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:47,426
so you know what you're doing
on the day.

681
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:49,462
Good luck, guys.
Thank you.

682
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,098
How are you feeling
about your symmetry decision?

683
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,633
The straight line down the middle.

684
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:55,468
Heather and i are kinda confused.

685
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:57,904
Does he want it to be
more symmetrical?

686
00:28:57,972 --> 00:28:59,572
Does he want it to be
less symmetrical?

687
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,842
He's like couple king pumpkins
pushed together

688
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,011
and then he'll have like a metal eye.

689
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,613
What material are you using
to create the final makeup?

690
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:09,849
- Foam latex.
- Okay, it's all gonna be foam.

691
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,951
And then you're just going to
pull out all your metal pieces

692
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,186
- and imbed it?
- Mm-hmm.

693
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:14,787
- Interesting.
- Okay.

694
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:15,888
- Thanks.
- Nice work.

695
00:29:15,956 --> 00:29:18,357
- Thanks.
- Good luck, thank you.

696
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,693
So far i have to say
i'm extremely impressed

697
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,795
with what's going on with the women.

698
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:25,531
They approached the challenge
the right way.

699
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,466
The synthesized this main concept

700
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,835
and then they allowed
themselves to go

701
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,971
and pick a certain element
and really run with it,

702
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,873
which is exactly what they
should be doing.

703
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,509
Is there one particular
concept with the girls team

704
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:37,743
that you like?

705
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,111
- I'd have to say the scarecrow.
- Yeah.

706
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,080
It's just...

707
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:44,116
there's so many subtle nuances
and details to the idea,

708
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:45,651
and it's all working.

709
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,687
A little concerned about
the tin woodman.

710
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,789
It's just straight down the middle.

711
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:52,758
That tends to look like
a cheap halloween mask.

712
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:54,627
Okay, so let's talk about the guys.

713
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:56,929
Very concerned about
what's going on over there.

714
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:59,799
Because no one's in charge
of their own project,

715
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:02,868
it seems like there's more
going on with the power struggle

716
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:04,737
than there is with the makeups
that are happening,

717
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,305
which is gonna hurt 'em.

718
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:10,109
Well, i guess we'll see how
it all comes together tomorrow.

719
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,280
Could we all talk?

720
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:16,816
Glenn made it clear
how disorganized we've been.

721
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:18,384
So rj and i took the reins.

722
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,753
We walked over to the other
teammates because we realized

723
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:23,623
we had to come up with
a team assessment immediately.

724
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:25,992
I think one of the things
that the girls have us over on

725
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,794
is they are each doing a character.

726
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:30,463
We're doing like a little bit here,

727
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:31,664
and a little bit here.

728
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:33,332
We've gotta stick to teams.

729
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,701
Okay, there's seven of us.
There's four characters.

730
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:37,870
The witch only requires one person.

731
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:39,272
You split up into pairs,

732
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,706
figure out what are your strengths

733
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:42,842
in terms of application.
I'll deal with the witch.

734
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,411
It felt like we got
everything figured out.

735
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:48,547
We started to get
teams of two together

736
00:30:48,615 --> 00:30:51,384
so we can really focus
on our characters individually.

737
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:52,285
That really helped out a lot.

738
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,759
Greg did a full chest piece,

739
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:01,927
and we still have no idea
how that's gonna turn out.

740
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:05,198
Is it gonna be too thin?
Is it gonna be too thick?

741
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,705
I'm making the witch's cape

742
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:15,808
by painting black liquid latex
on the floor

743
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:19,011
because i wanted the cape
to be very thin,

744
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:23,416
and i wanted to be able to just
roll that up once it dried.

745
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:27,687
You don't need to.
It peels right off.

746
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,522
Mm-hmm.
Mad skill, girl.

747
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,069
Time, guys!

748
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,172
By the end of day two,

749
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,940
i'm a little nervous
for application day,

750
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:49,675
because there are still some things

751
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,034
that we didn't get finished.

752
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,748
We got turkey too.

753
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:59,352
Okay, i'm making a salad.
How about that?

754
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,987
- I'm just physically tired.
- I feel you.

755
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:03,889
Our tin man tomorrow
has to be amazing,

756
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,158
because you and i are the ones
working less on that.

757
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:07,526
- Do you feel threatened?
- Mm-hmm.

758
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:08,861
I feel the same way.

759
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,463
But seeing what the girls did today,

760
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:13,499
i think we're even
if not back and forth.

761
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:23,509
Here we go.

762
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:26,078
So we arrive at the lab
on application day.

763
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:28,214
We have four hours to work
on our model,

764
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,116
and then we have one hour of touch-up

765
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:32,518
before they go onstage.

766
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,387
I'm worried...

767
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:36,088
'cause there's too much to do
by myself.

768
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,189
So hopefully my teammates

769
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:40,693
will be able to step in
at some point.

770
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,268
Big man, how you doing, buddy?

771
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:50,503
You're our model today.

772
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:51,971
You're gonna be the wicked witch.

773
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,572
So when our models come
the third day for application,

774
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,307
we don't have any room for error.

775
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:56,709
We're gonna cover you in warts.

776
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:59,512
Communication, work, and go.

777
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,051
Are we gonna do a bald cap?
What did you decide on?

778
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,520
No, let's put a wig cap on her.

779
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:08,854
The way me and ian are breaking down

780
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:10,956
our concept and design

781
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:13,526
is we're both going to do
the chest piece,

782
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:17,863
and he's gonna do the hair while
i do the overall paint job.

783
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:19,899
- Sue?
- They're cute.

784
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,734
Yeah, they're gonna be awesome.

785
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:24,937
Those paws look so cartoony
and gimmicky,

786
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,273
and that's all she was worried about.

787
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:29,475
Oh, this is beautiful.
This is even better.

788
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:32,077
Instead of sitting, how about
doing something to help out?

789
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:34,013
Jerry has immunity.

790
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,715
So he has nothing to lose,

791
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:39,552
where the rest of us,
if it comes down to it,

792
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,488
we're the ones
that would be going home.

793
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,957
Hey, guys, i could use some help.

794
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,059
I feel bad for tara because i know

795
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:49,562
that she's doing the scarecrow
by herself.

796
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,364
But my partner athena is dead weight.

797
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,467
So i can't walk over and help her.

798
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:55,635
I'm sorry.

799
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:58,571
We're running out of time,

800
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,105
so greg and i start cutting corners.

801
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:03,142
I decide to not use the cod piece,

802
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,643
the knees, and arms.

803
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,747
So now the main focus is the
head, chest, and nothing else.

804
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:13,920
15 minutes, guys.
15 minutes left.

805
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:19,558
Shove it up underneath there.

806
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:22,194
Time is up and i have so much to do.

807
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,930
I'm still on my own,
and it's making me crazy.

808
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:26,365
- Tara.
- Yes?

809
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,200
- Are you good?
- No.

810
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:29,668
Do you need help with something?

811
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:30,970
I haven't been good for a long time.

812
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:34,440
Coming up...

813
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:38,277
welcome to the face off reveal stage.

814
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:41,180
He's just awesome, and i'm stoked.

815
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,849
- That is a mess.
- Shockingly inadequate.

816
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,886
I feel like i am going
to throw up on the stage.

817
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,593
We've got one hour for last looks,

818
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:56,729
and on our scarecrow,
we still have hands,

819
00:34:56,797 --> 00:34:58,664
stomach, and coloring to get done.

820
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:02,134
Which is almost impossible.

821
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:04,637
If anybody has a hand
to help me over here,

822
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:06,505
it's just putting him together.

823
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:08,407
I'm not angry that
they're not helping me.

824
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:11,410
I'm just hoping that i can just
get everything done on my own.

825
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:18,250
15 minutes, everybody.

826
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:26,626
Time's up, everybody.

827
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:40,306
Welcome to the face off reveal stage.

828
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:43,242
Tonight, one of you will be
eliminated.

829
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,811
First, let's say hello
to your judges.

830
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:48,881
Owner of optic nerve makeup
effects studio glenn hetrick.

831
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,282
Hello.

832
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,718
Three-time oscar-winning
makeup artist ve neill.

833
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:54,286
Welcome, everyone.

834
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:56,889
And creature designer
and director patrick tatopoulos.

835
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:59,325
Hello, everybody.

836
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:02,294
This week, your spotlight challenge

837
00:36:02,362 --> 00:36:04,797
was to re-imagine
the iconic characters

838
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:06,932
from <i>the wonderful wizard of oz.</i>

839
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,368
First up is the women's team.

840
00:36:32,993 --> 00:36:35,661
I'm so happy.
It looks great.

841
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:38,063
I feel like it's
a complete character.

842
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:41,333
I see ve smiling,
which is also a good sign.

843
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:06,358
He's not making as much of an impact

844
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:09,094
as i felt like he was gonna make.

845
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:12,698
So i'm a little nervous.

846
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,323
Athena didn't manage her time well.

847
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:41,427
The body painter
did not paint the body.

848
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:44,463
She was supposed to age the skin.

849
00:37:44,531 --> 00:37:48,567
That's why we didn't have a shirt.

850
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,792
She looks striking.

851
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,395
She looks exactly how i pictured her.

852
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:20,590
That gold skin looks beautiful.

853
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:26,605
And then all of a sudden
we see dorothy,

854
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:28,540
skipping out onstage, being all cute,

855
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,275
with all of our characters
follow behind.

856
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:33,445
It's such a neat little picture
to see it all come together.

857
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,817
Next is the men's team.

858
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:38,143
He's just shiny and awesome,
and i'm stoked.

859
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:08,574
I think it looks really cool.

860
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:10,342
I feel like we have
the strongest character

861
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:11,743
among the boys' team.

862
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:12,845
So me and ian are feeling
really good right now.

863
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,860
Judges...

864
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:04,897
why don't you take a closer look?

865
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,431
When the judges go
for their up-close look,

866
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:07,900
it's very nerve-wracking.

867
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,268
They could either be
praising your work,

868
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:10,836
or picking it apart... you never know.

869
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:14,540
Oh, that's creepy.

870
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:26,752
As the judges look
at our tin woodsman,

871
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,755
i feel like i am going
to throw up on the stage.

872
00:41:33,259 --> 00:41:36,428
I just really, really,
really don't wanna go home.

873
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:41,533
When the judges walk up
to our tin woodsman,

874
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,568
i am feeling really nervous.

875
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:45,103
They're poking, they're prodding.

876
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,705
I'm freaking out.

877
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:50,142
I just really, really,
really don't wanna go home.

878
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,810
Can you move your face around?

879
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:53,578
I wanna see how the makeup moves

880
00:41:53,646 --> 00:41:55,847
when you try to emote through it.

881
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,756
Hairy metal.

882
00:42:04,824 --> 00:42:07,459
Glenn immediately noticed
the tin woodman's arms,

883
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:09,461
then he goes to the mask.

884
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:11,697
Is he trying to pull it off his face?

885
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:14,166
This is way more involved
than i thought it was gonna be.

886
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:20,272
Well, the judges would like
to speak with both teams

887
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,708
to learn more about your work.

888
00:42:22,776 --> 00:42:24,743
Ladies, let's start with you.

889
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,448
Let's start with the scarecrow,
and that was tara.

890
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:34,653
I know that you were working
on your own on a lot of this.

891
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:37,556
So that makes it
even more impressive.

892
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:40,292
Love what you've done with the hands.

893
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,627
And your integrating the crows
themselves.

894
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:44,563
I think you pulled it off
really well.

895
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:45,764
Thank you.

896
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:47,299
I like the makeup very much too.

897
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:50,936
The way you aged the costume,
everything fits together.

898
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:52,371
I agree.

899
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,172
Integrating the crows
into the makeup was really cool,

900
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,409
and i think the overall
design was really fabulous.

901
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:58,777
- Thank you so much.
- Well done.

902
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:00,746
Why don't we move on
to the tin woodman?

903
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:02,481
Which is heather and miranda.

904
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:05,584
Okay, who did what in this makeup?

905
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:08,353
Miranda sculpted the face,

906
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:12,057
and then i sculpted
the chest and the arm.

907
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,059
I gotta tell ya, ladies,

908
00:43:14,127 --> 00:43:16,495
it's probably my least favorite
makeup in the group.

909
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:17,629
It's very dodgy.

910
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:20,699
The paint job's not very good.

911
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,502
I don't understand
why you've got this thing

912
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,704
straight down the middle of his face.

913
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:28,240
If you would've pulled
the forehead over,

914
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:31,276
it would start to feel like
it comes together.

915
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:34,479
I liked the moisture
in the eye bubble.

916
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:36,982
That's about all that i like
about this makeup.

917
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,517
They didn't seem to like any aspect

918
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:41,019
except for the condensation
that was on the plastic eye,

919
00:43:41,087 --> 00:43:43,355
which was not deliberate.

920
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:45,124
I think there's a very good
chance that i'm going home.

921
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,528
All right, let's talk about
the cowardly lion.

922
00:43:49,596 --> 00:43:51,830
That was sue and athena.

923
00:43:51,898 --> 00:43:54,766
All in all, i think
your sculpture of the lion

924
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:56,201
is really fabulous.

925
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:57,869
I love his ears.

926
00:43:57,937 --> 00:44:00,038
They're all chewed up like
he's been in lots of fights.

927
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:02,841
But i'm kinda disappointed
that he doesn't have claws.

928
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:05,510
I wish you had also used
textures of the skin

929
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:07,245
the same way you used it on the face

930
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:08,713
so there was a bit of a transition.

931
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:11,083
Time management...
a lot had to do with it.

932
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,884
Right.

933
00:44:12,952 --> 00:44:14,686
Time management?

934
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:19,458
I did everything that i said i
was going to do from the get-go.

935
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:23,462
Finally, the wicked witch
of the west.

936
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,298
That was beki and brea.

937
00:44:26,366 --> 00:44:30,068
First, can you guys
tell me witch part that you did?

938
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:34,005
I sculpted the hat
and the chin, molded the warts.

939
00:44:34,073 --> 00:44:36,274
Beki did her shawl.

940
00:44:36,342 --> 00:44:38,110
We kinda collectively did the train.

941
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,346
She did the fingers...
the wonderful fingers.

942
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:45,217
And i sculpted her
broom/eye to the world.

943
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:48,920
You guys have gone so far
away from a traditional idea

944
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:51,790
in coming up with the gold,
and there's this very drow

945
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:54,059
sort of aesthetic to the neckpiece

946
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:57,329
and the headpiece.

947
00:44:57,397 --> 00:45:00,532
I really, really like it.

948
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,000
It looks very cohesive.

949
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:03,468
It looks like
the same person created it,

950
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,170
and it has direction.

951
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:07,572
I have one thing to say about it.

952
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,908
Spectacular.

953
00:45:09,976 --> 00:45:12,577
It's always so difficult
to hide an edge on a woman.

954
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:15,514
And the fact that you used
those fabulous moles

955
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:18,416
was really a good idea.

956
00:45:18,484 --> 00:45:23,555
A lot of the conceptual work
from that witch was my work.

957
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:25,891
But i wanted brea to shine

958
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:28,894
after her loss
in the foundation challenge.

959
00:45:28,962 --> 00:45:33,698
Let's look at the guys' creations.

960
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:35,267
Why don't we start
with the scarecrow?

961
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:38,069
That was matt and rj.

962
00:45:38,137 --> 00:45:40,539
I know i saw a sketch
on your desk, right?

963
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:42,207
- And did you do that?
- Yes.

964
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:44,376
I think that original concept

965
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:47,179
was maybe stronger to begin with.

966
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,947
I agree.

967
00:45:49,015 --> 00:45:50,448
I kinda wish you would've
stuck with that.

968
00:45:50,516 --> 00:45:52,951
Because his facial design
is something i've seen before.

969
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:56,154
It's so familiar to me.

970
00:45:56,222 --> 00:45:58,023
It's almost like one of those masks

971
00:45:58,091 --> 00:45:59,524
you sell for halloween.

972
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:02,160
It looks like a very dry
character, very dry.

973
00:46:02,228 --> 00:46:03,695
And you put gloss on the face.

974
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:07,399
And that gloss takes away all
the realism of this character.

975
00:46:07,467 --> 00:46:09,834
But i do like the proportion
of him very much.

976
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:11,836
And i like the fingers very much,

977
00:46:11,904 --> 00:46:15,307
because you created shapes
that were beyond human almost.

978
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:18,510
Okay, let's move on
to the tin woodman.

979
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:20,445
That was greg and nix.

980
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:22,214
Ve, let's start with you.

981
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,382
Who was responsible for that chest?

982
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,483
I was.

983
00:46:25,551 --> 00:46:26,952
Oh, darling.

984
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,055
I'm so sorry,
'cause the chest is funky.

985
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,490
For the chest part,
we wanted to have a opening

986
00:46:32,558 --> 00:46:36,261
for where the heart
had been removed from him.

987
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,929
No.

988
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:39,531
I could go on all day about things

989
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,132
that i don't like about this,

990
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,369
so let's just focus on
a few particular atrocities.

991
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:47,072
I find the application of the chest

992
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,641
shockingly inadequate.

993
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:52,844
And the other choice
to bring metal in the chest...

994
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:54,212
even around the wound of the heart,

995
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,614
you didn't even bring metal in there.

996
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:58,250
We did have vacuum form
pieces of metal,

997
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,019
but it didn't fit quite around it.

998
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:04,656
Figure out a way
to put your work on the model.

999
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:07,759
Also, that guy has really hairy arms.

1000
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:08,994
That's one of the first things...

1001
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:11,296
we walked up and went,
"oh, it's hairy metal."

1002
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:12,898
Hairy metal is not good.

1003
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:18,503
Okay, let's move on
to the cowardly lion.

1004
00:47:18,571 --> 00:47:22,674
That was ian and rayce's work.
Patrick?

1005
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:24,009
So who did what in this character?

1006
00:47:24,077 --> 00:47:25,744
I sculpted the lion face

1007
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:27,245
and did the majority
of the paint job.

1008
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:29,981
Ian did a lot of the hair work.

1009
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:33,818
- All the hair work.
- All the hair work.

1010
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:35,754
This is the best design tonight.

1011
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:38,089
I'm really, really impressed
with the styling.

1012
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:40,025
I love the face.

1013
00:47:40,093 --> 00:47:42,494
It's beyond lion.
It's almost like a monkey face.

1014
00:47:42,562 --> 00:47:43,895
That appeals to me.

1015
00:47:43,963 --> 00:47:45,196
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1016
00:47:45,264 --> 00:47:49,167
I really love the idea
of it being gray.

1017
00:47:49,235 --> 00:47:51,903
So expected to be this beige-y
flesh tone.

1018
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:53,638
Very well done.
I'm happy with that.

1019
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:55,173
Thank you very much.

1020
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:58,576
Um, i do love the paws.
You have the paws in there.

1021
00:47:58,644 --> 00:48:00,111
That was great.

1022
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,680
I love the paint job on the face.

1023
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:03,348
I think you did a great job, guys.

1024
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,116
I feel like if the men's team wins,

1025
00:48:05,184 --> 00:48:07,886
me and ian could have the top look.

1026
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:09,821
Let's move on to the wicked witch.

1027
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,890
Which was jerry's.

1028
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:17,362
I really dig the shapes
that you pulled off

1029
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,797
in the chin area.

1030
00:48:18,865 --> 00:48:20,565
And i like the way
that the nose works

1031
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,500
against the curve of the chin.

1032
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:24,102
Thanks.

1033
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,604
Jerry, i'm not a huge fan
of the way this makeup looks

1034
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:28,306
because when you get up close to it,

1035
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:30,642
the paint job is not good.

1036
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,812
I mean, it looks like you did it
with pencils or something.

1037
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,081
I don't know why you put
the teeth on the outside.

1038
00:48:36,149 --> 00:48:38,116
If you wanted her to look
all shriveled up,

1039
00:48:38,184 --> 00:48:39,684
wouldn't it almost
have been better to make

1040
00:48:39,752 --> 00:48:41,820
her mouth look like
it was caving in on itself.

1041
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:43,221
That was a group decision.

1042
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,623
We thought that the lips
would have pulled back

1043
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:48,026
and disintegrated
from the lack of moisture.

1044
00:48:48,094 --> 00:48:52,464
Okay.

1045
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,499
Well, the judges have
heard what you've had to say.

1046
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:55,900
Please head back to the makeup room

1047
00:48:55,968 --> 00:48:58,170
so they can make their decisions.

1048
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:05,410
Let's talk about

1049
00:49:05,478 --> 00:49:06,478
some of your favorite makeups
of the night.

1050
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:08,179
Which ones are they?

1051
00:49:08,247 --> 00:49:11,616
I personally think the girls'
scarecrow is stronger.

1052
00:49:11,684 --> 00:49:14,519
It's very cohesive,
he's cool and creepy looking.

1053
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:16,087
That's a very solid idea,

1054
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:18,223
and i think tara pulled it off
really well.

1055
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,859
I really like the witch
on the women's team.

1056
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,527
She was spectacular.

1057
00:49:22,595 --> 00:49:25,196
When she walked out,
she commanded the stage.

1058
00:49:25,264 --> 00:49:26,364
I agree.

1059
00:49:26,432 --> 00:49:28,400
I think the women had a better witch.

1060
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:30,602
I think that the men
had a better lion.

1061
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,070
Just not going with a flesh tone
to begin with...

1062
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:34,806
it's bold, it's really thinking.

1063
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:38,476
Okay, judges, let's talk
about your least favorite looks.

1064
00:49:38,544 --> 00:49:40,278
Well, you know, there's no question

1065
00:49:40,346 --> 00:49:44,682
that both of these tin woodmen
were absolutely atrocious.

1066
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,018
I think both were badly sculpted.

1067
00:49:47,086 --> 00:49:49,788
It seems the easiest
to conceptualize.

1068
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:51,256
Two bad sculptures,

1069
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:53,725
but for the guys, it was
a very bad conceptual idea.

1070
00:49:53,793 --> 00:49:56,194
So judges, have you reached
your decision yet?

1071
00:49:56,262 --> 00:49:58,329
- Yeah, we have.
- All right then.

1072
00:49:58,397 --> 00:50:01,533
Let's bring them back out.

1073
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,842
All right, glenn.

1074
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,611
Why don't you tell us
which team came out on top?

1075
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:15,947
The team that has won
tonight's challenge is...

1076
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,753
all right, glenn.

1077
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:24,522
Why don't you tell us
which team came out on top?

1078
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,461
The team that we decided has
won tonight's challenge is...

1079
00:50:32,665 --> 00:50:35,300
the women.

1080
00:50:41,607 --> 00:50:43,208
Thank you.

1081
00:50:43,276 --> 00:50:45,009
We're all very happy with
all the work that went into

1082
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:46,811
that very collaborative effort.

1083
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:49,547
Girls won.
God heard our prayers.

1084
00:50:49,615 --> 00:50:52,617
Congratulations, ladies.

1085
00:50:52,685 --> 00:50:54,619
But we can only have one winner.

1086
00:50:54,687 --> 00:50:56,588
So glenn, who would that be?

1087
00:50:56,656 --> 00:51:01,893
The winner is...

1088
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:03,595
brea.

1089
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:09,067
Thank you.

1090
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:11,302
We felt that the headpiece

1091
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,571
was probably the thing
that set the tone

1092
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,840
for the overall look the most.

1093
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:17,375
Well done.

1094
00:51:17,443 --> 00:51:18,810
To know that i went from the bottom

1095
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:21,045
all the way to the top
in one challenge...

1096
00:51:21,113 --> 00:51:22,514
who's ever done that?

1097
00:51:22,582 --> 00:51:23,781
I think i made a mark for myself,

1098
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:24,983
and that's what i came here to do.

1099
00:51:25,051 --> 00:51:27,118
Brea, congratulations.

1100
00:51:27,186 --> 00:51:29,921
You and your team can
head back to the makeup room.

1101
00:51:29,989 --> 00:51:31,689
Thank you.

1102
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:33,325
Well done, ladies.
Congratulations.

1103
00:51:37,129 --> 00:51:39,931
Jerry, as the winner
of the foundation challenge,

1104
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:43,401
you have earned immunity
and cannot be eliminated.

1105
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:45,437
You can head back to the makeup room.

1106
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,309
Rayce... ian...

1107
00:51:51,377 --> 00:51:52,744
rj...

1108
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:54,345
matt...

1109
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:55,713
you're also safe.

1110
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:57,015
You can head back to the makeup room.

1111
00:52:03,356 --> 00:52:05,857
Greg, nix, would you please
step forward?

1112
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,569
Nix, we definitely had some problems

1113
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:20,171
with the structure and form
of your sculpture

1114
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,208
in the details and lack thereof.

1115
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:26,678
Greg struggled with this chest piece,

1116
00:52:26,746 --> 00:52:29,213
and it just did not work out
in the end.

1117
00:52:29,281 --> 00:52:30,682
And who's going home tonight?

1118
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,152
The person leaving tonight is...

1119
00:52:38,758 --> 00:52:40,725
greg.

1120
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:46,431
We felt that the chest piece

1121
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:49,100
was the major contributing factor

1122
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:52,737
to the failure of this
particular makeup.

1123
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:55,139
Greg, you have been
eliminated tonight.

1124
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:56,441
Please head back to the makeup room

1125
00:52:56,509 --> 00:53:00,411
and pack up your kit.

1126
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:04,282
The hardest part is
i wasn't true to myself.

1127
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:07,552
And i was really trying to be
a team player.

1128
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,654
I wasn't assertive.

1129
00:53:12,224 --> 00:53:14,459
You're all awesome.

1130
00:53:17,496 --> 00:53:19,163
I wish i could've shown
a little bit more,

1131
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,766
but i think my best work
is still yet to come.

1132
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:23,735
So i'm hoping it's only gonna
get better from here.
