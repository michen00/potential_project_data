1
00:00:01,717 --> 00:00:04,152
Tonight, on the season finale
of <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,920
Three artists remain,

3
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:07,922
but only one can come out
on top.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,357
Rayce.

5
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,192
I'm a tattoo artist from Idaho.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,660
I shouldn't even have got
on the show,

7
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:15,263
and yet, I'm in the finale.
This is crazy.

8
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,998
It's very elegant
and pretty, and I like that.

9
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,100
I'm so close, I can taste it.

10
00:00:19,168 --> 00:00:21,036
- Ian.
- I just got out of school.

11
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:23,004
I'm the youngest person here,

12
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:25,073
and I've got a couple of wins
under my belt.

13
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,708
I'm starting
to actually believe in myself.

14
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,009
This is a stellar makeup.

15
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:30,445
I feel like
I've grown exponentially.

16
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:32,747
- RJ.
- Been teaching high school

17
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:34,816
in west Virginia
for eight years.

18
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:36,651
I need the money,
I need this exposure

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,520
to get back and do this
for a living again.

20
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,388
This whole design
is so clever and cute.

21
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:44,059
I have a good shot
at winning this.

22
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:47,195
They'll battle
in one epic final challenge.

23
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:49,931
I've never done a prosthetic
for a dance routine.

24
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,466
My heart's just, like,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

25
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:53,501
- Wow!
- I think it's even worse.

26
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:54,903
I'm really bummed right now.

27
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,971
All of my characters
had something wrong with them.

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,075
- My brain is fried.
- RJ is getting overwhelmed.

29
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:01,476
- I don't care.
- Do you want to switch?

30
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:03,144
It is a disaster.
Help me.

31
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:05,447
- You can't glue that down yet.
- Take this off.

32
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:07,949
- I love it.
- It all goes down

33
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:11,052
on the biggest stage
in <i>Face Off</i> history.

34
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,188
There are so many people
there, it's overwhelming.

35
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:15,990
- I'm almost shaking.
- This is the moment of truth.

36
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:17,992
Now it's time
to put them all to the test.

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,739
I'm a nervous wreck right now.

38
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:24,401
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic and win it all?

39
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:25,368
Find out tonight

40
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:27,742
on the season finale
of <i>Face Off.</i>

44
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:15,496
the hell
out of the people we love.

45
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:18,265
This is the longest I've ever
been away from my kids.

46
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,634
And it's really messing with me.

47
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:23,337
And then today,
I'm walking down the hall--

48
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,473
And I see my family.

49
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:30,377
Oh, my gosh!

50
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:32,880
Ahh.
I see my girlfriend Alana.

51
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,717
I miss you too.

52
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,753
My little sister
is on the computer!

53
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,125
I miss you.

54
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:48,028
To just hear their voices,
and seeing their faces--

55
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:49,329
I couldn't ask
for anything more.

56
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:51,031
I miss you guys so much.

57
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:57,538
Seeing her really justified,

58
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:00,307
to me, what I'm doing here.

59
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,010
I'm trying
to make a name for myself,

60
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,279
so that I can better take care
of the people that I love.

61
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:07,047
You guys look fantastic.

62
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:09,349
You look like
you're all a year older.

63
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,954
This whole competition
is for them.

64
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:16,089
And I need to really step it up
for this last challenge.

65
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,429
This is the finale,

66
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:24,031
and one of us is gonna win
100 grand.

67
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:26,433
Alana and I
could really use that.

68
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,734
We're looking to move
to California.

69
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:30,571
Ahh, this is crazy.

70
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:31,872
All right, I love you guys.

71
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,707
Bye-bye.

72
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,175
It was neat
to have us all reconnect

73
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:36,777
with the people back home.

74
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:38,645
Big guy.

75
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:39,780
It's the last challenge
of the season,

76
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,915
and we all have this spark now.

77
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:43,951
I think we all need to vent.

78
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:54,061
Good morning, guys.

79
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:55,362
Good morning.

80
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,930
There's only one challenge

81
00:03:56,998 --> 00:04:00,300
standing between you
and our grand prize.

82
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:03,136
Your final spotlight challenge

83
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:06,473
will not only test your ability
to create incredible makeups,

84
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,643
but also create
highly functional ones.

85
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:12,045
That's because
they will be tested,

86
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:13,513
three days from now,

87
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:16,416
performing
a choreographed dance routine...

88
00:04:16,484 --> 00:04:19,419
- Whoa.
- In front of a live audience

89
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:20,754
at the historic Alex Theater.

90
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:22,256
Whew.

91
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:24,691
I've never done a prosthetic
for a dance routine,

92
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,827
never done
a makeup for a dance routine.

93
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:28,528
So I don't really know
what to do.

94
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:32,633
Each of you will pick one
of three film genres--

95
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,436
Fantasy, horror, and sci-fi.

96
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:37,938
This is awesome.

97
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:41,174
Based on your genre,
you're going to have to create

98
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:43,543
three characters to go with it.

99
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:47,381
There is no way I'm gonna
be able to do three makeups

100
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:49,583
and get them onstage,
ready to dance, by myself.

101
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:50,817
Let's pick your genres.

102
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:53,320
I would really love
to have fantasy,

103
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:55,756
which is the basis
of what I love to do.

104
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:58,025
- RJ.
- I'm gonna take fantasy.

105
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,927
All right,
I can live with sci-fi.

106
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:02,029
You know, grew up
with old <i>Star Trek.</i>

107
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,064
- Rayce.
- Sci-fi.

108
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:05,699
Damn.
Great.

109
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,768
Well, then I guess, Ian--
Horror.

110
00:05:07,835 --> 00:05:10,103
Ooh.
I'm just not a big horror fan.

111
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:12,472
So we realize
that creating three characters

112
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,874
is too much work
for one person.

113
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:15,642
So we brought in some help
for you.

114
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:19,446
Whoo!

115
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:22,416
All our fallen brothers
and sisters come walking in.

116
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,484
Look at all
your beautiful faces.

117
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:26,520
Oh.

118
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,723
Okay, so you will each get
to choose three

119
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:32,426
of your former competitors
to join your team.

120
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:34,194
Rayce, you get to pick first.

121
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:37,731
- Jerry.
- Yes.

122
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,033
- Ian.
- Think I'll go with Matt.

123
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:41,668
- He's good with horror.
- I've been absolved.

124
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,204
- RJ?
- Got to take my roommate.

125
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,973
- Give me a hug.
- Miranda.

126
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,209
We all chose people
that are going to play

127
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:52,512
to our genre really well.

128
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,382
- I'm ready to win?
- To win.

129
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,684
Okay, so you all
will be meeting

130
00:05:57,752 --> 00:05:59,052
with our choreographers
Lindsay and Craig

131
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,488
a little bit later on
to go over your designs.

132
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:04,024
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

133
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:06,526
Before we really get going,
I want to get

134
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:08,395
a good, hard, strong concept.

135
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:11,531
The stakes are high,
so I have to give it my all.

136
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,233
We have two females, one male.

137
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,068
We came up with
a luciferian character.

138
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:19,106
We could have one owner
of these two chained-up beings.

139
00:06:19,173 --> 00:06:21,408
The two hellhounds
will be fallen angels.

140
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,477
We need some rib-cage appliances

141
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:26,046
and also hands
for the luciferian character.

142
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:27,381
And we could break the chains,

143
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:28,648
so they could do
their dance routine as well.

144
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:30,650
I think that's pretty solid.

145
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:33,687
Let's draw, girls.
My team is called "RJ's Angels."

146
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:37,324
They could be fairies.

147
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,792
- Trolls.
- Mermaids.

148
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,260
All three of us are
just tossing these ideas out.

149
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:42,529
- Vampires.
- Mutants.

150
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:46,366
- Two-headed elves.
- RJ is getting overwhelmed.

151
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:47,801
He doesn't want to step
on anybody's toes.

152
00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:49,469
- I don't know.
- He doesn't understand

153
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:50,737
that he's not hurting
our feelings,

154
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,539
but he needs to make decisions.

155
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:53,874
You got to help us.

156
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,810
- You got to direct us right now.
- I think-- Okay.

157
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,512
Let me get that for you, sir.

158
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:01,548
If any time I'm gonna do
my style, it's the finale.

159
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:02,883
It's got to be all me,
at this point.

160
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,086
I want to have
a very light entity,

161
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,155
and I want to have
a very dark entity

162
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:10,223
that represent
two different worlds.

163
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,958
And then there's gonna be
the woman character.

164
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:14,327
She's gonna be split
down the middle,

165
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:17,798
pulled into
two different dimensions.

166
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:19,332
What do you guys think?
Too weird?

167
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,534
- No, not at all.
- No, not at all.

168
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,069
I think it's really good,
actually.

169
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,538
I couldn't have
come up with that.

170
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:26,873
We immediately start working.

171
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:30,210
Miranda is sculpting faster than
I've seen her sculpt before.

172
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:33,013
Which is great, because
the stakes are amped up on this,

173
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:36,583
and I want Rayce to win.

174
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,387
My brain is fried
from this season.

175
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:41,455
Hi.
How're you guys doing?

176
00:07:41,522 --> 00:07:42,789
How are you doing?

177
00:07:42,857 --> 00:07:45,992
All the dancers
will be dancing together.

178
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,296
But each trio will have a moment
where they get to shine.

179
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:51,164
We want to break the chains.

180
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:53,033
And then have them
do their own dances.

181
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:54,501
You guys are
kind of choreographers.

182
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,436
- This is nice.
- I'm loving it.

183
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:58,238
Craig and Lindsay
gave us the okay,

184
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,207
and it was just awesome.
Thank you.

185
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,909
We've got this mask that's
gonna be velcroed together.

186
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:04,811
And then they're actually
gonna rip it apart

187
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,848
- and then reveal her face.
- It's pretty cool.

188
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:10,217
I just want to make sure
that they have full vision.

189
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:11,685
- Cool.
- How're you guys doing?

190
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:12,853
Hey, everybody.

191
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,855
I finally decided
on my concept.

192
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:21,294
We had this idea
where he would be wrapped up

193
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:22,996
in these ribbon things

194
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:24,397
and they would be
actually pulling on it.

195
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:28,502
It won't work.

196
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,371
'Cause you wouldn't want them
to be restricted.

197
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,772
They need to be able to move
around as much as possible.

198
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,608
Okay.

199
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:38,211
So we realize
we have to start from scratch.

200
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,412
And we have six hours left.

201
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,615
- We got to start sculpting.
- Yeah.

202
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:46,353
I don't think RJ sees
how much needs to be done

203
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,588
in the little time frame
that we have.

204
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:52,159
Come on, you can make up
a fantasy character, RJ.

205
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:53,627
Eventually, I go,

206
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:55,262
"Okay, forget it.
Here's what we're doing."

207
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,597
There's a Phoenix
being fought over

208
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:59,733
by an evil alchemist,

209
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,568
and this good Mother Earth
is trying

210
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,570
to protect the Phoenix
from this evil dude.

211
00:09:03,638 --> 00:09:05,472
Okay.

212
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,376
And then we finally start
to sculpt.

213
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:12,245
What if we just had a skeleton,

214
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:14,281
and the muscles are coming out?

215
00:09:14,348 --> 00:09:15,949
Yeah, that looks perfect.

216
00:09:16,017 --> 00:09:17,450
I'm feeling pretty good.
We have a lot to do still.

217
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:20,020
And I'm giving each artist
creative freedom.

218
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,389
Hey, boss man, want to come
take a look at this?

219
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:24,157
These first two days,

220
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:25,559
I really want
to get everything molded,

221
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:27,127
because that gives us
the third day

222
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:28,662
to pre-paint everything.

223
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,664
Then we're gonna be sitting
really well for application day.

224
00:09:30,731 --> 00:09:32,165
I like it.

225
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:34,000
Athena's sculpting the Phoenix.

226
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:39,139
But when I look over there
and I see this cartoon parrot,

227
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:40,574
I get freaked out.

228
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:49,950
Do you think you'd be okay
with more of a realistic thing?

229
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,519
RJ needs to say,
"Hey, this looks like a parrot,

230
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,221
not like a Phoenix."

231
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:56,456
This is looking
really good, though.

232
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:58,124
And I'm like,
"Oh, my God!"

233
00:09:58,192 --> 00:10:01,561
Looks like a hot mess.

234
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:02,762
Beki's sort of kicked me
in the butt.

235
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,433
So I start to take apart
Athena's beak.

236
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,001
But time is running out.

237
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:10,403
I'm getting very nervous.

238
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:17,544
By the time
the clock strikes zero,

239
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,813
I'm freaking out, because
if we're this far behind,

240
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,883
we're not gonna get
everything done in time.

241
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:25,518
Coming up...

242
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:27,921
I've actually brought somebody
to mentor you through this.

243
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,623
Holy shit.

244
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,560
Fuck, it is a disaster.

245
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:37,063
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i> finale.

246
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:38,398
This is it.

247
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:46,350
Day two--
and we only have ten hours

248
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,619
to bust all this stuff out.

249
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,088
But I feel like
we're a little behind.

250
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:55,225
Athena's beak kind of
reminded me of a parrot's.

251
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:58,829
So I was like, "Let me
tweak this just a little bit."

252
00:10:58,897 --> 00:11:00,831
I made the beak
a little bit more streamlined.

253
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,767
- Yeah, I like it.
- I don't know about that.

254
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,469
I don't think
it's too big, honestly.

255
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:06,703
I think that'll move fine.

256
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:08,472
Because this is a lot
of surface area.

257
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,641
Matt's continuing on that cowl,

258
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,976
and then Sue's working
on the face of Lucifer.

259
00:11:13,044 --> 00:11:17,181
And Tara and I are gonna work
on the two hellhounds.

260
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,316
I want to really nail
these forms,

261
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:21,518
'cause these are the things
that are gonna sell my concept.

262
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:24,388
But I also know that the colors
have to be just perfect.

263
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:27,825
Okay, check out
the color schemes.

264
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:30,627
The only thing I worry about,
conceptually,

265
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:33,096
is Rayce's choice
to go with gray scale.

266
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,566
I think it might be a mistake,

267
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:36,867
because it's not
very theatrical

268
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,368
and they're gonna be dancing
on a stage

269
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:41,438
with lights and sound effects
and smoke.

270
00:11:41,506 --> 00:11:43,540
Hey, guys.

271
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,976
- Hey.
- Hi.

272
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:47,344
I know you've got
a lot going on,

273
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:50,380
but I've actually brought
some help in for you--

274
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:53,217
Somebody to mentor you
through this.

275
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:55,853
- It's my dad.
- Oh.

276
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,422
- Hi.
- Whee!

277
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,658
Michael Westmore is "the guy."

278
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,961
He is an Oscar winner,
Emmy winner.

279
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:05,662
I mean, so many
wonderful things have come

280
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,131
from his incredible imagination.

281
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:10,033
It's just awesome
to finally get to meet him.

282
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:11,835
- Hi.
- Hi, Michael Westmore.

283
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,370
Nice to meet you, wow.

284
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:15,806
So tell us about your designs,
your concept.

285
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:17,975
We have one male figure,

286
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,710
which is the dominant
Lucifer character,

287
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:22,446
holding two hellhounds
on leashes.

288
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:26,283
Also, I just thought of putting
leds into the eyes, here.

289
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,218
On <i>Star Trek,</i>
we had leds everywhere.

290
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:31,688
And we actually put it someplace
where you have enough overhang

291
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:34,291
where it'll actually put
a glow against the eyes.

292
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,592
Cool, cool.

293
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,728
This is gonna be
our luciferian character.

294
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,930
I blocked it out,
and Sue's working on it.

295
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,598
And also Matt is working
on the headpiece.

296
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,166
- We're all collaborating.
- In the end, though,

297
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:45,302
if it didn't work out,
you're responsible.

298
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,038
You're the one that
wears the hat.

299
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,641
The concept is fantasy.

300
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,310
I really like the idea
of a Phoenix.

301
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:54,578
If you want to keep out
of trouble,

302
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:56,246
you might extend it more,

303
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:58,215
'cause it isn't gonna take you
that much longer to glue it.

304
00:12:58,283 --> 00:12:59,983
Fine, I was gonna take
this beak area

305
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:03,253
and do the vacuform,
so it's actually hard.

306
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:04,888
It would hold up, with foam.

307
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,924
Put a high gloss over
the top of it,

308
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,092
- which firms it up a little bit.
- Thank you so much.

309
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,695
We're playing a little bit
with fourth dimension

310
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:14,998
- and alternate realities.
- This, I really like.

311
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,633
Is there anything
that goes back here at all?

312
00:13:16,701 --> 00:13:18,502
I'm staying away
from that part of the neck,

313
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:20,203
just because we know there's
gonna be a lot of movement.

314
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:22,272
She will have a bald cap.

315
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,607
Make sure
you get that down good.

316
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:24,775
What else do you have?

317
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:26,677
This is our ethereal character.

318
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,912
I like it already.
I do.

319
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,149
Do you think that it needs
a skin texture over it?

320
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:34,151
I like it smooth.
I really do.

321
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:36,186
Okay, so why don't we start
with Ian?

322
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:37,988
He's got a great concept,

323
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:40,090
but his sculpt needs
more smoothing down.

324
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:42,626
They looked more like witches
than they did beautiful--

325
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:44,027
- Demons.
- Demon women, yeah.

326
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:46,897
- Okay, let's move on to RJ.
- I love his design,

327
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:50,033
with all the little flame pieces
of sculpture that he's doing.

328
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:53,837
My only concern with him is he
has a lot of different textures.

329
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:55,439
That's kind of, for me,

330
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:58,408
would be the downfall
or the success of his makeup.

331
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,310
Okay, let's move on to Rayce.

332
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:02,212
It's gonna depend
on how the paint job goes.

333
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,048
My only concern
is with his leading lady's face,

334
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,950
because he's got two faces
going there,

335
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:09,886
that they both stay individual.

336
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,788
- That it doesn't become--
- A muddy mess.

337
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,590
A muddy mess, exactly.

338
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,459
I can't wait
to see the final looks.

339
00:14:15,526 --> 00:14:17,361
Good luck, everybody.
Thank you.

340
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:18,695
Thank you.

341
00:14:28,673 --> 00:14:31,308
I think maybe
the nose should go back more.

342
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:33,877
Like, wait.
Isn't it pointy, like that?

343
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:35,479
Like, once you see the front?

344
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:37,080
No, you can see through
on the side.

345
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,882
That's something
you haven't said yet.

346
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,517
- And it's not in the drawings.
- It's in all the drawings.

347
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,719
No, it's not.

348
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,388
Tara's got a little bit
of an issue

349
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:45,655
with the sculpt on the face.

350
00:14:45,723 --> 00:14:47,124
Okay, no, see,
you were just telling me

351
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,859
that this part was see-through.
And I'm, like, "No, no."

352
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,360
- No, no, no.
- That's what I was asking.

353
00:14:50,428 --> 00:14:52,029
I don't like to tell people
when they're messing up.

354
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,930
- Ugh!
- So, I'm just like,

355
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:55,132
"Yeah," you know,
and then I'll fix it.

356
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,233
- I don't care.
- Do you want to switch?

357
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,567
Sure.

358
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,303
I just wish I hadn't wasted
so many hours.

359
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:02,539
Different position
for me to be in.

360
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:05,876
Just got out of school--
I was always told what to do.

361
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,284
Hey, guys, that's time.

362
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:17,220
We're done.
Let's get out of here.

363
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:25,562
Day three--
we come in,

364
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,464
and I definitely have my head
back in the game.

365
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:29,866
All you have to do
to put that mold on correctly

366
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,868
is to slide it
and <i>then</i> put it down.

367
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:34,304
I got in there, and I told
everyone what needed to happen,

368
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:38,308
so I think we're getting back
on track.

369
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:39,843
You know what would be
kind of deep?

370
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:42,546
If the mask looked like a baby.

371
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:45,482
Holy shit.
I love it.

372
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,584
Jerry is phenomenal.

373
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:50,687
I have a lot to learn
from his experience.

374
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,294
Make sure you paint
that shit today.

375
00:15:57,361 --> 00:15:58,695
Okay.

376
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:02,799
My main goal in this group
is to keep RJ on track.

377
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:05,302
We are here for him,
so he can win this challenge.

378
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:07,838
We're creating things
that are beautiful.

379
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:12,109
But I'm worried the Phoenix
could go from pretty to gaudy...

380
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:15,512
- In 5 seconds.
- In 2.5 seconds, yeah.

381
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,380
I'm letting Athena do her thing
with this wig.

382
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:19,716
But it's looking pretty freaky
at this point.

383
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:22,719
So I needed to say something,
because there's a lot at stake.

384
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,055
We could do four more
little ones in these spaces.

385
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,022
You got it.

386
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,727
I know, I know.

387
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:38,869
On day three, I am noticing
what RJ and his team are doing.

388
00:16:38,936 --> 00:16:41,104
And it's so gorgeous.

389
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:44,374
RJ's making a concerted effort
to incorporate

390
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:46,543
every type of makeup.

391
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:49,212
He's got silicone prosthetics,
foam prosthetics,

392
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,047
body pieces, face pieces.

393
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:52,716
He's got headpieces, lace wigs.

394
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:55,519
I'm like,
"Wow, I'm impressed."

395
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,302
Shit.
I look over

396
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,372
and Ian's hand molds
are not wanting to open.

397
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,008
And I see the color is,
like, drained out of his face.

398
00:17:20,077 --> 00:17:21,511
We're running out of time.

399
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,981
And these hands are a big part
of the luciferian character.

400
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:26,650
I don't even know what happened.

401
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:28,285
We've got, like,
five minutes left

402
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,654
and my heart's just, like,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

403
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:32,322
Coming up...

404
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,257
We're so behind
on our paint schedule.

405
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:36,726
Help me.
It is a disaster.

406
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:39,396
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

407
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:41,331
This whole season
boils down to this.

408
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,288
I look over,

409
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,690
and Ian's hand molds
are not wanting to open.

410
00:17:53,758 --> 00:17:55,625
I don't even know
what happened.

411
00:17:55,693 --> 00:17:58,261
And these hands are a big part
of the luciferian character.

412
00:17:58,329 --> 00:17:59,896
We've got, like,
five minutes left.

413
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:01,298
My heart's just, like,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

414
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:04,501
We finally get it to open.

415
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:07,504
These hands are like shit.

416
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:10,574
It is a disaster.
The fingers are breaking.

417
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,943
These hands
are not gonna happen.

418
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,845
I don't have the time
to do it again.

419
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:18,248
So my main focus
is gonna be on my fabrication.

420
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:20,417
Time's up.
We got to go, guys.

421
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:21,451
Damn, we have a lot of work
ahead of us.

422
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,322
It's gonna be intense.

423
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,865
Today is application day.
This is it, you know.

424
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:36,133
This is the last day.

425
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,935
We have four hours
to work on our model.

426
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:40,937
And then we have one hour
of touch up,

427
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,639
before they go onstage.

428
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,008
- We have chest pieces!
- Oh, yeah.

429
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:46,610
I really got to bring it today

430
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:47,844
and I've got the team to do it.

431
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:48,745
But we've got
a lot of work to do.

432
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:50,280
Wow!

433
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:52,149
This is all supposed
to not be here.

434
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:53,316
Hmm.

435
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,851
This one, I think,
is even worse.

436
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:56,119
It's so thick.

437
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,921
The chest pieces
came out too thick.

438
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:01,458
And so I go in and manually cut
nice, clean edges.

439
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:03,460
Ah, it's so much time,

440
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:06,997
but I guess we don't really
have much of another choice.

441
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:08,331
I hold, you cut.

442
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:17,174
Oh, shit, people are here.

443
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,575
Hi, you guys.
How're you doing?

444
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:19,910
He's gonna be Lucifer

445
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:20,977
and you're gonna be
his two hellhounds.

446
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:22,712
You're our Phoenix, okay?

447
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,581
And the Phoenix
is the centerpiece

448
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:28,418
of the entire, uh, costume.

449
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:31,588
I pick up the Lucifer
character's tailpiece.

450
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:32,889
That thing weighs
a good five pounds.

451
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:34,825
And it should weigh
just a couple pounds.

452
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:38,128
That's like...
That's hella heavy.

453
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:40,730
For a dancer that has
to wear this thing,

454
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:42,065
it's gonna look like
a water balloon on his head.

455
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,700
This is crazy.

456
00:19:43,768 --> 00:19:46,236
I decided to cut some
of the inside of the foam out

457
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:47,604
and it'll take a lot
of that weight out.

458
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:49,005
That's a lot lighter.

459
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,173
Okay, RJ, do you mind?

460
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,575
I'm gonna start
these arm things now.

461
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,477
Wait, oh, wait.
You can't glue that down yet.

462
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:54,644
The application of the Phoenix

463
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,413
has to be perfect
the first time.

464
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,515
Because it's a thin piece.

465
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,649
There's no peeling it up
and putting it back down.

466
00:19:59,717 --> 00:20:00,884
All right, wait.

467
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:02,085
The headpiece has
to go on first,

468
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:03,854
and then the face has to go on.

469
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:06,056
And that's got to go up
underneath these pieces.

470
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:07,124
That's true.
So take this off.

471
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,759
Pieces went down out of order.

472
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:11,228
And we have
to peel some stuff up

473
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,497
to get the neck down
underneath the shoulder,

474
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:15,532
- or it'll pop right back off.
- You want to get in here?

475
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,300
- Open this up.
- Okay.

476
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:19,202
Everything has to be perfect.

477
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,637
I really want to win,
at this point.

478
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:23,773
Teamwork makes the dream work.

479
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:28,512
Here is your face.

480
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,653
All right, you can go ahead
and turn like this.

481
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:38,021
At the start of this day,

482
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:40,524
I wanted everything
to be glued down in two hours.

483
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:43,260
And two hours has passed
on the clock,

484
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,995
- and we're not there.
- Rayce,

485
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,730
do you want this
to cover his nipples?

486
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,231
Or does this go under?

487
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,901
You worried about it--
How it stretches up?

488
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:52,335
I'm worried about his earrings.

489
00:20:52,403 --> 00:20:54,804
We've just begun eating
into our paint schedule,

490
00:20:54,872 --> 00:20:56,373
which is not good.

491
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,210
Okay, do you want me
to color the beak?

492
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:01,278
I think we're gonna look good.

493
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,412
You finish what you're doing.

494
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,247
- Look at the time.
- We got it.

495
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:06,716
I believe
everything's glued on, right?

496
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:10,520
Uh, yeah.
Paint time, now.

497
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,296
- Are you liking it?
- Looks really good.

498
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:22,365
- All right, help me--
all right.

499
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,267
Right now, we're behind.

500
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:26,770
We don't have any appliances
pre-painted.

501
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:28,939
- Where do you want it to end?
- That would be perfect.

502
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:30,207
You can gray out these.

503
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:31,308
How are we gonna hide that?

504
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:36,813
- Five minutes.
- Holy shit.

505
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,048
Yeah.

506
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:39,182
You fit him,
and I'll pack my kit.

507
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,394
Hey, guys, that's it.
Time's up.

508
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:52,362
I'm looking around,
I'm like, "Great."

509
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,331
RJ seems to be almost done.

510
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,299
We still have a hell
of a lot of costume,

511
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:57,667
hell of a lot
of painting to do.

512
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:59,436
Last looks is gonna be rough.

513
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,741
We come to the Alex theater

514
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,610
and, of all the last looks
we've had,

515
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:08,878
this is the most important.

516
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:10,213
Last looks--
It's totally different.

517
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:11,548
Each team has
their own makeup trailer.

518
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:13,149
It's like being on
a real film set.

519
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:15,452
Damn, this just got real.

520
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,354
Oh, lord,
this is gonna be cramped.

521
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,289
- Behind you guys.
- Ready?

522
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:21,291
We're an hour away
from this thing being over,

523
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,525
so we really need to bring it
right now.

524
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:23,660
Face me.

525
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,064
If you could blend around
her eyes, that would be great.

526
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:29,466
Dry brush these veins too.

527
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:30,700
This is actually
supposed to be white.

528
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,502
Oh, shit.

529
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,137
We're so behind
on our paint schedule.

530
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:35,839
- The whole chest in red?
- Yep.

531
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:37,974
Okay.

532
00:22:38,042 --> 00:22:39,376
What do you want me to do?

533
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,511
All this skin underneath needs
to be airbrushed black.

534
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:42,712
I am so proud of these girls.

535
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,748
I'm feeling a lot of love.

536
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:48,885
Just wish we had more time.

537
00:22:48,953 --> 00:22:50,153
Sue, just fucking do something.

538
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:51,288
Just paint it?

539
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:52,255
There's not even time to think.

540
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:53,356
We just have to do 'em.

541
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,127
Okay, I'm gonna glue
your beak in.

542
00:22:57,194 --> 00:22:58,361
You ready?

543
00:22:58,429 --> 00:22:59,329
Are you gonna be able
to dance in those?

544
00:22:59,397 --> 00:23:00,263
Yeah.

545
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,303
Now, that'll stay on
through the dance routine.

546
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:16,880
Hey, guys, that's it.

547
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,114
Time's up.

548
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:20,016
This whole season
boils down to this.

549
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:22,285
I really hope
the judges give me some leeway

550
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:23,586
with the paint jobs.

551
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,721
It's, like,
an hour left of work.

552
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,089
I'm really bummed, right now.

553
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,325
All of my characters
had something wrong with them.

554
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:30,160
Hey, we did what
we could do, right?

555
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:32,195
There's $100,000
hanging over my head,

556
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:33,563
and it's huge.

557
00:23:33,631 --> 00:23:35,098
This is where I win
or I lose the competition.

558
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,733
Brushes are down

559
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,668
and I finally start to think,

560
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:41,071
"Holy shit,
I could really win this."

561
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:05,171
Ladies and gentlemen,

562
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:07,973
please welcome your host,
McKenzie Westmore.

563
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,977
Hey, everybody.

564
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:17,016
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i> finale.

565
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,219
And now,
please welcome our artists.

566
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:28,160
We walk into the theater,

567
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:30,996
and there are so many people
there, it's overwhelming.

568
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,366
This is the spire.

569
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:35,834
I made it to the finale,

570
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:38,837
and I didn't expect
to get this far.

571
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,439
This is it.

572
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:42,141
It's gonna be the end
for two of us,

573
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:46,312
and one of us is gonna win.

574
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:49,882
Tonight, you are going
to see some amazing work

575
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,885
from our
extremely talented finalists.

576
00:24:52,953 --> 00:24:55,354
For their spotlight challenge,

577
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:58,924
we asked each artist
to create three original makeups

578
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:01,627
based on a specific film genre.

579
00:25:01,695 --> 00:25:04,230
Now, there's a huge
prize package on the line--

580
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:08,434
$25,000 dollars worth of makeup
from Alcone,

581
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:12,137
the reinvented
2012 Toyota Camry hybrid,

582
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:15,241
and $100,000 cash.

583
00:25:20,046 --> 00:25:22,348
Before we see the makeups,

584
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:24,917
I would like to introduce
you all to our panel of judges.

585
00:25:24,985 --> 00:25:26,518
First, we have

586
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:28,621
the owner of Optic Nerve
makeup effects studio--

587
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:29,755
Glenn Hetrick.

588
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:35,861
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

589
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:37,696
Oh, yeah.

590
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:40,332
And creature designer
and director,

591
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,967
Patrick Tatopoulos.

592
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:48,574
Okay, tonight, our studio
audience will have the chance

593
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:51,377
to vote for their favorite group
of characters.

594
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:54,346
And the judges are going to take
that number into consideration

595
00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:56,048
when they decide on the winner.

596
00:25:56,116 --> 00:25:57,916
So let's get to it.

597
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:03,155
Tonight's first creations
are from Ian.

598
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,456
He had "horror."

599
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:33,018
Our guys come out,
the lights are hitting 'em--

600
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:34,186
It looks awesome.

601
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:52,004
The demons are creepy
and very disturbing.

602
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:55,541
The judges really seem
to like what I did.

603
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,459
The feeling I wanted to portray
in the makeups

604
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:14,827
is definitely there.

605
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:19,865
But, the paint jobs
aren't anywhere

606
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:23,602
like I wanted them to be.

607
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,438
Next up is RJ, with his take
on the fantasy genre.

608
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:55,434
I'm getting a little worried,
because when my makeup comes out

609
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:57,102
I'm not hearing
the crowd response

610
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,304
that I was hoping to get.

611
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,189
I'm really happy
with the skin tone

612
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,224
on the Earth Mother,

613
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,426
but I would've liked
to have seen

614
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:23,195
a little bit more brown
in the leg area.

615
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:42,514
But overall I can't be more
happy with the way they look,

616
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:45,184
because, in my head,
that's exactly what I saw.

617
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:54,159
And finally, we have Rayce
and his characters

618
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:55,961
from the sci-fi genre.

619
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:22,488
They look cool.

620
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:23,989
They look so much better
onstage

621
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,757
than they did when they were
walking away from the trailer.

622
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:45,410
My in-between character has
that weirdness that I wanted.

623
00:29:45,478 --> 00:29:47,079
They're pulling off this look.

624
00:29:47,146 --> 00:29:48,547
I'm liking what I'm seeing.

625
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:11,803
The dark character's spikes
are looking cool,

626
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:13,739
and I'm feeling really good,
right now.

627
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:18,911
Now, that is just
the beginning.

628
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:21,613
Because now it's time
to put them all to the test.

629
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:24,283
They're performing in a number

630
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,218
choreographed
by Lindsay and Craig,

631
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:28,620
to the track <i>Cinema</i>
by Benny Benassi,

632
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:30,255
featuring Gary Go.

633
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:32,391
Let's check it out.

634
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:34,526
This is the moment of truth.

635
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:35,894
My models are gonna
be moving quickly.

636
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,396

655
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:24,903
The dance is one of

656
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:26,304
the coolest things
I've ever seen.

657
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:28,940
Yeah!

658
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:30,542
Whoo!

659
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,378
And I think the roar
of the crowd

660
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,213
really gave me a big boost
of confidence.

661
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:37,149
Then, all of a sudden,

662
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:40,218
I see some places where
the prosthetics have come up.

663
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:41,553
My gut just sinks.

664
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:43,422
This could be it.

665
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:53,962
The dance routine was pretty
vigorous on the makeups.

666
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,864
And the abomination guy--
He's actually starting

667
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,266
to lift up on the elbow.

668
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,102
I see some places where
the bald caps have come up.

669
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:02,337
This could be it.

670
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:04,339
All right, everybody,

671
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:07,476
it is time for you to vote for
your favorite group of makeups.

672
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:11,446
Please make your selections now.

673
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,718
To our studio audience,
you have all helped to make this

674
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,754
a wonderful evening.

675
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:20,822
Our judges will take your votes
into consideration,

676
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,992
but now it's time for them
to take a closer look

677
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,795
and deliberate in private.

678
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:28,630
Thank you all for being here.
Have a great night.

679
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:38,540
All right, judges.

680
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,109
I'm sure you're dying
to take a closer look,

681
00:33:41,177 --> 00:33:44,746
so come on up.

682
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,149
I'm first up, and that's
pretty nerve-racking.

683
00:33:56,392 --> 00:34:00,862
I really hope the judges give me
some leeway with the paint.

684
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,832
Ooh, the nails are all eroded.

685
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,335
I really like that little
bat thing-- It's fantastic.

686
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:07,603
He sculpted the whole thing?

687
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,404
Oh, and his wings come out
to the side.

688
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:10,772
- Exactly.
- Wow.

689
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,376
Quite striking with the makeup.

690
00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:21,383
My blood pressure's
through the roof.

691
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,189
It's beautiful.

692
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:36,698
Yeah.

693
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:42,104
Thank you very much.

694
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:47,009
The judges would like to speak
with each of you,

695
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:48,243
to learn more about your work.

696
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:52,247
Ian, if you would please
step up.

697
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:54,516
Hi, guys.

698
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:56,885
Tell us a bit
about the backstory.

699
00:34:56,953 --> 00:34:59,187
That's our Lucifer character,
on the right.

700
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:00,756
He is the angel of light,
the illuminator,

701
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:02,557
that's why we chose to go white.

702
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:05,560
And these two women represent
fallen angels which he enslaved.

703
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:07,663
The chains represent
the Lucifer character

704
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,498
almost unleashing them
on mankind.

705
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:13,168
I think that you have
some exceptional concepts,

706
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,237
but I'm not sure how
they integrate together.

707
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:18,106
There's a massive contrast
of color.

708
00:35:18,174 --> 00:35:19,574
They're too far apart--

709
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,043
The three of them
aren't married.

710
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,047
- But I love the sculpture.
- Thank you.

711
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:28,650
I've never seen
that makeup before.

712
00:35:28,718 --> 00:35:30,285
I don't believe
I've ever seen a makeup

713
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:32,654
- like that before either.
- Wow.

714
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:36,792
And that pushed up face
with the muzzle coming out.

715
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,427
And I love the fact
that the horns are poking out

716
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:39,995
and they're starting to bleed.

717
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:42,164
I just wish you would have given
it just a little bit of sheen

718
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:43,799
somewhere along the line.

719
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:45,400
Probably would have
made them look a lot scarier.

720
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:47,536
- It was just time.
- Well, Ian,

721
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,670
I'm always looking for someone

722
00:35:48,738 --> 00:35:50,072
to do something different,
unique.

723
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,174
I like that the Lucifer
character is actually in white.

724
00:35:52,241 --> 00:35:54,376
I think it's great.
You took a chance that way--

725
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,844
It doesn't bother me.

726
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,713
Again, what I will remember
about your work tonight,

727
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,481
is how original
and unique it is.

728
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:00,749
Thank you very much.

729
00:36:00,817 --> 00:36:02,184
All right, thank you so much.

730
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:04,252
- You can step back.
- Thank you all.

731
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,790
Good job, Ian.

732
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:10,726
I'm almost shaking.
I'm like, brr...

733
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,161
All right, RJ.

734
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:20,435
Okay, RJ, tell me
what the backstory is

735
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:23,338
on your fantasy characters.

736
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:26,108
The Phoenix represents me,
through <i>Face Off,</i>

737
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:28,343
like the Phoenix rising
out of the ashes.

738
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:31,379
You guys have given me
a second chance

739
00:36:31,447 --> 00:36:33,415
at a life
that I always wanted to have.

740
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,751
Well, this is really
interesting and unique.

741
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:39,821
Every, single character is
a complete makeup, head to toe.

742
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:42,424
- Fabulous job.
- Thanks.

743
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:43,959
How did you come about
building that headpiece

744
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:45,227
for Mother Earth?

745
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:46,595
That's all hemp.

746
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,331
And there's a plastic
vacuform shell in there.

747
00:36:49,398 --> 00:36:51,299
Well, all of your headpieces
are really great.

748
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,368
My only complaint
is I would have liked

749
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:55,437
to have seen
Mother Earth pretty.

750
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,972
We did want to go
for a more matronly look.

751
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,876
It would have been nice if she
would have been a pretty matron.

752
00:37:00,943 --> 00:37:03,278
Kind of like me.

753
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,381
RJ, you could put any makeup
on there,

754
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:07,382
I'll always know
which one is yours,

755
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,251
because you have a style.

756
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:11,219
You could put the vines
in multiple ways,

757
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,754
but the way they were put,

758
00:37:12,822 --> 00:37:15,423
it really follows
the shape of the muscle.

759
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:17,793
It's like it's very organic--
you pay attention to the body.

760
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,261
That's super important.

761
00:37:19,328 --> 00:37:21,029
Even little details,
like your sorcerer's hair--

762
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:22,464
The way you pulled it out
to the side and it--

763
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,832
Very, very cool.

764
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,869
The Phoenix character
is cool from the front,

765
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:30,038
but is even cooler
from the side.

766
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:31,273
I love the fiber optics,

767
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,475
I love the profile
of the feathers.

768
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,644
If I have any concerns at all,

769
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,614
it is some of the airbrushing
seems a bit directionless.

770
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:42,184
You've got, like,
a lot of heavy flames.

771
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:43,652
And then there's some areas
that sort of go to circles.

772
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,887
That is a minor complaint,

773
00:37:45,955 --> 00:37:47,923
with the amount of work
that you guys accomplished.

774
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,858
RJ, thank you so much.

775
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:57,666
- Rayce, you're up next.
- Awesome.

776
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,872
We looked very closely
at the erosion of the makeups,

777
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,374
over the evening, and
throughout the dance routine,

778
00:38:06,442 --> 00:38:09,211
which was another element
in this challenge.

779
00:38:09,278 --> 00:38:10,612
And it seemed to me

780
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,547
that perhaps you had
the greatest struggle with that.

781
00:38:12,615 --> 00:38:15,383
- Yeah.
- But...

782
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:18,787
You've come up
with three amazing makeups.

783
00:38:18,855 --> 00:38:20,055
They are exceptional.

784
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:21,656
The sculptures are exceptional.

785
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:25,227
And when they stand there,
it actually creates an illusion

786
00:38:25,294 --> 00:38:29,130
that there's a shadow
cast upon... The dark half,

787
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:31,733
and it goes from dark to light.
And that is so awesome.

788
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:33,535
Thank you.

789
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,904
There's an element texture
I wanted to keep on both sides

790
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:38,273
so that it helped identify
the different dimensions.

791
00:38:38,341 --> 00:38:39,841
It's very, very effective.

792
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:42,143
It's so fantastic that you have
a third character in the middle

793
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:44,346
that shows us that moment
of transformation.

794
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:45,947
You feel like
it's happening right now.

795
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:47,849
- Very cool.
- Thank you so much.

796
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:50,685
I think my favorite one,
out of the group of them,

797
00:38:50,753 --> 00:38:52,254
is the middle one.

798
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,990
Even looking straight at her,
there was three complete heads.

799
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:57,058
I mean, it just was creepy.

800
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,961
- Well, thank you.
- Rayce, you can step back.

801
00:39:01,697 --> 00:39:04,032
Job well done,
every single one of you.

802
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,335
You have made our jobs
very, very difficult.

803
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:10,171
Well, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

804
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:12,774
If you would please head back
to the makeup trailers,

805
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,442
while they make their decisions.

806
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:23,852
Before we go into deliberation,
you should know

807
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,888
that the audience picked Rayce
as their favorite.

808
00:39:26,956 --> 00:39:28,390
- They did?
- Yes.

809
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:29,925
What are your thoughts on Ian?

810
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,527
The head
on the luciferian character--

811
00:39:32,595 --> 00:39:34,663
Such a great sculpt,
such a great design.

812
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,997
- Creativity.
- The whole thing, creatively,

813
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:37,799
- was so great.
- Creatively, was powerful.

814
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:39,935
The paint, across the board,
was kind of flat for me.

815
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:44,005
Yeah, but he also manages
to bring something different

816
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:45,540
- every week.
- He's a natural.

817
00:39:45,608 --> 00:39:46,975
And what about RJ?

818
00:39:47,043 --> 00:39:48,510
It's very powerful
at a distance.

819
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:50,312
I think when you get closer,

820
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:51,746
it feels less
like a realistic makeup.

821
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:54,916
I think he does really fun
characters.

822
00:39:54,984 --> 00:39:57,552
They have that whimsical quality
that I really like.

823
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,388
He's a kind guy.
And it reflects--

824
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:02,357
- Yeah, and it pisses me off.
- Become creative--

825
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:03,625
I can imagine.

826
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,727
All right,
let's talk about Rayce.

827
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:07,195
He knocked it out
of the park, for me.

828
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:11,299
I loved the way those two
characters came together

829
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,268
in that middle character.
It totally blew me away.

830
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,103
And the paint job was amazing.

831
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,439
Clearly, he goes
beyond the two dimensions,

832
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:18,907
thinks three-dimensionally
as well.

833
00:40:18,975 --> 00:40:20,542
That's very rare.

834
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:22,510
All right, judges,
have you chosen your winner?

835
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:23,845
I believe so.

836
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:38,893
Glenn, who is the winner
of <i>Face Off?</i>

837
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:42,330
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

838
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:57,525
Glenn, who is the winner
of <i>Face Off?</i>

839
00:40:57,593 --> 00:41:00,962
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

840
00:41:07,002 --> 00:41:09,670
Rayce.

841
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:11,339
Ohh!

842
00:41:12,741 --> 00:41:14,842
Oh, my gosh.
Whoo!

843
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,983
Oh, my gosh!

844
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,185
You're kidding me.

845
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:28,856
Thank you, guys, so much.

846
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:34,328
Oh, my gosh.

847
00:41:35,597 --> 00:41:38,733
I can't believe it.

848
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,668
I understand how huge
winning <i>Face Off</i> is,

849
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:42,670
and how it's gonna
change my life

850
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:44,338
and change my family's life.

851
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:46,107
I am so grateful
for this experience.

852
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:48,242
I love that Rayce won.

853
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,844
He is so talented.

854
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:52,647
And I don't think my future
has ever looked this bright.

855
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:54,348
I'm happy for Rayce,

856
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,017
because he's a hell
of an artist.

857
00:41:56,118 --> 00:41:58,552
This experience
has been amazing.

858
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,421
Give me ten years--
I want to see where I'm at.

859
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:02,823
Congratulations, Rayce.

860
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:05,893
We do have one last piece
of business.

861
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:07,194
Want to go see your new car?

862
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:09,063
- Yeah.
- Come with me.

863
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:10,364
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

864
00:42:14,603 --> 00:42:16,370
It's just a dream.

865
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:18,339
I'm waiting for someone
to poke me with a fork

866
00:42:18,407 --> 00:42:21,208
and wake me up, right now.

867
00:42:21,276 --> 00:42:22,777
It's too nice.

868
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:24,445
I don't think I've ever sat
in anything that nice.

869
00:42:24,513 --> 00:42:25,846
It's all yours--

870
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:28,816
the all-new
2012 Toyota Camry hybrid.

871
00:42:28,884 --> 00:42:32,520
I can't go back
to being a tattoo artist.

872
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:35,008
Now there's this ambition spark

873
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:38,791
that's just burning inside me,
and I wanna go to make movies right now.

874
