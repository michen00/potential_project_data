00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,264
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,932
The artists were faced with
a nude body painting challenge.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,101
I can't look at them.

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,471
Matt's incredible blend
was crowned the winner.

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:12,273
And Miranda was sent home.

6
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:16,043
Now 11 artists remain.

7
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:18,112
Tonight, the artists must
face their fears

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,281
in our most disturbing
challenge yet.

9
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:21,582
This place is considered

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,918
one of the most
haunted hospitals in America.

11
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:25,186
- Oh!
- Don't do that!

12
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:26,253
I was scared, I was scared!

13
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,521
And it's not long

14
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:29,190
before things start
to fall apart.

15
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:30,691
There's some big mistakes here.

16
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,526
I have one shot
to get this right.

17
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:33,894
I think you kind of
missed the mark.

18
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:35,329
I could care less
what you think.

19
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:36,931
I'm screwed.

20
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,833
There's a pretty good chance
I'm out the door.

21
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,768
That's either gonna be
really damn cool

22
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:42,570
or it's gonna be
a huge disaster.

23
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:44,939
I'm a huge fan of this makeup.

24
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:46,774
But to make it to the top,

25
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:49,276
they'll have to impress our
award-winning panel of judges:

26
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:52,279
Ve Neill, three-time
Oscar-winning makeup artist

27
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:53,781
whose work
includes <i>Beetlejuice,</i>

28
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,950
and this summer's
<i>The Amazing Spiderman.</i>

29
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:58,919
Patrick Tatopoulos,
production designer

30
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,721
on this summer's <i>Total Recall,</i>

31
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,791
and director of
<i>Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans.</i>

32
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:06,627
And Glenn Hetrick,
cutting edge makeup artist

33
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:08,029
on <i>The Hunger Games,</i>

34
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,364
and custom designer
for Lady Gaga.

35
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,861
Only one will win Face Off.

37
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:11,838
Hello.

38
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:12,805
Hello?

39
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:22,849
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,417
How am I gonna get dressed
in 15 minutes

41
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:27,186
with all these girls?
So I-I panic.

44
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:39,599
I'm, like, what in bat-[Bleep]
is going on?

45
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,318
Here we are in the middle
of the night

46
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,420
in front of this
abandoned hospital,

47
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:02,355
and it's just really creepy.

48
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,399
Oh!
Don't do that!

49
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,434
Don't--
- I got scared, I got scared.

50
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,668
- Don't--
- I got scared.

51
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:16,669
- Do that.
- I didn't do it on purpose.

52
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:17,937
The lights are flickering,

53
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,372
and I don't even know
when the last time

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,873
anyone's even been
in this place, or...

55
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:22,241
What's still living
in this place,

56
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:23,876
and I don't want no part of it.

57
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,985
Welcome to Linda Vista
Community Hospital.

58
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:35,855
This place was
shut down years ago.

59
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:39,292
It's now considered one
of the most haunted hospitals

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,660
in America.

61
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,864
I brought you here
to get you in the mood

62
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:46,466
for your next
spotlight challenge.

63
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:51,070
This week, you will each create
your very own horror villain.

64
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,611
Whoa.

65
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,947
All of a sudden, all these
words pop up on the walls,

66
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,382
and they're all phobias.

67
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,417
Most of them, I just
have no clue about.

68
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:08,254
Scrawled on these walls are
some very disturbing phobias.

69
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:10,790
Now each of you will have
to select one,

70
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:13,393
and your makeups
should reflect that fear.

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,361
All right.

72
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,562
Let's see who's going
to pick first.

73
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,733
Sue.

74
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,701
Um...

75
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:24,904
Hadephobia.

76
00:04:24,972 --> 00:04:28,541
Hadephobia is the fear of ll.

77
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,411
Oh, I don't want that one.

78
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:32,578
You picked it.

79
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:33,846
Beki.

80
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:35,715
Think I'll take
the parasitophobia.

81
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,116
I'm thinking to myself,

82
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:39,419
I might be able to create
something pretty cool

83
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:40,486
for the fear of parites.

84
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:41,821
Ommetaphobia?

85
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,256
Ornithophobia.

86
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,191
- Cryophobia.
- Odontophobia.

87
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,659
Some of them
were pretty obvious.

88
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,761
I decided to be
a little daring,

89
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,896
and pick something
that I had no idea

90
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:50,930
what it was...

91
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,231
Xyrophobia?

92
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:55,301
- The fear of razors.
- Ooh.

93
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,736
Athena.

94
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,671
Merinthophobia.

95
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:01,574
The fear of being bound
or tied up.

96
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,178
Xerophobia.

97
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:06,279
Electrophobia.

98
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:07,914
Chemophobia.

99
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,282
Okay, everybody.

100
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:11,350
Now it's time
to start your sketching.

101
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:12,718
But to get you in the mood,

102
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:17,390
you're gonna have
to do it alone in the dark.

103
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,759
You'll have 30 minutes
to come up with your designs,

104
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:23,229
and then you can head back
to the lab, choose your models,

105
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,331
and get to work.

106
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:28,101
Grab your flashlights
and go to your rooms.

107
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:36,776
Middle of the night,
the witching hour.

108
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:38,811
I'm afraid of the dark,
so that's fun.

109
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,291
There's nasty stuff around,

110
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:56,062
and we have to sketch
in pitch black

111
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,432
in haunted rooms by ourselves.

112
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:05,238
Hadephobia is a fear of hell,
and now it makes sense.

113
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:09,709
I started sketching out
this kind of satyr-like being

114
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:11,344
that was just really primitive,

115
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,179
and it really scared me,

116
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,981
and I was, like,
this is gonna be a winner.

117
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:20,286
Feeling a little
creepy in here.

118
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:21,687
Some kids' toys on the ground.

119
00:06:21,755 --> 00:06:23,422
Not really liking
that too much.

120
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,924
I've been on bottom twice,

121
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:28,194
so if I'm on bottom again,
I feel like I'm going home.

122
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,898
My fear is odontophobia,
which is the fear of teeth.

123
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,566
I'm going with a
tooth-fairy-type feel,

124
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:37,203
which is gonna be this demon
that, uh, comes around

125
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,372
and steals little girls'
or little boys' teeth,

126
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,874
and, uh, he makes patterns
into his skull.

127
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:53,352
Basically my story is, uh,
this girl was raped

128
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,820
when she was a kid,

129
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:57,857
and now she finds guys
who want to play with her,

130
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:01,761
and she kills them
with her ropes.

131
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:07,033
I picked xyrophobia,
fear of razor blades,

132
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,602
because if you worked
in a hospital,

133
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,105
razor blade, scalpel,
hey, maybe he's a mad doctor

134
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:15,641
who shoved razor blades
into his face

135
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,343
and shoved them into his bones.

136
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:20,646
Afraid of eyes, seeing eyes.

137
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:24,283
Afraid of seeing eyes.
Afraid of...

138
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:29,522
I have no idea what to do
with ommetaphobia because...

139
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,458
Does the fear of eyes mean
the fear of looking at eyes?

140
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:34,060
The fear of what
they're looking at?

141
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:35,895
The fear of
what they look like?

142
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:37,496
Creatively, I have nothing.

143
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,811
- We are done with our
half-an-hour of sketching,

144
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:53,646
and it's time to go to the lab.

145
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:55,948
Thank God we are out
of this creepy place.

146
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,829
We have four hours
of work today,

147
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,765
and my goal is to finish
with my sculpture

148
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,400
by the end of the day.

149
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:17,336
This will be one
of the first challenges

150
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:20,539
where you can truly see where
everyone's skill level is at

151
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:22,942
because this is our first
individual challenge.

152
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,977
And I'm gonna really
push my concept,

153
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:27,280
and either go big or go home.

154
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:31,017
As of now, I'm a little lost.

155
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:34,620
So I figure, well, I'll just
start slapping some clay on.

156
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:35,688
I can figure it out that way.

157
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,460
I'm looking at Beki, and she's
like a Speedy Gonzales.

158
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,065
My phobia is parasitophobia,

159
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:50,002
and I plan on creating
a gigantic, beautiful parasite.

160
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,339
I just start slam-dancing
the clay because...

161
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,708
You have got to sculpt
as fast as possible

162
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,877
so that you can have
a workable piece.

163
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,385
I get chemophobia,
being scared of chemicals.

164
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,187
The idea that I see,
I see it right away

165
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,288
when I touch the clay.

166
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:10,956
I almost think
this is not fair.

167
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:13,559
I do chemical warfare
and chemical burns

168
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:14,627
as part of my job description.

169
00:09:18,598 --> 00:09:20,700
I chose the fear of birds.

170
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,401
My concept is a guy
that realized

171
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,004
that he had a-- a-- somewhat
of a symbiotic relationship

172
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:28,007
with them, where they live
inside of him.

173
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:31,110
Xerophobia is fear of dryness,

174
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:33,446
so I start thinking
of very cracked, dry,

175
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:34,880
husk-like,
slipping skin.

176
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:38,551
What are moisture areas?
I think the eyes and the lips.

177
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:41,821
So removing those could add a--
a cool effect to the character.

178
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:48,928
Making stuff up as I go.

179
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:52,665
You're still not happy
with your design?

180
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,967
I don't have a design yet.

181
00:09:55,035 --> 00:09:56,102
I have a piece of crap.

182
00:09:58,038 --> 00:09:59,438
It doesn't look like anything.

183
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:03,609
I know it's crap,
and I-I still have no idea

184
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:06,612
what to do with it.

185
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,214
Here I am running out of time.

186
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:11,317
If I don't get
my sculpture done...

187
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,452
Time is up, let's go.

188
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,856
I'm screwed.

189
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,694
Oh, let's get to work.

190
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,436
The challenge this week
is to create a horror villain

191
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,604
based off of a phobia.

192
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,272
Nice.

193
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,108
As I'm looking around the shop,
I have yet to see Tara

194
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:39,645
create something
that she feels confident about.

195
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:43,316
I think just, in general,
my head hasn't been in the game.

196
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:45,017
It's good to walk away
from your sculpt

197
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:46,218
and then come back to it.

198
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:48,521
You see something
maybe differently.

199
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:51,123
An idea finally comes to me.

200
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,492
I start to think about
mythology and Egypt,

201
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,695
and the all-seeing eye
of some kind.

202
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,163
I like it.

203
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,297
- This?
- Yeah.

204
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:04,437
Cryophobia is the fear
of ice and frost.

205
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,273
I really want
to make a character

206
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,575
that has that frostbitten
look to him,

207
00:11:09,643 --> 00:11:12,845
and I also want to make ice
that's not so fake looking.

208
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:16,449
Hey, everybody.

209
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,818
I am here with Glenn today
to do a walk-through,

210
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:22,555
and also our special
guest judge this week,

211
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:24,256
Tom Savini.

212
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:25,991
- Whoo!
- Hi.

213
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:31,297
Tom Savini is, I think,

214
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:32,965
everybody's idol
in this industry.

215
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:37,136
He's created some
of the best gore makeups.

216
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:41,507
Zombies...I mean, to this day,
still-hold-up-in-our-industry

217
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,742
makeup effects.

218
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,210
- Hey, Sue.
- Hello.

219
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:47,313
Tom Savini h has one of the best
special effects schools,

220
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:48,914
and I went to it.

221
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:52,451
I wanted this person to have,
like, the symbolism of chaos,

222
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,553
and just take this goat's head
and put it on him.

223
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,622
Yeah, I think
it's pretty creepy that

224
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,792
this hideous guy,
as hideous as-- as he is,

225
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,927
decides to wear that.

226
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,763
So you sculpted
this really quick,

227
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,998
had it molded, and already
had the foam ran in it?

228
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:08,134
- Yeah.
- Have you ever seen anyone on--

229
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,404
On this day that's already
sculpted, molded, and--

230
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,205
And got a piece of foam back
to fabricate them?

231
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:14,240
- I don't think so.
- I don't think we have.

232
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:15,608
- No.
- In this business,

233
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:18,344
it's one thing to be good,
but you have to be good

234
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:19,745
and fast.
Right.

235
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:21,313
Just the fact
that Glenn had noticed

236
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:22,882
how much work I had done.

237
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:25,151
To me, that gives me
a boost of confidence.

238
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:26,819
- How you doing?
- Hey, Ian, how's it going?

239
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:28,387
That's a big wisdom tooth.

240
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:29,622
Yeah, real gummy looking, uh...

241
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:30,990
What does the rest
of him look like?

242
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,658
The rest of him?
He actually has, like,

243
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:36,495
a jedi monk's cloth cloak.
He's got, like, samurai pants,

244
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:38,297
and, uh, even
ninja boots, and--

245
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,433
So it just fits
in the whole picture to...

246
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,468
- Yeah.
- All right.

247
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:44,637
- Hi, Athena.
- Hello.

248
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:46,672
So tell us about your phobia
and your concept.

249
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,374
It's a fear of being tied up.

250
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:50,309
I'm kind of building this,
like, rib cage,

251
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:51,644
but it's gonna
be under the skin

252
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:54,814
so it will look
like she's slimmer.

253
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:58,184
I have ommetaphobia,
which is the fear of eyes.

254
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:01,253
She's this
Egyptian goddess--

255
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,756
It's a bit mask-y,
so how's this gonna work?

256
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,257
Well, this is all
gonna be an appliance,

257
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:08,160
and then I'll remove the horns
and mold those separately.

258
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:11,764
It is electrophobia
and the fear of electricity.

259
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:16,168
My take on that is, uh, kind of
a '30s, '20s psychiatrist

260
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,971
who's really into giving
electric shock treatment.

261
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,140
Will there be any light
integrated into this?

262
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,008
I have a-- a bunch
of lighting stuff right there.

263
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:25,511
Oh, okay, so you're gonna try
to do some lighting stuff, okay.

264
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:26,712
All right.

265
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,913
Okay, 'cause
you can flash those.

266
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,148
I'm going for it.

267
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,550
Right. Now I have
to make these flash.

268
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:32,718
So this is pretty cool.

269
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:33,986
What is this?
Where did you get this?

270
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:35,354
I don't know
what this thing is, actually.

271
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,755
We found it
in the bin over there,

272
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:38,157
and so I thought, well,
that would be kind of cool.

273
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,993
Maybe he embedded them
into his face

274
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,195
along with the razor blades.

275
00:13:43,263 --> 00:13:45,564
I took the lips away
and I sunk the eyes in,

276
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:46,999
and-- and kind of
let the flesh take over.

277
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,702
It's just a wrinkled, uh,
dehydrated being.

278
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:50,903
That's pretty disturbing.

279
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:53,272
My guy has basically
died of infection

280
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,907
of the mustard gas.

281
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:58,010
The guy that we made grandpa
in <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre,</i>

282
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,447
we was a tunnel rat in Vietnam,
and he had wounds behind--

283
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:03,816
Mustard gas.
And it's been 20 years,

284
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,718
and they just still
are open and sore

285
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:07,486
as if they occurred yesterday.

286
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,288
So tell me about
what you're doing here.

287
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:12,458
This is a frozen surface
that's kind of cracking apart?

288
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,260
Yeah, 'cause he's got this
essential unit

289
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:15,928
that produces this coolant
that goes up to his face--

290
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,298
I decided to make
kind of a--

291
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,066
A messed up face under a mask.

292
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:24,637
This is gonna be a makeup,
and-- and this raven-like piece.

293
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,005
- Right.
- Well, it's good

294
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,873
that you have a solid direction,
though, aesthetically.

295
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,009
You're not just kind of
poking around in the dark.

296
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,881
All right, gentlemen.

297
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:38,584
I always like Rayce's concepts.

298
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,019
He's so very, very strong.

299
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,320
And this is the first time

300
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:43,622
we're going to get
to see him execute them.

301
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,124
If he can do it
on paper quickly,

302
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,560
and then nail it,
go, sculpt, mold,

303
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:49,094
it's a huge advantage.

304
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:51,864
So who are you
most concerned about?

305
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,732
I'm really concerned
about Tara.

306
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,870
She has sculpted a female face
over the female model.

307
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,205
Why would you sculpt a woman's
face over a woman's face?

308
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:01,874
Yeah, when you're not
doing anything to it.

309
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,142
There's no travel patterns.
When there's nothing else

310
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,044
going on except eyes
all over the place.

311
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:10,683
Now with Sue, there seems
to be a-- a gap

312
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,018
between the style in which
the face is sculpted,

313
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,754
and the style in which
the helmet is sculpted.

314
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:18,457
It could end up being a bit
of a train wreck aesthetically.

315
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:20,993
All right, guys.

316
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:22,127
Thank you, and good luck.

317
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:22,962
- See you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

318
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:23,829
- Bye.
- Bye.

319
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:30,035
Time to make a mold.

320
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:34,006
When you mold,
you put on the plaster,

321
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:36,809
which makes a negative replica.

322
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:40,279
After that's dried, then you can
actually put the two together

323
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,548
and pour any material you want
in between the two,

324
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:46,218
and push them together,
and that creates your mask.

325
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:50,522
'Ll probably be hella
mold makers after this.

326
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,625
- Don't jinx it.
- Ha, ha.

327
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,195
After Glenn and Tom's visit,

328
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,230
I start thinking that I need
to change something

329
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:00,065
with the little
amount of time I have.

330
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:03,302
Do you think it'd be bad
if I chopped my thing in half?

331
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,837
Like she had
no bottom prosthetic?

332
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:05,938
Ooh.

333
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,506
Yeah, and just use her face?

334
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:10,275
So I chop everything off
from the cheeks down,

335
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:12,344
which is good because
it's a makeup

336
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:15,914
and it won't look like a mask,
and it'll save me time,

337
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:17,082
since I lost so much time
figuring out

338
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,084
where the heck
I'm going with this.

339
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,255
It's gonna be tricky for me

340
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:25,891
to pull off the mold
from the replica

341
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,962
because my sculpt goes
all the way back past the ears,

342
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,666
and when you have that much
surface area covered,

343
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,267
it creates a lot more suction.

344
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,773
Did you get locked?

345
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,343
I cannot mess up
on the mold because...

346
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:46,545
All the time I spent
sculpting is useless.

347
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,152
I have one shot
to get this right.

348
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,064
Did you get locked?

349
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:03,600
The problem is, my sculpt goes
all the way back past the ears.

350
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:05,102
Nothing?

351
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,738
When you have that much
surface area,

352
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:09,273
it creates a lot more suction.

353
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,177
But I have one shot
to get this right.

354
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:16,380
- Oof!
- Yay!

355
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:17,281
Thank you.

356
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:21,785
You add blood to it,
that's when it kicks.

357
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:23,153
Little bit of blood
goes a long way.

358
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:24,521
That's what I say.

359
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,090
The good part about being
in a solo challenge,

360
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,358
I'd say, is the fact that
I'm the one sculpting it,

361
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:29,760
I'm the one painting it,
and I get to do it all.

362
00:17:29,828 --> 00:17:30,661
Me, me, me, me, me.

363
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:34,932
No, she doesn't realize it,

364
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:35,966
'cause she's been
lovingly painting it

365
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:36,967
for about three hours.

366
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,803
You, oh--
You're too funny.

367
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,644
My plan was to spend
maybe a half-an-hour

368
00:17:47,712 --> 00:17:50,047
on this lighting rig.
Best laid plans

369
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,281
always go to heck.

370
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:54,685
Oh, yeah.
I'm tired of this.

371
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:56,687
If these lights don't flash,

372
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:57,988
I'm dead, dead in the water.

373
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,656
26 minutes.

374
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:05,529
By the end of the day,
I'm feeling good.

375
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:10,100
But I see a lot of sweat, blood,
and tears in the mold room.

376
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:12,369
- You got this guy cleaned out?
- No.

377
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:14,838
So I'm back there helping
people get their molds apart,

378
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:16,406
and helping people
scrape their clay out.

379
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:17,674
Aw, Beki, thank you so much.

380
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:24,882
- Brushes down, it's time.
- Ugh.

381
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,623
Long day.
Glad to be home.

382
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,358
We're just utterly exhausted.

383
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:37,027
We're so brain-dead, it--
It's horrible at this point.

384
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,596
You thought Glenn didn't
like yours, why's that?

385
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:41,532
He didn't really say too much.
I feel like they were all

386
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:43,267
disappointed in me.
I feel really bummed out.

387
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,269
- Aww.
- I hope they like it, though.

388
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:47,437
My character does make sense,
I hope they get it.

389
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:50,207
I-I really do.
Kind of nerve-wracking.

390
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,877
Who do you think is doing
really well right now?

391
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:57,281
Honestly, I've been so
into my own thing,

392
00:18:57,348 --> 00:19:00,117
I have not had ten seconds
to even look around.

393
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:03,020
Well, I notice that you always
tend to sit next to Beki.

394
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,555
No, I don't.
That's an insult

395
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:06,890
to think that I would even care
about her [Bleep].

396
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,091
Why do I like that desk?

397
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,459
Because it's closest
to the products.

398
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,728
I've been in the top
twice already.

399
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:14,064
I could care less
what she's doing, honestly.

400
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:16,567
Brea sat all day long
next to me.

401
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:18,735
Brea said she was confident
all day long.

402
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,470
"I am confident."
"I feel good about it."

403
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,339
"I-- This is good.
This is a great makeup."

404
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:24,942
Out of-- I mean, there's--
There's how many of us? 11?

405
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,846
And ten of them are good
in different ways, you know?

406
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:31,448
And then there's this one.

407
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,183
I'm not very
impressed with Brea.

408
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:35,152
She really doesn't
have lab skills.

409
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,921
She's a little too overconfident
in her abilities,

410
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:42,292
which is always, you know--
Can lead you to a disaster.

411
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,501
It's application day now.

412
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,606
We have four hours
for application,

413
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:58,575
and then one hour at the studio
for final looks.

414
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,414
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

415
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:07,684
Today, I've got to get the
application done in two hours

416
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:10,087
because it's gonna be
an elaborate paint job.

417
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:12,823
I was a little bit concerned

418
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:14,725
about your breasticles
coming out so...

419
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:17,127
- No saggy boobies today.
- No.

420
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:20,597
I might have to have your help.

421
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:21,632
Do you wanna help me?

422
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,133
Now we're gonna grab here.

423
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:24,334
Okay, got that.

424
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:29,273
I still have to make my horns.

425
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,741
I need to attach the horns.

426
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:32,276
I have to make her weapon.

427
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:34,678
I have to apply her face.

428
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,847
I decide that I need
to start making eyeballs,

429
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:39,650
'cause I figure
it's fear of eyes,

430
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:40,884
so you gotta have
some eyeballs somewhere.

431
00:20:47,492 --> 00:20:49,693
I kind of want it
to be a little softer.

432
00:20:49,761 --> 00:20:51,528
I think I'm gonna
make a new one real quick.

433
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:53,196
It'll take about 40 minutes.

434
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:58,068
I make this last-minute decision
to pour a new silicon face

435
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:01,171
that would be perfect--perfect
color, perfect consistency.

436
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,674
It's gonna be a little
less pink this time too.

437
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:06,944
The time I lose
pouring up the second face,

438
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:09,947
I'll make up in having
to paint less of it

439
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:11,348
because if I get
the color right,

440
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,017
I'll have to put
hardly any paint on this.

441
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,061
Looking at my model,
I just don't like him.

442
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:25,462
I need texture on his stomach,

443
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,264
and I had the idea
of using cling-wrap.

444
00:21:27,332 --> 00:21:29,266
And I cling-wrapped
his whole stomach

445
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:31,601
to give him, like,
a wrinkly, creepy texture.

446
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:32,803
Hopefully it works out.

447
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:37,074
This is just gelatin,
like jell-o.

448
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:41,311
I'm using gelatin
to burn her head.

449
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:42,813
It looks very realistic.

450
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,449
The textures of it,
the shininess that it brings.

451
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:47,250
It really creates a burnt look.

452
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:54,691
At the two-hour mark,
I realize I'm having

453
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,326
some problems
with the edges laying down.

454
00:21:56,394 --> 00:21:59,029
This is all taking time
away from the paint.

455
00:21:59,097 --> 00:22:00,530
- You okay?
- Yeah, why?

456
00:22:00,598 --> 00:22:02,332
'Cause you don't
have a face on her yet.

457
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,101
- The face is the easiest part.
- Okay.

458
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:05,435
I can do the face
in ten minutes.

459
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:07,771
RJ forgets I been doing this
for 20 years.

460
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:12,075
Fifteen minutes, everybody.

461
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:20,851
I'm hoping the second
silicon face that I poured

462
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:22,085
is going to be perfect.

463
00:22:22,153 --> 00:22:24,054
I will not know
until I get to stage,

464
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:27,424
as I'm not going to open
the mold until the last second.

465
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:28,325
Time's up.

466
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:34,531
Jerry had decided to run
a completely new face.

467
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,466
Well, that's either gonna be
really damn cool,

468
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:37,667
or it's gonna
be a huge disaster.

469
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:41,538
Coming up...

470
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:43,774
The guy's, like,
sweating like crazy.

471
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,544
My character's neck's
just wide open.

472
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:49,346
I love it.

473
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:50,414
He's stunning.

474
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:52,149
It's awful.

475
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:53,917
I think you kind of
missed the mark.

476
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:54,851
There's some big mistakes here.

477
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,861
Last looks is
the most intense part.

478
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,830
You really find out
what you can do in an hour.

479
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:11,334
Damn, it is hot in here.

480
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,703
My guy's, like,
sweating like crazy,

481
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:16,339
and the neck's, like,
straight-up blown out, dude.

482
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:19,376
So I decide
to bring the whole mold,

483
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:20,911
the new silicon piece,

484
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:24,080
and I want to give it as much
time as possible to cure.

485
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:26,716
I'm hoping that it's better
than the first one I ran.

486
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:29,819
I'm really worried.
If the piece doesn't come out,

487
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,055
I'm thinking there's a pretty
good chance I'm out the door.

488
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:33,957
[Bleep], it's a little
too gooey.

489
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:37,494
Think I'm gonna go
with the other one.

490
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:38,929
I don't know
what happened here.

491
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:41,164
I just...Blew it.

492
00:23:48,172 --> 00:23:50,307
That's time.

493
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:00,016
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

494
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,918
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

495
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:05,355
Say hello to your judges.

496
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:07,724
Owner of optic nerve
makeup effects studio,

497
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,459
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

498
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:11,394
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist

499
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:12,862
ve Neill.
Hello.

500
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,431
Creature designer and director

501
00:24:14,498 --> 00:24:16,566
- Patrick Tatopoulos.
- Hi, everyone.

502
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:19,102
And joining our panel
this week,

503
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,138
special effects makeup artist
and horror icon

504
00:24:22,206 --> 00:24:26,743
Tom Savini.

505
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:28,445
Hi, thank you, thank you.

506
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:30,580
I can't wait to see
what you've come up with.

507
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:32,415
So this week
your spotlight challenge

508
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:33,817
was to choose a phobia,

509
00:24:33,884 --> 00:24:35,852
and create an original
horror villain

510
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,020
that represents that fear.

511
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:38,555
Let's see what
you've come up with.

512
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:40,724
First up, Sue.

513
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:07,250
Individually,
the pieces look great.

514
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:09,919
But as a whole,
I made some bad decisions.

515
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:36,179
I feel great about
the way my model is moving.

516
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,948
All in all, the total concept,
I think, looked great.

517
00:26:02,173 --> 00:26:04,507
I can only imagine
if I had actually figured out

518
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:06,543
what I was gonna do
a little bit quicker,

519
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,145
it could've been leaps and
bounds ahead of where it was,

520
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:10,180
but it looked pretty good.

521
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:36,139
I actually like mine.

522
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,674
He may be not as creepy
as he could be,

523
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:39,909
but it's my aesthetic,
I-I think he's beautiful.

524
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,934
The character's looking good.

525
00:27:05,002 --> 00:27:07,137
The only problem is,
on that neck area,

526
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:09,739
and the appliance
is just wide open.

527
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,408
I could easily be
on the bottom for that.

528
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:38,868
I look at him, he's all slimy
and gross looking,

529
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:41,337
but some of the teeth
were falling off, and...

530
00:27:41,405 --> 00:27:42,872
I-I just don't know what
to think at this point.

531
00:28:12,036 --> 00:28:15,038
I'm happy with the work
that I created solely on my own.

532
00:28:15,105 --> 00:28:17,106
If I go home over this,
then I'm okay with that.

533
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:45,201
My villain comes out,
and she looks strong,

534
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:47,370
sexy, and really freaky.

535
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,061
Seeing mine walk out there,

536
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:13,329
I feel like a father,

537
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:14,864
like I'm very proud
of this creature.

538
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:44,260
It actually doesn't look
as bad as I thought it would.

539
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:47,363
I mean, it's basically
only three colors, but...

540
00:29:47,431 --> 00:29:48,264
It kind of works.

541
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:09,352
Some of the villains
are a joke.

542
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,321
Maybe they would work better
at a Halloween party.

543
00:30:11,388 --> 00:30:13,489
But to me, they're making me
even more comfortable

544
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:14,290
at where my makeup is.

545
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,666
All right, judges.

546
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:24,801
Why don't you take
a closer look?

547
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:30,239
- Is this foam?
- Mm-hmm.

548
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:33,176
- It's just polyurethane.
- Polyurethane, yeah.

549
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,048
Can you open and close?
Oh, that's cool.

550
00:30:39,116 --> 00:30:41,417
Yeah...Oh,
I didn't see that.

551
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:43,485
- Yeah, yeah, look at that.
- That's nasty.

552
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:45,922
See what she did?
She ended it there.

553
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,124
Yeah, she got rid of
the lower piece, which is great.

554
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:55,031
That's pretty cool.
Yeah, yeah.

555
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:58,701
It's coming loose back here too,
the bald cap.

556
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,305
You never want to see
the exposed skin

557
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,273
or flaps of tissue hanging off,

558
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:07,710
and that's exactly
what his neck looks like.

559
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:09,012
There's no way I can
get away with it.

560
00:31:12,742 --> 00:31:14,976
With these judges,
you think you know

561
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:16,411
what they're gonna like...

562
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:19,181
It's coming loose back here
near the bald cap.

563
00:31:19,248 --> 00:31:20,749
But I'm the only one that has
an appliance falling off.

564
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,819
Can you turn a bit
this way, please?

565
00:31:24,887 --> 00:31:26,855
How does that mouth move?

566
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,695
She was trying to go
for an emaciated look,

567
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:35,430
but she's grown the ribs
the wrong way.

568
00:31:35,498 --> 00:31:36,264
They're coming towards us.

569
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:43,905
Can we see
the top of your head?

570
00:31:43,973 --> 00:31:45,941
- That's fun.
- Yeah.

571
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:48,977
I'm thinking, well, they'll
like the flashing lights.

572
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:49,978
They like shiny objects.

573
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:53,682
This anatomy concerns me a lot.

574
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:55,417
These teeth are so far out.

575
00:32:01,824 --> 00:32:03,592
Well, the judges
have scored your creations,

576
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,660
so let's find out
what they thought.

577
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:08,830
Beki...

578
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:11,666
Brea...

579
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:14,436
Ian...

580
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:17,472
Rayce...

581
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,275
Athena...

582
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:23,078
Jerry...

583
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:27,282
You have this week's
best and worst looks.

584
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:30,785
The rest of you are safe.

585
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:32,854
You can head back
to the makeup room.

586
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,392
Thank God.

587
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,793
This is first time safe,

588
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,996
and it's--
Makes me feel happy.

589
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:41,963
Yeah, it's nice back here.

590
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,668
The models are all
in their line,

591
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:48,570
and I notice
my model's not there.

592
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:51,006
So, Ian...

593
00:32:51,073 --> 00:32:53,408
Your model had an allergic
reaction to the makeup

594
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:55,343
through no fault of your own.

595
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:57,245
But for safety,
we had to remove the makeup,

596
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:59,848
and the judges will be using
a photo for reference.

597
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,586
All right, the judges would like
to speak with each of you

598
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,488
to learn more about your work.

599
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:07,555
Beki, please step forward.

600
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:16,731
Uh, I didn't know, honestly,
looking at your work,

601
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,166
where this was going to end up.

602
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:22,604
I love it.
You can't even tell

603
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:24,572
that you busted them
out that fast.

604
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,841
That is an honor
to hear that from you.

605
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:29,177
I think that you did
a really great job.

606
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:30,679
I love the color scheme.

607
00:33:30,746 --> 00:33:34,282
I like all your little
iridescent paint.

608
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,719
She's truly frightening
and a good phobia.

609
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,187
Thank you very much.

610
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:40,722
I'm a huge fan of this makeup.

611
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,525
You paid attention to some of
the natural elements in there,

612
00:33:43,592 --> 00:33:44,959
and translated
to the character.

613
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:46,995
Great work.
Thank you.

614
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:48,229
Beki, thank you.

615
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:50,065
Will you please step back?

616
00:33:51,534 --> 00:33:52,967
Good job.

617
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:54,202
Rayce, you're up next.

618
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,010
Ugh, technically,
you're lifting

619
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:04,379
in a lot of places,
your edges are really poor...

620
00:34:04,447 --> 00:34:06,181
Yeah.

621
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:09,551
But I think it's
a really cool design.

622
00:34:09,618 --> 00:34:11,586
It's really different,

623
00:34:11,654 --> 00:34:14,689
I haven't ever seen
anything like this.

624
00:34:14,757 --> 00:34:17,592
Uh, Rayce, I think this was
the coolest silhouette today.

625
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,594
Walking on stage,
I think it'd be, actually,

626
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:22,197
a fantastic monster
frankenstein to me.

627
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:23,732
- Thank you.
- Great stuff, Rayce.

628
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:25,734
I would have taken
half a cup of diamond dust

629
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:28,136
and poured it over him,
'cause every time he moved,

630
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:30,905
there'd be this sparkle
of frost all over him, you know?

631
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:34,175
But visually he's stunning.
Thank you.

632
00:34:34,243 --> 00:34:37,445
Guess the judges were able
to look past the application

633
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:39,714
and see the actual design
of the character,

634
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:42,117
which is what I had hoped
they would be able to see.

635
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:46,788
Athena.

636
00:34:46,856 --> 00:34:51,993
This doesn't really invoke
any kind of terror

637
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:54,496
or horror elements
to me at all.

638
00:34:54,563 --> 00:34:57,732
I think you kind of missed
the mark on the challenge.

639
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,835
As far as your prosthetics go,
I just think your technique

640
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:03,204
is on the soft side.

641
00:35:03,272 --> 00:35:05,907
I heard that you're
a terrific body painter.

642
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:08,510
Well, I actually wanted to get
out of my own comfort zone

643
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:10,278
to try something different.

644
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:13,548
For me, I wanted to see more
swelling and that redness,

645
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:16,484
and even directionality
of the rope bothers me.

646
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:19,587
It seems thrown together.

647
00:35:19,655 --> 00:35:21,956
There's some big mistakes here.

648
00:35:22,024 --> 00:35:23,591
All right, Athena, thank you.

649
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:27,095
If you'd please step back.
Thank you.

650
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:28,696
Jerry, will you please
come to the center?

651
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:37,639
Tell me a bit
about your concept?

652
00:35:37,706 --> 00:35:40,275
She is a psychiatrist
from the '30s

653
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:42,210
who embedded herself
with electronics.

654
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:43,978
I just spent all the time
getting the lights

655
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:45,280
to flicker and work.

656
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:46,781
I know it took you a long time.

657
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,550
I wish-- For me, I wish
you had pushed more

658
00:35:48,617 --> 00:35:49,984
toward the makeup effect per se

659
00:35:50,052 --> 00:35:51,453
than the actual prop build.

660
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,687
When I think of electricity,

661
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:55,023
I think of movement,
and sparks, and smoke,

662
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,358
and electricity should affect
the flesh more

663
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:59,594
with more black.
The burns are...

664
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:02,230
Black and red as well,
you know?

665
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,199
There's just so many
cool things you could've done,

666
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:05,533
and it doesn't say burn at all.

667
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:09,636
Jerry, if you'd
please step back?

668
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,940
Brea, let's talk to you.

669
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:19,481
So, Brea...

670
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:20,915
What were you thinking of

671
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:23,384
when you did this
scenario out here?

672
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:25,887
I don't know, like,
the cheeks were melted away,

673
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:27,989
and you could see the inside
of her mouth.

674
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:30,425
But they're not even
in the right shape, honey.

675
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:32,727
And you can see
her whole mouth.

676
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:33,995
How was that supposed to work?

677
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:38,099
I just-- I don't know
where this went so wrong.

678
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:40,602
I had hoped for a lot more.

679
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:42,871
The little cutesy face.

680
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:45,507
It's so cute,
it's hard to inspire fear.

681
00:36:45,574 --> 00:36:46,941
It's awful.

682
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,114
All right, Brea,
if you would please step back.

683
00:36:53,182 --> 00:36:54,349
Thank you.

684
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:55,817
I'm just utterly in shock,

685
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:58,186
because honestly I think it
looks like something

686
00:36:58,254 --> 00:36:59,854
you don't wanna come across
in a dark alley.

687
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:02,757
Ian.

688
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:07,695
Can you start by telling us

689
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:10,031
a little bit about
the concept of this makeup?

690
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:12,734
My, uh, phobia's odontophobia,
which is the--

691
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:13,902
the fear of teeth.

692
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:15,637
I chose to go
with a tooth fairy,

693
00:37:15,704 --> 00:37:17,705
and the female's been done
a few times,

694
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:20,742
so I chose to go with a male,
who is a demon.

695
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,777
Really like this makeup.

696
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:24,979
There's a really nice
attention to detail.

697
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,614
The saran wrap.

698
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:29,384
A quick way to fabricate
and cover huge amounts.

699
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:30,919
It's a
little-known technique.

700
00:37:30,986 --> 00:37:33,187
This is the best thing that
I've seen out of you so far.

701
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:36,190
I gotta say, my mouth hurts
just looking at that guy.

702
00:37:36,258 --> 00:37:38,560
And his fingers were so gross,

703
00:37:38,627 --> 00:37:40,995
I just went,
oh, this is so wrong.

704
00:37:41,063 --> 00:37:42,230
- Wow.
- Great stuff.

705
00:37:42,298 --> 00:37:44,132
I just-- I really do love
that paint job.

706
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,266
Thank you, sir.

707
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:46,868
Sorry I'm grinning
like an idiot.

708
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:48,970
Ian, could you
please step back?

709
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:50,438
Thank you so much.

710
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:53,875
- See?
- Thank you.

711
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,209
All right, everybody.

712
00:37:55,277 --> 00:37:57,111
The judges have heard
what you've had to say.

713
00:37:57,179 --> 00:37:58,713
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

714
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:01,482
while they make
their decisions.

715
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:08,323
All right, so let's start
with the works tonight

716
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,524
that you liked the most.

717
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:10,725
Why don't we start with Ian?

718
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:12,660
I was very impressed
with his work tonight,

719
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:15,363
and he's fairly young in
the makeup world in some ways.

720
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:17,865
And the fact that he was able
to take that concept

721
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:20,468
and hold onto it so strongly,
immediately develop it,

722
00:38:20,536 --> 00:38:22,604
and just run with it,
very impressive.

723
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:24,072
The use of the saran wrap,
extremely important.

724
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:26,541
That was so cool.
That saran wrap.

725
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:28,743
I got up there, and I said,
"what did he do on that chest?"

726
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:29,777
"That is so cool."

727
00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:31,112
He's very inventive.

728
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,780
He's like the MacGyver
of makeup.

729
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:34,849
You can't teach that,
so that-- that's awesome.

730
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,584
- It's in him.
- Yeah.

731
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:38,553
Okay, so let's move on to Beki.

732
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,622
She's a force. I mean,
after seeing her in the shop,

733
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:42,790
I think she's very driven.

734
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:46,294
The colors were beautiful,
the paint job was exquisite,

735
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:47,795
and it was a complete picture.

736
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:49,764
Okay, let's move on to Rayce.

737
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:51,933
This guy's such
a strong designer.

738
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:53,635
Yeah, I'm a big fan
of conceptual people

739
00:38:53,702 --> 00:38:55,136
that just kind of
bring it on paper,

740
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:56,904
and just carry on the vision
all the way to the end.

741
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:58,806
- He's one of those guys.
- Yeah, I liked it.

742
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:00,942
Like I said,
it was visually stunning.

743
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,277
Okay, so let's
discuss the looks

744
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:04,545
that you liked the least.

745
00:39:04,613 --> 00:39:05,913
Let's start with Athena.

746
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,816
Those prosthetics were so bad.

747
00:39:08,884 --> 00:39:10,451
We didn't ask
to do body painting today,

748
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,553
we just asked to do
a good paint job on the makeup.

749
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:14,222
- Makeup effects.
- And so...

750
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:15,490
It's kind of strange.
It's sort of a--

751
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:16,557
If it's outside
of your comfort zone,

752
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,126
you're in trouble.
Exactly.

753
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:19,594
Okay, so let's
move on to Jerry.

754
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:20,862
You spent all that time

755
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,431
just so we could see
some flickering lights,

756
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:25,433
when you could've been doing
a better job on your makeup?

757
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:27,035
You know, that's ridiculous.

758
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:30,838
I didn't see that it was a,
uh, electrical burn anywhere.

759
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:33,307
All right,
let's move on to Brea.

760
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:35,309
Brea has gotten really lucky

761
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:38,146
'cause she's been with
some really good artists,

762
00:39:38,213 --> 00:39:40,548
and today, chipmunk cheeks
with the teeth--

763
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:42,750
- anatomically, it's just
not right, you know?

764
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:44,986
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

765
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:46,354
- Yes.
- Okay.

766
00:39:46,422 --> 00:39:47,488
- Yes, we have.
- I believe we have.

767
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,389
Then let's bring them back out.

768
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,468
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about the top looks.

769
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:03,938
Our top looks tonight are...

770
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:07,075
Ian, for great
attention to detail,

771
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,310
without losing
your overall concept.

772
00:40:09,378 --> 00:40:12,313
Beki, for a very
successful realization

773
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:14,615
of the fear of parasites.

774
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:17,985
And Rayce,
for an exceptional design.

775
00:40:18,053 --> 00:40:20,354
All right, Glenn, then who is
the winner of this challenge?

776
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:22,290
The winner of
tonight's challenge is...

777
00:40:27,738 --> 00:40:30,306
The winner of
tonight's challenge is...

778
00:40:32,176 --> 00:40:33,209
Ian.

779
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:37,246
Thank you so much.

780
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:39,082
Oh, my God.

781
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:41,918
I thought I could ver, like,
do anything right.

782
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:44,020
I was-- I was terrified.
And I-I--

783
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:45,388
thank you all so much.

784
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,757
Top looks this week was me,
this guy..

785
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:50,526
- Ian, congratulations.
- Thank you.

786
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:51,861
You can head back
to the makeup room.

787
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:53,262
Good job, guys.

788
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,430
I really thought
I was going home

789
00:40:54,498 --> 00:40:55,298
if I didn't make it this time.

790
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,567
But everyone loved it.

791
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:59,102
Yay!

792
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:00,002
I did good.

793
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:07,009
Beki, Rayce, you are also safe.

794
00:41:07,077 --> 00:41:08,678
Please head back
to the makeup room.

795
00:41:08,746 --> 00:41:09,812
- Thank you.
- Thank you, everybody.

796
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,747
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

797
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:15,384
Unfortunately, that means
the three of you

798
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,353
are on the bottom this week,

799
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:18,788
and one of you
will be eliminated.

800
00:41:18,856 --> 00:41:20,556
Will you please step forward?

801
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:29,165
All right, Glenn,
why don't you tell us

802
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:30,333
about the bottom looks.

803
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,435
Athena...

804
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:36,439
Your poor sculpting lead to
an uninspired horror villain.

805
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:41,043
Jerry, you needed to spend
more time on your makeup

806
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:43,412
and less time
on blinking lights.

807
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:47,283
Brea, you had good ideas,

808
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:50,686
but your makeup suffered
from poor execution.

809
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,591
So then who is
going home tonight?

810
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:59,629
The person that's
going home tonight is...

811
00:42:03,467 --> 00:42:04,901
Brea.

812
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:07,537
Okay.

813
00:42:07,604 --> 00:42:09,438
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

814
00:42:09,506 --> 00:42:11,207
Well, thank you anyways,
it was a pleasure to be here,

815
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:12,608
and I appreciate
the opportunity.

816
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:16,312
Brea, I am so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

817
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,514
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room,

818
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:20,883
- and pack up your kit.
- Bye.

819
00:42:20,951 --> 00:42:22,518
Good luck.

820
00:42:25,989 --> 00:42:28,257
So I'm going home.

821
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:29,792
Are you serious?

822
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,661
There's nothing I would have
changed about that makeup.

823
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:32,995
I'm-- I'm completely
happy with it.

824
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:34,197
I'm not ashamed at all of it.

825
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,301
The experience of being here
was amazing to me.

826
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:40,203
All the people
that I met were great.

827
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,261
And, hey, it'll be something
I get to tell my grandkids about.
