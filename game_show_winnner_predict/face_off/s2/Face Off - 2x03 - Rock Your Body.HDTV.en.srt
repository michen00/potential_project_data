00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,371
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:10,706
14 talented special effects
makeup artists

3
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:13,843
came to Los Angeles to compete
to join the world's elite.

4
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:17,046
Your makeups are now going
to have to be waterproof.

5
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:18,181
Oh, my gosh.

6
00:00:18,248 --> 00:00:19,615
He goes underwater for a moment

7
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:20,683
and he comes right back up.

8
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:22,852
He can't breathe.

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,122
Tonight's winner is...
Matt.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,690
And who's going home tonight?

11
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:30,159
Nix.

12
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:33,963
Now, 12 artists remain.
And tonight...

13
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:36,799
Please welcome hip-hop star
Asher Roth.

14
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:37,867
Oh,

15
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:40,069
Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.

16
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:45,218
All completely nude models,
flopping in the wind.

17
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:48,578
And it goes from bad to worse,
like, real quick.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,181
To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress

19
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:54,383
our award-winning
panel of judges.

20
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:55,885

36
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:15,364
- I think Jerry.
- I know.

37
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,099
- It's like Jerry's a virus.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:18,734
- A parasite that he
attaches to anybody--

39
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:19,702
- Thank you.
- And whoever's associated

40
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,970
with him, goes home.

41
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:22,104
And then he's like,

44
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,475
Yeah.
It's the Jerry curse.

45
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,743
If you work with him,
he's gonna

46
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,245
sap any of your creativity

47
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:31,113
and bring your makeup down.

48
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:34,050
I'm just upset because
he's always telling people

49
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,218
how to do this, how to do that,

50
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,352
and his stuff doesn't work.

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,687
And you're on
the bottom every time.

52
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:48,364
Ooh.

53
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:50,066
We walk in and our models are

54
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,034
standing there
with sunglasses on

55
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,236
and we're like,
"what's going on?"

56
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:55,371
I'm a little confused.

57
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,373
Why are there only
four makeup stations

58
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,674
and only four models?

59
00:02:58,742 --> 00:02:59,942
Hey, guys.

60
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,245
Life on the set
of a Hollywood movie

61
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,580
or a primetime television show
is fast-paced,

62
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:06,182
and time is money.

63
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,484
Makeup artists are often pulled
in many different directions,

64
00:03:08,552 --> 00:03:11,220
forcing them to pass off
what they've started

65
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,155
onto a team member.

66
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,490
Well, that is the basis

67
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:17,326
for this week's
foundation challenge...

68
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:19,061
A timed relay race.

69
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,330
Oh...

70
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:23,366
Working in teams of three,

71
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:26,669
you will take turns creating
a single face makeup.

72
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:30,072
Each team member will get
two 15 minute turns.

73
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,207
When the 15 minutes are up,

74
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,908
you will run back to the start

75
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:35,611
and hand this brush
to your next teammate.

76
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,646
Oh, man.

77
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:37,980
You also will not be able

78
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,782
to see what your
teammates are doing.

79
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,884
What?!

80
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,785
Models.

81
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,555
Underneath your
models' sunglasses

82
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:48,791
are a pair of specialty
contact lenses.

83
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:50,860
Your makeups must
be built around

84
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,561
the lenses
your model is wearing.

85
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:55,331
And you won't know what
they are until you start.

86
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,767
Your guest judge
this week is best known

87
00:03:57,834 --> 00:04:01,304
for the fast-paced world
of sketch comedy shows.

88
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,839
Not only was she the department
head on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>

89
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:05,708
and <i>Mad TV,</i>

90
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:09,512
but she has won an emmy and
has been nominated 14 times.

91
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,182
Please say hello
to Jennifer Aspinall.

92
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,419
Jennifer Aspinall is so
respected in the makeup world.

93
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:19,255
She has to do so many different
looks on <i>Saturday night live.</i>

94
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:21,724
I want to impress her!

95
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,926
So, Jennifer, you know what it
takes to thrive under pressure.

96
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:25,561
What advice can you
give to these guys?

97
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,897
This challenge is a really
good opportunity for you guys

98
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:30,533
to fine tune your
decision-making skills.

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,668
You will have to follow the lead
that was put before you.

100
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:34,770
Stay focused,
make choices really quickly,

101
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:36,505
and work as a unit.

102
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:39,508
Okay, so Jennifer will select
the winner of this challenge.

103
00:04:39,576 --> 00:04:42,345
That person will then win
immunity, and, of course,

104
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:44,313
cannot be eliminated this week.

105
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,816
Every time there's an
immunity, I'm dying to get it,

106
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:49,552
because the stress level
on the judging days

107
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:50,953
is just sending me
through the roof.

108
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:54,090
She will be judging on
creativity, technique,

109
00:04:54,157 --> 00:04:57,727
and overall contribution
to the team's final look.

110
00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:00,129
Everything else has been
selected randomly for you.

111
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:04,033
Team one--
Jerry, Miranda, and Sue.

112
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:07,303
Team two-- Tara,
Brea, Heather.

113
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:10,506
Team three--
Rayce, Beki, and Ian.

114
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:14,477
And our last team is
Matt, RJ, and Athena.

115
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,911
Please head back
to the starting line

116
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,047
and pick who's gonna go first.

117
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:19,782
Let me go first because I can

118
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,250
throw down some
pieces real quick.

119
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:24,520
Okay, your time starts...

120
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:26,288
Now.

121
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:27,289
I'm faster.

122
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:28,524
Look at me.

123
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:29,792
My model looked at me,
and there were these

124
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,461
yellow contacts
with green and black spots.

125
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:34,897
And I'm like, "all right,
cool, Alien." Out the gate.

126
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:36,031
Ooh.

127
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,800
The contacts
my team has are fiery,

128
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,168
so I thought we'll do a zombie.

129
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:40,569
God, those are gorgeous.
You have gorgeous eyes.

130
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:42,605
I look at the contacts
and immediately I'm thinking,

131
00:05:42,672 --> 00:05:43,439
fantasy beauty, why not?

132
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,147
Come on, Jerry,
you got this, you got this.

133
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:53,282
I run over to the prosthetics

134
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,085
and I just rip the appliances
out of RJ's hands,

135
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:58,387
and I'm like, dude,
you just gotta go.

136
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:00,222
Okay, that's how
we're gonna play, all right.

137
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,558
I immediately grabbed
blue eyelashes,

138
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,960
thinking we're going with
blue star princess here.

139
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:07,229
Oh, my God, gorgeous,
gorgeous, gorgeous.

140
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:11,267
I only have 15 minutes to set

141
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:13,936
a foundation for
where we're going.

142
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:16,739
I lay down nasolabial
fold prosthetics.

143
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:18,174
We're off to
a really good start here.

144
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,045
Send me the concept, RJ.

145
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:27,216
You can do it, RJ.

146
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:29,819
Beki's first because
she's really good at

147
00:06:29,886 --> 00:06:32,021
applying prosthetics
and she's really fast at it.

148
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:36,025
But I just don't know what
to expect when it's my turn.

149
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:38,260
And switch!

150
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,797
Ah, go!

151
00:06:41,865 --> 00:06:43,265
All right, what are we doing?

152
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,768
The prosthetic piece
that's already been applied

153
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,770
looks like a zombie
so I start hitting the eyes,

154
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:49,572
shadowing it
with some dark reds.

155
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:52,875
Well, hello.

156
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:54,043
I turn around the corner,

157
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,911
I'm pretty shocked
by what I see.

158
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,380
All the other teams
has prosthetic pieces

159
00:06:58,448 --> 00:06:59,748
and we have eyelashes
and blue glitter.

160
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,953
Now I'm gonna
go over your eyes.

161
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Just keep drying.

162
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:06,489
Perfect.

163
00:07:06,556 --> 00:07:08,224
Thank you, sir.

164
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,959
I wanna do more things

165
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:11,093
but I'm worried
that ours is just

166
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:12,127
gonna be a wacky beauty makeup.

167
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,263
And switch!

168
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:20,870
Hi, friend.

169
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:22,037
I don't know who did what.

170
00:07:22,105 --> 00:07:23,873
What is happening here?

171
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,275
I just know what
it looks like now,

172
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:28,444
and it's different.

173
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,012
Look up.

174
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,316
All right, can you lean
your head back a little bit?

175
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,418
We need more texture,
so I actually lay paper towel

176
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:37,586
on his nose and his lips.

177
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:38,787
By the time I'm done with that,

178
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:39,788
it's, uh, next person up.

179
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:41,156
And switch!

180
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:46,762
Round two, I run up...

181
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,864
Wow, they're doing a good job.

182
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,966
I-- I don't know
if it was Miranda or Sue,

183
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,268
but it looks good.

184
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:53,869
Oh, wow.

185
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:56,772
I'm really enjoying the way
the piece is coming together.

186
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,173
We're awesome.

187
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,409
I feel pretty
confident about ours.

188
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:02,411
I just have to paint this
as fast as possible

189
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,580
so that they can do
some detail work on it.

190
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:08,450
Ooh, ooh, um...

191
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:11,153
The vision I see is
getting a little jumbled.

192
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,755
But I'm hoping the blue wig

193
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,023
will lead these girls
into the right direction.

194
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,724
Wow, you look
really pretty, actually.

195
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:16,792
Turn your head this way.

196
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,693
And switch!

197
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:23,966
Oh, beautiful.

198
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:31,407
Switch!

199
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:32,541
No.

200
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:34,076
My God.

201
00:08:34,144 --> 00:08:34,977
Look up.

202
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:41,016
Time's up!
Brushes down.

203
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,452
I know where we stand.
And it's not the top.

204
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,120
Pretty.

205
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:49,158
- Hey, you three.
- Hi.

206
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:50,793
Cool.

207
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,194
- Creepy.
- Yeah.

208
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:53,228
What was your concept?

209
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:54,496
I came over, I saw his eyes.

210
00:08:54,564 --> 00:08:56,498
I had it in my head
we were going demon.

211
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:57,666
Did you know what direction

212
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:58,968
he was going in
when you saw it?

213
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:00,269
I saw where it was going.
I was like,

214
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:02,037
"my job is just to get it
all blended in."

215
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:03,005
You guys did a great paintjob.

216
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,506
I like your spackling.

217
00:09:04,574 --> 00:09:06,575
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

218
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:07,943
Hi, ladies.

219
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,311
So, who exactly did what?

220
00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:10,312
I put the eyelashes.

221
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,447
I did the wig.

222
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:12,681
- Mm-hmm.
- The lips...

223
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:13,482
You did
the three dimensional stuff?

224
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,750
Yes.

225
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:17,052
Then I came in
and did the highlighting

226
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,321
and changed the eye shape
a little bit underneath.

227
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:21,423
I think you guys
had a couple of

228
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:23,525
different directions
going at the same time.

229
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:28,130
So tell us a little bit
about your makeup.

230
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:30,299
I was the first one up,
so I came over,

231
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,934
I saw that they were
sort of alien eyes,

232
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:34,570
and so I laid down the brow,
the chin and the ears.

233
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:35,938
I could see
where you were leading,

234
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:37,406
and these guys
were doing a good job

235
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,774
of following you
down that path.

236
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:40,309
So I feel like
it really worked.

237
00:09:40,377 --> 00:09:42,011
Thank you.

238
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:43,946
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

239
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:45,014
Wow.

240
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:48,250
I'm not sure
what it's supposed to be.

241
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,753
Maybe she got hit
with a paintball?

242
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,655
No, it's a zombie.

243
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,957
I'm not sure that those lenses
would have said "zombie" to me.

244
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:57,559
Blood looks great.

245
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:58,594
The blood was a good call.

246
00:09:58,662 --> 00:09:59,962
Gave it some dimension.

247
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,163
Thank you very much.

248
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,832
- Thanks, you guys.
- Thank you.

249
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,901
So, Jennifer,
how did they do overall?

250
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,003
I think you guys
did a really good job

251
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:09,171
with a really hard challenge.

252
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,306
But I do think
some of the teams

253
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,942
worked a little better
than others.

254
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,178
Which team won this challenge?

255
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,215
I'm gonna go with...

256
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,952
The green alien.

257
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,320
- Aw, thank you.
- Awesome, thank you.

258
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:28,157
It's okay.

259
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:30,059
We can only have
one winner this week,

260
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,194
and, remember,
immunity is at stake.

261
00:10:32,262 --> 00:10:35,931
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

262
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:39,768
The winner of
this challenge is...

263
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:40,736
Beki.

264
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:42,404
Thank you very much.

265
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:45,674
I think Beki had a really
clear vision from the beginning,

266
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:48,077
and I think she set it up
so that her team could really

267
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:50,979
follow that vision,
and they did a great job.

268
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:53,182
- Congratulations, Beki.
- Whoo, thank you.

269
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,350
With that,
you have won immunity this week

270
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:57,386
and cannot be eliminated.

271
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:58,921
Whoo!

272
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:01,924
I will see you all tomorrow
for the spotlight challenge.

273
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:04,493
But for now,
head back to the house.

274
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,362
Going into this next
challenge with immunity,

275
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,598
I'm feeling pretty confident.

276
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,272
We're back in the lab again.

277
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,144
We see McKenzie and
a bunch of covered black boards.

278
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,246
Welcome to
your next spotlight challenge.

279
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:26,782
Today I have
a very special guest.

280
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,585
He's a hot new artist
whose innovative music videos

281
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:32,654
have been viewed over
20 million times on YouTube.

282
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:35,324
And his last album
reached number five

283
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:38,527
on both the R&B charts
and billboard's hot 100.

284
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,229
Wow.

285
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:41,396
His hit single, <i>I love college,</i>

286
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:44,933
has sold over 2 million copies.

287
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,468
So if you would please welcome

288
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:47,536
Asher Roth.

289
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:48,537
♪ I wanna go to college

290
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:49,972
♪ for the rest of my life

291
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,875
♪ sit back in this club
and drink Miller light ♪

292
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,810
This is ridiculous, wow.

293
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,411
I have his first albums.

294
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,579
How you guys doing?

295
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:59,681
I'm pretty excited to meet him.

296
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,117
Asher has a new album
coming out very soon.

297
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:03,952
It's called,
<i>is this too orange?</i>

298
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,154
Oh, cool.

299
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:06,355
Today,
you're going to be creating

300
00:12:06,422 --> 00:12:07,923
an original piece
of artwork for him

301
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:11,293
that should be worthy
of an album cover.

302
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,761
So, Asher,
why don't you tell them

303
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,196
a little bit
about the new album?

304
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:15,564
I found out
along the way that orange

305
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:17,332
is the color of
the creative chakra.

306
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,568
So it's just warm,
fun, creative music.

307
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,503
I want you guys to get weird.
Have fun with it,

308
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:24,306
and just see how twisted
your minds are.

309
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:28,177
- We need to break you into
randomly-selected teams of two.

310
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:29,311
Oh, gosh.

311
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:33,315
Team one-- Jerry and Tara.

312
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:35,117
Team two--
Rayce and Beki.

313
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:36,185
Awesome.

314
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:37,886
Team three--
Ian and Miranda.

315
00:12:37,954 --> 00:12:40,956
Team four-- Sue and Heather.

316
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:43,926
Team five--
RJ and Athena.

317
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:47,162
Team six--Brea and Matt.

318
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,298
Behind these pieces of fabric
are the backgrounds

319
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:50,732
that you will be working with.

320
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,901
So why don't I bring in
some friends

321
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:55,537
to help us uncover these?

322
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:57,873
Whoa.

323
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,541
Oh, my God, don't look.

324
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:00,809
- Okay.
- You okay, Sue?

325
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,044
I'm gonna turn.

326
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:03,846
I can't stand in the front.

327
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:08,974
We get to the lab today

328
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,043
and McKenzie is standing
with Asher Roth,

329
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:14,146
in front of all
these huge boards.

330
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:16,115
So, why don't I
bring in some friends

331
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:18,217
to help us uncover these?

332
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,456
Oh, my God.
They have no clothes on

333
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:25,958
and I can't look at them.

334
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:27,760
You okay, Sue?

335
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,762
My face is getting
hotter and hotter

336
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,397
and I'm just looking up
at the sky.

337
00:13:31,465 --> 00:13:34,233
I'm gonna turn.
I can't stand in the front.

338
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:35,634
I just can't do this right now.

339
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:40,473
This is
a nude body painting challenge.

340
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,709
Yay!

341
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:45,845
I'm very excited
because everybody knows

342
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,381
that I am basically
a master body-painter.

343
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:52,351
So I finally
get a chance to shine.

344
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,487
All right, guys,
you need to select an element

345
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:56,722
of what Asher
just told you about his album

346
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,724
as the inspiration
for your designs.

347
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,693
Each team
must paint two models.

348
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,561
One must
blend into the background

349
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,531
and the other one needs to be
a character that interacts

350
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:08,067
- with the background somehow.
- Okay.

351
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:10,436
Each member of your team
must be responsible

352
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:13,005
for one of your models and
cannot work on the other one,

353
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:16,108
so it's very important
that you are both

354
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:18,244
on the same page, conceptually.

355
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:21,013
All right, guys,
pull down the sheets.

356
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,183
Oh, sweet.

357
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,618
Oh...

358
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:26,685
As you can see,
the models have been

359
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,954
pre-assigned
two backgrounds.

360
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:31,090
Keep that in mind
when you make your pick.

361
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:33,492
Models,
you can put your robes on.

362
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,995
Tara and Jerry, go ahead
and make your pick first.

363
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,500
We're checking out
the canvases.

364
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,135
On one side
we have this elephant

365
00:14:43,203 --> 00:14:44,937
that's skateboarding
in the middle of the air.

366
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:47,239
Another one is a park bench.

367
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:48,874
There's one with a pool.

368
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,976
Then there's
the wall of sneakers.

369
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:54,213
And finally,
there's an old abandoned barn

370
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:55,614
with a noose hanging
in the middle of it.

371
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,116
I like this.

372
00:14:57,184 --> 00:14:59,351
Tara and I
decide on the brick wall.

373
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,520
We both feel this one.

374
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,522
Although I'm not sure why.

375
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,457
Rayce, Beki.

376
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,860
Nobody wants
the shoe background.

377
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:09,528
In order to make that blend,

378
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:12,398
you have to paint
every individual shoe,

379
00:15:12,466 --> 00:15:14,567
and there's
no getting around that.

380
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:15,568
Ian and Miranda.

381
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:17,670
Very nice to meet you.

382
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,138
Sue and Heather.

383
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:20,506
- Hi, Sue.
- Heather.

384
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:21,407
Nice to meet you.

385
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,844
RJ and Athena.

386
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:26,278
Yes, relief.

387
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,114
We are going straight
to the pool backdrop.

388
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:31,016
It's not an elephant,
but it's better than sneakers.

389
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:34,620
Brea and Matt, go ahead.

390
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,655
All I'm thinking is, "great,

391
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:38,958
"how are we gonna make
a wall of sneakers

392
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,126
into an album cover?"

393
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,865
Well, our photographer
will be here later

394
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,967
to capture your work.

395
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,735
And Asher will be
joining our judges onstage

396
00:15:49,803 --> 00:15:51,570
to see what you've created.

397
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:53,138
Keep in mind,
the judges will be looking

398
00:15:53,206 --> 00:15:55,274
not only at
the final image overall,

399
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:58,177
but your individual
contributions as well.

400
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,980
You have one day
to complete this challenge.

401
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:04,016
Good luck, because your time
starts now.

402
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,558
Athena is really good
at body paint,

403
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:15,194
and this is her thing. I don't
want to take that from her,

404
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:17,062
so I let her do the character

405
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,265
that was going to be
standing out,

406
00:16:19,332 --> 00:16:21,400
and I'm going to take
the character that has to be

407
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:23,402
sunken in and
camouflaged to the background.

408
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,704
What if she's standing here

409
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:26,739
and does this pose?

410
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:32,511
We create these balls
coming out of the sky

411
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:33,979
that represent chakras.

412
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,215
Like-- like you're basically
reaching for something.

413
00:16:36,283 --> 00:16:38,918
That's a great idea.

414
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:40,519
Okay, well, we need
some sort of dynamic pose.

415
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:43,956
We need to be thinking of--
It's gotta be an album.

416
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:46,325
I'm trying to draw some things
and come up with a design.

417
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,860
And incorporate it.

418
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,628
I mean, it's a park bench

419
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:53,465
with some bushes
and a drink on it, you know?

420
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,534
We may not be
the best body-painters here,

421
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:56,869
but we're certainly not
the worst.

422
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:58,404
Nope.

423
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,539
Tara and I come up
with a concept fairly quickly.

424
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:04,710
We want to blend the male
into the background of the wall

425
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:08,280
and have the female be
a graffiti tagger.

426
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:10,549
I like that she's gonna be
in color...

427
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:12,251
- Oh, yeah. No, that's--
- And you're gonna be

428
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,552
all black and white.

429
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,754
Tara says she's
a really strong body-painter,

430
00:17:15,822 --> 00:17:19,224
so she should do the clothing
on the girl,

431
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:21,694
because that's gonna be harder
than doing the blend.

432
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,463
What if she's
spraying something orange too?

433
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:26,031
Like,
the finishing color's orange.

434
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:32,504
I was thinking of making her
into another elephant.

435
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,939
What's more fun than
an elephant on a skateboard?

436
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,374
I don't know.

437
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,476
- What do elephants eat?
- Peanuts.

438
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:39,845
- Peanuts.
- Peanuts!

439
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:42,014
Yeah, let's make him
hold a big peanut!

440
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,184
Still, that doesn't matter.

441
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:46,752
We have to figure out what it is
that we're using and stuff.

442
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,787
Well, it does matter,
because if they're interacting,

443
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:50,823
they can hold props
which interact with the coke,

444
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,358
or whatever the hell it is,
you know?

445
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:54,693
It's hard to think of
what you could possibly do

446
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,495
that would have anything
to do with Asher Roth

447
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:57,463
or an album cover.

448
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,064
We're looking at them,

449
00:17:59,132 --> 00:18:02,067
and we have no idea
where to go with this.

450
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:05,037
We see sneakers, and I think,
"what can you do with sneakers?

451
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,639
"Hey, basketball player."

452
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:09,141
Does an ass cheek
make a better basketball,

453
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,442
or a stomach?

454
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,277
What do you think?
Ass cheek.

455
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,279
I ended up thinking, let's put
a basketball on her buttocks,

456
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:15,447
and just have him palm it.

457
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:24,156
'Cause if it's, like, her hair--

458
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:26,025
We haven't figured that out.

459
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:27,993
The concept
is definitely abstract.

460
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:30,029
These characters
are both trying to rip away.

461
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:31,630
He's part of the warehouse,

462
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:34,133
and he's trying to
bring her back in,

463
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,834
and because
she's freed herself from this,

464
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:37,736
she's become
this whole other entity,

465
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:39,405
so she's gonna be
almost glowing.

466
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:41,240
My biggest concern

467
00:18:41,307 --> 00:18:44,143
is that the judges
might not get this at all.

468
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,713
Everyone else has started,

469
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,882
but Miranda and I, we're having
some pretty big struggles

470
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:51,417
with the conceptual design.

471
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:55,387
We can't figure out how to make
an album cover of this at all.

472
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:04,897
I'm throwing out ideas
to Miranda,

473
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:07,266
and she's not liking
any of them.

474
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,336
What the hell am I gonna do?

475
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:23,019
We gotta make an album cover
out of this,

476
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:26,056
and it's gonna be
a pretty difficult thing to do.

477
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,824
She could be like--

478
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:30,794
We have no ideas.

479
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:33,897
Could they be, like, someone's
peeking out of the bushes,

480
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,099
or like, I don't know, like,
something like that?

481
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:39,369
We just don't have the time
to continue conceptualizing.

482
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:41,171
And we're not really
getting anywhere.

483
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:42,739
We only have six hours
to do this,

484
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,541
so we really just have to
start getting painted.

485
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:49,379
We finally chose to go with

486
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,614
some kind of
hip-hop roller girl,

487
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:54,551
so I'm painting the tank top
and some sporty shorts

488
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:55,885
and some socks on her.

489
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,320
That's about the best
I could do.

490
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:58,888
I want to do the blend,
just because I feel like

491
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:00,623
it'll be easier
to match something

492
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:04,427
than it will be
to paint something else.

493
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,529
We are mixing color,
I mean--

494
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,231
- No, I think we're good.
- Not bad, yeah.

495
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,233
I said I thought
an hour for color, and...

496
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:11,868
- I think that's great.
- And we're doing it.

497
00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:16,139
It feels almost like
we're wasting time,

498
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:19,476
but on the other hand, if
this color-matching isn't right,

499
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:20,877
everything's thrown off.

500
00:20:20,945 --> 00:20:22,479
All right, let's see.

501
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:25,715
We're gonna try to incorporate
the title of the album,

502
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,851
"is this 2 orange,"

503
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:29,686
and the "2" being
the number on the Jersey.

504
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,088
The majority of the body
will be covered in paint,

505
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:34,424
because it's a naked
body-painting challenge,

506
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,626
but I'm using
a piece of rubber to create

507
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,428
his three-dimensional-looking
shorts.

508
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:39,429
How are you doing, you good?

509
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:40,697
- Great.
- Okay, tell me

510
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:42,766
if you're thirsty or anything.
Yeah.

511
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:49,105
I'm really still unsure
of myself with this elephant,

512
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:52,475
but as soon as I think I'm
heading in a right direction,

513
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,678
here comes McKenzie
and Ve Neill.

514
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:58,648
I am a little worried, because
I'm not used to body-painting.

515
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,950
What did you make
your elephant ears out of?

516
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:04,487
Uh, latex, cotton,
and armature wire.

517
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,722
- You're air-brushing?

518
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,923
I'm air-brushing
most of it, so--

519
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:07,991
And you're hand-painting,
for now?

520
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,526
I'm laying in with hand paint,

521
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:11,728
and then I'll make a little
stencil and clean up, and--

522
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:12,862
Got ya.
I'll be interested

523
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,464
to see how it turns out.

524
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:15,799
Me too.

525
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,100
"Me, too," well, that's scary.

526
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:19,002
First time
body painting, so--

527
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,336
Yeah, me, too, yeah.

528
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,704
Well, what's your concept?

529
00:21:21,772 --> 00:21:23,640
The guy who is gonna be
blending in

530
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:27,710
would ultimately have his hand
being body-painted into the cup,

531
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:29,212
and then she's gonna be
reaching for the cup,

532
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,314
- so also reaching for his hand.
- Oh, okay.

533
00:21:31,382 --> 00:21:32,715
So tell us about your concept.

534
00:21:32,783 --> 00:21:34,584
We went towards
the spiritual side of it,

535
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:37,020
because when we were
talking to Asher,

536
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,456
he told us
it's all about the chakras,

537
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:41,624
and the color orange
is the color of the chakras.

538
00:21:41,692 --> 00:21:42,926
- Hi.
- Hey, Matt, how are you doing?

539
00:21:42,993 --> 00:21:44,294
- Great.
- How are you doing?

540
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:45,995
So, Matt, what's your
whole take on this thing,

541
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,530
are you happy
with what you're doing?

542
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,265
Um, it's a daunting task.

543
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,500
Um, but...

544
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:51,434
- Definitely--
- You got the hard job.

545
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:52,869
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,771
So I'm just trying to--
I got everything planned out

547
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,806
so it's all, you know,
coordinated accordingly

548
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,942
to the racks,
and then traced a shoe,

549
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:01,578
and then created a stencil,
and then we airbrush.

550
00:22:01,645 --> 00:22:02,712
Got ya.

551
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,581
What is your concept?

552
00:22:04,648 --> 00:22:07,417
What we thought we would do
is take our male model

553
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:09,219
and blend him in
with the environment,

554
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,553
and what's
gonna be happening is,

555
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,422
he's going to be reaching out,
and so

556
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,624
she has already escaped
from this environment,

557
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:16,559
so she's very bright
and vibrant.

558
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,328
So both of them are
kind of an energy.

559
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:19,362
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

560
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,031
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

561
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,967
Okay, Ve,
which one do you think

562
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:25,235
looks the most promising?

563
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,370
I like
Rayce and Beki's concept.

564
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:30,707
I love the colors
in the female model,

565
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:33,109
and it looks like he's starting
on the back of her,

566
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,778
which means she probably is
gonna be turned sideways

567
00:22:35,846 --> 00:22:38,748
a little bit,
so that would be very helpful.

568
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,884
I think everybody's
doing really well

569
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:44,020
except for Ian and Miranda
with their picnic table.

570
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:46,756
You know, if they had
a strong concept,

571
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,658
it might have helped them
a lot more.

572
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,894
And I think Matt really has
his work cut out for him.

573
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:53,530
He's gotta, you know,
detail all those tennis shoes.

574
00:22:53,597 --> 00:22:55,198
I'm on the fence
with those guys.

575
00:22:55,266 --> 00:22:57,367
- Okay. Thank you.
- Good.

576
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:01,437
Yeah.

577
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,578
Maybe an hour and a half
goes by,

578
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:10,713
and I'm starting to
worry a little bit about Tara.

579
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,482
Tara, come here.

580
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,651
I don't feel her colors
are pink enough.

581
00:23:14,718 --> 00:23:16,953
There's too much flesh tone
showing through.

582
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,988
I just don't think
it's coming together.

583
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:21,624
And I'm-- I'm getting
a little worried about you.

584
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,326
- I'm not done yet.
- Okay.

585
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:24,727
I mean, if you love it,
then ignore me.

586
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:26,529
I don't love it yet,
but I'm not done yet.

587
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:30,567
I just-- I just think it needs
a lot more contrast.

588
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:33,336
Our characters are in this
black and white, gray world,

589
00:23:33,404 --> 00:23:35,972
so if I paint
something colorful,

590
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,410
I'm worried the black and white
concept will be lost,

591
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,548
I've never even
painted on canvas,

592
00:23:45,616 --> 00:23:47,150
so this is, like,
a whole new world.

593
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,386
"Is...This...Too...Orange?"

594
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,627
We are fifth hour
into our challenge,

595
00:23:57,695 --> 00:24:00,496
and I am looking
to the right of me,

596
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,333
and I see Brea's model
getting light-headed.

597
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,902
That's why I'm thinking that
something is not going right.

598
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:09,672
You're doing great.
Almost done.

599
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:13,876
Yeah.

600
00:24:13,944 --> 00:24:15,745
Things are going awesome.
I look at the clock,

601
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:18,615
we have 17 minutes left.

602
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:20,817
Next thing you know,
he takes a seat.

603
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:22,285
I'm like,
"why are you sitting down?"

604
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:23,186
Actually, will you stand up?

605
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:25,488
No, you gotta--
Okay.

606
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:30,760
You feel like you're
gonna pass out?

607
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:31,661
Are you okay?

608
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,498
I turn and I look,

609
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:38,034
and I see that Brea's model
is sitting on a chair,

610
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,270
and he kinda looks like
he's passed out.

611
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:43,239
I'm gonna get you some water,
okay?

612
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,775
Oh, great..

613
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:49,345
It goes from bad to worse,
like, real quick.

614
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,215
That's when I started
to freak out.

615
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,250
I have no idea
what he's going through.

616
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,718
No, this is not happening.

617
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,819
You've gotta be kidding me
right now.

618
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,924
- Coming up...
- This is like a bad dream.

619
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:03,660
Some people
really took chances,

620
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:06,029
and others played it
a little bit more safe.

621
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:08,331
I'm freaking out inside.

622
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:10,500
The body-painting
that you did here on the model

623
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,869
isn't good enough
for a face-painting booth

624
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:14,437
at a county fair.

625
00:25:22,923 --> 00:25:25,124
Brea has been
working on this guy all day.

626
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,426
14 minutes
left in the challenge

627
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:30,730
and he's down for the count.

628
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:33,132
Everybody really freaking out
that this poor guy

629
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,101
just passed out
in front of everyone.

630
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:36,502
Okay, what about the oxygen?

631
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,638
Is that
helping your breathing at all?

632
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:40,373
Is he okay?

633
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:42,475
Uh, no, I guess they're just
gonna take him away.

634
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:43,409
The ambulance is coming.

635
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:44,711
Paramedics show up,

636
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:46,980
and they've got
a breathing tube on this kid.

637
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:49,015
They're rubbing my makeup off.

638
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,683
It is so depressing.

639
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,719
My world feels like
it's crumbling right now.

640
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:55,221
There goes my masterpiece...

641
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:56,589
Off to the hospital.

642
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:01,561
After they haul Brea's model
out, I start to worry a lot.

643
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:04,297
I start to wonder
if I should even finish my work.

644
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,698
Hey...

645
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:12,605
Don't worry about it,
it's not your fault.

646
00:26:12,673 --> 00:26:15,008
These things happen.

647
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,176
And we're, like, almost done.

648
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:22,982
Everyone's freaking out,
but we all have to

649
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,218
maintain our composure
and get our makeups finished.

650
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,358
Guys, time is up!

651
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,162
This challenge is unique
in that

652
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,432
we won't be presenting the final
makeup in front of the judges.

653
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,367
They'll be judging
off a photograph.

654
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:44,303
We'll have ten minutes to take
pictures and do touch-ups.

655
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:46,873
- This is his girlfriend.
- Okay.

656
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,575
And he is going to hand him
a peanut with her nose.

657
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:51,110
Ooh, I like it.

658
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,381
I think you have to
move in more.

659
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,383
As the photographer
starts taking the pictures,

660
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,285
I'm a little worried,
because I didn't know

661
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:00,753
what was going to happen.

662
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:02,889
I was thinking, if I need to,
I will paint my body,

663
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,590
and stand there
and hold her ass,

664
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,192
'cause I'm not
losing this competition

665
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,127
'cause a model passes out.

666
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:10,430
Ready when you are, Miranda.

667
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,065
Perfect.

668
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:13,332
One...Two...Three...

669
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,734
Go.

670
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:16,536
Can you, like, bend your knees
and, like, really move?

671
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,004
Yup, yeah. Step away
and stretch over, yeah.

672
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,772
There are many horizontal lines

673
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,374
that are not gonna line up

674
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:23,609
if this thing is not
shot properly with the camera,

675
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:26,212
and I'm really
starting to sweat this.

676
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,147
Nice.

677
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,315
Go for him
and go away from him.

678
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:31,517
No, no, right hand away,
as it was.

679
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,553
Camouflaging
is very difficult to do.

680
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,123
I am extremely worried
that it's not gonna work.

681
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,337
So after everyone
gets their photos taken,

682
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,873
everyone heads home
and I'm in limbo with Brea,

683
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,775
wondering what's gonna happen.

684
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,010
The producers tell me
I'm getting a new model.

685
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,747
I'm thinking, "okay,
maybe the next day I'll do it."

686
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:02,148
Oh, no, no, no.

687
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:04,117
They tell me
I'm doing it right now.

688
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,718
Six more hours.

689
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,920
And my heart drops to my feet.

690
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,759
When we come back to the house,

691
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,727
and we all felt really bad
for Brea.

692
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,095
Now she's gotta do it again.

693
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:18,164
It's like, she's gonna be there
till midnight.

694
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,066
- Matt!
- Ooh, it's Matt!

695
00:28:20,134 --> 00:28:21,801
Walking into the house,
everyone wants to know

696
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,069
what's going on, what happened.

697
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,037
Was there any, like, thing
actually stated

698
00:28:25,105 --> 00:28:26,572
about what happened
to your model?

699
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,775
He wasn't hydrated,
and he was just out.

700
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:30,610
I feel bad for him,
but at least he's okay.

701
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,246
Brea will actually
be able to recreate

702
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:36,115
only what she made originally
and superimpose him

703
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,684
on the picture
that I've taken with my model.

704
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:40,853
She has an extra six hours?

705
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:41,854
- Right.
- That's 12 hours.

706
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:42,989
She's gonna be exhausted.

707
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:44,190
I'm really worried.

708
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:45,625
You know,
I did my part of the job,

709
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:48,192
I just want to make sure
Brea can pull it through.

710
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:07,180
Welcome to
the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

711
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:10,216
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

712
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,586
Say hello to your judges.

713
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:16,088
Owner of optic nerve makeup
effects studio, Glenn Hetrick.

714
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:17,523
Hello.

715
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,892
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

716
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,594
Hi, everybody.

717
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,229
Creature designer and
director, Patrick Tatopoulos.

718
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,330
Hi, guys.

719
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:25,998
And joining our panel this week

720
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,001
is chart-topping hip-hop star,
Asher Roth.

721
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,770
- What's up, guys?
- Hi.

722
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,705
So this week,
your spotlight challenge

723
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:34,473
was to work in teams

724
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,844
and create a piece of artwork
worthy of an album cover,

725
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,813
but you also had to
incorporate two nude models.

726
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,114
One blended
into the background,

727
00:29:42,182 --> 00:29:44,317
and the other one
as a character.

728
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:45,751
Now as everyone knows,

729
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,954
there was an issue
with Brea's model yesterday.

730
00:29:48,021 --> 00:29:50,923
Brea, the judges have been
made aware of what happened.

731
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:54,627
With that said, let's see what
you all came up with.

732
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,730
First up,
Tara and Jerry's creation.

733
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:09,208
When I see my picture blown up,

734
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:10,910
I could see
straight through the paint.

735
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,178
The airbrush
was not heavy enough.

736
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,570
My biggest concern
is the judges

737
00:30:37,638 --> 00:30:40,806
won't get the abstract concept
that I'm going for.

738
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:54,387
It's not the best,
most elaborate concept,

739
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:56,222
and that might kill us.

740
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,124
Is it what they're looking for?
I don't know.

741
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:01,327
I'm really not sure
where we stand,

742
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:03,429
so I'm kinda scared
at this point.

743
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,879
I'm a little nervous
that the judges are gonna think,

744
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:21,948
"these girls went
way too kooky."

745
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:24,984
So we could definitely
be on the bottom.

746
00:31:37,664 --> 00:31:41,534
When our photo comes up,
I am wowed.

747
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:44,337
I'm like,
"yes, that looks beautiful."

748
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,974
My model totally pops out
of the whole photograph.

749
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:05,257
At this point, I'm just,
"hey, what will be will be."

750
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,393
I tried my best.

751
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:08,995
I don't even know
what to expect at this point.

752
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,538
So, Asher, how do you think
they turned out overall?

753
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,841
I think there's some
really, really amazing stuff.

754
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,243
Some people
really took chances,

755
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,911
and others played it
a little bit more safe.

756
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:27,079
All right, everybody.

757
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:29,315
The judges
have scored your art,

758
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:31,083
so let's find out
what they thought.

759
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,285
RJ and Athena,

760
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:35,554
Sue and Heather,

761
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,656
congratulations, you are safe.

762
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,859
You can head back
to the makeup room.

763
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:48,968
The rest of you were the best
and the worst of this week.

764
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:50,736
So the judges would like
to speak with each of you

765
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:52,338
to learn more about your work.

766
00:32:52,406 --> 00:32:55,808
Tara and Jerry, if you would
please step forward.

767
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,743
The colors are completely off.

768
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,912
To the eye it was perfect,

769
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,648
but in the photo
it looks absolutely awful.

770
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:05,518
I really don't want to be
at the bottom again.

771
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,207
I have no idea.

772
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:15,409
Maybe it is okay,
maybe it's not. I don't know.

773
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:16,744
I see all the problems with it.

774
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,946
I'm freaking out inside.

775
00:33:19,014 --> 00:33:22,750
To start, could you tell me
a little bit about the concept

776
00:33:22,817 --> 00:33:24,418
that you were
working with here?

777
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:26,053
We had this black and white
background,

778
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:28,989
and originally, you know, it was
Jerry's idea to do a tagger.

779
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:31,959
We decided to make her part of
this black and white world,

780
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:34,562
and since he mentioned orange
is the color of inspiration,

781
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:36,830
it's the orange paint that's
giving her life in her hand,

782
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:39,967
but fades away into her
little black and white world.

783
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:42,836
That said, I think that
the blend is the more successful

784
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:46,941
of the two, but I really don't
understand what's going on.

785
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,210
The body-painting that you did
here on the model,

786
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,879
in my opinion,
isn't good enough

787
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,981
for a face-painting booth
at a county fair.

788
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,950
It just completely fails.

789
00:33:56,017 --> 00:34:00,020
The shadows and the highlights
don't work at all.

790
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,990
The character
this particular photograph

791
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:05,125
in black and white was
a really poor decision.

792
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:06,360
- You know?
- Yeah.

793
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:07,928
The whole thing about
black and white,

794
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:11,832
if you don't have a contrast
with it, then it's pointless.

795
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,300
Feels careful.

796
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:15,903
Nobody tags like that.
That's not happening at all.

797
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,438
Um, but, yeah,

798
00:34:17,505 --> 00:34:19,873
it just feels like you guys put
these unnecessary restrictions

799
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:21,675
on yourself
when doing this piece.

800
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:23,978
Jerry, Tara, please step back.

801
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,255
Rayce and Beki, you're next.

802
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,828
Judges, as a reminder,
Beki has immunity this week.

803
00:34:40,895 --> 00:34:43,264
Ve, let's start with you.

804
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,767
You told me your concept.
Can you revisit that for me?

805
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,236
Instead of taking, like,
the literal approach

806
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,005
and try to fit something
into that picture,

807
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:52,806
we took
the emotional value of it.

808
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:54,475
So we said, "that's a dark,
ominous background,

809
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:55,909
"we want to make our characters

810
00:34:55,977 --> 00:34:58,012
have some kind of
opposite reaction."

811
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,381
We wanted her to be, like,
she's ripping away,

812
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,716
and she's actually
trying to pull him

813
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,085
out of the ominous environment.

814
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:07,254
So that's why his hand's
starting to shake and crumble

815
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,923
and turn that white color.

816
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,292
I really like your concept,

817
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,561
and I think you've pretty much
effectively created

818
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:16,230
the look
that you were trying to achieve.

819
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:18,499
And I do like her paint job.

820
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:20,100
Taking that all
into consideration,

821
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:21,835
I think it's
a very effective image.

822
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:24,204
One of the great quality
of this image for me

823
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,973
is the fact that you're using
different techniques.

824
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,242
You're using a lot of airbrush

825
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,110
and you're using the sponge,
I assume.

826
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:31,712
I went in a little bit
with the airbrush.

827
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,280
- A little bit.
- To give me some of that--

828
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,615
The blending technique.

829
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:35,916
But texturally,
they feel quite different,

830
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:37,351
and I feel that was--

831
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:39,119
One of the most appealing things
about this image for me

832
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:41,588
- is actually that.
- Thank you very much.

833
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:43,290
From just
a high-concept standpoint,

834
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,359
it's tempting, it's alluring.

835
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:47,227
I like it a lot, I think
it's really, really cool.

836
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,696
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

837
00:35:48,763 --> 00:35:51,031
All right, Rayce, Beki,
can you please step back?

838
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:56,937
Ian and Miranda,
please step forward.

839
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:04,478
Did you guys have a concept
for this piece?

840
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:06,714
I live in New York, so, uh,
I see a lot of girls skating,

841
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:08,482
and it's usually hip-hop
they listen to,

842
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,651
and we also wanted them
to interact as well.

843
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:12,453
That's why we made
his hand the cup,

844
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,488
and she's skating
towards the cup

845
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:15,889
to try and grab it.

846
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:17,958
Maybe she was skating around
and got tired.

847
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:19,827
Overall, the concept was very
difficult to come up with.

848
00:36:19,894 --> 00:36:22,363
Well, whatever time you spent
on conceptualizing it

849
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,466
was an utter waste of time.

850
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,236
Your character on the left
is actually holding the cup,

851
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:31,872
yet we're trying to make him
blend with the background.

852
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,575
Either you choose to make him
a part of the cup language

853
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:36,343
or you just make him disappear.

854
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:37,644
It's a little confusing to me.

855
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:40,981
- Since I never
body-painted before ever,

856
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:42,683
it was--
It was difficult for me

857
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:45,386
to figure out how to attack it.

858
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,621
Ultimately, the thing
I dislike about it the most

859
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,089
is the lack of passion.

860
00:36:49,157 --> 00:36:50,958
You didn't pick
because you thought

861
00:36:51,025 --> 00:36:52,960
you had a strong concept
to work with.

862
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:54,528
You picked because
you thought it might be

863
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:57,364
the easiest thing to
integrate body-painting with.

864
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:59,733
You aimed
for perfectly adequate

865
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,403
and didn't even get there.

866
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,140
Miranda and Ian,
if you'd please step back.

867
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,276
Matt and Brea.

868
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:18,018
So which one did what?
Tell me.

869
00:37:18,086 --> 00:37:19,019
I did the basketball player

870
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:20,020
and he did the background,

871
00:37:20,088 --> 00:37:21,088
blending it in.

872
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,923
We constructed a stencil

873
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,391
with the outline of a shoe,

874
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:26,593
and just airbrushed
the, uh, white shoes

875
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,729
to start for a base,
and went in and detailed

876
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:31,131
all the fine details
on the shoes.

877
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,633
It's actually,
uh, quite remarkable.

878
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,268
Uh, the whole--
The whole piece is.

879
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,136
- Thank you.
- Very, very impressive.

880
00:37:36,204 --> 00:37:39,239
Matt, you're the man, dude,
seriously.

881
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:40,507
Job well done.

882
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:43,177
Uh, working with
what you were given,

883
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,679
uh, this is very, very conducive
with the hip-hop culture

884
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:47,981
and with shoes and athletics,

885
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:50,284
and using the butt
for the basketball

886
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,618
that's just-- It's funny.

887
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,619
It's got a sense of humor and

888
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,188
it-- it grasps your attention.

889
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:55,389
So job well done.

890
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:57,624
I really, really,
really like it.

891
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,493
The shoe integration
is just insane.

892
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:02,229
I still-- I'm staring at it
for how long now,

893
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:04,531
and I still don't know
exactly where the edges are.

894
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,066
That's impressive.

895
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:08,268
You know, my only criticism,

896
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:10,337
I think, of this,
is the fact that

897
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:12,606
the lettering is just
a little bit dodgy.

898
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:15,709
You probably could have cut out
a stencil of some sort.

899
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:17,578
But everything else,
I think you guys both did

900
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:19,012
a pretty great job on it.

901
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,980
Well done.

902
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,448
Okay, Matt and Brea,

903
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:23,217
will you please step back?

904
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:26,153
The judges have heard
what you've had to say,

905
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,055
so if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

906
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,890
while they make
their final decision.

907
00:38:34,696 --> 00:38:36,530
Okay, judges,
so let's start with

908
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:37,498
some of the looks
you liked the most.

909
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,966
Beki and Rayce.

910
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:41,835
Conceptually, it was
a really, really amazing piece.

911
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,371
You know, they took a chance and
I think they really exceeded.

912
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:47,574
Technically, it was
really beautifully executed.

913
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:50,010
The only thing is,
part of the job was to create

914
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,645
a great integration
to a background,

915
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:53,881
and I don't think
Beki succeeded at that.

916
00:38:53,948 --> 00:38:56,717
Okay, so let's move on
to Brea and Matt.

917
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:59,786
I think Matt did an amazing job

918
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:02,289
with his blend of the tennis
shoes was just phenomenal.

919
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,791
You know, even Brea,
she had a huge setback.

920
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,894
- Absolutely.
- She worked 12 hours yesterday.

921
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:08,462
- Right.
- To do that.

922
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,664
That's a lot of painting
to expect somebody to do.

923
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:13,700
Okay, so let's talk about
some of the bottom looks then.

924
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,035
Jerry and Tara.

925
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,737
It's very lopsided

926
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,805
in terms of whose fault it is.

927
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,307
Such a squandered opportunity

928
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,842
to do something so amazing

929
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,677
and really incorporate it
into the hip-hop world,

930
00:39:23,745 --> 00:39:25,512
especially when
the taggers are the idea.

931
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,980
It turns out to be
quite a boring

932
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:29,249
and very uneventful image.

933
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:31,084
Okay, what do you think
about Ian and Miranda?

934
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:35,289
I think Ian an Miranda just
totally blew it on this deal.

935
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:38,292
You know, the blend for me,
uh, didn't really cut it.

936
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:39,560
If you're not
going to bring it,

937
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,528
if you're not gonna
take on every challenge

938
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:42,696
as hard as you can,

939
00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:44,698
then why are you here?

940
00:39:44,766 --> 00:39:45,732
Very forgettable.
It's forgettable.

941
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,334
- Yeah.
- All right then.

942
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:48,735
Judges, have you
made your decisions?

943
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,770
- Yeah.
- I think so.

944
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:51,204
- Believe so.
- All right.

945
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,573
Let's bring 'em back out.

946
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:03,884
Okay, Asher, why don't you
tell us about the top teams?

947
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:10,591
The top teams...
Rayce and Beki.

948
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,426
I loved it...

949
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,928
Conceptually, technically,
job well done.

950
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,264
Thank you.

951
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,299
And Brea and Matt.

952
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:23,103
Overall, everything just tied in
and blended together very well.

953
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,005
Mission accomplished
all the way around.

954
00:40:25,073 --> 00:40:28,175
Thank you.
Which team came out on top?

955
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:31,612
The top, top, top team is...

956
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:39,260
Okay, then which team
came out on top?

957
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:42,697
The top, top, top team is...

958
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:50,571
Brea and Matt.

959
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,174
Yay, high five!

960
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,842
Thank you.

961
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,544
Thank you very much.

962
00:40:56,612 --> 00:40:58,212
Congratulations, Brea and Matt.

963
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,249
But, as you know,
we can have only one winner.

964
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:02,884
So, who will that be?

965
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:06,721
Every single artist
ran away from those shoes.

966
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:08,990
Matt, you killed it, man.
Congratulations.

967
00:41:09,057 --> 00:41:10,925
You got it.
Yay.

968
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,629
I'm feeling really great.

969
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:16,063
And I'm so excited to hear

970
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:18,266
that they love what I created.

971
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,167
I'm so thrilled
about that piece

972
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:22,303
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna figure out

973
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:24,171
how to get so many people
to see that piece,

974
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,439
because it's really cool.

975
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:27,675
I'm excited about it.
It's great.

976
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:29,477
- Congratulations, Matt.
- Thank you.

977
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:31,045
You and Brea can head
back to the makeup room.

978
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,747
Thank you.

979
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:35,850
Beki, Rayce, you are also safe.

980
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:37,652
Please head back
to the makeup room.

981
00:41:40,722 --> 00:41:42,823
Unfortunately,
that means that you were

982
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:43,925
our bottom looks this week.

983
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,531
If you would please
all step forward.

984
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:56,804
Glenn.

985
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:58,973
Jerry and Tara,

986
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,675
your poor technique
and lack of color

987
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,777
resulted in
an incoherent image.

988
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:05,880
And, Ian and Miranda,

989
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:08,282
we felt you had an
unacceptable lack of passion

990
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,917
and an absence of direction.

991
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,386
So then, who is
going home tonight?

992
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:16,223
The person going home
tonight is...

993
00:42:20,262 --> 00:42:23,230
Miranda.

994
00:42:23,298 --> 00:42:26,434
I just feel that you
are not yet prepared

995
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,510
to meet this level
of challenge.

996
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:33,535
I really, really appreciate the opportunity,
it's been a great learning experience

997
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,360
- Good luck.
- Miranda I am so sorry

998
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:37,745
that you happen eliminated.

999
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:39,280
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

1000
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,281
and pack up your kit.

1001
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:50,524
I'm going home.

1002
00:42:50,592 --> 00:42:51,692
Aww.

1003
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,461
I'm frustrated that I didn't

1004
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,529
showcase what I'm capable of.

1005
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:57,465
I'm gonna miss
all these people here.

1006
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:01,636
We've formed some
really strong friendships.

1007
00:43:01,703 --> 00:43:04,238
It's been awesome
to be able to come here

1008
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:07,041
and just be given
this opportunity.
