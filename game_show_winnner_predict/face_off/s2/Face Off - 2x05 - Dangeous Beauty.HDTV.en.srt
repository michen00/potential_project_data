00:00:00,325 --> 00:00:01,992
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,094
The artists were
asked to create

3
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:05,129
an original horror villain.

4
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:07,665
Don't do that!

5
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:08,999
Ian claimed victory,

6
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,668
but Brea's villain
failed to impress,

7
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:12,636
and she was sent home.

8
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:14,372
Now ten artists remain.

9
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,873
And tonight...

10
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:18,175
The artists face their
most dangerous challenge yet.

11
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,011
Oh, my gosh.

12
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,714
And tempers flare
like never before.

13
00:00:23,782 --> 00:00:25,149
It looks too clean.

14
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:26,350
That looks like [Bleep].

15
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:29,053
I'm filled right now
with revenge.

16
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,322
Leading to a dramatic
showdown onstage.

17
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,157
That's really [Bleep]
that you're throwing her

18
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:34,425
under the bus.

19
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,160
Like all of that was just
working for me.

20
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:38,195
I'm going to be brief:
Shameful.

21
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:41,232
It's one of the best
I've ever seen.

22
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:43,401
And to make it to the top,
they'll have to impress

23
00:00:43,468 --> 00:00:45,703
our award-winning
panel of judges.

24
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,339
Ve Neill, three-time
Oscar-winning makeup artist

25
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:49,940

26

and <i>The Amazing Spiderman.</i>

27
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,145
Patrick Tatopoulos,

28

and custom designer
for Lady Gaga.

33
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,293
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic

34
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,264
and earn $25,000 in makeup
supplies from Alcone,

35
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:16,801
the reinvented 2012
Toyota Camry hybrid,

36
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,403
and $100,000?

37
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:22,640
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

39
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:13,257
Brea's gone, and I'm so upset.

40
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,759
She's my best friend
at the house.

41
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:17,694
I love her.

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,901
Makes it real.

45
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:25,602
Now I feel very lonely.

46
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,938
As long as I'm here, I'm
always gonna be here for you.

47
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,840
It was always us against them,

48
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:31,308
and now it's just me and Matt.

49
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,379
Just say that you wanna
win the next one.

50
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,780
I wanna win the next one.

51
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,916
Victory would mean a lot to me,

52
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:40,784
and my dad as well.

53
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:43,153
'Cause before he passed away,
he always used to tell me,

54
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,088
"I'm gonna get you back
to California someday."

55
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,356
And I think that my being here

56
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:48,258
is him keeping his promise.

57
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:51,094
My dad's been pulling strings
since this whole thing started.

58
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:53,297
Right, talking to God.

59
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:55,098
Him and God have coffee
every morning.

60
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,633
"Let's talk about my son RJ.

61
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,236
He's a good boy,
a good boy!"

62
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,537
You have him down.

63
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,106
Are you sure
you didn't know him?

64
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:09,112
We're walking through
this very dense woods,

65
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,215
and it feels like huge forests.

66
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,550
It's a big, intense atmosphere.

67
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:16,253
We see a bunch of wild animals.

68
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,455
It's creepy and woodsy,
and we're looking around like,

69
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:20,090
"what the heck
are we gonna do?"

70
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,625
Hey, guys.
Good morning.

71
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,795
Please welcome our
guest judge, Sam Huntington.

72
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:28,098
He's currently starring
as the werewolf character, Josh,

73
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,468
on SyFy's smash hit series
<i>Being Human.</i>

74
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:32,703
Hi, guys.

75
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,005
Oh, my God,
it's Sam Huntington.

76
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:36,440
We're in the woods,
and he plays a werewolf.

77
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,542
There has to be
something up here.

78
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,279
Sam has worn a tremendous amount
of special effects makeups

79
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,947
and also has
a very unique perspective

80
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,549
on today's
foundation challenge,

81
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:49,253
which is to create
an original trauma makeup--

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,389
Wounds that would have been
inflicted by a werewolf.

83
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,360
In your opinion,
what do you think it takes

84
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:57,861
to make a great trauma makeup?

85
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:58,896
Well, there's a lot.

86
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:00,564
Realism of placement,

87
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,799
where on the body
the werewolf would attack?

88
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,368
How old the wound is,

89
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:07,137
timeframe,
how long ago did it happen?

90
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,072
Maybe it's started to heal.

91
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,274
If that's the case,
maybe the person is starting

92
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:12,109
to transform themselves.

93
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:13,877
There's been a million
werewolf movies,

94
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,846
so a different approach
is what I'm looking for.

95
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:17,648
- Thank you, Sam.
- Yeah.

96
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,784
All right, guys, you got
90 minutes for this challenge.

97
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:22,319
Your models
and your workstations

98
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,187
have been randomly
assigned to you.

99
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:26,323
The winner of this challenge
will receive immunity

100
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,026
and cannot be eliminated
this week.

101
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:32,029
Good luck,
because your time starts now.

102
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:34,331
Now!
Go! Go!

103
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,100
Run! No, I'm sorry.
I get excited.

104
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,102
- Gonna get me some cuts.
- Excuse me.

105
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,470
So we all run to the table,

106
00:04:40,538 --> 00:04:42,072
and we see a bunch
of foam appliances,

107
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,775
and so I immediately
grab three of them.

108
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:46,443
How open to getting
disgusting are you?

109
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,278
Whatever you want.

110
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:50,347
I see some tubing
and some syringes,

111
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,049
and I thought,
oh, this is awesome.

112
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,984
We're gonna do
a blood tube gag.

113
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:55,919
I love the foundation
challenges.

114
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,754
Being fast is one of my assets.

115
00:04:57,822 --> 00:04:59,423
I've worked on some projects

116
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,658
where we had to do traumas
really fast.

117
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:06,997
Are you ready to be bitten
by the werewolf?

118
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:09,466
I'm doing a lot
of 3rd degreeing,

119
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,335
which is the skin-safe
silicone.

120
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:14,871
And then I'm going to use
some vinyl gloves

121
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,206
to dangle some skin down.

122
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,474
- Can you take your shirt off?
- Sure.

123
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,409
Yay.

124
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:23,046
Creating wounds is a fundamental
aspect of special effects.

125
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,349
You have to know
the underlying anatomy

126
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,451
if you're gonna create
huge tears.

127
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:35,225
All right, guys,
you have an hour left.

128
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,693
Pulling back the lip

129
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,264
is something that no one else
is gonna do.

130
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:42,833
I liked Sam Huntington's
suggestion

131
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,668
about transitioning
into a werewolf.

132
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:48,238
So I'm gonna go with hair
spreading out from his wound.

133
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,473
30 minutes.

134
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:56,013
First I put down the tubing

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,514
and make it stick out
a little bit

136
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:59,516
so it looks like a severed
jugular vein.

137
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,951
Then I have this idea, okay,

138
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,386
I'm gonna make an eyeball
hang out of her face.

139
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:03,820
And that's what
I wanted to see.

140
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,288
Werewolf snack.

141
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:06,623
Argh!

142
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:10,193
All right, 15 minutes left.

143
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:12,429
I'm doing a werewolf
that he's been bitten

144
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,830
or he's fighting,

145
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,799
and as he's still trying
to fight for his life

146
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:18,568
he's starting
to change already.

147
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:26,543
We're running out of time.
We only have one minute.

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,715
Lift your arms up.

149
00:06:31,783 --> 00:06:33,250
Beki's model is bloody.

150
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:34,918
She's gonna need
several showers.

151
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,923
Time is up, everybody.
Stop your work.

152
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,726
Sam and I are going to see
how you did.

153
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:44,394
- Hi, Tara.
- Hi, Sam.

154
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:45,896
Tell us about
your werewolf attack.

155
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:47,264
He was putting up a good fight.

156
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,499
First he got hit,
and then he starts turning,

157
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,101
he starts healing up.

158
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,135
- And you hand-laid the hair.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,337
It looks very nice.

160
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:55,772
What we've got going on
is a laceration

161
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,340
across the throat,

162
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:58,708
and then on the right side
we've got a claw mark

163
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:00,610
across the eyes.

164
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:02,012
I love that it's over her eye.

165
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,480
The only critique I would have

166
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,449
is there's no hint of her eye
underneath there.

167
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:06,750
Exactly, that's what--

168
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:08,151
It looks like she never
had an eye.

169
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,520
I like that you made his ear
pointy with the hair.

170
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,090
Yeah, there weren't
any ears, so...

171
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,458
Yeah, and I like
the transformation.

172
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:15,792
It's all focused
around the wound too.

173
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,960
That's neat.

174
00:07:17,028 --> 00:07:18,395
So if I was the werewolf, argh!

175
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:20,297
- Nice!
- Grabbed her.

176
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,398
Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

177
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:22,599
It's pretty awful.

178
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,969
Oh, man, she definitely gross.

179
00:07:26,037 --> 00:07:27,370
I really like
that you incorporated

180
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:29,206
the bite mark in there,
and it's really successful.

181
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:30,240
It looks really great.

182
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:31,308
Thank you, thank you.

183
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,609
This is lunch.

184
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:33,977
She's not even gonna turn
into a werewolf.

185
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:35,445
She's just a snack.

186
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:36,813
And I put these little guys
in the back.

187
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,381
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

188
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:40,183
I'm no doctor,
but I can tell you right now

189
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,551
that's gonna be
an issue for you.

190
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,053
Yes.

191
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:45,689
People don't realize
how much actors know

192
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,125
about the special effects
industry.

193
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,427
Sam is constantly
in makeup all the time,

194
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:53,864
and he's surrounded by this,
so he's an expert.

195
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,265
So that is a completely
original prosthetic right there,

196
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,567
this piece right here?
Yes.

197
00:07:57,635 --> 00:07:58,468
Gross.

198
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,781
All right, Sam,
so what did you think?

199
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:13,850
I think you guys are amazing.

200
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,286
Doing what you did
in 90 minutes, mind-blowing.

201
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,155
Who do you think did the best?

202
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,357
Heather, very, very cool.

203
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:23,527
I loved how the transformation
that you had started

204
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:26,296
was localized around the wound
and how the depth changes

205
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,598
from the ear down to the chest.

206
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,333
Bravo.

207
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:31,868
I'm one of the top makeups,
so that's pretty exciting.

208
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:34,404
It's my first time to really get
called out for good things.

209
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,639
And, uh, and Beki.

210
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:37,707
Beki, of course.

211
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,442
It's always Beki.

212
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,578
Really cool.
The depth of all your wounds.

213
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,647
Really like the concept.
I loved your bite mark.

214
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:45,215
I thought it was
really, really cool.

215
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:47,250
And who is our winner?

216
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,318
The winner is...

217
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,523
Beki.

218
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:55,025
- Thank you very much.
- Beautiful job.

219
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:57,794
Yes, yes, it was tremendous.

220
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:00,163
I really, really enjoyed
all of it.

221
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:02,299
Going into the spotlight
challenge with immunity,

222
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,100
I'm gonna be here
for another week.

223
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,468
That's awesome.

224
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:07,170
Beki, congratulations.

225
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:09,406
You have won immunity this week

226
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:11,374
and cannot be eliminated.

227
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:13,276
All right, everybody,
I will meet you

228
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,912
back at the lab
for your spotlight challenge.

229
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:35,532
Oh, my gosh.

230
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,334
Everything's changed.

231
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,302
All our tables are moved,

232
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,204
and there's animals
and plants everywhere.

233
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,308
There's aquariums with lizards.

234
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,810
There's an owl.

235
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,179
There's a bunch
of really big wolves.

236
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:52,983
There's not a big barrier
between me and any of them.

237
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,318
At any point, they can just
rip our heads off.

238
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:01,091
There's a bear
and a guy with a gun.

239
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,795
Hey, guys.

240
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:08,064
As you can see,
we've made a few changes

241
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:09,899
to the lab this week.

242
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,568
You are now standing amongst
some of the most beautiful

243
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:15,205
plants and animals on earth.

244
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,573
But don't let that fool you,

245
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:19,376
because this is nature's
way of warning you,

246
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:21,578
of luring you into a trap.

247
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:25,882
Because all of these things
are extremely dangerous.

248
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,450
Some of these things
can even kill you.

249
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,221
That is this week's
spotlight challenge,

250
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:34,824
to create something
not only stunningly beautiful

251
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:38,161
but also extremely deadly.

252
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:40,597
You'll be working
in teams of two.

253
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,766
Each team will select
a plant and an animal

254
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,068
and use elements from them

255
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:47,671
to make your final
creature makeup.

256
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:50,340
Your teams have been
randomly selected,

257
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:51,708
and they are Heather and Rayce.

258
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,578
RJ and Ian.

259
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:57,614
Jerry and Matt.

260
00:10:57,682 --> 00:11:00,216
Athena and Tara.

261
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,553
And Beki and Sue.

262
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,656
My partner is Beki,
and I'm not thrilled at all,

263
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,591
because she thinks
too highly of herself

264
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:10,093
and she has immunity.

265
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:14,564
Now if you would please stand
next to your team members.

266
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,434
Obviously we're standing
amidst an incredible

267
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:20,603
array of animals,
but I do have one more for you.

268
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:23,907
Guys.

269
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,109
- Oh, my God.
- No way.

270
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,094
So today
is the spotlight challenge.

271
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:41,929
McKenzie's introducing
all these different

272
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,497
plants and animals.

273
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:44,732
They are some
of the most beautiful

274
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,234
and some of the most deadly.

275
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:50,638
And there's something moving
around behind this green wall.

276
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:52,106
Guys.

277
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,443
Oh, my God.

278
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:57,678
No way.

279
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:58,746
That is awesome.

280
00:11:58,813 --> 00:12:02,049
- Damn.
- Oh, my goodness.

281
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:03,884
I'll be damned if there's
not a rhinoceros in the shop.

282
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:06,153
Wow.

283
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:08,989
That is a southern white rhino.

284
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,225
- Holy crap.
- It looks like a dinosaur.

285
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:13,060
Its head is as large as me.
It's insane.

286
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:16,363
- Pretty amazing, huh?
- It's cool.

287
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:19,233
You will now select
a plant and an animal

288
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,701
and use elements from them

289
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,703
to make your final
creature makeup.

290
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:25,139
Heather, Rayce,
make your choice.

291
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:34,181
The water monitor's
right in front of us,

292
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:36,050
and we loved the wrinkles
in his skin and his pattern,

293
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:37,418
so don't even look
at the others.

294
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:40,254
All right.

295
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,089
Shoot.

296
00:12:44,326 --> 00:12:45,359
Yeah.

297
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,895
Slipper orchid I really like.

298
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:55,236
Look at the face.
Oh, my God, this is so neat.

299
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:58,739
Athena really likes
the bright colors of the snake.

300
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:00,574
Her paint jobs have been
so phenomenal

301
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:02,509
that if she has a plan,
I'm gonna go with it.

302
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:08,749
What do you say?

303
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,184
You afraid of it?

304
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:11,752
Uh...

305
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:15,155
What goes with that color?

306
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:16,690
Yellow iris.

307
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,025
That's what I was thinking.

308
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:21,762
Oh, wow.

309
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,830
This is pretty incredible.

310
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,632
I want to do the white rhino.

311
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:27,301
Sue thinks that
it might not translate,

312
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:29,403
and I've got immunity.

313
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,772
I should really let her do
what she wants to do.

314
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:40,381
And the bird of paradise,
right?

315
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:43,651
Let's do it.

316
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,085
All right,
so it looks like you have

317
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:46,954
everything that you need.

318
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:50,658
You will have half an hour to
look at your plants and animals

319
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,493
to draw inspiration
for your designs.

320
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,861
Good luck, everybody.

321
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,896
Your time starts now.

322
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,972
I'm letting Rayce
do the sketching.

323
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,573
I don't wanna sketch
next to him

324
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:08,375
- because that man's amazing.
- Good grief.

325
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:10,110
We have no appendages.

326
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:13,414
What will we do
with his arms and legs?

327
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,249
Do we wanna go for realistic

328
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:16,417
or do we wanna go for, like--

329
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:17,985
80% realistic,

330
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,820
20% theatrical.

331
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,355
It's gotta be subtle.

332
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:25,259
It can't be this overdone
Halloween [Bleep].

333
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:26,960
That's really cool.

334
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:30,731
I'm thinking, what if the
chameleon camouflages itself

335
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,133
as the orchid?

336
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:34,568
- It's up to here.
- Exactly.

337
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,270
Beki and I were sketching,

338
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:38,739
and I'm surprised
it's going so well.

339
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:41,542
We both want to have
a female tarantula

340
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,745
just to give that
beautifully dangerous aspect.

341
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,547
Yes, perfect.
Right on the same page.

342
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:52,519
Crazy.

343
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,455
At the end of the day,
I'm a little worried

344
00:14:54,522 --> 00:14:55,856
about our creature.

345
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,624
I feel like we have some ideas,

346
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:01,428
but it doesn't feel like
a complete picture.

347
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:02,896
Time's up, we gotta go, guy

348
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:06,700
so I'm hoping we'll still
be able to pull it out.

349
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:20,781
- We start
our 12-hour lab day,

350
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:23,317
which is all we've got
for this challenge.

351
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:26,253
What if we make it
a Mayan Aztec warrior?

352
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:30,824
My goals today are to sculpt,
mold, and cast in foam

353
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:32,426
the cat face.

354
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:37,698
For the sculpt, you take clay

355
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:40,401
and work on the stone positive
of the model.

356
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:42,636
Your sculpture is going to be

357
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:44,671
what your prosthetic
will end up looking like.

358
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:51,478
Our concept is 80% lizard
and 20% firestick.

359
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,946
I was gonna make some holes too

360
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:55,449
so we could, like,
put some stuff in front.

361
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:56,750
Oh, yeah, I agree.

362
00:15:56,818 --> 00:15:58,218
Rayce and I are working
really well together,

363
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,254
and we decide
that he will sculpt the face,

364
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:02,489
and I'll do the headpiece
and the tail.

365
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:06,126
I like the profile.

366
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:08,095
Yeah, I'm liking
the profile too.

367
00:16:08,163 --> 00:16:09,663
All right, you take over
on this sculpture.

368
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:11,465
I'm gonna work on the flowers.

369
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,866
The orchid has
those three leaves.

370
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,135
There's a big main leaf
and two leaves off to the side.

371
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:16,703
And then there's a couple
at the bottom.

372
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,705
So I go ahead
and I start fabricating

373
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,674
the back piece out of

374
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:22,176
vacuform plastic
and a heat gun.

375
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:24,845
And I'm making the shapes
of the petal as I go.

376
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,751
We come up with
what I consider to be

377
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:32,719
a great concept.

378
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:36,223
It's got this spider face
and an exoskeleton

379
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,525
and arms with these
petaled leaves.

380
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:42,896
Sue is very adamant about
just sculpting the face.

381
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:44,898
I just wanna make sure
that we have a costume

382
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:46,233
for our creature.

383
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:47,734
You think the petal
is not a good idea?

384
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:49,069
- Yeah, no.
- Okay.

385
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:50,404
I think it should be
a spike like,

386
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:51,939
psh, psh, psh, psh.

387
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:55,676
I'm getting apprehensive
about her direction style.

388
00:16:58,313 --> 00:17:00,113
One of the ideas
that I came up with

389
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:01,515
was to put petals on the back.

390
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,684
And if he, like,
curled up into a ball,

391
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:07,754
it would, like, spike out
from the curve of his back.

392
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:10,557
Hey, guys.

393
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,360
I'm here with ve to do
a little walkthrough today.

394
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,862
I'm always excited to see ve.

395
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,865
I'm very starstruck
when she comes in the room.

396
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:19,399
It's a chameleon, right?

397
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:22,703
So he's camouflaging himself
as the flower.

398
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,507
And it secretes, like, a poison
ivy kind of rash thing, yeah.

399
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:28,742
- Poison Ivy, I did her.
- Yeah, I know you did.

400
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:31,845
You have immunity, right?

401
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:32,946
That's true.

402
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:34,948
Are you worried about that?

403
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:40,320
Um, I believe that Beki
always puts 110%.

404
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:42,155
And what's his tail
gonna be made out of?

405
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:43,323
Foam latex.

406
00:17:43,391 --> 00:17:44,491
It's a big piece.

407
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,059
You guys are so bloody brave.

408
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,228
- I know.
- Wow.

409
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,796
Is this gonna be
something fabricated

410
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:51,331
- or is this gonna be--
- It's gonna be foam latex.

411
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:55,602
- It's gonna be foam.
- Yes.

412
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,571
Okay, let's talk
about Heather and Rayce.

413
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:59,239
She's got that big old
tail in there.

414
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:00,541
That freaks me out.

415
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,142
Why does that make you nervous?

416
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,777
'Cause it's a big mold,

417
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:05,746
especially to do out of foam.

418
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:07,414
But I think
with Tara and Athena,

419
00:18:07,482 --> 00:18:09,383
it might have looked really
cool to do the snake

420
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,784
in silicone.

421
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,419
Foam has a tendency
to give things

422
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:14,154
- a very matte look.
- Matte, dull.

423
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:16,290
And the silicone
would have given it

424
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,892
that creepy,
shiny effect, you know?

425
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,360
All right, Sue and Beki.

426
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:22,930
I think they have
some really cool ideas

427
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:25,432
as far as the design
of it goes.

428
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,367
As long as they remember
to incorporate the flower,

429
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:29,403
it should be really cool.

430
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,271
All right, well,
I cannot wait for tomorrow.

431
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,073
Me too.

432
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:38,111
Hey, Rayce.

433
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:56,163
I'm making pincers out of foam,

434
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,667
and I'm gonna make it
look textured.

435
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:05,205
But I look over and I see Beki
is already painting her suit,

436
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:06,840
so I realize
that we're diverging

437
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:09,543
off of different styles.

438
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:13,246
Are you gonna shave it?

439
00:19:13,314 --> 00:19:15,148
No, I'm not.

440
00:19:15,216 --> 00:19:18,752
What kind of texture
are you going for then?

441
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,588
Not that texture.
That looks like [Bleep].

442
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:24,324
I thought you were gonna
make those a lot smoother.

443
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,831
Hey, do you think that this
would look more real

444
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:32,265
or this would look more real?

445
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,934
I would say if you're
gonna go with this,

446
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:35,502
then your whole spider
needs to have that.

447
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,004
Right.

448
00:19:37,071 --> 00:19:40,007
Sue comes over and she
wants some advice from Rayce.

449
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:41,241
And I'm thinking,
maybe you should

450
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,809
go ask your partner
these things.

451
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,912
He said that this looks
a little bit too clean,

452
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,948
but maybe we can put
flocking on it.

453
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,516
To tie in her two elements,

454
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:54,187
she wants me to texturize
the entire exoskeleton

455
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:55,822
of this creature.

456
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,090
My opinion doesn't matter.

457
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:59,960
Sure, no problem.

458
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:01,328
I'm about to lose it.

459
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:05,165
I cannot handle that Sue
is so unaware

460
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,035
of how terrible
this is going to look.

461
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,702
That looks like [Bleep].

462
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,939
Beki is working on
a full-body creature suit,

463
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,408
but it looks too clean
and suity.

464
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:22,177
I'm sorry, what were
you discussing with Rayce?

465
00:20:22,244 --> 00:20:24,212
Oh, I was just asking him
what would look better.

466
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,082
So my opinion doesn't matter.

467
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:32,120
- Dude, I need your advice.
- Huh?

468
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:33,955
Beki's not cooperating.

469
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,523
I feel like she's slowing down.

470
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:37,659
I think you should just do
what you need to do

471
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:40,728
to get it done, even if you have
to downsize it a little bit.

472
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:42,096
Okay.

473
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:43,865
I think we are creating
a big pile of [Bleep].

474
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:49,804
When the sculpture is finished,

475
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:51,472
it's time to make the mold.

476
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,309
You do this by putting cement
on top of the sculpture.

477
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:55,743
Once it hardens,

478
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,445
you fill it with foam
or silicone,

479
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:00,481
which eventually becomes
the prosthetic.

480
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,689
My creature's flower petal
is painted from the back

481
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:11,292
so that the paint's
foggy matte finish

482
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,794
doesn't cloud the plastic,

483
00:21:12,861 --> 00:21:15,363
and then that way the inside
is still glossy and shiny

484
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:19,267
and looks very wet
and plant-like.

485
00:21:21,604 --> 00:21:23,104
I really want
to impress the judges.

486
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:25,907
So instead of just doing
regular body painting,

487
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:29,110
I'm going to make
every single scale

488
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:31,145
any apply them all on the body.

489
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:33,514
To cut all these and glue
all these individually,

490
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,416
you know, I think
they should go on in sheets,

491
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:36,484
not one by one.

492
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:38,086
It's gonna kill us.

493
00:21:38,153 --> 00:21:40,521
I know Athena gets
carried away in the lab,

494
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,524
she happens to regularly

495
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:45,526
put all this effort
into a project

496
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:46,928
that she doesn't end up using.

497
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:48,296
Like, I see where
you're going with it,

498
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,298
and I like it,

499
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:51,432
but I think it needs
to have, like,

500
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,435
a little bit of
the smoothness with it.

501
00:21:54,503 --> 00:21:58,339
I just wish that we were
on the same page.

502
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:00,942
After this, I mean, it's gonna
be cohesive anyway.

503
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,344
I hope that I didn't
offend you or anything.

504
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:05,280
Oh, my God,
she won't stop talking.

505
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:08,082
This one thing's not being
cooperative and I hope that--

506
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,417
I think I am being cooperative,

507
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,652
am I not?

508
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,053
I'm adding texture.

509
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,155
You went over and asked
somebody else their opinion.

510
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:15,356
That's not working with me.

511
00:22:15,424 --> 00:22:16,724
That's working
with somebody else.

512
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,027
I'm feeling like Sue
has misdirected me.

513
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:22,664
Sue wanted it to match

514
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:25,033
with the two little pincers
that she made.

515
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,768
I'm regretting the fact

516
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:29,003
that I allowed her to take
the alpha role

517
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:31,606
in this situation.

518
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:37,845
It's the end of the day.

519
00:22:37,913 --> 00:22:39,580
I look up and I'm like, ugh!

520
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:41,649
This could turn out horrible.

521
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:47,288
I know Ian isn't really
enthused about this,

522
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:49,590
but I have been the underdog
this entire time,

523
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,259
so I have to step it up
a notch.

524
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:54,329
If it doesn't work out,
send me packing.

525
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:55,797
One minute, everyone.
One minute.

526
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:03,071
That's time, everyone.

527
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:18,753
So it's application day.

528
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:21,089
We only have four hours
with our models

529
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:24,459
and one hour
of last looks onstage.

530
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:26,394
That come out okay?

531
00:23:26,462 --> 00:23:27,862
I'm a little worried
about Beki.

532
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,330
- It came out all right.
- Yeah.

533
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:32,700
Risking my staying
in this competition on her

534
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:33,901
is a little scary.

535
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,139
What's up, Ticia?
Whoo-Whoo.

536
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:44,078
Oh, ladies.

537
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:46,114
At least we got a tail.

538
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:49,317
I'm pretty nervous.
We have so much to do today.

539
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:50,918
Immediately I get started
on the application.

540
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:53,087
I do the bald cap,
I apply the face,

541
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,389
apply the head.

542
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:56,724
All this time, Rayce is
trimming up the tail,

543
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:57,892
painting the tail.

544
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,961
Going as fast as we can.

545
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:01,162
Do you want to pre-paint

546
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,029
while I'm putting
the bald cap on?

547
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:03,464
I could start, yeah.

548
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,433
I can throw a piece down
like nobody's business

549
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:06,434
in about 20 minutes.

550
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:08,403
So Ian took over the paint.

551
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,937
But I was getting concerned

552
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:14,342
because he was taking more
time than he should be.

553
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,811
Hour and 20 minutes.

554
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,780
The application
is taking way too long.

555
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:21,449
With the fully body to paint,
we need a lot of time.

556
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,819
Look way, way up.

557
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:27,555
We have the cowl piece
and the prosthetic piece

558
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:29,223
and palm pieces to apply.

559
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:31,993
But our model
seems very irritated.

560
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,428
She has really dry skin.

561
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:35,930
While applying the prostate
on under her eye,

562
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:38,933
she's twitching and
moving her body repeatedly.

563
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:41,369
It's really stressing
Jerry and myself out.

564
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:44,372
And we're just wondering
if we can get this done in time.

565
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,607
I have to go to the bathroom.

566
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:49,477
15 minutes, everyone.

567
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:58,920
I'm in this panic mode,
and I'm thinking,

568
00:24:58,987 --> 00:25:01,289
oh, my God, are we gonna
get done in time?

569
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:03,424
I'm franticly rolling
up these spines

570
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:04,959
while she's painting.

571
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:07,128
And I barely get them done,
and I'm like,

572
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:09,330
oh, God, I hope
these things stick.

573
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:11,666
What do you think
about this so far?

574
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,267
It's all right.

575
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:14,635
This is not going
to be a pretty thing

576
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:15,837
when it gets done.

577
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:18,706
I think her face
looks like blue mud.

578
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:20,908
I feel like I just made
like a Disney character spider

579
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:22,610
or some [Bleep].

580
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:23,878
Sue and Beki, theirs is--

581
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:26,581
It's just not looking good.

582
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:28,349
She spent, you know,
two hours pre-painting it,

583
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,784
and that's what it looks like.

584
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:32,553
- No.
- Yeah.

585
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:40,294
Beki's spent all day
in the spray room,

586
00:25:40,362 --> 00:25:42,897
and we still have to get
the entire body suit on

587
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:44,098
during last looks.

588
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:47,969
Time's up.
Gotta go.

589
00:25:48,036 --> 00:25:50,071
I honestly believe
Beki's sabotaging the project

590
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,806
'cause she has immunity.

591
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,646
Coming up...

592
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:02,049
- Please welcome Vivica A. Fox.
- Wow.

593
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:03,451
It's one of the best
I've ever seen.

594
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,353
It's got rubber barf
all over it.

595
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,855
I'm going to be brief.
Shameful.

596
00:26:13,877 --> 00:26:15,378
It's last looks,

597
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:16,746
or the last 60 minutes of doom

598
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:18,181
if I like to put it.

599
00:26:18,248 --> 00:26:19,582
This might be a little painful.

600
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,385
We are so far behind that
I don't even have time

601
00:26:22,453 --> 00:26:23,753
to breathe
in this next 60 minutes.

602
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,021
Are you gonna
cover it with leaves?

603
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,989
No, we only have
three more leaves,

604
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:28,991
so paint it up with as much
blue as possible.

605
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,296
I don't think we should do
this hard of lines.

606
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:34,564
What?

607
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:35,698
The one thing I'm worried about

608
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,066
is it can't be body paint.

609
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:38,401
It's beautiful,

610
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:41,170
but less body paint
and more real.

611
00:26:41,238 --> 00:26:43,172
Body painting is just
a different type of look.

612
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,941
It's a little less realistic,

613
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:47,810
but luckily the spines are
gonna make this look good.

614
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,148
His eyes are mean-looking.

615
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:54,183
You're ready for a spidey
mardi gras right now.

616
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:57,353
Everything looks like
it's coming together.

617
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:59,622
I looks good for how much
time we had.

618
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,924
It's a full--
Full-length makeup.

619
00:27:05,662 --> 00:27:07,029
These things are falling out.

620
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:10,366
Can't get the spines to stick.

621
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:14,804
Ian, Ian, Ian, come on.

622
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,307
Turn, turn, turn.

623
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,709
Well, guys, that's it.
Time's up!

624
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:33,523
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

625
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,491
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

626
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,760
Say hello to your judges.

627
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:40,763
Owner of Optic Nerve makeup
effects studio, Glenn Hetrick.

628
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,131
Good evening.

629
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,200
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

630
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,202
Hi, everybody.

631
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,471
And creature designer and
director, Patrick Tatopoulos.

632
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,906
Hi, guys.

633
00:27:49,973 --> 00:27:51,841
And our guest judge this week.

634
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:54,310
You know her from her
blockbuster films

635
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:56,779
<i>Independence Day,</i>
<i>Kill Bill Volume One,</i>

636
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:59,148
where she was the beautiful
but deadly assassin

637
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:01,250
Vernita Green, AKA Copperhead.

638
00:28:01,318 --> 00:28:03,219
Please welcome
Vivica A. Fox.

639
00:28:03,287 --> 00:28:04,987
Hi, guys.

640
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,891
Vivica A. Fox

641
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,694
is on our stage this week.

642
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,830
Vivica, thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

643
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:15,465
I'm very happy
to be here, McKenzie.

644
00:28:15,532 --> 00:28:17,266
And I've had the pleasure
of working with Ve

645
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:20,136
on <i>Batman & Robin</i>
where I played Ms. B. Haven.

646
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:21,637
Another beautiful
but deadly creature.

647
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:23,573
Absolutely, she was.

648
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,242
All right, guys, this week
your spotlight challenge

649
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,978
was to work in teams
and create a creature

650
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:31,747
that was not only
stunningly beautiful

651
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:33,182
but also deadly.

652
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,917
Let's see what
you came up with.

653
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:45,995
♪

654
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,809
Little guy comes out
and he sells this thing.

655
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:02,512
Turns out exactly the way
I conceptualized it.

656
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:03,913
It's beautiful and deadly.

657
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:05,047
And we're like, "yes."

658
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:29,472
I feel like he definitely
has a presence.

659
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,040
But I feel like
we missed an opportunity

660
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:33,175
to really take advantage
of the plant.

661
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:57,199
Our model is the only one
that has painting.

662
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:59,502
It's a complete look.

663
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,504
Compared to everybody else's,
who just decided to do

664
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:04,674
half a body and just put
some sheets on the bottom.

665
00:30:33,203 --> 00:30:36,706
I'm really happy
about our collaboration

666
00:30:36,773 --> 00:30:38,874
because it's
a very innovative design

667
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:43,012
and very cool to look at.

668
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:12,274
Our leopard woman is pretty.

669
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:13,909
Her character is the only one

670
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:15,745
that might be in a real movie.

671
00:31:15,812 --> 00:31:17,613
The rest of them
are Halloween costumes.

672
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:30,359
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look.

673
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,466
Why don't you go ahead
and open your arms up

674
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:39,201
so we can look at everything
and just keep them open.

675
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:46,275
Can you move your mouth
up a little bit, yeah?

676
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,443
Don't put
your fingers in there.

677
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:50,846
- That's right.
- Might miss one.

678
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:51,881
This is pretty tight.

679
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:52,915
For the time that they had,

680
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:54,316
that's a lot of detail.

681
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:56,052
We've had to really
cut a lot of corners,

682
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,787
so I'm really worried

683
00:31:57,854 --> 00:31:59,455
about what the judges
are gonna think.

684
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:01,457
The hair fascinates me
more than anything else.

685
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:03,592
I like the hair.

686
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,928
I was worried that this tail
wasn't gonna come out.

687
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:09,532
- It did.
- It came out good.

688
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,833
It's all stencils

689
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:12,435
and it repeated
over and over and over again.

690
00:32:12,502 --> 00:32:15,571
The judges walk up,
and it's just no smiles.

691
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:27,804
The judges walk up,
and it's just no smiles.

692
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:33,376
Oh, God.

693
00:32:33,444 --> 00:32:34,677
I feel awful.

694
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,546
And the paint job,
it's not popping.

695
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:39,682
We shouldn't have chosen
a snake.

696
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,051
I get this whole thing
that's going on right here.

697
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,156
Open and close your mouth.

698
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,560
Thanks for the cat noise.
It helps.

699
00:32:50,627 --> 00:32:52,428
It does help.

700
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,702
I don't know what to say.

701
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:05,241
The judges have scored
your creations

702
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:06,275
and would like to speak
with each of you

703
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:07,443
to learn more about your work.

704
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:10,246
Athena, Tara, you are up first.

705
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,887
Let's start with who did what.

706
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,021
I sculpted the face.

707
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:21,391
I did the chest, the shoulders,

708
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,959
the legs, and the back.

709
00:33:23,026 --> 00:33:25,828
I think you both know
that you're in some trouble

710
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,964
- here on this one.
- Yeah.

711
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:30,233
I've seen you sculpt better.

712
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,235
I've seen you paint better,
so I expected more.

713
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,270
The colors are one
of the biggest problems.

714
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:35,738
Very disharmonious.

715
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,573
We had talked about
putting pants on him

716
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,042
so that we didn't have
to cover so much body.

717
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,177
But now he looks like he
has underoos on, right?

718
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:42,612
This is comical.

719
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:44,680
Why in the heck didn't
you use silicone?

720
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:47,483
It would have given it that
slimy look to him, you know?

721
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:50,186
It's really flat.
It's nothing, you guys.

722
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:53,256
You totally blew it.

723
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,158
I'm gonna be honest with you,
I love the color.

724
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:56,893
But then when we got up close,

725
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,628
especially along the back,

726
00:33:58,695 --> 00:34:00,730
you guys could have used
a little bit more iridescence

727
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:01,898
to make it look wet.

728
00:34:01,965 --> 00:34:03,633
I wish we'd had more time.

729
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,967
Well, you don't.
It's a challenge.

730
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:07,270
Yep.

731
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:11,374
Athena, Tara, please step back.

732
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:13,409
Heather, Rayce,
please step forward.

733
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:22,885
This is another
good design from you, Rayce,

734
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:25,121
and I'm actually
very impressed with the mouth.

735
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,557
I think it's one of the best
reptilian mouths I've ever seen,

736
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:29,725
because this mouth does not
look human at all.

737
00:34:29,793 --> 00:34:30,927
It's stunning.

738
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:32,328
Thank you.

739
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:33,563
I wanna compliment you

740
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,131
on that rock star
hair style right there.

741
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,667
That is very modern.
Yes, rock on, babe.

742
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:40,169
However, my biggest complaint

743
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:42,004
is gonna be them toga pants.

744
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:43,506
You coulda figured out
some kinda way

745
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,308
to spray paint 'em,
to do something,

746
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,643
instead of them being
so bright white.

747
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,278
I know.

748
00:34:49,346 --> 00:34:52,315
Heather, Rayce, will you
please step back?

749
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,550
Matt and Jerry, you're next.

750
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,789
Tell me a little bit
about your concept.

751
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:02,592
Why did you decide to dress it
with floral elements

752
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:04,627
rather than integrating
the creature?

753
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:06,896
We didn't want to go mutant.

754
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:09,365
We thought beautiful, leopard.

755
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:11,501
It was different
from everybody else,

756
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,969
and it just felt right.

757
00:35:13,036 --> 00:35:15,204
I see what you've done,
but in the front

758
00:35:15,272 --> 00:35:16,672
it looks like someone
in a bathing suit.

759
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,775
And maybe not introducing
white on the face,

760
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:21,077
because it feels
a bit more cartoony

761
00:35:21,144 --> 00:35:23,246
because of that.

762
00:35:23,313 --> 00:35:24,747
I have to agree with Patrick

763
00:35:24,815 --> 00:35:27,583
that you guys missed on using
more of the yellow iris.

764
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,752
This thing that's going on
around the neck,

765
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,087
is this something
that you sculpted?

766
00:35:31,154 --> 00:35:32,989
It's supposed to be
an armor mantelpiece.

767
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:35,224
I get it,
but it seems like that time

768
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:36,392
would have been better spent
finding a way

769
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,793
to sculpt something

770
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:41,998
that had to do with
the plant and the animal, yeah?

771
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:45,635
Jerry, Matt, please step back.

772
00:35:45,702 --> 00:35:47,470
Sue and Beki, you are next.

773
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,111
I'm going to be brief.

774
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:57,013
Shameful.

775
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,781
I think you both know that.

776
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,383
The safety pylons on his arms

777
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,053
and big, giant floaty tubes
coming out of his back.

778
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,655
I really don't think
that could have won

779
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:07,657
a costume contest at
a third grade Halloween party.

780
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:11,060
It looks like it's got
rubber barf all over it.

781
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,563
At the last moment,
Sue suggested that we texturize

782
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,598
the entire piece.

783
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,133
What, you have a gorgeous
model under there.

784
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,701
Where's the beauty in this?

785
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:21,170
I'm so bummed out, 'cause
I was really expecting it

786
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:22,672
to be so cool.

787
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:25,508
Unfortunately, I did take
heavy direction from my partner.

788
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:27,877
That's really [Bleep]
that you're throwing her

789
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:29,845
under the bus 'cause you have
immunity this week.

790
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:32,682
Well, I disagreed with this,
so I have to defend the fact--

791
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,216
That is the least
of your worries.

792
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:40,489
All right, Beki, Sue,
step back.

793
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:43,559
I didn't work this hard
to be thrown under the bus

794
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:47,096
and be thrown out
this competition unfairly.

795
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:48,431
That's not right.

796
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:52,001
I want to win this competition
more than ever.

797
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:53,903
RJ, Ian, please step forward.

798
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,510
Could you guys start by
explaining who did what?

799
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:03,613
I sculpted and painted
the piece as well.

800
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,415
I did all the preform
with the heat gun

801
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:09,452
and the sculpted piece
over the forearms.

802
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,821
Overall, I really
was not thrilled

803
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,757
about anybody's work
in this challenge.

804
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:18,060
That said, I think that this
was extremely successful

805
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:22,064
in combining the plant
and the animal.

806
00:37:22,132 --> 00:37:24,867
The thing I like about it
the most is solid direction.

807
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:26,936
It came out arms together.

808
00:37:27,004 --> 00:37:29,271
You've got this flower shape
that then opens up

809
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,340
and reveals your animal's
head underneath it.

810
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:34,910
And it was very simple,
but oftentimes

811
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:37,046
things that work best on set
are exactly that,

812
00:37:37,114 --> 00:37:38,714
just clever and simple.

813
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:40,483
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

814
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,817
It's very reminiscent

815
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,819
of another one of those
Batman films I did

816
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,722
or poison ivy where she opens
up out of the orchid,

817
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,624
and I know that's what
you were going for.

818
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:50,326
And you did a great job.

819
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:52,028
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

820
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:54,463
The successful aspect
of this piece for me

821
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,298
is the fact that he doesn't
look like a human,

822
00:37:56,366 --> 00:37:59,268
and that is key for me.

823
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:00,670
If I was to play this
as a character,

824
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,204
I would love to open it up,
blow out some dust,

825
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:03,706
hittin' with them tentacles.

826
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:05,474
Like, all of that was
just working for me.

827
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:06,575
Thank you.

828
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:08,611
Ian, RJ, you can step back.

829
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,385
All right, the judges have
heard what you had to say.

830
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:17,820
Please head back
to the makeup room

831
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:19,088
while they make
their decisions.

832
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:26,062
Well, that was interesting.

833
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:29,665
Talk about being dangerous
and beautiful.

834
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,934
I'm filled right now
with revenge.

835
00:38:32,002 --> 00:38:34,103
Thanks for throwing me
under the bus there.

836
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:35,404
I don't think
I threw you under the bus.

837
00:38:35,472 --> 00:38:36,605
I think you gave me
such heavy direction,

838
00:38:36,673 --> 00:38:38,040
and I followed your direction.

839
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:44,847
Okay, so let's talk about
all of tonight's looks.

840
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:47,383
Why don't we start
with some of the better ones.

841
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,018
I did like RJ and Ian's.

842
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,020
That is absolutely this week,
for me,

843
00:38:51,088 --> 00:38:53,756
the only one
that if developed further

844
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:55,925
would have succeeded
as a character.

845
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,127
What I really like is when
you saw that piece unfolding

846
00:38:58,195 --> 00:38:59,562
there was not much
of a human left.

847
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:00,896
That was cool to me.

848
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,299
I also thought that
Heather and Rayce,

849
00:39:03,366 --> 00:39:05,134
I thought they did
a really good job

850
00:39:05,202 --> 00:39:07,236
with the rock star hairdo
that they did on top.

851
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,604
Yeah.

852
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:10,973
Okay, so let's move on
to some of the ones

853
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,476
that weren't quite
so successful tonight.

854
00:39:13,543 --> 00:39:14,777
Why don't we start
with Tara and Athena.

855
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:16,378
I don't know,
she's had a lot of chances

856
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:17,813
to show us her body painting,

857
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,315
and there's always
been an excuse

858
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:21,217
why it hasn't come off
the way she wanted it.

859
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:22,418
I don't get it.

860
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,919
They failed miserably.

861
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,788
I mean, I don't know how
they couldn't look around

862
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:27,857
and see how much
any of the other teams,

863
00:39:27,924 --> 00:39:30,126
they all at least did more.

864
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:31,627
All right, let's move on
to Sue and Beki.

865
00:39:31,695 --> 00:39:33,129
Your thoughts there?

866
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:34,563
That's a team that didn't seem
to work well together,

867
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:35,765
that's for sure.

868
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,366
She looked like
a mean old walrus.

869
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,101
I really can't understand

870
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,437
how anyone who wants
to be in this business

871
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:44,540
could have looked at that
and not done something.

872
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:46,242
Both teams were directionless.

873
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:48,277
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

874
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,012
Yeah.

875
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,715
