1
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:02,403
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,471 --> 00:00:03,804
The artists were asked to create

3
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:06,907
- a Tim Burton-inspired character.
- Yes.

4
00:00:06,975 --> 00:00:09,443
I feel like a crazy toy maker
right now.

5
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:12,880
- Rayce claimed the victory.
- Cool.

6
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:15,182
But Beki fell short
and was sent home.

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,351
Now five artists remain.

8
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,553
And tonight
they'll face a challenge

9
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,988
of Jurassic proportions.

10
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:22,990
Did not see that coming.

11
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:24,792
This is to get into the finals.

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,594
These stakes are so high,
everything has to be on target.

13
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:28,863
It's "Go big or go home,"
at this point.

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,331
This was like a kick
in the face.

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,266
I decided to tear off
the sculpt.

16
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:33,701
It sucks to be me.

17
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:35,670
Who will triumph
and earn a spot

18
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:38,639
- in the series finale?
- I'm going home on my birthday.

19
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:40,808
My God, it's fabulous.

20
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:42,777
I think you might have
overextended yourself.

21
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:46,147
I'm just shattered right now.

22
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:48,449
To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress

23
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,318
our award-winning panel
of judges.

24
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:52,887
Ve Neill-- Three-time
Oscar-winning makeup artist,

25
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:56,891

and <i>The Amazing Spiderman.</i>

26
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,659
Patrick Tatopoulos--

27
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:01,862
Production designer

28
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,665
and director of
<i>Underworld, Rise of the Lycans.</i>

29
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:06,233
And Glenn Hetrick--

31

and custom designer
for Lady Gaga.

32
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:14,255
Only <i>one</i> will win <i>Face Off.</i>

33
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:46,625

34
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:56,430
- Very quiet now.
- Too quiet.

35
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:59,066
I'm starting to realize
I do have a chance

36
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,168
of getting to the finale.
And I want to win.

37
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:02,369
'Cause I could really
use that money

38
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:03,970
to hopefully get out
of a lot of debt

39
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:05,405
and really start a life.

40
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,908
I was was very shocked
Beki got eliminated.

41
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:09,710
Wow, that was pretty crazy
last night, huh?

44
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:16,016
That means that they were
probably expecting me

45
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:18,351
to, like, utterly fail.

46
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,654
I want to make my fiance
proud of me.

47
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:21,922
That's my dream.

48
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,124
He's the one
who actually told me

49
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:26,093
"This is your one shot.
Just go ahead and do it."

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,994
I really want to take this one.

51
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,696
I believe it is anyone's game.

52
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:31,665
But winning this competition
would be awesome for me.

53
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,234
I would be able to expand
my makeup and effects business.

54
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:36,169
And I want to bring
that championship back

55
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:39,339
to Austin, Texas.

56
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,648
- Morning, everybody.
- Good morning.

57
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:51,418
Congratulations.
The five of you

58
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:53,653
are all within reach
of the season finale.

59
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:55,222
I'm so close, I can taste it.

60
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:58,024
But this isn't about me.

61
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,160
It's about providing
a better life for my family.

62
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:04,030
Now there's no question that
you are all extremely talented.

63
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:07,067
But we only have room
for three of you

64
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,870
- in the finale.
- We all just look at each other

65
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:11,772
and we're like,
"You got to be kidding me."

66
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:14,241
Did not see that coming.
Double elimination--

67
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:15,876
This was like a kick
in the face.

68
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:18,078
- Whoa.
- Rayce, you okay with that?

69
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,246
Shocked.

70
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:21,281
A little bit
of pressure now, huh?

71
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,484
Okay, so let's talk about
this week's spotlight challenge.

72
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:27,587
We're gonna do things
a little bit differently.

73
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:31,992
I'm sending you on a field trip
to a mystery location.

74
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:33,960
Oh, man.
Every time we had a field trip,

75
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:35,395
I didn't do too well.

76
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:38,165
So I don't really want
to go anywhere.

77
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:39,966
When you arrive,
I want you to head inside,

78
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,668
take a look around,

79
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,436
and choose an option
that is laid out for you.

80
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,971
After you make your choice,

81
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,207
I want you to spend
just a little time

82
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:50,177
taking photos,
working on your designs.

83
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:51,511
There's a van waiting
for you outside.

84
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,913
Good luck,

85
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,751
and I want you all
to think big.

86
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,020
We've already done
big, elaborate makeups.

87
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,388
How much bigger can we get?

88
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:06,760
We rode up in the van,
for our field trip,

89
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:08,795
and none of us know
where we're going.

90
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:10,096
I love surprises,

91
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:14,134
so I can't wait
to see where we're going.

92
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:16,136
We're at
the Natural History Museum!

93
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:19,973
That's my favorite museum
of all time.

94
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,041
Man, that's awesome.

95
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:22,943
It's dinosaurs.

96
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:26,847
I'm walking through
the hallways

97
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:28,348
of these huge, giant behemoths,

98
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,551
and those teeth
are, like, the size of my arm.

99
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,220
There's two things
that I started off drawing

100
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,688
when I was
five or six years old--

101
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:37,057
He-man was the main one,

102
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:38,892
and then dinosaurs
was the other.

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,861
I love dinosaurs.

104
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,765
"Your spotlight challenge
this week is"--

105
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,500
"To create a dinosaur-human hybrid."

106
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:49,536
"Judges want you to embrace
the scale and scope

107
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:50,937
of these creatures."

108
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,874
"Fabricated elements
are strongly encouraged."

109
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:58,044
It's so important
that you get the right dinosaur

110
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,913
that's going to be perfect
for you,

111
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:01,715
especially when the stakes
are so high.

112
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:04,484
Everything has to be on target.

113
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,786
I want to go triceratops,
but it's a lot of work.

114
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,955
That is a lot of work.
I chose the carnotaurus.

115
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:10,490
And I start sketching.

116
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:13,059
One of the most important parts
of any good makeup

117
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:14,995
is the design.
And my dinosaur

118
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,963
has these huge horns
that are just pointing outward

119
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:19,466
on top of his head.
So I want to keep

120
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,434
the massive scale
of the dinosaur

121
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:25,238
with the human aspect--
Like an ancient warrior.

122
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:27,440
Ooh, this guy's fuzzy.
I finally see

123
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:30,877
this brightly rainbow-colored,
little tiny dinosaur

124
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:32,212
that's really cute

125
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,115
with a cool, like,
black-and-white mohawk.

126
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:37,150
And it's so colorful.
And I'm colorful.

127
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:40,253
So let's make this
a dinosaur version of me--

128
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:42,656
Pop rock-inspired.

129
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:47,794
Let's have it
like a crazy hipster dinosaur.

130
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:49,963
I don't know
how we'd do something

131
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:51,464
that doesn't
already look like something

132
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:53,066
we've already done, though--
That's the thing.

133
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,634
The whole point of being here

134
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,136
is to challenge yourself
as an artist

135
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,570
and to try and do new things.

136
00:05:57,638 --> 00:06:00,307
Unfortunately, I've already done

137
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,809
two lizardy-looking
human-hybrid creatures.

138
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:04,477
This is going
to be very difficult.

139
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,983
I chose the corythosaurus.

140
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:11,518
It's just got
interesting shapes,

141
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:14,587
and I like the paint patterns
that are on there.

142
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:15,722
Think that I can do
a lot with it.

143
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,658
My concept is big lips,
top round head,

144
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,227
with a hump,
and the tail pokes straight out.

145
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:22,896
Almost a camel-like shape to it.

146
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:34,074
I end up going
to the velociraptor

147
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:36,509
and I see the feathers.
And I think,

148
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:40,080
"Well, that could be fun."

149
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:48,121
We head back to the lab
and we pick our models.

150
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,490
Everyone wants this so bad,
so it's very stressful

151
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:52,759
because the stakes are so high
and the talent's so intense.

152
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:56,696
Everyone's bringing
their "A" game.

153
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:59,299
We have five hours in the lab,

154
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,001
and I start
sculpting the features

155
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,769
where I had drawn them.

156
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:06,573
Your sculpture is going to be
what your prosthetic

157
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,376
is gonna end up looking like.

158
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:15,715
As soon as I start sculpting,

159
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:16,850
I'm trying to think
about a story line

160
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:17,851
to go along
with this character.

161
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,654
So velociraptor turns

162
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:24,691
into veloci-rapper.

163
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,494
Instead of being
a little bit fresh prince

164
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:31,931
and old-school,
he's a little bit more modern.

165
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:36,836
What's his story?

166
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,972
I'm pretty much doing
<i>Island Of Dr. Moreau.</i>

167
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,474
Just kind of creepy,
almost diseased,

168
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:44,177
with a humanoid type
paint scheme.

169
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:45,912
I'd try to find some kind
of a back story

170
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,515
- for him, you know.
- Why is that?

171
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,550
'Cause they might
bust your balls for it.

172
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:52,352
- Yeah.
- Think there's

173
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,921
always further thought
that has to go into things,

174
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:58,525
especially because this
is the most intense challenge.

175
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:01,694
I mean, this is to get
into the finals.

176
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,108
I'm noticing that the mood
is definitely different.

177
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:18,578
RJ is a very
happy-go-lucky guy.

178
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:22,248
But he's getting frustrated
with his design.

179
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:23,817
At the end of the day,

180
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:25,385
I'm legitimately starting
to get scared.

181
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:29,022
Everything that I'm sculpting
is starting to look

182
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,392
like the orchid chameleon.

183
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,560
I have to bring something new
to the table.

184
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:36,996
So I decide to tear off
the sculpt.

185
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,802
Now I have to completely start
all over again tomorrow.

186
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,038
Time's up.
That's it.

187
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:51,277
It sucks to be me.

188
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:52,245
Coming up...

189
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:56,382
I'm just shattered right now.

190
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,919
It would be devastating
to lose at this point.

191
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,287
I wish that you had pushed it
a little further.

192
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:03,189
What it is that you've
achieved here this week

193
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:06,659
is truly impressive.

194
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:15,455
Day two at the shop--
We have 12 hours.

195
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,391
We have to create
a human-dinosaur hybrid.

196
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,460
You're doing poly or foam?

197
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,761
Foam, yeah, foam.

198
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:24,197
There's a lot depending
on this day,

199
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:27,967
and I think that's going
for everyone.

200
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,503
Yesterday,
I had to scrap my sculpture.

201
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,639
Today, I have to bring a design

202
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,041
that is not reminiscent
of something

203
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,110
that I've already done.
So I have

204
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,313
to completely rework the idea
of this creature in my head.

205
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,520
Hey, guys.

206
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,423
I am here
with Cleve and Constance Hall--

207
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,059
the stars of SyFy's new show
<i>Monster Man.</i>

208
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,261
They're fabrication specialists.

209
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,629
They want to walk through

210
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,097
and help consult with you guys
on your designs.

211
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,832
I'm just looking
at them like, "wow."

212
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,834
They're expert fabricators,

213
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,637
and we're going to get great
feedback and advice from them.

214
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,939
So I'm really excited to hear
what they have to say.

215
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,309
- Ian.
- Wow, looks like you're doing

216
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,978
- my favorite dinosaur.
- Really? Triceratops?

217
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,513
- It's always been my favorite.
- Awesome.

218
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,481
Me too, actually.
The only fabricated pieces

219
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,717
are going to be his horns,

220
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,218
and I'm fabricating his tail
as well.

221
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,787
So what are you--how are you
gonna fabricate the horns?

222
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,255
I've got these.
I was--

223
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:23,690
Yeah, I was thinking

224
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,591
I could heat 'em up
a little bit and shape 'em

225
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,393
- and carve 'em and--
- Be careful, it melts fast.

226
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,329
Be careful,
that melts really easily.

227
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,364
Cleve and Constance
gave me some tips

228
00:10:31,432 --> 00:10:32,598
on how to make horns
and things of that sort,

229
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,567
which was very helpful.
Very nice meeting you.

230
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,868
Good luck.
Take care.

231
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,370
I'm fabricating the back
of the head

232
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:39,572
out of latex and polyfoam
so that those feathers

233
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,074
really have something
to really stick into.

234
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,242
And what are you using
to assemble it all?

235
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,611
- What type of glues?
- I was gonna use some barge.

236
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,947
Do you have trouble with
your barge sticking sometimes?

237
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:48,981
- Yeah, yeah.
- Tip for people

238
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,583
who use contact cements--

239
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,752
When you buy it,
turn your can upside down,

240
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,587
leave it there,
because the stuff separates.

241
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:55,888
- Cool.
- Shake the hell out of it.

242
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,357
Mix the stuff,
and it'll work a lot better.

243
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,826
Nice. Okay.
Cleve tells me

244
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,462
about using my barge,
which is this glue that I use.

245
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,397
He gives me this tip
about turning it upside down

246
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,199
and letting the chemicals
separate.

247
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,500
Good idea.

248
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,135
His armor is actually fossils.

249
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:10,703
Uh-huh. What are you making
the costume from?

250
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,372
I decided to go
with cotton fabric.

251
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,340
- For the armor?
- Armor--

252
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:15,775
We're gonna use,
actually, polyfoam.

253
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,510
And it's due when?

254
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,445
Um, by the end
of the day today.

255
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,814
- This seems a little nut-sy
by our standards

256
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,083
- for time lines.
- Yeah.

257
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,785
I've got, like,
a duct-tape buildup.

258
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:26,886
- And I wrap this--
- Batting.

259
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,454
Yeah, with batting.

260
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,989
It's got to have something
on there, though.

261
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,558
I asked constance
about the best way

262
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,594
- to texture this tail.
- I personally find it better

263
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,063
to cut it into small things
like around the scales--

264
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:39,165
- Piece it around.
- Oh, that's a good idea.

265
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,433
They're really smart.
They know a lot of stuff.

266
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,635
Well, I appreciate all the help.
That was great.

267
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,570
I kind of wish it was longer
and I could actually

268
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:45,905
just sit there
and pick their brains.

269
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,774
- Hey, Sue.
- Hello.

270
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,509
- Tell us what you got going on.
- Ta-da.

271
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,710
- Bringin' it out.
- Wow.

272
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,512
Okay, I love you already.

273
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,213
That's awesome.

274
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,648
Immediately,

275
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,384
constance loves
my dino-hipster girl.

276
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,685
It's going to have piercings,

277
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,120
- dinosaur piercings.
- Absolutely.

278
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,624
Constance is
a great fabricator and artist.

279
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,092
She gave me a confidence boost.

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,728
All right, guys,
it's looking good.

281
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,431
- Good luck.
- Thanks for coming by, guys.

282
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,969
Oh, my God,
we're so close to the finale.

283
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,006
Everyone's really stressed.
I feel exhausted,

284
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,341
but there's still so much to do.

285
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,178
I'm doing foam batting
and duct tape

286
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,113
for the hump and the huge tail.

287
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,614
- Check this out.
- Ha.

288
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:31,684
I am the least experienced
in the entire group.

289
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,786
I'm a tattoo artist from Idaho.

290
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,122
And I'm really starting
to feel the weight

291
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,891
of this competition.

292
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,793
I got the body done already,

293
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,695
but I still have the tail,
the face, and cowl.

294
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,931
On top of that,
I'm making a prop.

295
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,366
I have to make a skateboard.

296
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,938
I'm really feeling confident.

297
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,874
I'm feeling this challenge.
My concept's strong.

298
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,444
I'm working as fast as I can.
And I can taste, you know,

299
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,413
that 100 grand right there.

300
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,784
Hey, guys.

301
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,052
Boom. In comes Glenn.

302
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,054
I'm a little nervous
at this point.

303
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,456
If I can get a good review
out of Glenn,

304
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,592
if you can get Glenn to say,
"Hmm, that looks cool,"

305
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,960
or "Can't wait to see it,"

306
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,561
then I know I'm on
the right track.

307
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,796
Tell me about
what you're doing here.

308
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,798
I'm trying to do
something different

309
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:21,000
that you guys
haven't seen me do yet.

310
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,568
I'm kind of keeping
the mouth really tight.

311
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,905
Pushing the jawbone back
a little bit further,

312
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:30,042
so that the elongated head
doesn't seem out of place.

313
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,577
What is the rest
of the look then?

314
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,712
- So his wardrobe or--
- Oh, he's--

315
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,348
He's gonna be
a velociraptor-rapper.

316
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,183
- A veloci-rapper.
- Copy that.

317
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,118
- I like it.
- All right, well,

318
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,620
- look forward to seeing it.
- Let you get back.

319
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,121
- Appreciate it.
- Good luck.

320
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,423
He walks off and I'm like,
"hmm, shit."

321
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,427
I can't really change
my idea, at this point.

322
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,430
He's an ancient deity
of the reptilian race.

323
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,132
Oh, that's very cool.
Color-wise?

324
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,734
I'm going for a more...

325
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,270
Tan, flesh color
and possibly some orange.

326
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,438
This is probably
the most extensive effort

327
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,574
that you've made so far, right?
It's the most pieces.

328
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,943
It's "Go big or go home,"
at this point.

329
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,378
- Hey, Sue.
- Hello.

330
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,513
Hipster dino-girl, yeah.

331
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,881
It's "girl power."

332
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,017
"Girl power" dinosaur. Okay.

333
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,619
Even though Glenn's
rolling his eyes at my idea,

334
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,955
I'm not going to change it.
I mean, it's totally me.

335
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,857
As you can see,
I'm not sculpting scales.

336
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,792
He's gonna be more flesh-like.

337
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,128
But with the spot design--
is kind of what I'm thinking.

338
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,264
I'm gonna bring in colors
of the human flesh.

339
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,399
We've got to ask,
at this point--

340
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,134
So we've talked
to several of you guys.

341
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,368
And I don't know
if you're listening

342
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,070
to what all
your paint jobs are.

343
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,305
I think maybe
you should all pay attention

344
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,407
- to each other.
- The last thing we want

345
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,075
is everyone have their dinosaurs
up there

346
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,410
and they're all
the exact same color scheme.

347
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:40,680
So I'm not feeling good
about the visit.

348
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,048
So far,
what I have seen of your work--

349
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,418
You stick really close
to what your designs are.

350
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,821
This seems to be changing
a lot as you go.

351
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,856
So why are you changing so much
as you go?

352
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,359
I was worried about it
being too dinosaur-y.

353
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:55,227
And so I had to pull back
a little bit.

354
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,663
And so I actually took my sketch
and my design

355
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,966
and kind of sunk in more
into the face.

356
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,301
I feel, without Glenn
really saying anything,

357
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,437
that he wishes that
I had gone with the sketch.

358
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,339
So, at this point,

359
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:10,376
I'm really starting
to doubt myself.

360
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:12,244
So? Thoughts?

361
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,413
The double elimination,
I think, is taking its toll.

362
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,850
It's making them do more work
than they would normally do.

363
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,986
Okay, so let's start with RJ.

364
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,488
I'm concerned with the fact
that it's sort of playful.

365
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:24,490
I'm not sure that
that's going to work.

366
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,225
I could be wrong.
We might see this come out there

367
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,793
and it completely clicks.

368
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:29,996
Moving on, then, to Matt.

369
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,431
The sculpt is looking
really, really good.

370
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,700
So hopefully he's really
familiar

371
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,502
with some
of the sort of rough techniques

372
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,404
for painting wardrobe
which he can do--

373
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,939
Rubouts or dry brushing,

374
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,907
making it look cool the armor.

375
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,209
Really concentrate

376
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,543
- on coloring his makeup.
- The face.

377
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,612
All right, let's discuss Ian's.

378
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,250
The profile already
is way further along

379
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,453
than anyone else's.
So I think he's right on track.

380
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,422
- And seems to have a very...
- Sense of confidence.

381
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,590
Clear direction. Yeah.

382
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,592
Let's move on to Rayce.

383
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,160
- What are your thoughts there?
- Not the best work

384
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,828
that I've seen him do.

385
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,430
I think the pressure
is getting to him

386
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,232
and I think he's
second-guessing himself.

387
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,733
And he's scaling back
what it is that he's doing.

388
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,169
Your thoughts there
with the hipster dino-girl?

389
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,071
I love that she's trying
to do things

390
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,407
with the entire body--
That's great.

391
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,075
And I think
that was a wise decision.

392
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,177
Out of everyone,
she's the only one

393
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,613
that purposely picked something
for the color.

394
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:24,450
All right, thank you, Glenn.

395
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,257
I finally finished my cowl.

396
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,126
I'm gonna do
a large two-piece mold.

397
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,496
You do this by putting
a cement-like substance

398
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,931
on top of the sculpture.

399
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,499
Once it hardens,
you can clean out the clay

400
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,734
and fill it
with foam or silicone,

401
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:44,270
which eventually becomes
a prosthetic.

402
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,772
Now the big-ass moment.

403
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,811
So I'm looking around--

404
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:54,246
No one else is making a prop.
And I'm just thinking,

405
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,115
"How the hell am I going
to make a skateboard?"

406
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,118
So I take some lightweight foam

407
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,653
and I start carving it out
like a skateboard.

408
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:06,292
And it's coming together.

409
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,963
Nothing worked out the way
I wanted it to today.

410
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,032
I start to peel off
the latex tail,

411
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,737
and I notice that there's chunks
of uncured latex

412
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,606
in a lot of the trenches.

413
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:22,942
Big chunks were taken out.

414
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,677
Some of the latex is ripping,

415
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,812
so it doesn't lay
like it's supposed to.

416
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,081
And it looks
significantly different

417
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,616
than the head
that I've been sculpting.

418
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:34,720
Looks like ass, man.

419
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,256
It's a disaster.
It's just ugly, dude.

420
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:38,491
And there's no fast way

421
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,559
to fix all this
and make it look awesome.

422
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,895
I'm really down at this point.

423
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,029
I feel like I've failed,

424
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,498
and I could easily see myself

425
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,433
going home.

426
00:17:50,304 --> 00:17:53,206
I'm just shattered right now.

427
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:55,008
My tail looks like crap.

428
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,878
There's chunks of uncured latex
in a lot of the trenches.

429
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:00,813
It's ripping in some areas.

430
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,348
I don't know how
I could help that.

431
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,150
I'm not gonna sit there
and cut out pieces of foam

432
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,585
and put it back there.

433
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,253
I'm well into day two,

434
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,454
and I can't change
what I'm doing.

435
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,257
And I've just got
to make it work.

436
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:13,393
The ten hours are winding down,

437
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,695
and I've got the cowl molded.

438
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,297
I've got my prosthetic
already molded--

439
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:21,534
Chest piece, shoulder piece,
and my tail.

440
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,803
Okay, guys, time's up!
Brushes down.

441
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,072
I got everything knocked out

442
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,240
that I wanted to do
and accomplish.

443
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:28,941
It's just,
is it gonna be cohesive?

444
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,044
You never know.
It's always in your mind,

445
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,445
but it could be something
tally different

446
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:33,813
once you put it all together.

447
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,481
Oh, my back.

448
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,617
That was a beast.

449
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,160
We get home--
Everyone's really exhausted.

450
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,861
RJ's cooking dinner,

451
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:51,331
but I don't even feel
like eating at this point.

452
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:54,000
- Today was rough.
- I'm excited to see yours, RJ.

453
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,736
Glenn did not seem interested
in seeing it.

454
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,538
I really feel
like I'm going home,

455
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:03,176
because I'm making
a veloci-rapper.

456
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,111
It's just a play on the name.

457
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,348
Uh, veloci-rapper.
It's just...

458
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,384
Rapper-- Raptor,
you know?

459
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:13,152
- Oh, I see.
- Thought it would be a funny--

460
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,721
I have this horrible feeling
that all this comedy stuff

461
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:18,591
is not jiving with anybody.

462
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,760
Today when all my stuff
went to...

463
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,261
To crap, you know,

464
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,031
all my latex
gave me issues all day,

465
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:27,200
I got really depressed
and I started thinking

466
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,502
of my kids back home.

467
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,838
They're always the ones
that comfort me

468
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:34,507
when I'm having my down times,
you know.

469
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,376
I feel like I sucked all day.

470
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:39,645
And the only thing
that can stop this from sucking

471
00:19:39,713 --> 00:19:40,680
is to talk to my family,

472
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:43,383
and I can't talk to them either.

473
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,185
Tonight's the last night we're
all gonna be five in the house.

474
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,522
I mean, the pressure's on.
It's like, "Go big or go home."

475
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,391
Just try to pull out
all the stops.

476
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,025
We're so close
to the finals right now.

477
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,861
I can taste it,
I'm hungry for it.

478
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,262
I'll do everything in my power
to stay here.

479
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,797
I've really got to
pull something

480
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,932
out of my butt tomorrow
to stay safe.

481
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,908
Today's application day--

482
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:10,977
Our models
will be arriving soon.

483
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:15,982
This is undeniably
the most important day

484
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,750
since the entire contest
started.

485
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,252
Cape.

486
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,220
On top of everything else,

487
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:24,724
today is my birthday.
So today is gonna be

488
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,293
the best birthday ever
or the worst birthday ever.

489
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,765
We're doing
dinosaur-human hybrids.

490
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,134
So you're going
to be velociraptor-rapper.

491
00:20:35,202 --> 00:20:37,270
Work with me here on this.
Ready?

492
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:39,138
I made this elongated headpiece.

493
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,273
We have talons

494
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,443
and I made you
special dino-bling.

495
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,912
Today's always nervous--

496
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,580
You know what I mean?--
Application day.

497
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,149
Everything has got
to go perfect.

498
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,617
You're gonna be a triceratops.

499
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,253
So you got, like,
big-ass horns

500
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,022
and, like, a beak and stuff.

501
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,723
We're going all out on this.

502
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,261
You're gonna be
a dino-hipster girl.

503
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,330
I still need
to finish fabricating.

504
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:06,232
Immediately, I asked
my wonderful model Linda

505
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,067
to help me deck out
the skateboard.

506
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:13,039
The models are there
to help you.

507
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,442
They're on your side.
They want you to do well.

508
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,545
The texture on the tail
is terrible-- It sucks so bad.

509
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,981
Every time I look at it,
I just want to throw up on it.

510
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,883
The only way I'm gonna save this

511
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,919
is by some killer paint job
that hides everything

512
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:29,422
and pops out the things
I want to pop out.

513
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,690
This is kind of a base.

514
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:33,326
Bring it to life
with the airbrush.

515
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,760
It's a risky plan,
because it's colors

516
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:37,029
that shouldn't necessarily
go together.

517
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:39,665
I'm just sinking.
It just feels like

518
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,602
the world is closing in
on me right now.

519
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,804
This could be it.

520
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:47,173
I'm taking time

521
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,774
to actually airbrush
the base piece

522
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,977
before I apply it.
That way I know, for sure,

523
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,545
I have a strong paint job on it.

524
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,480
Which the judges have been
deducting me for.

525
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:08,194
All right,
we got to get this on.

526
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:12,465
I have this fat suit
I have Tommy put on.

527
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,333
I figured, like,
triceratops, you know--

528
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,302
Kind of big, cow-like.

529
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,005
They'd have weight on them.
But he's just looking

530
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,873
a little too chubby.
You look a lot fatter

531
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,141
than what
I thought you would have.

532
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:24,310
So I try and pad his shoulders--

533
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:26,145
Make him look bigger all around.

534
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:28,114
But it's not
what I wanted at all.

535
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,583
It's not looking right.
It's <i>no bueno.</i>

536
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:31,717
I finally take it off of him.

537
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,452
Yeah, I kind of like that.

538
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,820
I think it might work.
That's nice.

539
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:37,089
- Thank God.
- Hell, yeah.

540
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,127
I put the face on.
I start painting.

541
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,462
And I stop for a minute...

542
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,031
And I'm thinking,

543
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,999
"This will be the last time
I'm working in this place."

544
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,936
And it's really upsetting me.

545
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,905
I've come so far,
and it's proven to me

546
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:54,807
that I really am doing
a good job.

547
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,476
It would be devastating
to me to lose

548
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:58,844
at this point.

549
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,018
As the four hours near the end,

550
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:07,620
I start worrying
about the chest piece

551
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:10,289
and the armor pieces
that I have to apply.

552
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:13,025
Pretty good.
It's really just the armor.

553
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:15,561
It's daunting to get those done,
but if I screw up--

554
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:16,896
If I make him look
too costume-y--

555
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:18,030
That's the axe.

556
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,173
Hey, guys, that's time.
Let's go.

557
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,075
Leaving for the stage,
I see that everyone

558
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,377
still has a lot to do.

559
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:34,246
We only have one hour
to pull everything together.

560
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:35,548
Two people are
gonna be eliminated.

561
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:39,018
Two people?

562
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:43,322
I'm really worried now.

563
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,459
Coming up...

564
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,327
My heart's just pounding.

565
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:50,663
Two of you will be eliminated.

566
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:52,098
I think you might have
overextended yourself.

567
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,300
I'm going home on my birthday.

568
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,411
Oh, my God, it's fabulous.

569
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,549
We're at the stage
for our last looks.

570
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:06,817
We only have one hour
to pull everything together.

571
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:08,686
Um, stoop down a little bit.

572
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:10,555
All I'm doing is painting
like a mad woman.

573
00:24:10,622 --> 00:24:12,857
Okay.
Let me get it all.

574
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:14,425
Drop your jaw
just a little bit.

575
00:24:14,493 --> 00:24:16,360
During the last looks, I need

576
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:17,595
to put on
the tail and the hump.

577
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:20,798
And I've got
this nice duct-tape vest,

578
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:23,668
and the wardrobe
will cover up the duct tape.

579
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:25,469
I have a lot
of painting left to do.

580
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:27,071
And it starts looking
really good.

581
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:29,307
I think
I actually <i>can</i> finish this.

582
00:24:29,374 --> 00:24:32,176
- Look at this ghetto affixing.
- Turn your arms, Phil.

583
00:24:32,244 --> 00:24:36,113
Turn to this side...

584
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:37,548
I'm starting
to feather the tail...

585
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:43,054
I don't like this.

586
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:46,390
RJ, man,
this hot glue does wonders.

587
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:49,927
- Told you.
- Turn them both over.

588
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:51,162
Nobody's gonna beat me.
I'm gonna stay.

589
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:53,064
I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna stay.

590
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:57,635
Five minutes, guys.

591
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,403
I was a little frantic.

592
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:02,206
But I think my model
looks phenomenal.

593
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:04,041
Hey, guys, that's it!

594
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:07,511
Time's up!
Brushes down.

595
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:09,347
Two people are leaving.

596
00:25:09,414 --> 00:25:11,649
This is our last chance
to impress the judges

597
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:15,252
before the finale.

598
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,357
I am petrified.

599
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,502
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

600
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,974
Tonight, two of you
will be eliminated.

601
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,977
And three of you will make it
to the finale.

602
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:41,479
Say hello to your judges.

603
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:43,881
Owner of optic nerve makeup
effects studio--

604
00:25:43,949 --> 00:25:46,050
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

605
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,252
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist-- Ve Neill.

606
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,187
Evening, everybody.

607
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:51,756
And creature designer
and director--

608
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:53,724
- Patrick Tatopoulos.
- Hello.

609
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:55,092
All right, guys,

610
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,927
so this week
your spotlight challenge

611
00:25:56,995 --> 00:25:59,630
was to create
a dinosaur-human hybrid.

612
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:01,732
So let's see
what you come up with.

613
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,035
First up--
Sue's creation.

614
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,560
She's so flamboyant,

615
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:31,595
and all the eyes are just drawn
to her in that color

616
00:26:31,663 --> 00:26:33,431
and her attitude
and her swagger.

617
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:35,299
It's totally me.
I love it.

618
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,160
I'm legitimately starting
to get scared.

619
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:05,896
I'm thinking I'm going home
on my birthday,

620
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,132
because I know
that Glenn doesn't like it.

621
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,835
He already said it before.

622
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:34,125
I think he looks intimidating.

623
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,926
He's phenomenal.
He has a whole presence

624
00:27:35,994 --> 00:27:38,929
of a T-Rex.
It just works-- He's solid.

625
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,093
He's opening his mouth
and, like, moving his hands,

626
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:10,795
because he can flex 'em
and stuff.

627
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:13,397
He's looking really cool.

628
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,323
I think
everyone else's is good,

629
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:42,860
and then mine is just
a step under all of them.

630
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:46,530
I've never been this nervous
in any of the other challenges.

631
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:48,766
And my heart's just pounding.

632
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:58,576
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

633
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:03,647
She was only doing this shape

634
00:29:03,715 --> 00:29:05,149
like it was
going to be a partial,

635
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:07,952
but it looks like she decided
to go with a whole face.

636
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,420
Are you able
to open your mouth a bit?

637
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:11,789
- Yeah?
- I'm excited.

638
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:13,057
There's a whole bunch
of details on there

639
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:14,458
that they haven't gotten
a chance to see.

640
00:29:14,526 --> 00:29:16,126
She's got
a whole spine thing going.

641
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:18,028
Oh, look--
Piercings.

642
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:19,563
It is kind of--
Something went wrong here.

643
00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:21,866
Collapsed.

644
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:26,437
Can you open and close
your mouth?

645
00:29:26,504 --> 00:29:28,005
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

646
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:29,807
Pretty rough edge here.

647
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:33,077
You always get really nervous
when they do their looks,

648
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:34,745
because you don't know
what they're saying.

649
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:37,081
He started to do some,
like, vein-y breakup.

650
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:39,550
- This is a good idea.
- To break it up, yeah.

651
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:42,753
Wish he would have
done it more.

652
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:50,027
Kind of Damien-like,
you know?

653
00:29:50,095 --> 00:29:51,729
- This is cool.
- Uh-huh.

654
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:00,371
Nice.
I like the tail.

655
00:30:00,438 --> 00:30:02,506
Oh, yes, like a little,
stubby tail, huh?

656
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:04,208
- Yeah, it's cute.
- Which they add, by the way--

657
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,076
I like when I see them
paying attention

658
00:30:06,144 --> 00:30:09,280
to the original characteristic.

659
00:30:09,347 --> 00:30:10,547
I can't believe
we all did this.

660
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:12,650
This was a hell of a challenge.

661
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:15,552
She's got huge eyes.

662
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,754
Give us some gestures--

663
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:18,022
I want to see
how the makeup moves.

664
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:20,624
This is
the most intense challenge,

665
00:30:20,692 --> 00:30:22,393
because there's so much
riding on it.

666
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,096
I could go home
because my latex on my tail

667
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:30,134
looks like crap.

668
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:37,341
She's got huge eyes.
It's so cool.

669
00:30:37,408 --> 00:30:40,210
Ve, Patrick, and Glenn
go up for close looks,

670
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:43,480
and this is
the most intense challenge,

671
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:45,048
because there's so much
riding on it.

672
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:46,149
Give us some gestures--
I want to see

673
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:49,820
how the makeup moves.
Thank you.

674
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:55,225
Well, the judges
would like to speak

675
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,294
with each of you
to learn more about your work.

676
00:30:57,362 --> 00:31:00,764
RJ.

677
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:04,001
Are you happy
with this character?

678
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:05,469
How well do you think
you've done?

679
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:09,206
Um, I'd give it
a solid six, seven.

680
00:31:09,274 --> 00:31:10,941
You probably could have done
a little bit more

681
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:13,877
more with the paint job.
A little bit more break up

682
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:16,179
would have pulled this look
together really well.

683
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:18,181
That being said,
it does not detract

684
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:19,383
from the fact that I think

685
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,519
he's a really successful
character.

686
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:25,222
Can you give us a profile?
Can you show us your profile?

687
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,391
There's a lot
of a raptor vibe in there.

688
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,892
And he creates that back--

689
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,093
It's not human anymore,
the back.

690
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:31,328
I think that's
very, very important.

691
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:33,330
The purposeful hard edge
to the lip,

692
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:34,998
and then you can see his mouth
inside--

693
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,900
So often can go horribly wrong,

694
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:39,970
but it works really well
in this makeup.

695
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:44,007
RJ, thank you.
You can step back.

696
00:31:44,075 --> 00:31:47,044
Matt, you're next.

697
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:52,516
- Glenn, let's start with you.
- How do you feel

698
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,452
- about what you've accomplished?
- Um, I would say,

699
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,454
I think I knocked out
a lot of stuff that I wanted to.

700
00:31:57,522 --> 00:32:01,858
I could have done more
with certain pieces.

701
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,460
I love the chest piece.

702
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:05,962
I think all that's
really cool and creepy.

703
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,564
And I think it's interesting

704
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:10,233
that you chose to paint him
in a skeletal way,

705
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,737
which is like a dinosaur
exoskeleton-type look.

706
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,872
- I like it.
- Thank you.

707
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,341
Although
it's a very cool character

708
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,343
with the chest plate,
it took a bit of the effort away

709
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,111
from your sculpt on the face,

710
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,280
and I wish you had pushed it
a little further.

711
00:32:23,348 --> 00:32:26,049
Feeling like you missed
the dinosaur thing a little bit.

712
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:27,484
I think
it would actually benefit

713
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:29,319
from not having
the chest plate on it.

714
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:31,221
I wish I could see
underneath there.

715
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:35,125
Think it would help it read
as a part human-part dinosaur.

716
00:32:35,193 --> 00:32:37,794
Some really cool stuff
going on.

717
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,764
I think you might have
overextended yourself, though.

718
00:32:40,832 --> 00:32:44,768
Matt, thank you very much.
You may step back.

719
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:46,136
Ian.

720
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:51,341
Would you give us
a little bit of information

721
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:53,043
about your character here?

722
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:55,579
Basically, I was going with
an <i>Island Of Dr. Moreau</i> feeling.

723
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:59,850
I chose the triceratops,
because he has a great profile.

724
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,284
I like this guy.

725
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:04,020
I think the major problem
with this

726
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,857
is the fact that there's just
not quite enough paint on it.

727
00:33:06,924 --> 00:33:08,692
But, all in all,
I think you did a great job

728
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,293
and it's a great character.

729
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:11,595
Your sculpt is really good.

730
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:12,763
I like the way
the mouth functions.

731
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,965
You paid attention
to the wrinkle--

732
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:16,967
They make sense
when the mouth opens.

733
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,668
I agree with Ve--
You've done a great job again.

734
00:33:18,736 --> 00:33:21,037
- Wow, thank you.
- I really wish

735
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,372
you would have gone and done
some simple buildup

736
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,774
underneath your wardrobe

737
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:25,375
to make the chest
really barreled.

738
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:28,478
That's a suggestion,
not a criticism.

739
00:33:28,546 --> 00:33:30,414
I really think
that you succeeded this week.

740
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:32,416
- Thank you.
- Ian, thank you very much.

741
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:35,452
You can step back.

742
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,254
Rayce, you're up.

743
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:42,526
- Patrick, let's start with you.
- Tell us about the character.

744
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:45,462
The dinosaur I chose
was the corythosaurus.

745
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,364
First thing,
when we went to the museum,

746
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:48,899
is I looked at the silhouette
and I thought,

747
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:50,767
"This is such a powerful
silhouette in itself,

748
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:54,104
that I wanted to achieve that
on my character."

749
00:33:54,172 --> 00:33:55,906
That's interesting
you talk about the silhouette,

750
00:33:55,973 --> 00:34:00,043
because, for me,
this is a very successful job

751
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:02,712
of creating a new silhouette
that's less anthropomorphic,

752
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,881
especially when your model
gets into the right position.

753
00:34:04,949 --> 00:34:06,950
Like the hump on the back,
the tail--

754
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:08,285
It really works for me.

755
00:34:08,352 --> 00:34:10,120
What it is that you've
achieved here this week

756
00:34:10,188 --> 00:34:13,924
is truly impressive--
Wicked accurate decisions.

757
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:17,360
I love that you integrated
<i>the</i> shape of <i>the</i> dinosaur

758
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:20,897
into the profile--
Not just aspects of it

759
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:22,466
jammed into the color.

760
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,501
- How did you make that tail?
- Ha.

761
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:28,104
I used to sit with my kids
and make duct-tape characters.

762
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:30,941
And it's just duct tape
with foam batting...

763
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:32,342
- Get out.
- Like snow batting, yeah.

764
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:34,010
- Duct tape?
- Duct tape.

765
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:36,446
Oh, my God, it's fabulous.

766
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:38,915
Spin around for us.
Look at that.

767
00:34:38,983 --> 00:34:41,485
I have to eat my own words
about not liking blue makeups,

768
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,820
- 'cause this one's really cool.
- Thank you so much.

769
00:34:43,888 --> 00:34:45,522
Rayce, you can step back.

770
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:50,060
Sue.

771
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:55,265
Glenn, let's start with you.

772
00:34:55,333 --> 00:34:58,134
Sue, could you tell everyone
about your basic concept?

773
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:01,104
My dinosaur is named
a tianyulong.

774
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:03,507
It was the most flamboyant
in color.

775
00:35:03,574 --> 00:35:05,909
I kind of made my creature

776
00:35:05,977 --> 00:35:08,678
into a dinosaur version of me

777
00:35:08,746 --> 00:35:13,116
as, like, a hipster
"girl power" dinosaur.

778
00:35:13,184 --> 00:35:16,520
You created
a very cool little character.

779
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:18,255
It really strikes me,
among the whole group here,

780
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:19,489
you are the only one
that made something

781
00:35:19,557 --> 00:35:20,857
that feels really fun.

782
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:22,993
And the colors actually
really work well together.

783
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,130
It was really wise to pick
a very colorful dinosaur.

784
00:35:27,198 --> 00:35:29,299
It helped you zone in
on this concept

785
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,667
that you wanted to work with.

786
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:32,569
I think that's where it is
for me,

787
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:35,038
that it's a little too colorful
and it's a little too vibrant,

788
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:38,241
but overall I think
that you're pretty successful.

789
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:42,279
He's just not a girl,
that's all.

790
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:43,580
We have matching shoes.

791
00:35:43,648 --> 00:35:45,949
I think it's very cute.

792
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:48,552
I think
your color scheme's wonderful

793
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,287
and very whimsical.

794
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:51,621
And you did a great job
this week.

795
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:52,722
And, you know, I'm not a girl,

796
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:53,990
but I'm still digging it.

797
00:35:54,058 --> 00:35:55,358
So there's maybe
something wrong with me,

798
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:59,162
I don't know, but I think
it really works for me.

799
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,300
Thank you, Sue.

800
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:04,634
All right, everybody,

801
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:06,469
the judges have heard
what you have to say.

802
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:08,204
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

803
00:36:08,272 --> 00:36:11,141
while they make their decisions.

804
00:36:15,046 --> 00:36:17,147
So why don't we start
with Matt's work tonight.

805
00:36:17,214 --> 00:36:18,515
What are your thoughts?

806
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:19,983
I liked the character.

807
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:21,918
I just think that, um,

808
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:23,320
it didn't really look
like a dinosaur.

809
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:26,356
I agree-- That was
so essential to the challenge.

810
00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:28,358
He kind of has, like,
a demon look to him

811
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:29,893
as opposed to
an actual dinosaur.

812
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,095
We talk about those horns
staying so big.

813
00:36:32,163 --> 00:36:33,597
When you shrink
the proportion of the dinosaur,

814
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,031
you need to shrink them as well.

815
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,399
But I still really think
it's a cool makeup.

816
00:36:36,467 --> 00:36:37,934
Yeah, it is.

817
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:39,402
All right,
let's move on to Ian.

818
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,171
I think Ian might have been

819
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:43,673
the most successful
in putting the dinosaur

820
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:45,108
on a person.

821
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:47,744
Yeah, he got the feet
and the hands going.

822
00:36:47,812 --> 00:36:50,547
And he got a hard-shell effect
on those pieces

823
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:52,182
that actually needed to be hard.

824
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:53,383
Yes. To me it's almost
too much

825
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:55,585
of a dinosaur face,
dinosaur hands,

826
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:58,521
on a silhouette
that's purely human.

827
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:00,690
All right, so with that
let's move on to Rayce then.

828
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:03,793
Really super-strong idea.
And one of my big fears--

829
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:07,263
The giant, round apertures
where the eyeballs were in.

830
00:37:07,331 --> 00:37:09,799
And it's one of the strongest
pieces of the makeup

831
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:12,535
is that he created this
really cool, round shape there.

832
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:14,838
He worked with his model.
This is a new skill

833
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:16,439
that we really haven't seen
out of anyone--

834
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:19,275
Using the model
to the best advantage

835
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:21,311
in order to accentuate something
in the makeup.

836
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:22,779
- You saw that mouth moving.
- Yeah.

837
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:24,681
And the mouth
was absolutely stunning.

838
00:37:24,749 --> 00:37:26,182
I didn't like
the wardrobe, though.

839
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,153
Yes, quasimodo belt-rope
was a little disappointing.

840
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:31,755
Yeah, that was disappointing
I got to say.

841
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:33,323
All right, let's move on
to Sue.

842
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:35,725
I think Sue did
a really great job this week.

843
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:37,193
I mean, she came up
with a really cute

844
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:39,396
little sassy character
for herself.

845
00:37:39,463 --> 00:37:41,631
The colors all worked
really well together.

846
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,867
I really don't like
this makeup.

847
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,101
I don't like
the "girl power" idea.

848
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:47,604
- Doesn't like "girl power."
- Oh, come on!

849
00:37:47,672 --> 00:37:50,273
I don't like the skateboard.
I just don't like it.

850
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:51,675
It doesn't work for me.

851
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:53,777
It was the perfect thing
for her to do.

852
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:55,779
You only like it because
it <i>is</i> "girl power."

853
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:58,982
Nah--
It has nothing to do with that.

854
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,417
- Holy smoke.
- I'm sorry.

855
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:01,651
I can't even back myself up
on that one.

856
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,919
I just don't like it.

857
00:38:02,987 --> 00:38:05,822
All right, let's move on to RJ.

858
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,358
I would say
that the raptor was in the face,

859
00:38:08,426 --> 00:38:09,592
which was actually important
to me.

860
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,860
Although it's completely human,

861
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:12,162
there was still
the characteristic

862
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:13,463
of the raptor.

863
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:15,231
And the nice line
from this side.

864
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:16,800
When you see the feathers
go down into the back--

865
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:18,101
The human back--
And the tail,

866
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:19,869
it flows really nicely.

867
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:21,604
Yeah, nicely together--
It's true.

868
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:24,140
Yeah, I thought the
raptor-rapper thing was cute.

869
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,342
I mean, he even did the sculpt
of the little disc.

870
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,179
That wasn't good,
that was great!

871
00:38:29,246 --> 00:38:31,181
- I thought it was funny.
- There's a few issue though,

872
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:32,982
like the toes just being
way too long.

873
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,284
We know this important,

874
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:35,585
to pay attention
to stuff like this.

875
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:37,087
The guy walks
like he's coming back

876
00:38:37,154 --> 00:38:38,521
- from a scuba diving lesson.
- Like clown shoes, yeah.

877
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:40,857
- They are like clown shoes.
- That's not a good thin

878
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:43,526
you want them to-- And you
have to pay attention to that.

879
00:38:43,594 --> 00:38:44,994
I can't believe we have
to eliminate two people.

880
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:47,230
- This is freaking me out.
- Yeah, I don't envy you guys.

881
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:49,032
I think what we're really
trying to decide tonight

882
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,467
isn't so much who are
the two people

883
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:53,103
that are going home--
It's knowing

884
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,604
that there's only three slots
for next week,

885
00:38:54,672 --> 00:38:56,573
and who are the three people
that we most want to see.

886
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,441
Very difficult, no doubt.

887
00:38:58,509 --> 00:38:59,843
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

888
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

889
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,646
- We have.
- Fantastic.

890
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:05,515
Let's bring them back out.

891
00:39:13,591 --> 00:39:15,125
All right, Glenn,

892
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:17,093
who is the winner
of this challenge

893
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:19,028
and the first person joining us
in the finale?

894
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:22,499
The winner
of tonight's challenge...

895
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:25,635
is...

896
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:34,442
All right, Glenn,

897
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,644
who is the winner
of this challenge

898
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:39,514
and the first person joining us
in the finale?

899
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,684
The winner
of tonight's challenge...

900
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:45,687
is...

901
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:49,324
Rayce.

902
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:52,727
Wow.

903
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:56,197
You very successfully merged
the human and dinosaur forms

904
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:58,099
in your creation, and it was

905
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:01,002
- a beautifully executed makeup.
- Thank you so much.

906
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,339
Rayce, congratulations.
You are the first person

907
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:07,275
- joining us in the finale.
- Thank you all.

908
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:08,543
I can't believe this right now.

909
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,944
Inside I'm just freaking out,
thinking,

910
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:11,879
there's no way
that I'm in the finale.

911
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:13,715
Like, wow.

912
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:15,183
All right, Glenn,

913
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,218
who is the second person
to join us?

914
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:22,190
The second person
moving on to the finale is...

915
00:40:25,127 --> 00:40:30,064
Ian.

916
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:33,167
Ian, congratulations.
Great job.

917
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,169
Thank you.
I'm very proud.

918
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:38,373
I made it to the finale.
Um... damn.

919
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,341
It's surreal and...

920
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:41,609
I couldn't be happier.

921
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:43,745
Well, we have
three artists left,

922
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:47,415
but only one of you
can continue on with us.

923
00:40:47,483 --> 00:40:50,585
So, Glenn, who has
the final spot in the finale?

924
00:40:50,652 --> 00:40:54,889
The third person that will be
competing in the finale is...

925
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,629
- RJ.
- Oh, God.

926
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:03,197
Ooh.

927
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:06,334
Thank you guys so much.

928
00:41:06,402 --> 00:41:09,704
- Wow.
- Well, RJ, congratulations.

929
00:41:09,772 --> 00:41:11,672
You have final spot
in the finale.

930
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,074
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

931
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:14,742
Best birthday present ever.

932
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,677
Ha!

933
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:18,479
I can't believe it.
I'm-- I just am in awe

934
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:22,417
that I got through.

935
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:23,651
Unfortunately that means,

936
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:28,423
Matt, Sue,
you will be leaving us tonight.

937
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,224
Judges, is there anything that
you would like to say to them?

938
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:33,461
Just want to tell you both--
Nothing to be ashamed of.

939
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:35,463
This was
a very tough decision tonight.

940
00:41:35,531 --> 00:41:37,365
And you should both be
very proud of yourselves.

941
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,067
Sue, right from the beginning,

942
00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:41,903
I knew that you had
some serious sculpting talent.

943
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,606
So don't give up.
This is just the beginning.

944
00:41:45,674 --> 00:41:47,975
What I like about you
is your originality.

945
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:50,144
You're just fresh,
full of energy.

946
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:51,712
You bring a lot of realism
in your sculpture.

947
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,091
- It's not easy.
- Thank you.

948
00:41:53,149 --> 00:41:56,051
Matt,
extremely impressed with you.

949
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:59,321
Really, really strong--
Strong design skills.

950
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:01,290
And I cannot wait
to see what you come up with

951
00:42:01,357 --> 00:42:02,491
in the future.

952
00:42:02,548 --> 00:42:07,244
You're like an incredible artist and
your work here has been phenomenal.

953
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:09,607
We look forward to see
great things from you.

954
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,849
Thank you.

955
00:42:10,951 --> 00:42:15,465
Sue and Matt, it's really been great having
you here with us and seeing your work.

956
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:19,171
You, please, head back to the
make up room and pack up your kits.

957
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:23,729
- Thank you both.
- Good job, guys. - Good luck guys.

958
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:26,540
I'm not really sad...
I feel I've done my best.

959
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,876
And leaving here definitely felt
I'm ready to go.

960
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:33,028
I've got, uhm, a ton of
other creatures in my mind

961
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,326
that want to get out.

962
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:35,953
I love you, guys!

963
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:39,351
It hurts, but, now I know
what I'm capable of doing,

964
00:42:39,386 --> 00:42:41,576
I only have one way to go and that's it.
