00:00:00,257 --> 00:00:02,043
<i>Previously on Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:05,768
14 talented special-effects
make up artists came

3
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:08,785
to Los Angeles to compete
to join the world's elite.

4
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:11,170
You're going to have
to re-imagine and modernize

5
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:12,705
four of the iconic
main characters from

6
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:15,574
<i>the wonderful Wizard Of Oz.</i>

7
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:16,809
Jerry has immunity,

8
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:18,644
but I'm not gonna
let him push me around.

9
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:21,814
The strongest makeup was Brea.

10
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:25,518
Who's going home tonight?

11
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:28,154
Greg.

12
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,889
Now 13 artists remain.

13
00:00:29,956 --> 00:00:31,157
And tonight...

14
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:32,358
Your models will be

15
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:34,694
completely submerged
in a water tank.

16
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:36,696
Something's wrong.

17
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:39,832
He can't breathe.

18
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,966
But to make it to the top,

19
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:42,168
they'll have to impress

20
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:44,136
our award-winning
panel of judges--

21
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,604

36
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:02,615
I still feel down
about everything.

37
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:03,916
Yeah.

38
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:05,584
I feel like I've
let my team down...

39
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:07,620
And I've helped
send home a friend.

40
00:02:07,687 --> 00:02:09,622
Since I'm still here,
I feel like

41
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,090
I definitely have
to redeem myself.

44
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:16,796
I was pissed because
at one point,

45
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:18,297
Jerry was sitting in the chair.

46
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:19,698
Hell, no.

47
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,633
Because if you and I were
teamed up together,

48
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,901
that'd be it.

49
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,203
What if I keep on
getting second place

50
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:27,239
because I'm helping
other people look good?

51
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:31,110
When I lost to Brea, I realized
I allowed someone else

52
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:35,047
to get that win by
riding on my coattails.

53
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:36,382
And damn if that's
gonna happen again.

54
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,350
Let's do this day, man.

55
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:41,220
- We got this.
- Yeah, we got it, man.

56
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:52,198
Good morning, everybody.

57
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:53,666
Good morning.

58
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:56,769
Welcome to the Aquarium
of the Pacific.

59
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:59,738
This place features
over 11,000 animals,

60
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:03,175
including sharks,
jellyfish, sea dragons,

61
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,844
even giant crabs.

62
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:08,414
This truly is
a world-class experience.

63
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,149
This spotlight challenge,

64
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:12,451
you're gonna be working
in teams of two.

65
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,453
You are going to
search the aquarium

66
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:16,922
to find fish or other
creatures to inspire

67
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,091
your very own
sea creature makeup.

68
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,061
I actually went
to college for marine biology.

69
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:23,362
So this is right up my alley.

70
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,830
I know my fish.

71
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:26,899
Your teams have been
randomly selected

72
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,200
and they are...

73
00:03:28,268 --> 00:03:32,204
Team one-- Sue and Rayce.

74
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:33,506
Yeah.

75
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,007
Dang.

76
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:39,812
Team two...Jerry and Nix.

77
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,781
Jerry is the last person
I wanna be teamed up with,

78
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,884
because him and I are
gonna be bumping heads.

79
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:48,120
Team three is Miranda and Beki.

80
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:50,689
I'm paired up with the
greenest person on the block.

81
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:52,024
This is gonna be interesting.

82
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:55,094
Team four...Ian and RJ.

83
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,229
Yes!

84
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:02,034
Team five...
Matt and Tara.

85
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:05,671
Team six...
Heather and Athena.

86
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,273
All the teams are picked
and I'm thinking,

87
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,774
why is my name
not getting called?

88
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:10,309
Brea?

89
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:12,278
Why don't you come and stand
next to me for a minute?

90
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:13,512
All right.

91
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,680
The rest of you can now go

92
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:18,183
stand with your teammates.

93
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:21,320
Well, as the winner of last
week's spotlight challenge,

94
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:25,891
you get to choose
which team you'd like to join.

95
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,126
Yes.

96
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:27,993
So your team will
have three people.

97
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,296
Go ahead and make your choice.

98
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:32,898
Well, I feel pretty strong
as a sculptor,

99
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,534
and I was really impressed
with Rayce's painting skills

100
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:37,736
so I'm gonna have to
choose Rayce and Sue.

101
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:40,105
Fantastic, go and
join your teammates.

102
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:47,012
Well, I can't wait to see
what everyone comes up with.

103
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,916
But there is one more thing
you should know.

104
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,685
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Of course.

105
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:56,589
On reveal day, your models
will be completely submerged

106
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:59,658
in a water tank.

107
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:03,429
So your makeups are now going
to have to be waterproof.

108
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:04,897
Oh!

109
00:05:04,965 --> 00:05:07,433
- That's hard-core.

110
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,468
I've done a body paint once,

111
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:10,936
submerged in water
for a few hours,

112
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,738
and that was a big challenge.

113
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:14,440
But to do something
with prosthetics?

114
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:16,008
That's a whole
nother ball game.

115
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:17,810
You all have 30 minutes
to go find

116
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,878
something that inspires you.

117
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:22,715
So, grab your cameras,
your sketchpads,

118
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:27,620
because your time starts now.

119
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:32,224
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

120
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,425
Wow.

121
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:34,493
Looks like he's frontin',

122
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:36,996
- he's like...
- Yeah.

123
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:38,697
I really like the frog idea

124
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,232
and I think it lets
you paint like crazy--

125
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,533
- I just don't think
the frog is

126
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,035
exactly the way to go, though.

127
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:44,603
Out of everyone in the group,

128
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:46,705
Nix and I are really the only
two that don't really get along.

129
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:48,407
Texture is what we need.

130
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:51,710
At the same time, Nix knows
I'm a great sculptor

131
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:54,713
and I've heard Nix is
a fantastic painter.

132
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:56,115
Because we're gonna
butt heads on this,

133
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:57,616
I think the easiest way
to do it

134
00:05:57,684 --> 00:06:00,185
is ultimately you'll
be in charge of paint

135
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:01,587
and I'll be
in charge of sculpture.

136
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:02,888
If we don't do it that way,

137
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:06,859
I guarantee we don't win,
I guarantee it.

138
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:10,629
Wait, look at the stingray.

139
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:12,865
Mm-hmm.

140
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,667
I'm pretty much immediately
thinking a lionfish

141
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:16,335
because they're one of
my favorite fish.

142
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:18,237
There's lots of appendages.

143
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:19,672
Oh, that's what--
That's what we want.

144
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:21,206
Yes, this is the one
I was talking about.

145
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:22,408
I love it, I love
the sculpture of it.

146
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,877
I'm so glad that
you're a pro at fishes.

147
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:26,979
Awesome.

148
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,614
Looks like plants.

149
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:29,948
- I like this one, you know why?
- You do?

150
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,917
'Cause they look like a dragon.

151
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:35,320
Leafy sea dragon.

152
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:37,389
I like the colors of this
but I also like this fin.

153
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:38,857
It looks like an antenna
or something on top.

154
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:41,894
- Yeah.
- Lyretail fairy basslet.

155
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,730
It changes color,
behavior and sex.

156
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:47,199
Oh, yeah, it's androgynous.

157
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:49,368
It starts out as a female
and then morphs into a male.

158
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:51,403
I think he or she
will be fierce.

159
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,138
No doubt.
Yeah. Fierce.

160
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,306
Beki, look how cool they are.

161
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,275
Yeah, those two look beautiful.

162
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:57,876
This thing would all
flow in the water

163
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,945
in a really interesting way.
Yeah.

164
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,280
Do you think this
might be the one?

165
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:02,848
Yeah.

166
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:03,749
Are you guys picking
this thing?

167
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:04,783
Yeah.

168
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,085
Don't pick what we're picking

169
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:07,252
'cause you don't
wanna be next to us.

170
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,654
Well, all right.

171
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:10,155
Beki and Miranda are doing
the same fish as us.

172
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,524
But I don't want our fish
coming out looking the same.

173
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,059
So I'm ready
to bring it on, man.

174
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,395
Wow, that's cool,
look at that shark.

175
00:07:17,964 --> 00:07:19,431
I like the ridges
down the back.

176
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:21,600
And then they have
an easy texture to sculpt.

177
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:25,070
I-- I think the zebra shark
is a good choice for us.

178
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:26,605
Turtle.

179
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:29,475
We see this turtle and
he's floating past us,

180
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,410
and at that point,
we looked at each other,

181
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,746
and we knew that that
was gonna be our animal.

182
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:35,981
I mean, it's got great texture,
it's got great color.

183
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:39,218
- I think it'll be good.
- I think it'll be awesome.

184
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,325
We get back to the lab.

185
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:50,295
We get to choose
our model for the makeup.

186
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:52,664
On each of our stations,
there's an aquarium

187
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,666
so that we can test
different materials,

188
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,034
see how things
move in the water,

189
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,236
see if they float
or if they sink.

190
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,037
We can't build

191
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:01,273
a really big
head piece, unfortunately,

192
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:03,776
but we're just gonna keep
that mohawk going on.

193
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,512
We have three and a half
hours in the lab

194
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,314
to figure out the design
that we're going to do.

195
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:12,117
What do you wanna do?

196
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:15,087
I'm really nervous
about it, actually.

197
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,321
Well, let's talk about it,
what are you worried--

198
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:17,790
I mean, we gotta get started.

199
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:21,460
Having it hold up underwater
is a huge twist.

200
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:22,728
We don't even know
where to begin.

201
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:24,663
I think we should have, like...

202
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:28,367
Something okay, well lawyers are
known as sharks, right?

203
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:30,836
Well what if he's a lawyer?

204
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:32,938
We'll take a risk and we'll say,

205
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:35,307
if this works, awesome,
and if it doesn't

206
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,575
send me home.

207
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,911
- Cowl first?
- Cowl first.

208
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,413
We'll work on the face tomorrow.

209
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,115
All right.

210
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,383
Do we wanna cover her eyes

211
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,851
or do we wanna keep
her real eyes?

212
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,852
We should keep her real eyes.

213
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,253
I've never done something

214
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,521
under the water before.

215
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,257
To me, the challenge then became

216
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:54,693
it has to be a beautiful
creature in the water, you know?

217
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:57,296
We have to use fabrics and
things that are going to float

218
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,331
and be beautiful in the water.

219
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,870
So, we've got a head.

220
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:08,774
One arm, one sheet with texture.

221
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,075
These are the things
for sure we're sculpting.

222
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,077
I'm feeling really
great about today.

223
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:15,647
We both agree foam latex
is the best for this.

224
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:17,916
Silicone doesn't
breathe underwater.

225
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,384
We know that if we
glue it on well,

226
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:20,919
it's not gonna come off.

227
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,359
My greatest strengths lie

228
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:29,595
in conceptualizing
and sculpting.

229
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,730
I believe that you need
that base sculpt

230
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,633
to really wow those judges.

231
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,841
Apparently, Matt likes to
slip these sex symbolism things

232
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,310
into all of his makeup,
which is fine by me.

233
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:52,584
For this character,
I'll be working primarily

234
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:54,553
on the face sculpture.

235
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:57,756
Sue is working on the chest
piece and the back piece.

236
00:09:57,824 --> 00:10:00,092
And Brea is working
on the arm pieces

237
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,929
as well as the appendages that
come off of the character.

238
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,364
Mine looks a little
more delicate.

239
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,932
- Yeah.
- And this just looks like

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,367
"I'm gonna kick
your ass right now."

241
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:09,534
Totally.

242
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:10,402
The concept is
going to be about

243
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,504
this sea goddess has come out,

244
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:15,073
and instead of
camouflaging with the water,

245
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:17,876
she's going to be just embodied

246
00:10:17,944 --> 00:10:20,178
with anger
and fire and passion.

247
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:24,783
Should I make him a little
more meaner or something, or...

248
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:26,251
I think stay away from the mean

249
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:28,053
because I think a lot of
people tend to go that way.

250
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:29,388
- So just kinda leave him?
- Yeah.

251
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,323
We're working surprisingly
well together.

252
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:34,259
We have some molds to make
and some latex arms to pull.

253
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,895
I mean, it's, you know,
it's high school stuff.

254
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,167
The lionfish that we chose

255
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,670
has a very, very,
very broad mouth.

256
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:47,272
So we tried to capture that.

257
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,776
While I'm sculpting,
Athena is making long spines

258
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:52,678
that are going to work
almost like a glove.

259
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:55,580
Gonna make a really big
impact in the display tank.

260
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:03,956
I'm worried if we
have too much of,

261
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,324
like, the lip thing going on,

262
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:06,858
it's bent out like that.

263
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:11,596
The sea dragon has a really long
snout, or nose, or whatever,

264
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,966
and she starts putting on
this really short

265
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,934
little stubby thing
that looks like a duck

266
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:18,236
and it's just
a big sloppy mess.

267
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,938
Can I-- Can I
just do one thing?

268
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:21,273
- Go ahead.
- I just think maybe--

269
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,674
- Go ahead.
- Like, if we just...

270
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:25,777
So she wants to come over
and sculpt on it.

271
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:27,446
Instantly, she wipes
the face off

272
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:29,815
and starts doing this little
tiny chicken nose on it.

273
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:34,987
You don't think it
looked like a duck before?

274
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:38,523
Nope. I think it looks
like a chicken now.

275
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:43,395
Becky and Miranda are having
some intense...Dialogue.

276
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,130
Okay, then I'm gonna
leave the snout up to you.

277
00:11:45,198 --> 00:11:46,932
'Cause the way that
you're responding to me

278
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,934
is stressing me out a little
bit, like, so I just--

279
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,669
I'd rather just
leave it to you.

280
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:52,337
I'm over here sculpting,
waiting for you to

281
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:55,007
show me something that doesn't
look like a chicken or a duck.

282
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,541
Maybe you could
help me out rather than

283
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,010
just yelling at me
that you don't like it.

284
00:11:58,077 --> 00:12:00,412
She definitely
underestimating me,

285
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,814
so it's kind of gonna
bite her in the ass

286
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:05,250
if we can't get
something out that works.

287
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:07,486
You gotta show me what's
going on in your brain.

288
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:10,122
Oh, my God, this is
gonna be a disaster.

289
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,757
You just have
bad things to say,

290
00:12:11,824 --> 00:12:13,625
but you don't wanna
help me out.

291
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:25,665
Well, maybe you could
help me out

292
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,434
rather than just yelling at me
that you don't like it.

293
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:31,204
The end of day one, Miranda
starts basically shutting down.

294
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,441
So, I had a front
and a back piece,

295
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:37,477
a chicken staring at us.

296
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:40,614
I guess I'm 20% of
the way where I wanna be.

297
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:54,427
The start of the day
is very nerve-wracking.

298
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,962
We'd have to take
into consideration,

299
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,297
is this gonna float?

300
00:12:57,365 --> 00:12:59,499
Is the paint gonna
bleed into the water?

301
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:03,036
Really makes me nervous.

302
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,171
I like the white one
to be honest.

303
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,841
I haven't done a latex skin
like this before.

304
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:09,843
What jobs have you worked on?

305
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,678
I sculpted for this guy's film.

306
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:13,980
- What was the name of the film?
- And I helped around--

307
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,248
I don't remember.

308
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,850
Did you go on set
for that at all?

309
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,151
No.

310
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,419
And how long did it
take you to do--

311
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,521
Why are you, like,
drilling me right now?

312
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,757
I'm trying to figure out
what you've done.

313
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:24,958
I don't know you.

314
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:26,559
She obviously
doesn't respect me,

315
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,129
and she doesn't really
give me a chance.

316
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,431
I don't understand why
it was such a big deal

317
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:32,632
in what I was doing.

318
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,533
You-- you became
defensive when

319
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:34,934
I started asking you what your

320
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:36,202
credentials were, okay?

321
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,305
Because it seemed
like you were asking me

322
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:43,076
in a way that was indicating,
"oh, you haven't done anything."

323
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,445
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

324
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:48,648
Patrick and I are here
to check out your work.

325
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:51,751
So here comes
McKenzie and Patrick.

326
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,920
I'm a little nervous because
he's a great artist,

327
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:56,189
and anything he says,
you've gotta listen to it.

328
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:59,526
Hey!
So our team of three.

329
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:02,329
I am so excited to see
Patrick in the lab.

330
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:05,098
I love his work,
I love <i>underworld.</i>

331
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,467
We wanted this dragon to be
a representative of the sea

332
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:09,035
and a guardian of the sea.

333
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:10,470
You guys have
a plan for the legs?

334
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:11,971
We have-- Already have
molding the arms,

335
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,506
- the whole texture on the arms.
- Uh-huh.

336
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:14,574
What we're gonna do is maybe

337
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:16,042
just do a brush-up
with the latex

338
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,211
- and...
- And use some of those pieces?

339
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,579
Yes, and use some of
the pieces on the legs.

340
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,115
- Hey, Matt and Tara.
- Hey.

341
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:23,316
- Hi, guys.
- How you doing?

342
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,284
Great.

343
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:25,251
Something about the water

344
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,619
that makes things move,

345
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:28,188
are you planning that as well?

346
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:30,090
We're running around
those ideas, but we're, uh,

347
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:32,425
we're kinda iffy on the material
to use right now.

348
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:34,160
- Right, right.
- And we just need to hammer

349
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:36,162
down on the--
the exact concept

350
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,664
of the certain fins
and the shape.

351
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:39,132
So you're basically
conceptualizing

352
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,167
as you're moving forward.
Yeah.

353
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:42,335
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

354
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,371
Thank you.

355
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:45,472
- How are you doing?
- Hi.

356
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,207
It's coming along.

357
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:48,575
He's gonna be wearing
a three-piece suit, actually.

358
00:14:48,642 --> 00:14:50,176
- Yeah.
- Really?

359
00:14:50,244 --> 00:14:51,644
He's a lawyer.

360
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:52,912
Looking good.
Good luck, guys.

361
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,481
- Good luck.
- Awesome.

362
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:55,882
- Hey, Nix, hey, Jerry.
- How's it going?

363
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,551
We're doing
a Ridley's sea turtle.

364
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:00,720
It's an interesting choice.

365
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:03,189
The turtle is
a pretty streamlined shape.

366
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:04,657
It's underwater.

367
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,659
The same sort of the appeal
of all the things

368
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,795
that are flowing
just sell the water better.

369
00:15:08,863 --> 00:15:10,296
We did talk about that.

370
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:12,999
One of the benefits of water
is undulating, trailing--

371
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:14,367
- Mm-hmm, right, right.
- Materials.

372
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,568
But then we thought,
everyone's gonna do that.

373
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,404
We're not putting
too many twists

374
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,272
and turns into our pieces.

375
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,041
There's just gonna be
cool textures and paint job.

376
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:24,411
It looks to me like you paid
attention to the fish quite,

377
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:25,912
and I think it's important that

378
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,680
there definitely is
a fish face.

379
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:30,250
I know some people were going
kinda more of a character,

380
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:33,953
but we-we've decided to take
a more literal approach.

381
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:35,488
Those pieces are what?

382
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,956
They're gonna be
those little, uh--

383
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,125
This is where we're
gonna anchor the big fin.

384
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:40,593
That's it, got you.

385
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:41,995
So you guys are
working well together?

386
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:43,563
Feel it's all happening?

387
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:45,932
I think we sat down,
kind of talked about

388
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,167
exactly what
we wanted to get done,

389
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:48,435
so we're on the same page.

390
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:49,669
You feel
you're on the same page.

391
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:50,570
- Very good.
- Well, good.

392
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:51,571
It's funny because Miranda

393
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,072
just instantly lies.

394
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,141
She's like, "oh,
everything's great."

395
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,011
You can't just say
something that's not true.

396
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,648
- All right, good luck.
- Thank you.

397
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:05,385
So, let's start with Sue,
Brea and Rayce,

398
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,921
who are doing
the leafy sea dragon.

399
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:09,322
Um, what are your thoughts?

400
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,024
Those are guys
are creating something

401
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,060
that to me looks
absolutely great.

402
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:15,929
Who are you most
concerned about?

403
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:17,363
Matt and Tara,

404
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:18,598
I think are the one
that would concern me.

405
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,532
- Why?
- Because they don't have

406
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,301
a full-blown plan.

407
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,570
They have a lot of things that
they haven't resolved yet.

408
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:26,506
Okay, so Nix
and Jerry's sea turtle?

409
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:29,742
I'm not crazy about the sculpt
on the face of the turtle.

410
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,578
It's a little cartoony.

411
00:16:31,645 --> 00:16:33,947
What are your thoughts on
Athena and Heather's lion fish?

412
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:36,149
I'm a little bit
concerned about how much

413
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,617
we're gonna see
that mouth opening.

414
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:38,885
You don't want
this thing to look like

415
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:40,854
a big pull-on mask
for Halloween.

416
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:43,122
Right.

417
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,724
All right, guys.

418
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:45,825
Can't wait to see
what you come up with.

419
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:46,893
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

420
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:48,728
Take care, bye.

421
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,166
I think the only way this isn't

422
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:54,667
gonna work is if
we don't get finished.

423
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,035
Yeah.

424
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,739
Um...

425
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,276
Yeah.

426
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:04,410
I don't wanna have them say

427
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:05,912
it looks like
three people doing it.

428
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,947
To make this
a cohesive character,

429
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:10,483
all of our sculptures
have to have

430
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,385
some kind of element
that's relatable.

431
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:15,722
As long as there's
none that bend back in,

432
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:17,223
so that if they're underwater,
they can have like,

433
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,992
a flow off of them,
kinda that aerodynamic...

434
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,493
Okay.

435
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,095
After I finish the sculpture,

436
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:23,496
I make a mold of it.

437
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,132
So that you're left with
a negative impression

438
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,767
of your original sculpture.

439
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:29,536
Once you pour foam latex in,

440
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:31,971
it has to bake
for quite a few hours.

441
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,774
We wanna have that baking
by the time we leave tonight.

442
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:38,411
All right, what do you
want me to do now?

443
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:39,412
Uh, mold that arm.

444
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,713
I can sculpt.

445
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,282
Plan was to have the head
totally finished

446
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:44,617
and I'm willing to let him
run the paint job.

447
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:47,287
I've heard how good he is,
but I haven't seen it.

448
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,721
- Hey, Beki?
- Yeah?

449
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,290
I have a question.
Should I, like, build a wall?

450
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:52,725
I'm just worried it'll--
It won't be able to stay.

451
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:53,927
I start getting very concerned.

452
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:56,863
I'm realizing how very little

453
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:58,131
experience she really has.

454
00:17:58,198 --> 00:17:59,465
You think you could
help me open this?

455
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,401
I can't figure out
how to open it.

456
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:02,468
She's just killing me.

457
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:08,107
Are you guys feeling confident?

458
00:18:08,175 --> 00:18:11,177
No, because time is the only
thing that will make her-- Me

459
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:12,545
feel comfortable with her.

460
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,180
I'm frustrated.

461
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:17,917
I feel like I've been working
as fast as I possibly can.

462
00:18:17,985 --> 00:18:19,686
Also, coaching Miranda

463
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:23,056
is making me a little bit
anxiety-ridden

464
00:18:23,123 --> 00:18:26,092
simply because I can't hold
the whole boat on my own.

465
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:31,931
The way Beki is saying
everything to me

466
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:35,835
is just rude and mean,

467
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,970
and it's kind of a nightmare.

468
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:38,605
This is not finished yet here.

469
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,840
I put that in
and you called me over

470
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:41,774
to help you with that,
so I did.

471
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:43,009
Then I'll blow dry them

472
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:44,177
and they'll be ready
to pop out.

473
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:45,345
You're sure
there's nothing else

474
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,846
you'd rather me
be doing that this?

475
00:18:46,914 --> 00:18:49,082
Because if so, speak now.

476
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,584
Miranda is getting really
aggressive with me.

477
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:52,685
And honestly, I don't feel like

478
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:54,954
I need to prove myself to you,
like...

479
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:56,856
You don't need to
prove yourself to me.

480
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:58,191
You need to prove
yourself to the nation

481
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,026
because you're on <i>Face Off.</i>

482
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:05,836
Beki and Miranda aren't
gelling together

483
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:07,305
very well at this point.

484
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:09,440
Communication isn't quite there.

485
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:10,741
Just, ugh!

486
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:12,576
If you feel
I'm being so inadequate

487
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:14,245
with my time,
then I'll do something else.

488
00:19:14,313 --> 00:19:17,281
- I think you should pre-paint
because it might take you

489
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:19,050
a little while
to get what you want.

490
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,953
Miranda's pretty adamant
about doing the painting,

491
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,956
and if she paints
as fast as she sculpts,

492
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:26,390
that thing's never
gonna get painted.

493
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:34,565
Day two's almost done.

494
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,467
Got the face molded,
ready for foam.

495
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:39,537
Got a lot of our fins cast up.

496
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:42,573
Should be doing
pretty good for tomorrow.

497
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,042
All right, guys, time's up.

498
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:49,714
Come on, peeps, let's go!

499
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,390
Look at Athena, skipping in

500
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,692
like she doesn't even have
a ten-hour day.

501
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,160
That's cute.

502
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:04,929
So it looked like
you were stressing a little.

503
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:06,931
Uh, just a little.

504
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,066
Miranda and I had a fight,

505
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:11,102
and I feel like
that showed some of

506
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:12,636
the worst parts of both of us.

507
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,005
She's still new, though,
isn't she?

508
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,374
Today I'm asking her
what her credentials are,

509
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:19,477
and she started just,
immediately getting defensive.

510
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:22,380
It's just like,
she's so threatened by me.

511
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:25,616
Beki told Miranda to her face
that she was incompetent

512
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,084
and that she should not be here.

513
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:31,055
I caught Beki scolding
Miranda like a child,

514
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:35,159
and...You just-- You should
never do that to someone.

515
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:37,695
And if something takes you
longer than so and so hours,

516
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:38,829
- you shouldn't be here.
- Look at you.

517
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:40,331
If you didn't have
me on your team

518
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,533
doing the work, you would
have nothing done, homegirl.

519
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,769
Hoo!

520
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:47,071
She's jealous
'cause she didn't win.

521
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:48,706
She's walking around
saying, "I let you win

522
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:50,941
because I wanted you
to redeem yourself."

523
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:52,543
You're not
letting me win anything.

524
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:54,145
I'm dope.
That's why I'm here.

525
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,313
For your information, that's why
I have my own company.

526
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:57,581
Because I'm dope.

527
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,762
So application day--
We have four hours

528
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,631
to apply our prosthetics,
get it painted,

529
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:14,799
have everything finished,

530
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:16,133
with an hour
to do final touch-ups.

531
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:22,907
I'll tell you what, dude,

532
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:24,075
I cannot wait
to paint this turtle.

533
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:29,547
Beautiful.
Beautiful, beautiful.

534
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:36,253
Hi, how are you doing?

535
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,755
- Good, I'm Sara.
- I'm Beki.

536
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:38,756
It's so nice to meet you.

537
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:40,024
Are you our model?

538
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,559
- I think so.
- Perfect.

539
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,861
Four hours seems like a long
time to do a makeup application,

540
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,330
but when you're doing a full
body with multiple pieces

541
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:48,099
it-- it goes by in a flash.

542
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,867
There'll be a--
One prosthetic piece,

543
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:52,269
and this will go all the way
down to your...Crotch area.

544
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:53,871
This part goes here, okay.

545
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:56,340
- My hoo-hah.
- Yes, and then...

546
00:21:56,408 --> 00:21:58,275
If it's cool with you,
it'd be awesome

547
00:21:58,343 --> 00:21:59,343
- if you could shave your legs.
- Yeah, yeah.

548
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:01,112
So you're-- you're a lawyer.

549
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:04,215
- Shark lawyer.
- That's clever, dude.

550
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:08,119
We really have
to bring something extra

551
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:09,520
with this leafy sea dragon.

552
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:12,156
Being that a team of two
picked it as well.

553
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,959
Now it's a duel of whose leafy
sea dragon's gonna be better?

554
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:18,562
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

555
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,733
We have over 15 appliances,
plus the paint job.

556
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,503
Holy crap, half of that
would have sufficed

557
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,704
for a team of three.

558
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:27,905
I'm getting
a little worried now.

559
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:40,217
I'm gonna glue it
in the side of the foam.

560
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:42,920
Gonna have you grab and hold
onto this kind of a little bit.

561
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,388
We have to apply bald cap.

562
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:46,457
We have to apply
facial prosthetic,

563
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:48,993
two arm pieces,
and two leg pieces.

564
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,861
It's a lot of stuff to apply,

565
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,197
and I hope that I'll be able
to get the paint job

566
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:55,699
done on time.

567
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:04,608
So our model, Ethan,
he keeps kind of nodding off.

568
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:07,478
Wake up.

569
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:08,812
"Huh?"

570
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,214
I can't believe
he, like, passes out

571
00:23:10,282 --> 00:23:11,749
in, like, three seconds.

572
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:14,752
We have a narcoleptic
lionfish man today.

573
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:18,055
I'm gonna kill you right now.

574
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:25,963
I don't know what happened.

575
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,232
There's so many chunks
missing from the edges.

576
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,201
First thing the judges are
gonna look at is the edges.

577
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:31,669
When you have
a nice blended edge,

578
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:32,970
you shouldn't see it at all.

579
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:34,872
And it just makes
the character more real.

580
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:39,143
I'm really stressing that

581
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:40,878
we're not gonna be able to
get these edges down.

582
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:42,613
How are we gonna hide these?

583
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,848
So we're feeling
a little nervous

584
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,416
that we're not gonna be able
to pull off this makeup.

585
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:53,991
Look at that, dude,
custom color, bro.

586
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,360
What do you think, dude?

587
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:59,163
It's a little cartoony.

588
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,431
So you don't like
the paint job,

589
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:01,865
or you just think it
needs to be tweaked?

590
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:05,069
I don't actually
like it, but, you know...

591
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:07,805
I'm starting to get that queasy
feeling in my stomach,

592
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:10,774
thinking that I just knocked out
some really cool sculpts

593
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:12,643
in a short amount of time,

594
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:16,113
and now, they're going to get
saddled with an awful paint job.

595
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:17,715
I mean, because of time,
would you mind

596
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:19,083
if I just kinda
wrapped up the back?

597
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,117
Yeah, that's fine.

598
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,819
One hour left.

599
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:33,230
So we're just doing a...

600
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:34,331
I don't know yet.

601
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,500
My whole mantra with makeup is

602
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:37,935
if you can't hide it,
flaunt it.

603
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:40,337
So, my brilliant plan is to

604
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:42,906
cover these massive edges
with fabric.

605
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:44,675
I don't wanna cover up
your sculpt too much,

606
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:45,876
'cause it's pretty,
but I--

607
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,045
We just have
to do the edge that way.

608
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,580
Since we don't have much time,

609
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:53,517
the fabric has to be
applied at the last looks.

610
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:54,952
It'll be okay, Matt,
it'll be okay.

611
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,387
All right, all right.

612
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:58,856
I'm really thinking
she's out of her mind.

613
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:00,424
Coming up...

614
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:01,792
Let's put your
makeups to the test

615
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,127
in our water tank.

616
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:05,996
We're in big trouble.

617
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:07,731
This is an incredible look.

618
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,967
The paintjob was amazing.

619
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:12,870
I did not like this makeup.

620
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:21,032
It's last looks.

621
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,467
Whoo, the last hour.

622
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,903
We got a lot of detailing to do

623
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:27,371
and finishing stuff.

624
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,706
Shell is on, baby.

625
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:30,041
That ain't going anywhere.

626
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,343
We should start
fabric-ing I guess.

627
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:33,711
We're scrapping
blending the seams,

628
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,513
which is a big no-no in my book.

629
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:37,215
And Tara's trying
to reassure me that

630
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:39,417
we can hide those
with the fabric.

631
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:40,518
How lo2 would you say
till you're ready

632
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:41,919
to help me with the paint?

633
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:43,354
'Cause I can't paint
the whole thing alone.

634
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:45,790
I will help you paint
as soon as I get these fins on.

635
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:47,191
Just like I said I would.

636
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:52,096
You think we should
lose the fins?

637
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:53,397
Yeah.

638
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:54,665
They just turned out
to look like.

639
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,735
We have no choice,
we have to do it.

640
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:58,836
And pose with your fists.

641
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:01,973
Hey, guys, time's up.

642
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,441
I was really disappointed.

643
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,543
It was definitely one of
the key parts of our makeup,

644
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,911
and we had to take it off.

645
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:08,079
It's not a finished work.

646
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,958
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

647
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:25,229
Now, tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

648
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,864
But let's say hello
to your judges.

649
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:29,400
Owner of optic nerve
makeup effects studio,

650
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:30,935
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hello.

651
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:32,870
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist,

652
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:34,539
- Ve Neill.
- Welcome back.

653
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:36,040
And creature designer
and director,

654
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:37,341
Patrick Tatopoulos.

655
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:38,843
Hi, guys.

656
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:41,412
So, guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

657
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,647
was to work in teams.

658
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,215
And to find a sea creature

659
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,583
from the aquarium
of the pacific

660
00:26:45,651 --> 00:26:48,186
to use as inspiration
for your unique makeups.

661
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:51,189
You were also asked
to make them waterproof.

662
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:57,028
I'm standing there, and I'm
looking over at this huge tank,

663
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,463
and I'm getting
a little nervous.

664
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:00,865
Let's take a look
at your makeups

665
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:03,267
before they go
in our water tank.

666
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:25,990
I'm glad we decided to go with
the fabric and hide the edges,

667
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:27,658
because it looks
like colorful scales.

668
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:49,914
It doesn't look good.

669
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,782
As soon as his back faces us,

670
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,084
I notice that
there's skin showing.

671
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:13,204
We feel like our
character's execution

672
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:14,605
is a little lacking right now.

673
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:16,607
But she's gonna be going out

674
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,109
in the water in a few minutes,

675
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,411
and we're really gonna
see that ethereal look.

676
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,368
I know he's still really
visually striking,

677
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:45,670
but I'm a little nervous that

678
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:48,406
maybe now we don't
have enough pieces.

679
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:11,629
Despite all of the shenanigans
between Miranda and I,

680
00:29:11,697 --> 00:29:13,464
we actually created
an amazing creature.

681
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:16,167
And I can visualize what it's
gonna look like in the water.

682
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,368
It will be beautiful.

683
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,058
I see big grins
on people's faces

684
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:43,694
when they see our shark dude.

685
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:44,895
I think we might have this.

686
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:52,703
So let's put
your makeups to the test

687
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:55,039
by submerging your models
in our water tank.

688
00:29:56,908 --> 00:30:00,111
First up is Tara
and Matt's creation.

689
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:06,050
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

690
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:11,689
We're a little worried,
because...

691
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:13,991
We never even tested
the makeup that we used.

692
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,359
It may crack.

693
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,328
I'm also a little worried

694
00:30:17,396 --> 00:30:19,397
how well the model will do
in the water.

695
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:22,333
She may freak out
and rip off the prosthetic.

696
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:24,769
This is it, guys, sink or swim.

697
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,740
Wow.

698
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,609
Everybody gasped
when she got in the water.

699
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:34,345
That looks really cool
in the water.

700
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:37,615
Everything's staying on,
she's sparkling,

701
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:40,251
you can't see the edges--they're
all disguised by the fabric.

702
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:43,954
Yeah, it looks terrific.

703
00:30:47,225 --> 00:30:48,259
Well, this was
a really clever way

704
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:49,727
to hide all their edges.

705
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,765
Next up is Nix
and Jerry's creation.

706
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,136
When our turtle
gets into the water,

707
00:30:59,204 --> 00:31:00,638
it's already kind of awkward.

708
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:02,606
You can see the back part of
the shell starting to lift up.

709
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:06,210
He goes underwater for a moment
and comes right back up.

710
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:08,679
The water is just
caving in on him.

711
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:11,549
He can't breathe.

712
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,184
We're in big trouble.

713
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:19,304
Next up is Nix
and Jerry's creation.

714
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,939
Something's wrong.

715
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:22,307
He goes underwater
for a moment,

716
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,909
and he comes right back up.

717
00:31:23,977 --> 00:31:26,211
Gee, he's having
some major blowouts.

718
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,115
A cloud starts
forming around him of paint.

719
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:32,084
Everything
but the shoulders is up.

720
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,719
We're in big trouble.

721
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:35,621
The shell is completely
floating off.

722
00:31:35,688 --> 00:31:38,223
I don't enjoy
doing mediocre work.

723
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,858
Hey!

724
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,360
I'm pretty good.

725
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:44,763
But you're as strong
as your weakest link.

726
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:47,800
Next, we have Sue,
Rayce, and Brea's creation.

727
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:54,039
I think that
if those weren't made

728
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:55,941
with such thick, stiff wire,

729
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:58,076
they'd be lighter
and they'd be moving a lot.

730
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:00,212
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

731
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,247
The model is
selling the makeup.

732
00:32:02,315 --> 00:32:03,415
It's beautiful.

733
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:04,583
All right, let's look

734
00:32:04,651 --> 00:32:05,784
at Heather and Athena's
creation.

735
00:32:05,852 --> 00:32:07,186
Okay.

736
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:10,823
- Nice.
- Whoo hoo, yes.

737
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,525
As soon as he jumps
into that water tank,

738
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:17,496
he, like, becomes
like a fish in the water.

739
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:19,598
The mouth is actually
really fantastic.

740
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,733
Oh, look at the little things
around him, all moving.

741
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:22,835
- Right.
- Good.

742
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:24,603
Oh, yes.

743
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:26,472
Now we need to applaud.
Yeah, this is good.

744
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:28,607
Now, let's see Ian and RJ's.

745
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:32,478
He gets into the water, and
immediately his clothes pop up.

746
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:42,654
All right, let's see
Beki and Miranda's.

747
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,196
This looks way better
underwater than it did out.

748
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:52,097
Totally, totally.

749
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:59,738
Well, the judges have scored
your creations, so...

750
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:01,707
Let's see what they thought.

751
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:06,278
Beki and Miranda...

752
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:11,583
Brea, Rayce, and Sue...

753
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:14,253
Your teams are safe.

754
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,554
You can head back
to the makeup room.

755
00:33:15,622 --> 00:33:16,455
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

756
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:17,723
Thank you.

757
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,791
Me and Beki worked
horribly as a team,

758
00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:22,694
so I'm excited that
we were called safe.

759
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:27,432
All right, the rest
of you were the best

760
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,203
and the worst of this week.

761
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:32,971
So the judges would like
to speak with each of you

762
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,106
to learn more about your work.

763
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:35,507
Heather and Athena,

764
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:36,542
would you please step forward?

765
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:46,585
I did not like this makeup.

766
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:49,454
I actually loved it.

767
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:50,722
I thought it was really cool.

768
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,424
Oh, my God, thank you.

769
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:54,793
You made some really,
really brave decisions.

770
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:56,328
Could you tell us
a little bit about

771
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:57,829
who did what on this makeup?

772
00:33:57,897 --> 00:34:01,833
I sculpted the face
and the backs of the legs, and--

773
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:04,202
And I did the whole paint job,
from head to toes.

774
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,604
I think it came out
really well.

775
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:08,040
All in all, it was really
successful as far as,

776
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,441
you know, holding up
in the water,

777
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:11,643
which was one of the challenges,
so good job, ladies.

778
00:34:11,711 --> 00:34:13,579
- Thank you.
- I love it.

779
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:16,515
I walk yesterday in the shop,
and I saw your work,

780
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:19,518
and I thought those were
the only two that decided

781
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,987
to do something that's
very much of a fish,

782
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,890
and not some kind
of hybrid man-fish face.

783
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,059
And I thought that
was a very bold choice.

784
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:29,628
- Great work.
- Thank you.

785
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:32,130
Thank you.
You can both step back.

786
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,368
Jerry and Nix, if you
would please step forward.

787
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:44,910
Okay, who did what
on this fiasco, guys?

788
00:34:44,978 --> 00:34:45,944
I led sculpturally,

789
00:34:46,012 --> 00:34:48,313
then Nix led painting.

790
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:52,651
I gotta tell you, your turtle
was a turd, I'm sorry.

791
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,654
I think the best thing on your
turtle was his shoulders,

792
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:57,923
and unfortunately,
the minute he got in the water,

793
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,858
everything blew off,
which was kind of a bummer.

794
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:01,627
I mean, was it glued on at all?

795
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:04,930
- Yeah.
- And it all blew off anyway?

796
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,633
Damn!

797
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,034
One of the key thing
about this sculpt

798
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:10,636
is it looks very,
very cartoonish,

799
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:12,638
which is actually
very dangerous because

800
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:15,574
the paint job using green
and brown together

801
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:19,378
on the same character
was very risky.

802
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:22,414
If one of you is the person
who ends up hanging tonight,

803
00:35:22,482 --> 00:35:24,416
which do you
think it should be?

804
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:28,153
Just for application,
I would say Jerry.

805
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:29,621
He threw me under the bus.

806
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:32,791
I can't believe
you just did that, dude.

807
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:34,893
- Jerry?
- Uh...

808
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:37,229
I'm not gonna throw
Nix under the bus.

809
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:39,698
You know, I'm gonna say
we're equally responsible.

810
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:41,266
I will agree with that.

811
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:45,671
We are both
equally responsible.

812
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:47,172
Thank you, guys.
You can step back.

813
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:51,510
Tara and Matt, you're next.

814
00:35:56,749 --> 00:35:59,751
Tell me who did
what on this makeup.

815
00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:02,154
Uh, I handled the sculpting
of the prosthetic,

816
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,722
the chest and the fins.

817
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,457
Um, I headed up the paint job,

818
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:07,793
and I also wanna say he came up
with the creature idea.

819
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,996
I'll tell you right away that
this is an incredible work.

820
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:12,097
I'm very impressed with it.

821
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:13,865
I think your color scheme,

822
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,701
the way you played
with the appliance,

823
00:36:15,768 --> 00:36:17,335
the way this functions
in the water,

824
00:36:17,403 --> 00:36:18,570
it's a gorgeous piece.

825
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:19,705
Thank you.

826
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:20,839
I agree, and I think this is

827
00:36:20,907 --> 00:36:23,075
an absolutely fantastic makeup.

828
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:25,410
The little filigree work
that's in the sculpture

829
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:26,812
absolutely thrilled me.

830
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:27,946
Well done.

831
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,314
The idea that you took that

832
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:31,516
iridescent fabric and
put it around the edges

833
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:33,618
of all your appliances
was a very clever way

834
00:36:33,686 --> 00:36:34,853
to hide your edges,

835
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:36,922
and it did nothing
but enhance the makeup.

836
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:38,890
Yeah.

837
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:41,927
All right, thank you.
You can step back.

838
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:45,931
Rj and Ian,
please come to the center.

839
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,300
Glenn, let's start with you.

840
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:51,002
Please start by telling us
a little bit about the concept.

841
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,904
It's a zebra shark.

842
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:55,173
Uh, he's a lawyer.

843
00:36:55,241 --> 00:37:00,178
And a shark lawyer.

844
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:02,981
In your opinions,
how well do you feel

845
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,015
you did with this makeup?

846
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:05,717
I actually was really happy

847
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,819
with how it turned out.

848
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:09,121
I think that
the hands could have been

849
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,655
executed a little bit better.

850
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:15,260
I'll go so far as to agree
with you on that wholeheartedly.

851
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:16,828
If you're gonna put
clothes on somebody

852
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:18,463
that's going into the water,

853
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:21,066
you should have sewn him
into those things

854
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:22,634
because the minute
he hit the water,

855
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:25,804
everything covered up
your makeup job.

856
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:28,140
Uh, I think that kind of
blew it for you.

857
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:30,909
If I go home over
a terrible wardrobe choice

858
00:37:30,977 --> 00:37:34,246
and having a clean makeup,
I'm gonna be pretty upset.

859
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:35,514
All right, guys,
can you please step back?

860
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:38,784
Thank you.

861
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:41,653
Okay, the judges have heard
what you've all had to say.

862
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:43,221
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

863
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:45,624
while they make their decision.

864
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:49,594
All right, judges.
Okay, let's talk about

865
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:51,730
some of the best and
the worst looks of the night.

866
00:37:51,798 --> 00:37:53,465
Let's start with
Heather and Athena.

867
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:54,566
What are you thoughts?

868
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:56,468
I really liked that lionfish.

869
00:37:56,536 --> 00:37:57,969
I thought it was really
well-done.

870
00:37:58,037 --> 00:37:59,538
Heather was a very big driver.

871
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:02,240
She was the one in charge
of the sculpt of the face.

872
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:04,843
Kudos to her for being able
to let go of the wheel

873
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:06,244
when it came
to the body painting,

874
00:38:06,312 --> 00:38:07,279
because it
was the right choice.

875
00:38:07,346 --> 00:38:08,747
Athena killed that paintjob.

876
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:10,582
Matt and Tara's?

877
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,018
It was Matt's design
and direction.

878
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,754
Where do we bring Tara into this
as far as her contributions?

879
00:38:15,822 --> 00:38:18,623
Well, I think she's mainly
responsible for the coloring.

880
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,458
As beautiful as the sculpt
is and the design...

881
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:21,793
Yeah.

882
00:38:21,861 --> 00:38:23,128
A bad paint job could have
sank that thing.

883
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,931
Yeah, it could have.
And the paint job was amazing.

884
00:38:25,998 --> 00:38:27,632
Jerry and Nix.

885
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,568
It was a turd-le.

886
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:32,337
They were the guys that said
that they wanted to play safe,

887
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:34,739
and I don't know they realize
that they played the opposite.

888
00:38:34,807 --> 00:38:36,575
They played very risky to me.

889
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:38,977
Why would they paint it
that bright green

890
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:40,912
when they had everything
else in the beige tones?

891
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,314
That-- It didn't go.

892
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:43,715
Ultimately, the result

893
00:38:43,783 --> 00:38:45,417
shows you that there was
a complete disconnection

894
00:38:45,484 --> 00:38:48,854
between both sides of the work,
and it's just terrible.

895
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:51,756
Okay, so any thoughts
on Ian and RJ, then?

896
00:38:51,824 --> 00:38:53,558
It was just kind of a mess.

897
00:38:53,626 --> 00:38:55,293
They didn't glue
his clothes down,

898
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:57,362
they didn't put the fins
in the right place.

899
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,898
That idea seems
like one of those

900
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:01,499
first ideas that you blurt out.

901
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:03,735
Yeah, yeah,
I couldn't agree more.

902
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:06,404
So, judges, have you
reached your decision yet?

903
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:07,639
I think we did.

904
00:39:07,707 --> 00:39:08,773
- Yeah, we have.
- Yep.

905
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:12,611
Okay, let's bring
them back out.

906
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:21,386
All right, Glenn, why don't you

907
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:24,623
tell us about
the top looks tonight?

908
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,827
Our top teams are...

909
00:39:28,895 --> 00:39:31,463
Heather and Athena,
with the lionfish.

910
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,633
Really bold decisions and
an extremely even collaboration

911
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,768
between the two of you.

912
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:42,107
And Matt and Tara
with the basslet.

913
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:45,677
A unique concept and
extremely clean execution.

914
00:39:45,745 --> 00:39:48,413
So then, which team
came out on top?

915
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:50,749
The top team tonight is...

916
00:39:58,126 --> 00:40:00,061
The top team tonight is...

917
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:11,506
Matt and Tara with the basslet.

918
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:18,646
- Congratulations, Matt, Tara.
- Thank you.

919
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:20,014
But we can only
have one winner,

920
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:21,382
so, Glenn, who would that be?

921
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,084
Tonight's winner is...

922
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,922
Matt.

923
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,023
Thank you.

924
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:30,324
We felt that you contributed

925
00:40:30,392 --> 00:40:32,593
the defining conceptual element

926
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:37,298
that really drove the piece
to its final form.

927
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,100
- Congratulations, Matt.
- Thank you.

928
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,068
You and Tara can head back
to the makeup room.

929
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:43,371
I can't believe it.
This is my first win.

930
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:44,939
To me, it's like
a dream come true.

931
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,841
Yay, we knew it.

932
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,442
He the-- He's
the ultimate winner though.

933
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,945
Just to hear the judges
comment positively on my work

934
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:52,780
and praise it
is all I really wanted.

935
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,818
Athena, Heather,
you are also safe.

936
00:40:57,886 --> 00:40:59,053
You can head back
to the makeup room.

937
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,922
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

938
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:02,156
- Hell of a job.
- Good luck, guys.

939
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:04,458
Thanks.

940
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:07,194
Unfortunately, this means you
are bottom looks this week.

941
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:09,630
So, one of you
will be eliminated.

942
00:41:13,435 --> 00:41:15,269
Please step to the center.

943
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:23,611
Glenn?

944
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,179
Ian and RJ,

945
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:27,949
the random fin placement
and inadequate anatomy

946
00:41:28,016 --> 00:41:29,984
of your creation,
combined with the fact

947
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:33,287
that you blew the opportunity
to work with the entire body--

948
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:36,090
We had a guy in a suit getting
into a tank of water--

949
00:41:36,158 --> 00:41:38,559
Didn't really add up for us.

950
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:41,762
Jerry and Nix,
with your sea turtle...

951
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,465
Poor decision-making,
I think, from the beginning,

952
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:48,002
and an overall lack of quality
in the work in its final form.

953
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,539
So who's going home tonight?

954
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:53,708
The person
going home tonight is...

955
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:01,882
Nix.

956
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:05,786
It just felt like you had
this huge opportunity

957
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:07,955
to show us your
body painting skills tonight,

958
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:09,190
and it wasn't there.

959
00:42:09,257 --> 00:42:10,725
It just didn't happen for you.

960
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:14,228
It's definitely, uh,
a lot-- A lot harder

961
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,130
than I thought it was gonna be.

962
00:42:16,198 --> 00:42:17,999
Nix, I have seen your work,

963
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,333
and I know you're amazing.

964
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:20,301
I'm sorry to see you go, honey.

965
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,769
I really am.

966
00:42:21,837 --> 00:42:23,237
That means a lot
coming from you. Thank you.

967
00:42:23,305 --> 00:42:26,107
Nix, I'm sorry, but you
have been eliminated.

968
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:27,608
It's been great having you
here with us.

969
00:42:27,676 --> 00:42:29,543
But if you would please head
back to the makeup room,

970
00:42:29,611 --> 00:42:31,212
and pack up your kit.

971
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:36,651
It's been an honor.

972
00:42:36,718 --> 00:42:38,319
Sorry.

973
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:44,125
Aww...

974
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:45,993
Yeah, I'm-- I'm
going home, guys.

975
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:47,461
Really, I'm not
ready to go home.

976
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:48,996
I don't feel like
I've had the chance

977
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:50,731
to really show people
what I'm capable of.

978
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:52,933
I'm an artist established
for body painting,

979
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,769
and I'm just gonna have to work
a little harder to show

980
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:57,571
I'm capable of doing
special effects as well.
