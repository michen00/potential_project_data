1
00:00:01,165 --> 00:00:02,732
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,334
The artists were asked
to create something

3
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:05,835
beautiful but deadly...

4
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:07,637
Oh, my gosh.

5
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:09,672
On the stage, sparks flew.

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,907
Shameful.

7
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,942
I did take heavy
direction from Sue.

8
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,310
That's really [Bleep]

9
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:15,245
that you're throwing her
under the bus,

10
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:17,213
'cause you have immunity.

11
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,049
RJ claimed his first victory...

12
00:00:20,117 --> 00:00:23,019
And Athena was sent home.

13
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,788
Now, nine artists remain,
and tonight...

14
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,390
We are not quite done yet.

15
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,926
Oh, hell, she's gonna
cut somebody else.

16
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:32,895
They'll face their
toughest challenge yet.

17
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:34,330
I've got a little something
to tell you

18
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:35,698
about your models.
What?

19
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:38,534
How much more difficult
could this possibly be?

20
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:41,170
- And the pressure rises
to an all-time high.

21
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:42,972
I think we need
to take their teeth casts,

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,274
and I think we can
discuss this afterwards.

23
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:46,276
I just don't like her attitude.

24
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,044
It's vengeance time.

25
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,545
I'm kind of disappointed.

26
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:50,613
It just looked bad.

27
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:54,550
To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress

28
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:57,120
our award-winning
panel of judges.

29
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:59,922
Ve Neill, three-time
Oscar-winning makeup artist

30
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,457
whose work includes
<i>Beetlejuice,</i>

31
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,493
and this summer's
<i>The Amazing Spiderman.</i>

32
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,528
Patrick Tatopoulos,

33
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:08,264
production designer
on this summer's <i>Total Recall</i>

34
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:11,501
and director of <i>Underworld,</i>
<i>Rise Of The Lycans.</i>

35
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:14,103
And Glenn Hetrick,
cutting-edge makeup artist

36
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,405
on <i>The Hunger Games</i>

37
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:18,174
and custom designer
for Lady Gaga.

38
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:20,543
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic

39
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:24,580
and earn $25,000 in makeup
supplies from Alcone,

40
00:01:24,648 --> 00:01:28,151
the reinvented 2012
Toyota Camry hybrid,

41
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,553
and $100,000?

44
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,030
Everyone's a little bummed
about Athena leaving,

45
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:15,832
and it's been a long day.

46
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:17,066
We are all tired.

47
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:19,602
We want to go home
and go to bed...

48
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,070
Hey, guys.

49
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:22,672
And in walks McKenzie.

50
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,107
We are not quite done yet.

51
00:02:24,174 --> 00:02:25,675
- Ooh.
- What?

52
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:27,977
I'm thinking, oh, hell,
she's gonna cut somebody else.

53
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,279
Please come with me.

54
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:33,383
- Oh, snap.
- It's ridiculous.

55
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,185
I don't know what to expect,
but this is what we're here for.

56
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,092
I realize it's been a long day,

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,728
but this is a tough business
with crazy hours,

58
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:48,731
so your next
foundation challenge

59
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:50,633
actually starts right now.

60
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,502
Crap, we're all exhausted,

61
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,705
and our creative, artistic
juices are just not flowing.

62
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:57,106
Let's get to it.

63
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:08,985
A group of amazon, tall,
thin women walk out.

64
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:10,453
This is awesome,

65
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:14,157
because I've been
wanting to do beauty makeup.

66
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:16,859
All the boys are getting sweaty
and clammed out.

67
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,903
Your foundation challenge

68
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,439
is to transform these
beautiful runway models

69
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:31,908
into unremarkable plain Janes.

70
00:03:31,975 --> 00:03:34,343
Thank God we're not doing
beauty makeup.

71
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:35,711
I'm not too good at it.

72
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:38,281
Makeup artists are sometimes
asked to tone down

73
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:41,217
or completely mask the beauty
of a Hollywood starlet.

74
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:43,486
Some good examples
are Nicole Kidman in <i>The Hours,</i>

75
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:45,054
Mariah Carey in <i>Precious,</i>

76
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:47,457
Cameron Diaz
in <i>Being John Malkovich,</i>

77
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:49,625
Charlize Theron in <i>Monster.</i>

78
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:52,094
So in other words,
you're gonna need to do

79
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,597
a complete head-to-toe
make-under.

80
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:57,567
A make-under.

81
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,702
Now we have a special guest
judge here today

82
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,970
to give you some advice.

83
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,206
She was the department head
on huge movies

84
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:05,608
such as <i>Terminator Salvation,</i>

85
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:07,176
<i>Superbad,</i>

86
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:08,878
and she's most well known
for the great make-under

87
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:10,279
that she did on Drew Barrymore

88
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,081
for the film <i>Never Been Kissed.</i>

89
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,650
Please welcome Kim Greene.

90
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,187
- Kim.
- Hi.

91
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:19,555
- Kim Greene is a really
well-known makeup artist

92
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:22,191
in this industry, so I'm excited
for the challenge.

93
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,895
So, Kim, what does it take to
make a successful make-under?

94
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:29,098
Well, first of all, you need
to know your character.

95
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,700
Really think about
who they are,

96
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:33,002
where they came from,
their mental state.

97
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,537
Also, be subtle.

98
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,205
If you add a pimple, don't
make it, like, ridiculous.

99
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:38,774
This is great, because I have
a lot of experience on set,

100
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:41,377
so I'm really good at making
certain types of girls

101
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,412
look like crap.

102
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,948
Okay, the winner of this
week's foundation challenge

103
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,484
will win immunity
and cannot be eliminated.

104
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:51,153
Your models have been
randomly selected for you.

105
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,123
You have two hours
for this challenge.

106
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,859
Good luck, because
your time starts now.

107
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:06,002
The first thing I do
is run into the back room,

108
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:09,105
check the wardrobe,
then grab a wig

109
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,740
and decide what look
I want to go for.

110
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,542
- My name is Beki.
- Hi. Alison.

111
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:18,981
I think I'm gonna go,
like, working girl, you know.

112
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,483
I'm using old-age stipple,

113
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:23,319
which is this latex formula
that allows you

114
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,688
to use that person's skin
in the forms of their face.

115
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:28,824
It makes all those
fine skin wrinkles heavier,

116
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,259
so it ages the person
beautifully.

117
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,762
You'll like looking ugly.
It's gonna be awesome.

118
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,697
Yay.

119
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:37,400
After what happened today,
I really want to win this.

120
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:41,470
I want that immunity so I'll
never feel that unsafe again.

121
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:42,905
This is gonna be fun.

122
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:45,241
I have a personal style
that I like to stick to,

123
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,277
so I start thinking of doing
more of a heroin-chic look.

124
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:50,279
I brought in some,
like, acne scarring

125
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:53,482
under the cheekbones and, uh,
got rid of her eyebrows.

126
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,388
All right, everybody.
This is your 30 minute mark.

127
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:11,033
Time's up.
Brushes down.

128
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,974
- Hi, Sue.
- Hello.

129
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,475
Tell us about your work today.

130
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,477
When I first met my model,
she was very young,

131
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:22,812
had no wrinkles,
very beautiful,

132
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,246
and had a great nose,

133
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,949
so I gave her some old-age
stipple here, here,

134
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,151
and on the nasal labia.

135
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:31,554
I'm not really sure
what this is on her nose.

136
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:33,923
It's a broken nose,
almost really thick.

137
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,925
- Okay.
- So I exaggerated it.

138
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:37,560
Good thinking.
That gives me a back story.

139
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,128
Great.

140
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:43,799
This is a librarian, and
she's so much into her work

141
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,468
that she's always sick.

142
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,103
She's got book residue.

143
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,938
You get those brown smudges
on your fingers.

144
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:51,641
I love that you thought
through her character,

145
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,142
I love that you kept her
totally thin,

146
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,944
and that really helps her
look sick.

147
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,613
She's a small-town girl,
and she came to LA

148
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,148
to be an actress.

149
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:01,317
Didn't quite make it,
and now she's a prostitute.

150
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:03,853
She stands on the corner,
so we've got lots of sunspots

151
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,087
and basic nail polish.

152
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,522
That looks great.
Is this a bruise?

153
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,291
That's a bruise, and I did
slight veining there.

154
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,060
- That's really great.
- Excellent. Thank you.

155
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:14,897
I started with some
subtle shadowing around the eyes

156
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:16,432
and nasal labial areas,
and, along the way,

157
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,667
she kind of turned into

158
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:20,302
a gross character of my mother
from 1989.

159
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,505
I don't know.

160
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:25,007
She is
a drug addict/prostitute.

161
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,643
- Really?
- Who would have thought?

162
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,578
I added the dry, cracked lips.

163
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:32,415
She also has a tattoo
that says "trust me."

164
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:33,549
Where does that come from?

165
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,351
She's constantly lying,

166
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,720
but she doesn't want to believe
that that's who she is.

167
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:39,789
I love the thought process
behind the makeup.

168
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:40,690
Thank you.

169
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,203
All right, Kim, so how
did they do overall?

170
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,971
You guys did great.

171
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:59,575
I'm really impressed by the
stress that you're put under

172
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:01,844
and that you handle it
so beautifully.

173
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:05,681
Who were our more successful
makeups today?

174
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:09,085
Jerry, I loved the detail
in the nails

175
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:12,455
and the "trust me" tattoo
was a nice little touch.

176
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:15,357
Rayce, the newsprint
on her hands

177
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,326
and the capillaries
being broken--

178
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,461
Wonderful, subtle work.

179
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:19,729
Thank you so much.

180
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:21,731
- Ian, you did a great job.
- Thank you.

181
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:24,100
I think the texture work
was really good.

182
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,870
You did really bad makeup
in a really good way.

183
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:29,305
- Thank you.
- All right, Kim.

184
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:34,210
Who is our winner today?

185
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,078
Rayce.

186
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:38,681
Oh. Holy cow.

187
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,649
- Good job.
- Thank-- thank you so much.

188
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:43,519
Rayce, congratulations,
you have won immunity

189
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,187
and cannot be eliminated

190
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:46,489
from this week's
spotlight challenge.

191
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:47,656
- Fantastic.
- All right.

192
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,992
I will see you all tomorrow.

193
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,193
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

194
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,962
The immunity feels good.

195
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,864
I got the top look, and I'm
feeling good about that.

196
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,707
We woke up today,
and Athena's not here.

197
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,942
She's usually always awake,
cooking breakfast,

198
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,778
and, like, always a smile
on her face.

199
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:10,646
I think everyone's
really missing her.

200
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:12,348
I think Beki
should have went home,

201
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:14,250
but since she had immunity,
it saved her ass.

202
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,218
Don't even get me started
with that.

203
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:18,420
The judges gave us
some negative criticisms,

204
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:21,123
and then she throws me
under the bus.

205
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:23,192
When Beki and Sue came onstage,

206
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,095
you just saw Glenn
cover his face.

207
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,030
I know. I didn't think Beki
was gonna do that.

208
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:30,032
Yeah. It might hurt her
in the later challenges.

209
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,135
The one thing we can't do is
throw anyone under the bus.

210
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:36,138
It's vengeance time,
and it's getting real now.

211
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:46,815
So we walk into the lab,
and McKenzie's there, as usual,

212
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:48,750
and it's pretty sparse today.

213
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:52,287
No-- no crazy animals.
No naked people.

214
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:54,590
Some makeups allow for
a certain margin of error,

215
00:09:54,657 --> 00:09:59,962
but today you will face
your toughest challenge yet.

216
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:05,100
Your spotlight challenge
is all about old-age makeup.

217
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,173
Old-age makeups require
very subtle techniques

218
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:14,276
and understanding how
the face and body moves.

219
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:16,378
It's one of the hardest makeups

220
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,148
because there is
no room for error.

221
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:21,483
So before I tell you more,
I need you

222
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:26,755
to divide yourselves
into three teams of three.

223
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:27,656
Oh.

224
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,093
Heather.

225
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:32,861
I hear someone calling
my name, and it's-- it's Sue.

226
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,396
Is this cool?

227
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:36,431
I turn around to Beki, and
with a pleading look in my eyes,

228
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:38,233
like, like, please,
please pick me.

229
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:39,501
Sorry, Sue.

230
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:42,371
So the teams are Beki,
RJ, and Heather.

231
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:43,372
Word.

232
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,240
Tara, Sue, and Matt.

233
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:49,378
I'm nervous because
I have noticed

234
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:52,848
that drama follows each
partnership Sue has.

235
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:56,151
And we've got Jerry,
Ian, and Rayce.

236
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:58,754
I couldn't ask for
better teammates.

237
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:01,123
This is a slam dunk
unless we screw it up.

238
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:02,424
Although this is
a team challenge,

239
00:11:02,492 --> 00:11:05,294
you will be judged
on your individual work.

240
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:07,930
Now let me introduce you
to your new models.

241
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:14,870
- Whoa.
- Holy cow.

242
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,234
We get into the lab today,

243
00:11:21,302 --> 00:11:23,203
and we find out
our next spotlight challenge

244
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,207
is old-age makeup, but
McKenzie has a surprise.

245
00:11:27,274 --> 00:11:31,578
Now let me introduce you
to your new models.

246
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,947
- Whoa.
- Holy cow.

247
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:36,749
Ooh.

248
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:42,121
- Meet your twins-- The Greens,
the Tindals, and the Hornbecks.

249
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:43,823
- Hello.
- Hi.

250
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,959
Now each team will select
a set of twins.

251
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:48,828
You're gonna have to age
one of them to 75

252
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:52,398
and the other one to
the ripe old age of 100.

253
00:11:52,466 --> 00:11:54,033
Oh, cool.

254
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,235
So basically, your makeup

255
00:11:55,302 --> 00:11:56,369
should appear to be
the same person,

256
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,571
but at different stage
of their life.

257
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,542
Holy Moses. This is
going to be so hard.

258
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,510
All right, so we've
predetermined the order

259
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,079
in which your team will pick.

260
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:08,381
Sue, Tara, Matt,
you have number one.

261
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:09,515
Take your pick first.

262
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,017
We choose the boys.

263
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:13,786
- Ian, Jerry, and Rayce.
- Hornbecks.

264
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:15,488
Yeah. I think we'll go
with the hornbecks.

265
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,924
We wanted the Greens anyway.

266
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,759
All right, well,
I know that this challenge

267
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:21,694
is incredibly difficult,
but I've brought in

268
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,764
a very special guest judge
to give you some tips.

269
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:27,467
He has worked on an amazing
array of films,

270
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:29,402
including <i>The Mask,</i>

271
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,671
<i>Watchmen,</i> and <i>A Beautiful Mind.</i>

272
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:34,274
He's also won
three academy awards,

273
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,576
including one for his work
on Brad Pitt

274
00:12:36,644 --> 00:12:39,379
in <i>The Curious Case</i>
<i>Of Benjamin Button.</i>

275
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:41,848
Please welcome Greg Cannom.

276
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:46,019
When you want
an old-age makeup done

277
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:48,288
and you want it done right,
you call up Greg Cannom.

278
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:50,456
He is the king
of old-age makeup.

279
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:53,192
Hi, everybody.
I'm very excited to be here.

280
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,927
So, Greg, do you have any tips

281
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,630
to create a convincingly
realistic old-age makeup?

282
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:00,533
When you do an age makeup,
most people I see do it,

283
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,002
they go out,
and you can't do that.

284
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,637
You have to build up
the clay and everything

285
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:05,972
going straight out that way.

286
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,507
Really make it subtle.

287
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:09,375
Greg will be joining
the judges on stage this week

288
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:10,677
to see your final makeups.

289
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:14,714
Good luck, because
your time starts now.

290
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:18,785
- Hi, I'm Beki.
- Nice to meet you, ladies.

291
00:13:18,852 --> 00:13:21,321
We only have the twins
for 90 minutes,

292
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:23,556
so the first thing is getting
their hands cast

293
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:25,124
and their teeth cast.

294
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:26,859
As soon as this sucker is set,

295
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,895
we will take you out of it.

296
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:31,030
A very simple but effective
way to show aging

297
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:32,598
is in the hands and teeth,

298
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:36,469
so it's important for us
to get those casts made.

299
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:38,638
Of course, you guys have
big, bright blue eyes,

300
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:39,839
which are really difficult.

301
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,377
'Cause 100-year-olds don't have
big, bright blue eyes.

302
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,779
As you get older, obviously
your eyes start to dull out,

303
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,247
so we were like, oh, God,
what are we gonna do?

304
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:52,719
I promise, it will come off.

305
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,821
- Do me a favor.
- What do you need?

306
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:56,055
Get a pen.

307
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:58,658
Straight away,
Sue takes charge,

308
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:01,194
and that worries me,
because Matt and Sue

309
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:04,163
are two of the most
inexperienced out of everyone.

310
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:07,467
I think that if we're
going to do a multi-piece, um--

311
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,469
I think we need to take
their teeth casts first,

312
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:10,770
because we only have
90 minutes with them,

313
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,071
and I think we can
discuss this afterwards.

314
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,640
Okay.

315
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:17,877
Tara's a little bit
more aggressive on this one.

316
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:19,112
Guys, I wonder if we should

317
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:20,546
try to get their hands
while they're here too.

318
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:23,483
I think it's better to
focus on the basics first.

319
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,518
Teeth and hands are bonus.

320
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,392
See if your hands
both fit in there.

321
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,463
Hey, guys,
come and gather round.

322
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,634
So we're working on our twins,

323
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:43,369
and McKenzie walks back in.

324
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:44,670
We're like, oh, [Bleep].

325
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:46,606
What does McKenzie
have to tell us now?

326
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:49,609
How much more difficult
could this possibly be?

327
00:14:49,676 --> 00:14:54,046
I've got a little something
to tell you about your models.

328
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:55,948
They're not really twins.

329
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,717
Guys, come on out.

330
00:14:57,785 --> 00:15:00,787
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

331
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:05,691
That's right.
They are triplets.

332
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,862
Your third model, you're going
to have to age to 50 years old,

333
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,132
so now it is 50, 75, 100.

334
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,368
Now we have three old-age
makeups to do,

335
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,936
and there's three of us.

336
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:20,006
All of a sudden, this challenge
has just gotten a lot harder.

337
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:23,943
- Hey, I'm RJ. What's your name?
- Erlina.

338
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:25,044
Erlina. Great.

339
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:26,979
Where did this child come from?

340
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:28,648
'Cause there's two
that look alike,

341
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,216
and then the third one comes in,
and I'm thinking,

342
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:31,584
y'all playing with us?

343
00:15:31,652 --> 00:15:36,088
Our girl is a fraternal twin
to the identical twins.

344
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:38,124
Well, well, well,
isn't that special?

345
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:39,692
Are you feeling okay?
You look a little worried.

346
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,631
- Are you worried?
- Am I worried? No.

347
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,434
If we kind of go
a little bit of hippie--

348
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:49,602
and then we at least
have a theme

349
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,337
with costume
and stuff like that.

350
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:53,172
We go, like, you know,
older granola head.

351
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,908
Our concept for this is, uh,
hippie chick.

352
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,577
I choose 100 years old.

353
00:15:57,644 --> 00:16:00,146
Ian is tasked
with the 75-year-old,

354
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:02,448
and Rayce has
the 50-year-old.

355
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:10,957
- Okay?
- Okay.

356
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:13,559
You guys have other thoughts?
Matt, do you have an idea?

357
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:16,028
What if we just do he's,
like, a businessman at 50,

358
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:17,163
so he has a business suit?

359
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:18,130
That sounds great.

360
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:23,202
I get assigned
the 100-year-old,

361
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,037
Tara's gonna do
the 75-year-old,

362
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:27,273
and Matt's gonna do
the 50-year-old.

363
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:28,374
You got the alginate ready?

364
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:29,809
Sue was saying, do an ultracal.

365
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:33,246
You don't want to put
anybody's hands in ultracal.

366
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:34,914
That's like putting
their hands in cement.

367
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:36,516
Oh.

368
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,352
We don't pour stone directly
over people's hands.

369
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,388
The heat from the ultracal
could have burned him.

370
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:43,623
That's very dangerous.

371
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,925
So you pour alginate
over their hands,

372
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:49,228
and then you fill the hands
with the ultracal.

373
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,403
Tara gets angry and upset and
says, "oh, you can't do that."

374
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,838
So that starts
a downward spiral.

375
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:01,908
It seems like
she wants to take over, but--

376
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:03,809
She's being real bitchy.

377
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,545
No, no, no, just wrap them
in wet paper towels.

378
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:06,579
- I did.
- Okay.

379
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:07,747
She snaps at me.

380
00:17:07,814 --> 00:17:08,948
I just don't like her attitude.

381
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:11,150
I'm a little offended
right now.

382
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:12,518
I--

383
00:17:12,586 --> 00:17:14,020
Hey, guys, that's time!

384
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:15,988
[Bleep].
This is a nightmare.

385
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:20,174
If we don't pull it together,
our make up won't be cohesive at all.

386
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,683
It is day two
of the old-age challenge,

387
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,185
and we feel great.

388
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:35,589
We jump right back into it.

389
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,359
Oh, I can sculpt
the forehead backwards.

390
00:17:38,426 --> 00:17:40,294
We only have ten hours today,

391
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:43,297
so we just need to
get sculpts done.

392
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:46,166
That's the most important part.

393
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:50,838
You can see there are
some straight lines there,

394
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:53,807
and some of them aren't
as wrinkly as we want.

395
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,276
We're sculpting
tiny nasal folds

396
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:56,877
and eye bags and a brow piece.

397
00:17:56,945 --> 00:18:00,447
These are very subtle things
that can age a person.

398
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:05,486
The goal is to have all three
models aging progressively,

399
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:07,187
the first model
being 50 years old.

400
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,690
We're gonna give her a fat suit
and some jowls,

401
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,760
and then she's an athletic
granny and 75,

402
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,528
'cause she needs to lose
some of her weight.

403
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:16,697
That will take her nicely
into 100,

404
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,766
when she starts to look
a little bit more gaunt.

405
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,301
Since we're doing
such thin appliances,

406
00:18:20,368 --> 00:18:22,303
RJ, Beki, and I have
decided to use silicone,

407
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,637
because it's more translucent,

408
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,606
and it'll look the most
like real skin.

409
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:32,479
Hey, everybody.

410
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,848
I'm here with Glenn and Greg.

411
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,284
We're gonna do a walkthrough
and see how you're doing.

412
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:38,852
Hi, guys.
Hello.

413
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Sue, Matt, Tara.

414
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,288
So how many pieces

415
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:42,256
are you planning on
breaking that down into?

416
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:43,490
Two.

417
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:46,260
I'm going to just get
the nasal folds,

418
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:48,696
because they're so heavy,
like that.

419
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,130
Okay.

420
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:52,299
What materials
are you gonna use?

421
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,001
- We're gonna use silicone.
- All silicone?

422
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,903
Yeah, it's a little tough,
because we're the ones

423
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:59,039
with the least amount of
experience in all of this.

424
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:02,743
- Tara butts in and says we're
the least-experienced group.

425
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,278
Speak for yourself!

426
00:19:04,346 --> 00:19:06,547
She's gonna be heavier
when she's 50,

427
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:08,983
so we'll be doing these--
Do the jowl

428
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,452
and the heavier bagged chin
here.

429
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,487
Are you gonna be doing
any overlapping pieces too?

430
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:15,622
We're gonna do a forehead,
bags, cheek,

431
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,925
and jowls and upper lip.

432
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,159
How many pieces are you doing?

433
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:22,062
The 75-year-old only has
these four,

434
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,664
and neck and forehead,

435
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:25,766
and then the rest
is gonna be stippled.

436
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,167
And the coloring
and everything,

437
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,869
are you gonna really break
it up, mottling and--

438
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:30,471
That's the intention.

439
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:33,440
As she ages, she'll get Tanner.

440
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:38,579
So let's discuss Jerry,
Rayce, and Ian.

441
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:39,813
I'm a little concerned
at the way

442
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,448
that they're approaching
the sculpture.

443
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,250
I don't know that they're
leaving themselves enough time

444
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:45,285
to get down into the subfloor
and the details.

445
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:46,787
And it's hard

446
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,022
by the way they're starting
with the wrinkles.

447
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,289
- Yeah.
- That's not the way to do it.

448
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,692
You have to get all
the shapes in first

449
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,560
and then rough in the wrinkles.

450
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:56,063
Let's move on to Matt,
Sue, and Tara.

451
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:58,966
I think conceptually,
they're the best.

452
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:02,703
I think the 100-year-old
is too subtle and too thin,

453
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:07,508
and it needs to be a lot more
jowly with sagging flesh.

454
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,977
So let's move on to Beki,
RJ, and Heather.

455
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:13,814
I'm really concerned
about Heather's sculpture.

456
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,516
She's not laying the clay on
the right way.

457
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,052
So I think that each team has
a couple of really good ideas

458
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,221
and each team is making
some very serious mistakes.

459
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,624
So I guess we'll see tomorrow.

460
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,459
All right, guys.
Good luck.

461
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:27,594
See you tomorrow.

462
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,802
Once the sculpture's done,
it's time to make a mold.

463
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,638
You cover it in
a cement-like substance,

464
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:38,939
let it set up.

465
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,308
Once it's set up, you open it,

466
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:42,643
and that's the moment of truth.

467
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,983
Only one person
needs to do gelatin.

468
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:52,453
It's really frustrating,
the fact that they have this,

469
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,588
like, bond and, like,
talk quietly with each other.

470
00:20:56,357 --> 00:21:01,028
I can't change their sculpts,
I can't change their methods.

471
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:02,196
I'm a little nervous
about that.

472
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:04,998
We've got three minutes.

473
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:09,603
RJ and I are very worried
about Heather's sloppy molding.

474
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:11,472
Uncomfortable.
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:15,375
Her work is definitely not
conveying an old-age makeup.

476
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:19,813
That's time!

477
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,382
I'm not real confident with
how things are gonna turn out.

478
00:21:30,425 --> 00:21:32,960
Let's see what we have
for silicone.

479
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:36,163
Today is application day.

480
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,966
We've got four hours, and then
we've got an extra hour

481
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:42,369
right before stage
to get everything done.

482
00:21:42,437 --> 00:21:44,872
- That's a good color.
- Yeah. It's nice.

483
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:47,207
Come and look at my edges.

484
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:52,312
My prosthetic has edges
that are a mile thick.

485
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,482
I might as well take
a sander to the edge of it.

486
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:01,088
- Hello.
- Here we go.

487
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:01,989
Hey, girls.

488
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:08,195
What are you
starting with, Rayce?

489
00:22:08,263 --> 00:22:09,730
The nasal labials.

490
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,532
I'm feeling pretty good about
what we've got going on.

491
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,934
Ian and I start laying down
our prosthetics.

492
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:15,369
Oh, does it tickle?

493
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:17,704
Jerry starts applying
his prosthetic.

494
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:20,974
Even though we haven't been
communicating the best,

495
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,410
we did decide to place
the molds and the sculpts

496
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:25,145
of each of the three models.

497
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,313
It's something that will
carry over

498
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,182
to make it look
like the same person.

499
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,716
You're not doing
a bald cap, Sue?

500
00:22:29,784 --> 00:22:31,552
- Oh, I'm just--
- Oh, you're just fitting it?

501
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:33,420
- I'm doing
the 100-year-old.

502
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:36,356
I'm going to do a bald cap,
but each triplet's hair

503
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:40,661
is so thick, it's almost
impossible to flatten it down.

504
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,168
Do you think you're gonna
have enough time

505
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,803
to help me with the hands
at one point?

506
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,606
Um, maybe, if I can
get that hair done.

507
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:54,141
One of the strong points
of my makeup

508
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:55,576
is showing
that receding hairline,

509
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:58,045
but if I do it wrong,
it could be a horrible mess.

510
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,414
You all right?

511
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:05,786
As soon as I start to lay
the prosthetic down,

512
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,021
I notice my model
can't handle it.

513
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,460
Okay, I better
take it off, then.

514
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:15,529
I just have to get
the makeup off her

515
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:18,031
no matter what the cost.

516
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,866
What am I gonna do?

517
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:22,803
I'm worried that if I don't have
makeup to show the judges,

518
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,704
I am going home.

519
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:32,714
My model had
a bad skin reaction.

520
00:23:32,782 --> 00:23:34,450
A new model is on the way,

521
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:36,885
but I've got to get this
laid down

522
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:38,554
before we go to the studio,

523
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:39,955
which about an hour.

524
00:23:47,897 --> 00:23:50,399
Finally, the new model
shows up and, wow,

525
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:55,204
this lady is very tiny,
very small hipped.

526
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:57,272
I have this piece
that's been sculpted

527
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,808
for somebody who has
a much larger head

528
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:01,643
than the person that
I'm applying it to.

529
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:04,079
So what we'll do is
try to get this to fit

530
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:06,849
to your facial features
as much as possible.

531
00:24:14,457 --> 00:24:16,325
- Look like your grandma?
- Yeah.

532
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:17,860
15 minutes.

533
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:20,028
I'm looking around,
and I'm the only one

534
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:22,631
who doesn't have a single drop
of paint on my model.

535
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,333
I am totally screwed.

536
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:32,908
All right.

537
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,577
Hey, everybody, that's time.

538
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:37,379
We're done.
Let's go.

539
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:40,082
Her face looked like
some botched plastic surgery.

540
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,850
I think I'm going home.

541
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:50,993
Last looks is
a make or break situation.

542
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,461
I need to really pull through
on this one.

543
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:55,164
We shall witness
the fastest paint job ever.

544
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:58,700
Sue and Matt and I have to
make them look cohesive,

545
00:24:58,768 --> 00:24:59,701
so I'm hoping
it'll come together

546
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,136
with the paint or the hair.

547
00:25:01,204 --> 00:25:02,838
At least we have the mole.

548
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:04,373
I have to cut the piece
and dart it

549
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,108
like a piece of clothing.

550
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,477
Paint only covers so much.

551
00:25:08,545 --> 00:25:11,446
I'm gonna go right underneath
your nose area right here, okay?

552
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,551
I was gonna do, like,
a really light brown.

553
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:23,926
Time's up, everybody.

554
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:25,360
You only got one hand on her.

555
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:26,895
I didn't get any hands on.
That kind of sucks.

556
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:41,710
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

557
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:45,914
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

558
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:47,482
Say hello to your judges.

559
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,252
Owner of optic nerve makeup
effects studio, Glenn Hetrick.

560
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,853
Hello.

561
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:53,789
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

562
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,224
Good evening.

563
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,858
Creature designer and
director, Patrick Tatopoulos.

564
00:25:56,926 --> 00:25:58,427
Hi, guys.

565
00:25:58,494 --> 00:26:01,296
And you've already met our
special guest judge this week.

566
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:02,698
Please welcome

567
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:05,400
three-time Oscar winning makeup
artist Greg Cannom.

568
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:06,602
Hi, everybody.

569
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:09,738
So this week,
your spotlight challenge

570
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:11,139
was to work in teams

571
00:26:11,207 --> 00:26:13,775
to create a set of old-age
makeups on triplets.

572
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:16,511
Now RJ, the judges
have been made aware

573
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:17,913
that your triplet
had to be replaced

574
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:20,882
with another model,
so, with that,

575
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,551
let's see what
you've all come up with.

576
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:50,012
I'm a little worried
about the hair,

577
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,680
but I think
I'm still safe enough

578
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:53,348
to not be at the bottom look.

579
00:27:12,568 --> 00:27:14,569
Overall, I'm okay with it.

580
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:17,239
I think mine looks
fairly realistic.

581
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,594
I'm really confident
in my makeup.

582
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:41,930
This is the first time
where I feel like

583
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:43,765
I'm gonna put my name on this

584
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,434
and this can be
really good for me.

585
00:28:42,992 --> 00:28:45,494
Overall, 20 feet away,
she looks great.

586
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:47,462
I'm feeling very confident.

587
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,720
It's by far the best sculpture

588
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:13,989
out of any
of the 100-year-olds.

589
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,525
It's the only one that
looks like a real person.

590
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,591
I am stressed out.

591
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:51,126
I am starting
to profusely sweat

592
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:52,661
in areas I did not know sweat.

593
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,457
She looks decent.
Uh, she doesn't look awful.

594
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:24,926
Gave it the old college try
anyway.

595
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:55,257
I feel like I'm in
a little bit of trouble.

596
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:57,425
This is the most
anxious I've been yet.

597
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:58,560
I know that she could
look better.

598
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:11,172
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

599
00:31:42,772 --> 00:31:44,539
I think it's
a little too subtle.

600
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,682
Glenn just shakes his head.
It's very scary.

601
00:31:53,749 --> 00:31:55,617
It's very unnerving.

602
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,753
All four of them
just started attacking.

603
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,357
Ah, crap.

604
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,259
I'm definitely not gonna
be safe this time.

605
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:08,995
So this is the one
that had to be all cut

606
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:14,033
- and manipulated, 'cause--
- Exactly. A different model.

607
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:17,503
Open and close your mouth
as wide as you can.

608
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,809
Well, the judges
have scored your creations

609
00:32:23,877 --> 00:32:25,411
and would like to speak
with each of you

610
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,679
to learn more about your work.

611
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,949
Matt, Tara, Sue,
you are up first.

612
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,924
All right, so let's start
with the 50-year-old makeup.

613
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:40,326
How do you feel that you
did with this makeup,

614
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,761
a scale of one to ten?

615
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:45,431
- I'd say about a seven.
- You would, huh?

616
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:49,936
Looks like he might have
been bitten by a chia pet.

617
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,405
He looks like a were-chia,
sort of transformed

618
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,707
into whatever that is.

619
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:58,344
I want to know why you made
the top of his head so tall.

620
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,446
Well, our guys
had very thick hair,

621
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:03,049
and so it was really hard
getting it down, and--

622
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:05,551
Okay. Matt, why didn't
you just use his own hair?

623
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:07,954
Uh, I wanted to show
some receding.

624
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,588
Oh, dude, you have let him wait

625
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:11,624
till he got older
for that business.

626
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:13,759
Yeah, when I do
a 50-year-old makeup,

627
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,629
I would never do a forehead
on anybody, ever.

628
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:20,099
I would always keep
it very subtle.

629
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:24,770
All right, let's me on
to your 75-year-old makeup.

630
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,872
I don't think the makeup
is horrible,

631
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,375
but unfortunately the hair
is a little bit distracting,

632
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:30,710
I gotta tell you that.

633
00:33:30,744 --> 00:33:33,279
I look at a character
that goes from 50 to 75

634
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,716
to 100 years old, your 75
suddenly got very long hair,

635
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:39,585
and it feels like it doesn't
belong with the two other guys.

636
00:33:39,653 --> 00:33:41,020
Okay.

637
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:44,023
All right, let's talk about
your 100-year-old makeup.

638
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:46,826
Sue, how did you guys decide
which one of you

639
00:33:46,893 --> 00:33:48,327
would be doing
the 100 years old?

640
00:33:48,395 --> 00:33:51,197
Well, it seemed that
the more he progressed in age,

641
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:52,798
it would be more
sculpting-heavy.

642
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,001
I feel like sculptins
definitely my forte.

643
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:57,236
It's a very nice job.

644
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,205
Very impressive to me.

645
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:01,941
This, to me, feels very real.
Good stuff.

646
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,276
I like that you put
a lot of character into it,

647
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,978
and I love the bald head
and everything.

648
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:06,912
You did a great job.

649
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,119
Thank you very much.
You can step back.

650
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:17,356
All right, Beki, RJ, Heather.

651
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:23,095
Okay, let's start with
your 50-year-old makeup.

652
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:27,633
I think that the approach
was a good idea.

653
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:30,169
I think you fell down
here sculpturally.

654
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:33,406
Okay.
I would agree with that.

655
00:34:33,507 --> 00:34:37,043
It looks like she got hit
with a frying pan.

656
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,513
This pinched, folded,
weird globular mess

657
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,516
right here on her face is
really a wrong thing to do.

658
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:48,521
It's so distracting, I don't
even know what to tell you..

659
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:53,059
Now let's move on to
your 75-year-old makeup.

660
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:55,027
So can you tell us a little
bit about what happened here??

661
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:58,764
My first model had really
violent allergic reaction,

662
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:01,467
so I was just trying to
make this work

663
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:04,503
with the shape of her,
uh, bone structure.

664
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:09,775
Everything that you're telling
me sounds like an excuse,

665
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:12,111
but it's not, because you
managed to take

666
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,248
all of those things and turn it
into a successful makeup.

667
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,783
The fact that it's not
for her face

668
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,718
and you were able to
manipulate that piece

669
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:22,354
to get it to line up that well,
to me, is impressive.

670
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:23,489
Thank you.

671
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:24,657
It's interesting.

672
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,158
We say, when
an incident happens,

673
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,660
sometimes this is where you
become the most creative.

674
00:35:27,727 --> 00:35:30,596
The piece literally wrapped
around behind her neck,

675
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:33,699
and I cut about a good inch of
of both sides of the neck.

676
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,967
- Yes.
- So...

677
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:36,669
- Great stuff, RJ.
- Thank you.

678
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:38,537
Yeah, I thought you did
a very nice job.

679
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,573
You did very subtle sculpting.

680
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,042
I really like it.

681
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:46,312
All right, let's move on
to your 100-year-old makeup.

682
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:51,750
Okay, can you explain to me
why it looks so weird?

683
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,586
I don't know
how else to say it.

684
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,888
I mean, this is all kind of
drooping down here and strange...

685
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:56,889
It's very--
It got very droopy.

686
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,491
The anatomy's not correct.

687
00:35:58,558 --> 00:36:02,328
It looks more like a zombie
makeup, to tell you the truth.

688
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:03,662
When I looked close
at the makeup,

689
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,598
I realized that the neck
wasn't glued down.

690
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,166
Did you do that on purpose?

691
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:10,436
Um, a little bit here,
but I actually was hoping

692
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,638
to be able to get it
to tuck back in.

693
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:14,773
It feels to be like a mask
for that reason, and because

694
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:18,277
the pieces are floating
as well, it doesn't help.

695
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:21,213
Thank you very much.
You can step back.

696
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:23,282
Rayce, Ian, Jerry.

697
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,917
Now, as a reminder,
Rayce has immunity

698
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:28,387
and cannot be eliminated.

699
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:30,122
Okay, let's start with
your 50-year-old makeup.

700
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,490
Patrick?

701
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:33,659
Rayce, I'm a big fan
of you as a designer,

702
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,127
but I've got to say,

703
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:38,430
I felt not very,
very impressed with the result.

704
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,199
I think's a little too subtle.

705
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:41,700
Okay.

706
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:42,868
For me, I would have done more

707
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,871
in the area of the nasal folds
and everything,

708
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,273
and I also would have gone

709
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,508
a little more
of sunburned colors.

710
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:50,976
Okay.

711
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,344
Where you applied
your appliances,

712
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:54,046
the roughness and the texture

713
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:56,849
says more a disease
or ailment than it does age.

714
00:36:56,917 --> 00:37:00,719
- Okay.
- Disappointed.

715
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:03,389
All right, let's move on
to your 75 year-old makeup.

716
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:05,558
One to ten, how do you
think you did?

717
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,060
I'd say 7 1/2 or so.

718
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,396
You guys generally
overestimate yourselves

719
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:13,566
on these challenges,
I gotta tell you.

720
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:17,403
The tone of her face and her
neck are completely different.

721
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,471
I'm already granting you guys
certain latitudes

722
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,473
in the fact that you have
so little time,

723
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,976
but coloring right
doesn't take any longer

724
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:25,611
than coloring wrong.

725
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:30,549
When I got up close,
it just looked bad, honey.

726
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:34,153
There's not really
any texture to it,

727
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:35,554
it doesn't really
have wrinkles,

728
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:37,456
and it looks all splotchy.

729
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:39,925
I'm disappointed.

730
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:43,195
All right let's move on
to your 100-year-old makeup.

731
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,830
For the time that you had
to do this,

732
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:48,100
I think it's, you know,
really successful.

733
00:37:49,703 --> 00:37:50,970
I just wish the coloring
would have gone

734
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:52,304
just a little bit further,
but other than that,

735
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:54,073
I think you did a pretty
great job, Jerry.

736
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,574
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

737
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,076
I'm really liking this.

738
00:37:57,143 --> 00:37:59,078
I think, again, I look at
the three of them together,

739
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:00,613
and I can tell the progression.

740
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,847
Thank you.

741
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:02,881
All right, guys,
thank you very much.

742
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:07,086
You can step back.

743
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:09,054
All right, the judges have heard
what you've had to say.

744
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:10,956
If you would please
head back to the makeup room

745
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:13,926
while they make
their decisions.

746
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,132
All right guys, so let's start

747
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,835
with Matt, Tara,
and Sue's makeup.

748
00:38:22,902 --> 00:38:24,069
What do you think?

749
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,337
Sue really impressed me
this week.

750
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:26,839
To me, it's one notch higher

751
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,540
than most of the stuff
I've seen today.

752
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,609
And it was blended
really nice too.

753
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:33,012
Matt's, with the forehead,
was really frightening.

754
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:35,447
It's scary when a makeup
artist can't look at that

755
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,916
and go, "this isn't working,"
and not change it.

756
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:41,854
Let's move on to Jerry,
Ian, and Rayce.

757
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:43,255
Well, I think Ian was--

758
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:44,923
He's just out of his league
on this one.

759
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,692
Once again, if maybe
even the coloring

760
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:48,527
had matched up more, you know?

761
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:50,729
Ian has proved to us
that he's a very creative kid,

762
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:52,998
but, you know, old-age make up
is not about being creative.

763
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,600
It's the technique,
the knowledge.

764
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,302
- It's the knowledge...
- It's experience.

765
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,736
It's experience, yeah.

766
00:38:57,804 --> 00:38:59,705
And I want to give credit
to Jerry this week.

767
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:02,608
I'm always very pleased with
Jerry's attitude and work,

768
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:04,777
but this time, I think he did
a pretty decent job, no?

769
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:06,345
Did a great job.

770
00:39:06,413 --> 00:39:09,848
All right, let's move on
to Heather, RJ, and Beki.

771
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:12,418
Heather missed the mark
on this one completely.

772
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:13,952
The anatomy was all wrong.

773
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,189
It looked like something
that you might see as a joke,

774
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:19,725
like on <i>SNL</i> if they
were purposely trying

775
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:22,061
to make someone look
ridiculous.

776
00:39:22,128 --> 00:39:25,064
You know, Beki's
was just bad choices.

777
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:28,834
The silicone was hard.
The sculpting was bad.

778
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:32,271
- The edges were bad.
- RJ, though, high point.

779
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,406
- He really pulled it out.
- Yeah.

780
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:36,775
Nice and thin,
sculpting and everything.

781
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:38,944
And the other two,
just the--

782
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:41,680
Their-- The sculpting
was just non-existent.

783
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:45,017
All right, then, judges,
have you made your decisions?

784
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:46,218
Yep.

785
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:47,553
Yep, we have made
our decisions.

786
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,987
Let's bring 'em back out.

787
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:00,866
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about the top looks?

788
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:05,270
Our top three makeups
tonight are...

789
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:10,809
Sue, for a very convincing
and comprehensive makeup.

790
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:15,247
Jerry, for a very solid approach
to a tough challenge.

791
00:40:15,315 --> 00:40:18,851
And RJ, your makeup,
pretty good overall,

792
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:20,786
but particularly
considering the obstacles

793
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:23,422
that you had to overcome
this evening.

794
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,058
All right, Glenn, then who is
the winner of this challenge?

795
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:29,328
The winner of
this challenge is...

796
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,621
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge?

797
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:42,258
The winner of
this challenge is...

798
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:46,596
Sue.

799
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:52,568
It was an extremely
strong effort

800
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:55,538
on what was an exceedingly
difficult challenge.

801
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:57,473
Recognition
means so much to me,

802
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,509
and to have that
from four people

803
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:02,478
that I really respect
and admire, it feels great.

804
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,013
Sue, congratulations.

805
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:05,515
You can head back
to the makeup room.

806
00:41:08,785 --> 00:41:12,054
All right, Glenn, who are
our bottom three this week?

807
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:14,357
Ian,

808
00:41:14,424 --> 00:41:16,359
Beki,

809
00:41:16,426 --> 00:41:18,728
and Heather.

810
00:41:18,795 --> 00:41:20,396
All right,
the rest of you are safe

811
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:23,766
and can head back
to the makeup room.

812
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:26,936
Ian, Beki, Heather,
please step forward.

813
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:33,209
All right, Glenn,
why don't you tell us

814
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:34,544
about the bottom looks.

815
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:37,713
Ian, your sculpture
was just too subtle,

816
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:41,183
and you also made
some fatal color errors.

817
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,886
Beki, mainly due to
the inaccuracy

818
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:46,222
of the anatomy
in your sculpting.

819
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,493
And Heather, there were major
flaws in both the sculpture

820
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:52,461
and paint approach
to your makeup.

821
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:54,664
All right, so who is
leaving us tonight?

822
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:58,167
The person that's
going home tonight is...

823
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,406
Heather.

824
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:06,309
Damn.
Damn.

825
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:07,810
Unfortunately,

826
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:10,746
your makeup looked more
like a melting zombie

827
00:42:10,814 --> 00:42:12,648
than an old-age makeup.

828
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:14,684
- I agree.
- I'm sorry, Heather.

829
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:17,887
Heather, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

830
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:20,189
It's been great
having you here with us.

831
00:42:20,257 --> 00:42:22,058
Please head back to the makeup
room and pack up your kit.

832
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,292
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

833
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,994
- Bye, guys.
- Good luck.

834
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:28,631
The hardest part about leaving

835
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:30,066
is just wondering
what I could have done...

836
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,233
It's me.

837
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:32,702
And if I could have gone
farther.

838
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:35,771
It's meant a lot to me to be
part of the competition.

839
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,442
I love effects, and this has
only fueled that fire more.
