1
00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:02,914
The winner of<i> Face Off</i> is...

2
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:08,619
Action.

3
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:10,221
The Critics' Choice Award winner

4
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,289
is better than ever.

5
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:13,724
<i>Face Off</i> is back.

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,059
Hell, yeah.

7
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:16,727
But if you
think you know<i> Face Off,</i>

8
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:19,797
I have something entirely new
in store for you.

9
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:20,798
Think again.

10
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:23,034
- Yay!
- This is so exciting!

11
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,202
- Oh, my God, this is real.
- We made it.

12
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:26,971
This season, the
competition gets turned on its head

13
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,139
with all new challenges...

14
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:30,841
Create a stunning short film
on location.

15
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:32,910
Ah, I'm so excited.

16
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:33,911
Massive stakes...

17
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:35,913
We like to call it
"The Gauntlet."

18
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:36,914
What?

19
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:39,050
And one epic milestone.

20
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:42,486
This is the 100th episode
of<i> Face Off.</i>

21
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,021
It's overwhelming.

22
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,724
In the end, our
legendary judges will decide

23
00:00:46,758 --> 00:00:49,760
who wins a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

24
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:52,997
to one of their
85 international locations,

25
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:55,967
an all new 2015 Fiat 500,

26
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:59,503
and $100,000.

27
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:09,580
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

28
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:44,331
Sync and corrections by n17t01

29
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:52,089
This can't be real.

30
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:53,724
I'm at the Natural History
Museum.

31
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,626
I see this girl
walking towards me

32
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,628
and she looks
just as scared as I do.

33
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:58,629
Jason.

34
00:01:58,663 --> 00:01:59,663
Brittany, nice to meet you.

35
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:01,265
Nice to meet you too.
You ready for this?

36
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,868
I'm so excited, I can't believe
we're on<i> Face Off.</i>

37
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,036
Chills is the best way
to put it.

38
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,104
I've worked so hard
to get here.

39
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:09,040
After I graduated
cinema makeup school,

40
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:10,374
I got involved
with the drag community

41
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:11,675
up in San Francisco.

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,943
I love doing beauty makeup

43
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:15,379
just as much as slapping blood
all over somebody,

44
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:17,848
so being on<i> Face Off</i>
is a dream.

45
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:19,483
As soon as I walk
in those doors,

46
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:20,818
my life's gonna change.

47
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,319
I have no idea what to expect.

48
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,088
Yeah, no idea.
Not at all.

49
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:26,357
I've been a professional makeup
artist for three years.

50
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:28,359
I graduated from Make-up
Designory in New York.

51
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:29,693
I grew up in theater

52
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,395
and you're always expected
to do your own makeup.

53
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,931
So at six years old, I was
putting on my own eyelashes.

54
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,567
I am ready to kick some butt
here on<i> Face Off.</i>

55
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,743
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, I'm Missy Munster.

56
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:47,645
- I'm Meg, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

57
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,815
Growing up, I was bullied a lot
just because I'm a freak.

58
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,516
That led me
into the effects world.

59
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,019
I found a lot of people that
I had things in common with.

60
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:56,921
Now I'm a lot more social.

61
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,589
I've worked
in a few effects shops

62
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,925
so I know how to work
in a team, and that's

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,593
a good skill to have here.

64
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:03,727
Where are you from?

65
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:06,163
I am from the beautiful
Garden State.

66
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,499
I didn't go to school for this.
I learned it on the Internet.

67
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:11,735
That is very intimidating to me,
but I am tough.

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,504
I was diagnosed
with Hodgkin's lymphoma

69
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:15,940
about six years ago
and I showed cancer.

70
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,943
After my hair grew back,
I decided to shave half of it,

71
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,878
'cause it reminds me
of my tough days.

72
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:23,047
So if I just keep
believing in myself,

73
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,482
I could definitely
win<i> Face Off.</i>

74
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,618
- Oh, hey, I'm Ricky.
- Jasmine.

75
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:30,187
I've been in this field
for 13 years now.

76
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:33,290
I've worked on Cirque du Soleil,

77
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:36,260
Latin Grammys,
Billboard Music Awards,

78
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:38,562
so I'm really hoping
my experience takes me

79
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:39,864
far in this competition.

80
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:40,865
I'm so nervous.

81
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,533
I am pretty fucking
nervous too.

82
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:44,201
I started off my career path

83
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:46,403
as a kid,
chopping up foam furniture

84
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:48,305
to make all kinds
of different monsters.

85
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,108
That was before I found out
about Savini School,

86
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:52,676
and now I feel
like I'm definitely

87
00:03:52,711 --> 00:03:54,512
on the fast track to success.

88
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,380
- Let's do it.
- Uh-huh.

89
00:04:01,786 --> 00:04:03,621
This is so cool.

90
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:05,823
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

91
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:07,258
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

92
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:14,698
Now, I know that you're
a very talented bunch,

93
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:17,568
so that's why we're not going to
go easy on you this season.

94
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:18,769
- Ooh.
- Good.

95
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:20,304
We're just gonna launch
into your first

96
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:22,673
epic Spotlight Challenge
right now.

97
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:27,745
No foundation
challenge means no immunity,

98
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,213
so one of us is going home.

99
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:31,916
As you can tell, we are here
at the Natural History Museum

100
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,450
of Los Angeles County,

101
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,719
which houses
extensive collections

102
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:39,557
of animal and mineral artifacts
from every corner of the Earth,

103
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:42,426
but this challenge is
much bigger in scope

104
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,461
than just little old Earth.

105
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:48,065
It takes place
on a galactic level.

106
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,568
Tapping into one
of the hottest genres

107
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:53,504
out there right now,
science fiction.

108
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:55,472
Yes.

109
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,107
Now, while we're all blown away

110
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:59,476
by the super cool aliens
in these films,

111
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:03,047
sometimes the true stars
are the awe inspiring

112
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:06,217
and nightmare inducing
alien animals.

113
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,451
- Yes.
- Awesome.

114
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:11,055
For your first
spotlight challenge,

115
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:12,423
you'll work in teams of two

116
00:05:12,457 --> 00:05:15,192
to create your very own
alien animal.

117
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,796
Yeah.

118
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,564
Now, I've brought
one of Hollywood's

119
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,399
most sought-after
creature designers

120
00:05:22,434 --> 00:05:23,834
to help you out today.

121
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:26,337
He's worked with huge names
like JJ Abrams,

122
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:30,007
James Cameron, Ridley Scott,
and Stephen Spielberg.

123
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,844
Please give a warm welcome
to<i> Face Off</i> series judge,

124
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:35,412
Mr. Neville Page.

125
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:37,481
Hello.

126
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:40,284
This is awesome.
I am so excited

127
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:43,787
to be in Neville's presence.
He is just so good.

128
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,055
Yeah, good to see you.

129
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,957
- Hi, guys.
- Wow.

130
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:48,459
Thank you for helping me
to kick off

131
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,661
this season's first
Spotlight Challenge.

132
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:52,162
I am excited to be here.

133
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,298
All right, Neville has
hand-selected items

134
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:55,833
from all over the museum

135
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:59,203
that you will use as inspiration
for this challenge.

136
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:01,972
Today's challenge is all about
shifting your perspective

137
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,540
and thinking out of the box.

138
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:05,909
Don't think literally.
Look at your inspiration

139
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:07,678
as if you're seeing it
for the first time

140
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:10,614
to inspire design directions.

141
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:12,883
All right, the person
you walked up with

142
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:16,353
in the rose garden out front
is your teammate.

143
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:17,488
Hey.

144
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,323
Yes.

145
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:21,592
All right, now, Neville
mentioned wanting you guys

146
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,594
to think outside of the box
for this challenge.

147
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,963
I'm going to force you
out of your comfort zone

148
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:30,234
by knocking down the walls
of that box right now.

149
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:33,304
For this Spotlight Challenge,
you'll be working

150
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:36,507
with two models
in your final creations.

151
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:39,176
Guys, come on out.

152
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:45,282
Oh, my God.

153
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,717
How are we going to do this?

154
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:49,987
I have never taken two people
and put them into one creature.

155
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:51,088
It's insane.

156
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:52,790
On my go, you'll hit the museum

157
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:54,658
to choose
one of Neville's picks,

158
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:55,826
and your models will join you

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,728
once you've made
your selections.

160
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:00,230
Neville will come by to consult
on your creature designs

161
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:01,565
before you head
back to the lab.

162
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,566
You guys ready?

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,767
Yes.

164
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:05,569
- Let's do it.
- Go.

165
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,540
Is rounding the corner.

166
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,576
- Oh, my gosh, yeah.
- The turtle's perfect.

167
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,914
Where's mineral?
Yeah, all right.

168
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:19,516
Got it.

169
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,152
Yes, I love it.

170
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:24,088
My name is Sidney.
I'm from Pace, Florida,

171
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,423
and I actually model
for makeup.

172
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,158
After watching
what they're doing,

173
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:30,127
I decided I can do it myself.

174
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:32,363
Being self-taught
worries me a little bit,

175
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:34,798
but my teammate Evan
is on top of his game

176
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,999
so I think we can do this.

177
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,268
We got the Schorl Tourmaline
with Albite.

178
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:40,871
It's a black stone
wrapped with white mineral.

179
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:42,106
Instantly have an idea.

180
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,807
They share a brain.

181
00:07:43,842 --> 00:07:46,877
The layout of the two models
is just like our mineral.

182
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:48,979
She's gonna be wrapped
around the male model

183
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,614
to make it one monster.

184
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:53,317
Basically, she's
your life force kind of thing.

185
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:55,953
In 2006, a friend of mine
inspired me

186
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:58,989
to go to the Tom Savini School
for Special Effects Makeup.

187
00:07:59,023 --> 00:08:01,692
I found my passion.
The rest is history.

188
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:04,128
I love doing aliens,
but I'm super worried

189
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:06,663
'cause this is
a really hard challenge.

190
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,699
Hey, guys, so where are we at?
What do you got going?

191
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,403
We're going with a
six-legged, ape-like creature.

192
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:13,771
Okay, a six-limbed
creature?

193
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:14,805
Yeah.

194
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,240
That's gonna make it
feel alien,

195
00:08:16,274 --> 00:08:19,076
but those limbs,
which are your arms--

196
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,811
Yay, she can animate--

197
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:23,480
maybe they're some kind
of sensory appendage?

198
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,082
And that's gonna change
your silhouette.

199
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:26,250
- Yeah.
- Got you.

200
00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:31,588
So since we have a clam
and it's two models,

201
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:33,323
I think it's definitely
essential

202
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:34,958
that we utilize them
to make something open.

203
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:37,394
I've been doing makeup
for about eight years now.

204
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,898
I've worked for haunted houses
and independent films in Denver,

205
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:42,933
so I'm used to deadlines.

206
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:46,303
That's gonna be essential
in my performance on<i> Face Off.</i>

207
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:50,207
Omar and I like the idea
that the clam can open up.

208
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:55,913
So these can operate
big shells, little mouth.

209
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:58,315
I used to work here
in Los Angeles, California,

210
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:00,617
on films like<i> Blade II,</i>
<i>Spider-man 2,</i>

211
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:01,885
and<i> The Last Samurai.</i>

212
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,321
About 12 years ago,
I had a newborn baby

213
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:06,156
with a disability
so we had to move

214
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:07,858
back home
to be closer to family,

215
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,460
but now I'm here on<i> Face Off</i>

216
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:12,663
because I am ready to get
back into the special effects.

217
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:14,431
You've got four eyes?

218
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,400
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, we'll decorate a face

219
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:18,635
that utilizes
their double eyes.

220
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,637
My only concern is
the reveal would

221
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:22,606
almost feel like you've got
two human heads.

222
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,208
That might kind of
kill the gag.

223
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,376
There are things here
that feel alien and organic,

224
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:27,945
and that's gonna be successful,

225
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:30,547
versus two people
inside of a creature.

226
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:31,582
Okay.

227
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:34,017
Azurite with malachite.

228
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,385
Yeah, I like the colors
on this.

229
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,987
Yeah, and then some of those
protruding rocks

230
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:37,988
that are coming off,
like, near the bottom there.

231
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:39,323
Mm-hmm, yeah.

232
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:41,291
I've always loved sculpting,
loved making creatures,

233
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:42,960
and then my senior year
in high school,

234
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,828
I entered
a mask making competition

235
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,064
and got a scholarship
for the art institute.

236
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:48,465
That's when I realized
I could actually

237
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,733
pursue this as a career.

238
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,735
I think it'd be cool
to have pieces of the stone

239
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:52,736
jutting out from the shoulders.

240
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,304
Shoulders, yeah, definitely.

241
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,907
I originally started
as a computer animator,

242
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,408
but sitting
in front of a computer

243
00:09:58,443 --> 00:09:59,776
didn't really appeal to me.

244
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:02,546
Special effects makeup
is a lot more dynamic,

245
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,147
and I absolutely love it.

246
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:06,016
Maybe stand in front of here.

247
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,152
There's so much riding on this,
being the first challenge.

248
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:11,355
It's go big or go home.

249
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:12,589
- Hey.
- Hey, how's it going?

250
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:14,124
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

251
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,927
We'd like to actually put
one of the spikes on her head

252
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,295
so that it can move around.

253
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:21,164
Okay, but make sure that
what you're going to not do

254
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:22,933
is create a rock creature.

255
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,002
- Okay.
- It can have the surface

256
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:27,971
that mimics rock perhaps,
but it can't be made of rock.

257
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,006
Okay.

258
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:33,810
My name's Scott,
nice to meet you.

259
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,178
Jordan, nice to meet you,
Scott.

260
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:36,513
- I'm Nora, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

261
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,248
All right, we've
got the ram horn.

262
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,483
- Ram horn, all right.
- Yes.

263
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:42,319
I was not a person
that wore a lot of makeup

264
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:44,755
myself growing up,
always been a tomboy,

265
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:47,157
so makeup effects school
wasn't exactly

266
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,959
the obvious route for me.

267
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:51,795
I went to community college,
took philosophy and art courses,

268
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,196
and that's when I found out

269
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:56,166
about the Tom Savini
Special Makeup Effects program.

270
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,136
I actually just graduated
the day before I came out here.

271
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,071
No rest.
I went from one

272
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,373
high stressful situation
to the next.

273
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:06,043
What if it's a predator?
We need to have some sort of--

274
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:07,744
- Not necessarily a defensive...
- It's got to be quick-moving.

275
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:09,646
But an offensive system,
so what is that?

276
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:10,647
Claws? Teeth?
What?

277
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,249
Thinking we make this
into a claw.

278
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:14,484
My name is Scott.
I'm 43 years old.

279
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,320
Over the last 18 months,
I've had

280
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:20,624
several major life changes,
starting with losing 110 pounds.

281
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:23,660
Then I got a divorce,
moved to Florida, and started

282
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:26,196
to work at a special effects
materials supplier,

283
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,931
and as a result,
I fell back in love

284
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:29,533
with my childhood passion.

285
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,002
Now with my weight loss,
my newfound energy,

286
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:34,705
it's time for me to reboot
the rest of my life.

287
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:38,508
There's so much texture
and detail, which is great.

288
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:41,445
Just make sure you focus
on what we're gonna see.

289
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:45,182
Spend a lot less time
on the back, and try and get

290
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:46,883
some of those details
done in paint

291
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:48,251
versus sculpting scales
for example.

292
00:11:48,286 --> 00:11:49,353
Absolutely.

293
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,488
All right, we got
the native silver.

294
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,556
It's the big one.

295
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,024
- It's that big one over there.
- Okay.

296
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,526
I started by working
at haunted houses.

297
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:59,496
I'm still new to it,
but in 2013,

298
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,299
entered competition
for<i> Top Haunts</i> Magazine.

299
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,869
I won best makeup artist.
Now I'm here to win<i> Face Off,</i>

300
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:07,938
and I'm gonna try my hardest.

301
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:09,806
Let's start back-to-back
just to see, like,

302
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:11,441
- proportions and stuff--
- Yeah, Lily's height could--

303
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:12,843
- Yeah.
- There we go.

304
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,712
I grew up behind the scenes
of the film industry.

305
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:17,748
My mother was
a casting director.

306
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:19,483
I remember going to sets
with her

307
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,552
and being in awe
of everything that was going on.

308
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,688
I only graduated
from Makeup Designory

309
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:27,290
a year and a half ago,
so I'm a little worried

310
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:29,593
because Stevie and I
are so new to this.

311
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:32,496
I just really hope that
we pull together as a team.

312
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,764
We got the native silver.

313
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:34,831
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

314
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:37,534
And we're making
a being that could

315
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:39,703
use all of her subjects
as miners

316
00:12:39,737 --> 00:12:41,805
to draw the silver
from the Earth.

317
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,008
That's good
for a different challenge.

318
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:48,145
This is about
the organic animal.

319
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:50,814
Not necessarily gonna have
culture, et cetera.

320
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:52,115
Just worry about making

321
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,984
- a really cool creature.
- Okay.

322
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:55,986
This is horrible.
It's just really bad.

323
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,754
Forgetting what
our challenge is about

324
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:01,058
is not the first impression that
I wanted to make on Neville.

325
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,292
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

326
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,393
Yeah, my pleasure.

327
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:05,128
We just wasted all of that time.

328
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,830
All righty, guys,
it's time to go.

329
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:09,066
Now we're gonna have
to come up with a new concept

330
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,969
in the lab without the models
and without Neville's advice.

331
00:13:13,004 --> 00:13:15,372
If that doesn't get done,
we're screwed.

332
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:23,436
_

333
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,239
Holy crap.

334
00:13:26,274 --> 00:13:27,240
- Oh, my God, look at all this.
- Whoo!

335
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,575
Wow.

336
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,043
We get into the
lab for the first time

337
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,679
and words can't describe
how awesome it is.

338
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:33,813
I'm blown away.

339
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,682
- Oh, my God. Vacuum forms.
- Ah!

340
00:13:35,716 --> 00:13:36,850
- Nice.
- Wow.

341
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,552
- Oh, yes, this is my room.
- This is it.

342
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:44,925
It is like a playground
combined with a candy store,

343
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,660
and it is amazing.

344
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:47,961
Oh, my God.

345
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,699
All right, guys,
let's get to work!

346
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:56,169
Oh.

347
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,239
All right, all right.

348
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,074
My partner is
Ben and our creature

349
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,310
is a cave dweller
that hides from an alien race

350
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,744
that wants to harvest
formations

351
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,212
that are growing
out of their backs.

352
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,348
Are we still going
with a no eyes thing or?

353
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,950
I was gonna make a flap
right here,

354
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,084
so that he can
see though--

355
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,085
Nice.

356
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,787
Our plan is to make a face,

357
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:18,591
a cowl, four giant legs,
and fabricate a giant body.

358
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:19,592
It's a tall order.

359
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:20,593
I like where we're headed.
Cool.

360
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:21,795
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,200
The first thing
Libby and I have to do

362
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,969
is figure out our concept,

363
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,404
because we forgot
the animal part.

364
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,174
We have a head here and
something that looks like a head

365
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,576
- to kind of throw off the prey.
- Yeah.

366
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,479
The concept is
this bug-like creature.

367
00:14:39,513 --> 00:14:42,716
The top half is alluring,
and the bottom half of it

368
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,452
will trap you
once you get too close.

369
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,988
All of the texture will be
these rock formations.

370
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:50,123
Okay, I'm gonna go grab clay.

371
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,868
Hey, guys, here with my dad

372
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:02,869
for the first walk-through
of the season.

373
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,371
- Oh, hey!
- Whoo-hoo!

374
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,373
Yeah!

375
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,041
There's Michael Westmore,

376
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,010
amazing,
Oscar-winning makeup artist.

377
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:11,711
I'm really freaking out.

378
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:15,949
We chose alligator skin,
and it has a giant jaw

379
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:18,051
that's able to snare
and catch things.

380
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,719
This is the roof of the mouth.

381
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,622
It looks like a girl
that's had injections.

382
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,024
It can't have human elements
to it at all.

383
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:25,025
Right.

384
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,694
So put this form down here

385
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:29,763
so this whole thing
looks like a ladder.

386
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:31,197
- Yeah.
- Okay.

387
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:33,066
We chose the herbivore jaw.

388
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,834
What's your color
scheme gonna be now?

389
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,569
Dark shades of brown
and then dry brush over it

390
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,872
with a little bit of a highlight
in a bone color.

391
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:40,807
If you get it muddy,
I'm going to kill you.

392
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:43,043
Start off very light
and build up.

393
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,044
Deal.

394
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:45,678
We chose the ram horn,

395
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:49,149
and it's gonna be this snake,
reptilian armored animal.

396
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:51,117
And you're gonna have horns
coming out of here?

397
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:53,253
Yes, that's where the first
set of horns would be,

398
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,822
maybe a smaller set
coming out of the cheek area.

399
00:15:55,856 --> 00:15:57,257
You could probably get away
with making one mold

400
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,059
and just running it in urethane
a couple times.

401
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:00,460
Definitely.

402
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:03,196
So tell us what you chose
at the museum for inspiration.

403
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,265
We have tourmaline with albite.

404
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,534
What I'm seeing here
is the devil.

405
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:08,868
- Oh!
- Exactly, exactly.

406
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,036
- I knew it. I knew it.
- You know?

407
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,105
It really should be
asymmetrical

408
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,640
like you've done there.

409
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:14,808
- Okay.
- Yes.

410
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:18,044
We are doing one creature
with two heads.

411
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,345
If you have time,

412
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,382
do away with this human crease
by making a little piece

413
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,983
that would fill
all the way out there,

414
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:27,387
because this is a mask
with human eyes.

415
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,488
- Okay.
- Yeah.

416
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,156
- Good luck, everybody.
- Thank you!

417
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:31,391
- Bye, thank you.
- Bye!

418
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,996
I like that a lot.

419
00:16:37,031 --> 00:16:38,231
If you're happy, I'm happy.

420
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,633
I am sculpting the two shells

421
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:44,971
and Kevon is sculpting
the inside of our clam,

422
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,172
but I'm a little worried

423
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:49,576
because of the size
of all these sculpts.

424
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,378
I have never attempted
anything close to this before.

425
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:53,379
I don't think
it hurts to go bigger.

426
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,380
Right, yeah.

427
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:55,815
I'm definitely nervous.

428
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:03,256
Time's up, everybody!

429
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:18,771
Oh, my God.
Holy cow, I'm here.

430
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,275
The<i> Face Off</i> house is unreal.

431
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,943
This place is huge.

432
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,380
- Wow, this is insane.
- Ho!

433
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:30,517
It's completely
surreal to be here.

434
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,418
We all can't believe it.
We're so excited.

435
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:33,887
Congratulations, everybody.

436
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,734
Today, Stevie and I
have a lot to work on,

437
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:50,170
and since we wasted
a whole bunch of time

438
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:51,905
coming up with a new concept,

439
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:56,075
Stevie suggests we combine
my face with my cowl

440
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,343
and make it a mask.

441
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,711
- Yeah, look at that.
- That's good enough.

442
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:02,649
Now we can do one mold,
rather than separate pieces.

443
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,121
Today I need to
get this face done,

444
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,689
so I put the final details
on it...

445
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:10,790
Evan.

446
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:14,060
And I get it to Sidney
for molding.

447
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,869
And then I get working
on finishing the back

448
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,103
and starting the arm.

449
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,471
We have a lot of work to do

450
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:28,508
and I just hope
that we can get it done.

451
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,359
_

452
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,346
_

453
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,909
_

454
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,543
_

455
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:39,394
_

456
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:41,054
Oh, it's happening.

457
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,488
I'm getting nervous about time.

458
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:45,725
We have a ton of molds
we have got to get done.

459
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:49,128
We should probably start
casting up as many as we can.

460
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:51,331
On top of that,
I have a really big priority,

461
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,666
and that is the mouth
of this clam,

462
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,201
and time is ticking.

463
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:56,402
I figure we do the buckets
or something,

464
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,770
- we'll mix a big batch.
- All right, cool,

465
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,539
can you start
without me at all?

466
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,541
Things are taking longer
than they should be,

467
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:05,945
and these are the biggest molds
I have ever had to make.

468
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,146
I'm freaking out a little bit.

469
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:08,181
Shit.

470
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:09,282
I am very nervous.

471
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,483
Get more...

472
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,918
This is a tall order to fill,

473
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:15,655
and I'm worried
that we bit off way too much.

474
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:23,349
Me and Kevin only have five
hours left.

475
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:27,520
and these are the biggest molds
I have ever had to make.

476
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,288
I'm gonna switch gears,
'cause I got to get

477
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:31,123
that other mold started.

478
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:32,658
We just got to divide
and conquer,

479
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,027
so Omar is doing
the mold of the heads

480
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,129
and the inner membrane
of the clam,

481
00:19:37,164 --> 00:19:39,599
and I'm working
on the clam's mouth.

482
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,501
You guys have the biggest
shit I've ever seen.

483
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:43,636
I know.
It's frustrating.

484
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,771
This is hard.
We can do it, though.

485
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:48,274
I've been up against worse
deadlines than this.

486
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:01,020
I start working on
the wings for our alien animal.

487
00:20:01,054 --> 00:20:02,522
It's taking this long to dry,
makes me a little nervous.

488
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:03,689
Yeah.

489
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,758
The slip latex
is not drying quick enough.

490
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:09,395
so I use some stretchy fabric,
cover that in slip latex.

491
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,797
That way, we'll only have to do
one layer of latex

492
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,299
but we'll still have
the stability we need

493
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,534
to lift it off the floor.

494
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:15,835
- It was a happy accident.
- Happy, happy accident.

495
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,670
It was, like,
completely happy accident.

496
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,410
So I' going
off of Neville's suggestion

497
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:27,346
and making feelers
out of a pipe insulation tube

498
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:29,615
and panty hose.
Hopefully, that'll give it

499
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,685
a real nice, loose feeling
when they move.

500
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:36,822
I also cut the end of the tube
to give it a hand look.

501
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:37,924
It's so long, though.

502
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:41,460
Well, I know, it's...
got to feel stuff.

503
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:42,461
I'm excited.

504
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:49,702
I am fabricating the
body for our massive creature,

505
00:20:49,736 --> 00:20:51,337
so I grab
several sheets of L200

506
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:53,105
and start getting
the general shape,

507
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,874
and then I start
laying down tinfoil

508
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:56,776
so that it'll give it
that rocky texture.

509
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,944
Once all the textures
are on there,

510
00:20:57,978 --> 00:20:59,078
I start painting latex,

511
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:01,147
forming a skin
around the entire thing,

512
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:03,983
and I couldn't be happier
with how it looks.

513
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:06,285
Hey, everybody,
that's 15 minutes left.

514
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,089
Careful with that.
Careful with that.

515
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:13,292
My gosh, did this actually--
yes!

516
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:15,194
The molds are done.
We just need to open

517
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:17,263
and clean them out
as fast as we can.

518
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,864
Uh-oh.
Shit.

519
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:22,368
Oh, fuck.
There's a hole in my mold.

520
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:23,970
What's this?

521
00:21:24,004 --> 00:21:27,106
I have no idea.
We're screwed.

522
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,241
I'm not really sure
what to do at this point.

523
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:31,243
This is the main thing
I worked on.

524
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:33,245
I have to fix it,
but I'm not gonna have time

525
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,780
to finish this today.

526
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,649
All right, everybody,
time's up!

527
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:42,455
So at this point,
I'm just, like, f-- s-- fucked.

528
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:46,525
I might not have a piece
to send out on stage.

529
00:21:57,004 --> 00:21:59,705
Today, there's
a hell of a lot we have to do.

530
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,706
It's so thick

531
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,308
right here, but that's okay.

532
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:05,478
First thing's first, I'm running
the latex and poly foam cowl.

533
00:22:05,512 --> 00:22:07,513
Jasmine is finishing up
the final touches

534
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:09,115
on the back spine
for the creature.

535
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:10,916
- You like this?
- Yeah.

536
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:13,386
I am in the zone,
'cause I have to get this done.

537
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,321
There is no other option.

538
00:22:17,658 --> 00:22:21,527
The first thing we come in
and do is repair the mold,

539
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:25,698
and then we have to poly-foam
two big pieces,

540
00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:27,767
and we also have to figure out

541
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:30,102
how to cover up
the rest of our model.

542
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:32,571
We got to get this done.
We got to get this done.

543
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:34,020
_

544
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:38,878
- Hey, what's going on?
- How you doing? How are you?

545
00:22:38,912 --> 00:22:40,446
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

546
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,447
There you go.

547
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:43,482
When my models show up,
I start applying

548
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:44,717
the cowl and the face

549
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,986
while Jordan's
finishing up the body.

550
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,456
The amount of work is
just shy of soul-crushing.

551
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:52,858
So where is the monster's eyes?

552
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:53,859
It doesn't really have eyes.

553
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:54,894
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

554
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:59,465
Your face is right here.
You're gonna be terrifying.

555
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:00,599
I am very nervous.

556
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:03,002
Not only is this
the biggest challenge

557
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:05,137
<i>Face Off</i> has ever thrown
at anybody,

558
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:07,840
but we also made
a very risky decision,

559
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:10,476
because there is no way
we could stick those two actors

560
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,212
together and then send them
to Last Looks,

561
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:16,115
so we're not going to be able
to put anything on these models

562
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:17,850
until we get to the stage.

563
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:19,151
So just sit tight for now.

564
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:20,820
Okay.

565
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,055
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

566
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,090
All right!

567
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:31,130
This might not fit.

568
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:32,998
I take charge of the application

569
00:23:33,033 --> 00:23:34,500
while Evan paints the tentacles

570
00:23:34,534 --> 00:23:36,102
and works on all
the extra pieces

571
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:37,470
that we're gonna add
to this character.

572
00:23:37,504 --> 00:23:39,638
Yeah, we're gonna have to
trim that out.

573
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:40,840
But I'm stressing out

574
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:43,175
because the cowl
doesn't fit properly

575
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,445
and I have to stuff pieces
of mattress foam in there

576
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,014
so that I can get the face
and everything lined up.

577
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:56,989
This is our first challenge.
It's so scary.

578
00:23:57,023 --> 00:23:58,157
Everything's applied,

579
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:00,259
and now we have to get
this thing painted.

580
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:02,595
We decided to use
a cooler palate

581
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,930
with highlights
of browns and oranges,

582
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:07,767
and we're feeling good
with how everything is gelling.

583
00:24:12,773 --> 00:24:14,440
Like, right here,
is this what you want?

584
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:16,809
For our paint scheme,
we're using Pax washes,

585
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:19,645
which is Pax paint with
a little bit of water in it,

586
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,181
just so the color's
not so monochromatic.

587
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,783
Just keep doing it the way
you're doing it.

588
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:26,485
I'm extremely stressed
about how long it's taking,

589
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,587
but it's easy
to muddy a paint job

590
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:30,156
when you're using
so much brown.

591
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,124
I just want it to have
a lot of texture.

592
00:24:33,693 --> 00:24:35,594
All right, everybody,
ten minutes!

593
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:41,549
_

594
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,522
_

595
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:44,136
Not over till it's over.

596
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:48,440
Time just flies by
and we are so far behind.

597
00:24:48,475 --> 00:24:49,441
You got everything?

598
00:24:49,476 --> 00:24:50,643
No, I need sea sponges.

599
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:53,212
We've spent so much time
patching holes

600
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:56,682
and fixing things that now,
we have nothing painted.

601
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:58,784
Do you think I should take
some of this texture just down

602
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,152
- into her arm a little bit?
- They're fine.

603
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:01,153
I thought we were just
cutting them.

604
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:02,555
Time.

605
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,356
We just don't have
time to fabricate the pieces

606
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:07,259
that we had hoped
to cover the actor's body.

607
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:10,663
All right, guys, that's time!

608
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,298
We're gonna have
to do the entire paint job

609
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:13,699
in Last Looks.

610
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:16,769
We're just not gonna get
everything that we want done.

611
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:26,500
We only have one hour
of Last Looks.

612
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:28,102
Turn that way for me.

613
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:29,837
I'm trying
to finish this paint job,

614
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:32,273
but I'm nervous,
because a bad paint job

615
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:33,340
can send you home.

616
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,675
All right, this is
gonna have to do.

617
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:37,611
Where are those scissors at?

618
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:39,713
We are just slamming this
all together.

619
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,916
We're pinning, we're cutting,
we're hot-gluing.

620
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,118
This is my first chance
to make an impression.

621
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:45,853
I've got to make this good.

622
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,126
Right now, we're just
trying to paint, paint, paint

623
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,828
and try and cover,
cover, cover.

624
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:55,529
I've gotten out of my head
that we're going to go out

625
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:57,865
with a winning look, but
at least we'll have something.

626
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:01,902
We get the suit on Isabelle
and we position her with Matt,

627
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,405
and we realize that the front
is completely open,

628
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,806
so we look over
to our wardrobe,

629
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:07,441
we drape it over it,
start ripping it,

630
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:08,676
and it's looking great.

631
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,644
All right, everybody,
15 minutes!

632
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,279
I'm having trouble
seeing the vision, girl.

633
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:13,480
I'm starting to lose my cool.

634
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:14,949
I don't know how
I'm gonna conceal this one.

635
00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:15,983
Just glue it together.

636
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:17,017
I have to conceal
this whole body.

637
00:26:17,052 --> 00:26:18,118
Let me just do the eye
real quick.

638
00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:20,287
This is supposed to be
when we're ready

639
00:26:20,322 --> 00:26:23,157
to send it out, and
I feel like we've got nothing.

640
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:24,992
I can't-- I can't
put this on stage.

641
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:26,227
It was what it is.

642
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,430
Time's up!

643
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,301
- I've never done anything that
looks like this. - We're gonna be okay.

644
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:33,634
Our makeup's a piece of shit,

645
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:35,736
and I'm worried
I'm going to be in the bottom.

646
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,737
We got to go, okay?

647
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:38,973
We're gonna get ripped up.

648
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:53,120
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

649
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,257
You know our illustrious
series judges.

650
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,359
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

651
00:26:58,393 --> 00:26:59,560
Mr. Glenn Hetrick.

652
00:26:59,594 --> 00:27:00,594
Good evening.

653
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:06,634
Oscar and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist, Ms. Ve Neill.

654
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,369
Welcome to<i> Face Off</i>, everybody.

655
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:10,504
Hi, Ve.

656
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:13,040
And of course, creature
and concept designer,

657
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:14,508
Mr. Neville Page.

658
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,749
All right, guys, for your first
Spotlight Challenge,

659
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:25,519
we definitely threw you
a huge curve ball there...

660
00:27:25,553 --> 00:27:28,188
asking you to make
an alien animal

661
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:30,624
using two models.

662
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,894
So let's take a look
at your final creations.

663
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:00,220
From a distance, this
actually looks really amazing,

664
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:01,922
so I'm really hoping
that the judges

665
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:03,457
are really digging it.

666
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:21,909
It's just awesome.

667
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:23,510
When our creature
is moving around,

668
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:26,380
it looks like it is
one massive creature.

669
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,115
I am so pumped right now.

670
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:49,236
I do like the way the
inside of the clam turned out,

671
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,105
but I'm worried
that it doesn't look finished.

672
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,324
She looks fierce,
beautiful, deadly.

673
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:11,458
We did it.

674
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,413
I love how the tentacles hang
out of the back of the wardrobe.

675
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:33,447
They look great.

676
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:53,000
It's hard to look
at it because this is not

677
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:55,169
the caliber of work
that I like to put out.

678
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:12,386
My heart is dropping.

679
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,356
I knew we should've gotten
some cloth to cover that.

680
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:37,411
I see some good
points and some bad points.

681
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:39,213
I definitely see
the things we missed,

682
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:41,381
but I'm pretty happy
with my facial sculpts.

683
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,589
Okay, judges, why don't you
go ahead and take a closer look

684
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:50,324
at our alien animals.

685
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,298
Oh, I see,
this is supposed to be

686
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,633
the bottom of the mouth.

687
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:01,335
- Yeah.
- I got it.

688
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,404
Ah, that's so unusual.
Thank you.

689
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,876
There's a lot of interesting
shapes here.

690
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,777
I love the coloring on this.

691
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:15,782
It's kind of like
<i>Little Shop of Horrors.</i>

692
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:17,417
Yeah.

693
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:20,954
I can't understand if I'm
supposed to see a face in this.

694
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:22,956
Thank you.

695
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:24,158
I like the paint work on this.

696
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:25,659
They were smart to put
a little bit

697
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:26,860
of sparkle powder in there,

698
00:31:26,895 --> 00:31:28,428
because it gives it life.

699
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,031
That use of the second
performer

700
00:31:31,065 --> 00:31:32,766
to have these tentacles
is a good idea.

701
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,801
It's different from what
everybody else did,

702
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:36,837
and it makes great use
of that second person.

703
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,440
This one actually
got worse up close.

704
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:42,676
I'm losing my mind.
In my head,

705
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,478
I'm completely
ripping it apart...

706
00:31:44,512 --> 00:31:45,979
It's buried in the paint.

707
00:31:46,014 --> 00:31:48,715
So I feel like they're gonna
rip it apart too.

708
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,887
All right, guys, it's time
to get on Twitter and tell us

709
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:58,192
who made your favorite
alien animal using #FaceOff

710
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:06,300
I feel really,
really stressed out

711
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:08,502
because I have no idea
what they're saying.

712
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:10,637
They did a lot of sculpting.

713
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:12,673
It's buried in the paint,
but it's

714
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:16,743
some of the nice form language
happening up in these horns.

715
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:20,180
I don't see the synthesis.
I don't understand

716
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:22,482
how that's utilizing
the two performers.

717
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:23,984
I do love
the paint job, though.

718
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:25,018
Yeah.

719
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:29,623
Really elegant
form language happening.

720
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,491
His goes that way
and hers goes that way.

721
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:32,893
That's kind of interesting.

722
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,135
Okay, the judges have
scored your creations.

723
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,037
Let's find out
what they thought.

724
00:32:44,072 --> 00:32:46,740
Jasmine and Ricky,

725
00:32:46,774 --> 00:32:49,142
Brittany and Jason,

726
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:51,111
Missy and Meg,

727
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:54,014
Nora and Scott,

728
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:56,016
congratulations,
because you are all safe

729
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,751
and can head back
to the makeup room.

730
00:32:57,785 --> 00:32:59,553
Nice work, guys.

731
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:00,987
Thank you, guys.

732
00:33:04,992 --> 00:33:07,160
That means the rest of you
were the best

733
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,730
and the worst this week,
and the judges would like

734
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:11,231
to find out
more about your work.

735
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:13,333
so Sidney and Evan,
if you please, step up.

736
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,369
All righty.

737
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:21,975
Tell me about the concept behind
your alien animal creation.

738
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:25,045
Our reference was stone

739
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,314
with a mineral
wrapped around it,

740
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:29,983
and the white section of
the stone looks like it's a...

741
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:31,184
Parasite.

742
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,886
So this intelligent creature

743
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,288
merges with it
to protect itself.

744
00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:38,058
I think you did an amazing job.

745
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:42,462
Tell me about the division
of labor.

746
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:45,098
I sculpted the cowl,
the back piece,

747
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:48,735
and Sidney blocked out the face,
and I fabricated the tentacles.

748
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,571
I absolutely loved
the tentacle movement

749
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:53,640
and I thought it was
very successful

750
00:33:53,674 --> 00:33:57,010
combining the two performers
into one creature.

751
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:59,446
The eyes were the creepiest
part of the thing.

752
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,847
I did like your paint job,

753
00:34:00,882 --> 00:34:04,117
and the back end was so great
when it was animated.

754
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:05,218
Cool idea.

755
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:06,520
Thank you.

756
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:09,656
The way you executed
the tourmaline was beautiful.

757
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,258
It felt authentic,

758
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:13,326
and as a consequence,
it's standout.

759
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:15,028
- Nice.
- Thank you.

760
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,797
Sidney and Evan,
if you please, step back.

761
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:24,671
Omar and Kevon.

762
00:34:30,678 --> 00:34:33,380
Please tell us how your clam
inspired your character.

763
00:34:33,414 --> 00:34:35,048
We wanted to create a clam,

764
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:38,452
so we thought we could have
the models each use an arm

765
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:40,287
to open and close
part of the shell

766
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:41,488
and then use their hands

767
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:44,057
as part of a jaw
that's in the center.

768
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:46,760
I tell you, it looked
like SpongeBob the Clam.

769
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,598
It was very cartoony, guys,
and it was confusing.

770
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,267
You have camouflage fabric
on the outside,

771
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:56,236
your colors were
all over the place.

772
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,672
It looked like something right
out of a little kid's TV show.

773
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:00,240
Okay.

774
00:35:00,274 --> 00:35:03,743
When yours opened up,
it was just a mess visually,

775
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:05,912
and having a clam
as your reference,

776
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:08,748
definitely don't make
a clam creature.

777
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:12,819
It could be clam-inspired,
but just not a clam.

778
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:15,789
You myopically focused
on this hand gag

779
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,757
and lost your way,
trying to figure out

780
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,292
how to build things around it.

781
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,394
I think there's a great concept
underneath there,

782
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,630
but you didn't get there.

783
00:35:25,132 --> 00:35:27,234
Omar and Kevon,
if you please, step down.

784
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:29,269
Thank you.

785
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,176
Libby and Stevie.

786
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:42,749
Tell us about the object
you chose

787
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:44,818
and how it inspired
your alien animal.

788
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:48,088
The object that we ended up
choosing was the native silver.

789
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:50,290
We decided to make this insect

790
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:52,459
where the top head
would draw prey

791
00:35:52,493 --> 00:35:55,028
while the bottom head
would feed on it.

792
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:56,696
I made the top head.

793
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:59,599
For the bottom creature,
I did the cowl and the face.

794
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:02,602
I think the core concept
really fell apart.

795
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:05,705
You had this head on top,

796
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,942
which didn't feel
like an angler lure.

797
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:10,610
It felt like another person

798
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:13,780
in a body position that
wasn't very inventive.

799
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:17,083
There's no synthesis
of the two actors,

800
00:36:17,118 --> 00:36:18,718
and that was a failure

801
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:21,788
in terms of succeeding
within the challenge.

802
00:36:21,822 --> 00:36:24,224
If it's trying to lure
its prey in,

803
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,793
you want to give it something
recognizable to look at,

804
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:28,862
not down there where it's
gonna get eaten,

805
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,031
but up top where it might
be looking at it.

806
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,399
All of that being said,

807
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:35,602
I thought your paint job was
absolutely spectacular.

808
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,704
Thank you.

809
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,906
Libby and Stevie,
please step back.

810
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,647
Ben and Jordan.

811
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:53,720
So what is the overall concept

812
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,989
behind your alien animal?

813
00:36:56,023 --> 00:36:58,325
This alien
creature is a cave dweller.

814
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:00,994
Part of its anatomy
uses camouflage.

815
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:05,231
Its main senses
are smell and vibration.

816
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,067
I love this thing.

817
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,702
Thank you.

818
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,704
In terms of the detail
that you accomplished,

819
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:13,373
it's extremely intelligently
designed.

820
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:14,374
Thank you.

821
00:37:14,408 --> 00:37:15,475
Who did what?

822
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:17,344
I sculpted the face,
he sculpted the cowl,

823
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:19,446
and I applied the cowl and face

824
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,981
and did the painting
on both of those.

825
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:24,317
He fabricated the entire body
all by himself.

826
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,553
It's like a subterranean
dinosaur.

827
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:29,356
I mean, it has triceratops,
a rhino,

828
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,092
an elephant mixed
into this one creature.

829
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,326
It's so cool.

830
00:37:33,361 --> 00:37:34,995
- That means so much, thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

831
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:38,898
The discreet graphic design
that lives within your mineral,

832
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:42,002
you used it
in such an organic way.

833
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,003
Beautiful work.

834
00:37:43,037 --> 00:37:44,437
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

835
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,773
Ben and Jordan,
please step back.

836
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:53,747
Thanks, guys, please head
back to the makeup room

837
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:54,948
while the judges deliberate.

838
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,683
Thank you.

839
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,389
All right, judges,
let's start with your favorites.

840
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,190
How about Sidney and Evan?

841
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:06,826
The fact that they just
covered the second performer

842
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:08,294
with this parasitic thing

843
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:10,964
and allowed it to become
the mechanical element

844
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:12,966
made it
so visually interesting.

845
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,267
That just brought
that whole thing to life.

846
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:15,268
Absolutely.

847
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:16,736
That black rock element,

848
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:18,438
I thought they crafted it
quite well.

849
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:20,306
It looked authentic.

850
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,575
Okay, let's move on
to Jordan and Ben.

851
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,878
This is definitely the
hardest opening challenge

852
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:27,480
we've ever given, and these two
delivered on a level

853
00:38:27,515 --> 00:38:30,083
that could not be expected
out of this challenge.

854
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:32,252
I love that they used
things that were familiar to us

855
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:34,421
like the rhino skin,
the elephant feet.

856
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:36,756
It was like an alien dinosaur,
which is cool,

857
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:37,957
and the color was beautiful.

858
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:40,060
It was a very resolved
head sculpt

859
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,862
and the paint job was so good.

860
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:44,564
All right, let's move on
to the looks

861
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:47,267
you liked the least.
Let's start with Omar and Kevon.

862
00:38:47,301 --> 00:38:49,135
Biggest mistake
was to do a clam.

863
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,136
A clam.

864
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:51,604
And it was sloppy,

865
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,406
and it wasn't a very
creative clam.

866
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:56,643
They even sculpted
and molded the shell.

867
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:59,245
It might as well have been
a piece of L200

868
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,380
with some shapes carved in it.

869
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:01,514
I thought it was.

870
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:02,549
I did, too, until they told me
they sculpted it.

871
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,550
Yeah.

872
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:05,719
And finally, Libby and Stevie.

873
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:08,154
Great paint job, horrible ideas.

874
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:10,924
The two heads
was such a bad choice.

875
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:13,193
Why is the second performer
a second face.

876
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:14,828
they could have covered him
with a trash bag

877
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:16,062
and just had him holding wings

878
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:18,031
and it would've been
more successful.

879
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:19,833
All right, judges,
have you made up your mind?

880
00:39:19,867 --> 00:39:20,867
I think so.

881
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,702
Let's bring 'em back out.

882
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:35,081
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

883
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:37,150
Sidney and Evan,

884
00:39:37,184 --> 00:39:39,285
you guys made some
really smart decisions,

885
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,854
and the tentacles
gave your work

886
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:43,957
that special something
it needed to set it apart.

887
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:45,759
Jordan and Ben,

888
00:39:45,793 --> 00:39:49,195
your creature is the epitome
of same-page teamwork

889
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,132
and the head was
the crowning achievement.

890
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,867
Okay, which team
came out on top?

891
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:57,203
The top team tonight is...

892
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:02,767
Alright which team came out on
top?

893
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:08,272
The top team tonight is...

894
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:09,340
Jordan and Ben.

895
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:14,412
The varied textures,
the brilliant sculpting,

896
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,814
and the fantastic
graphic paint job

897
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,384
combined into something
pretty incredible.

898
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,052
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

899
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,488
Jordan and Ben, excellent work,

900
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,223
but as you know,
we can only have one winner.

901
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:26,290
Glenn?

902
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:30,461
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

903
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,363
Ben.

904
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,166
Thank you very much.

905
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,969
Though Jordan did do
a massive amount of work,

906
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,804
my favorite things
about this creature

907
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,540
were the face and that
beautiful graphic paint job,

908
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:44,642
and that was all you.
Great job.

909
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:45,943
Thank you so much.

910
00:40:45,978 --> 00:40:47,678
Wow.

911
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,881
Being the winner of the first
Spotlight Challenge

912
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,315
is pretty incredible.

913
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,518
It's a really awesome way
to start out in the competition.

914
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,780
_

915
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,154
Ben, congratulations.

916
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:57,321
Thank you.

917
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:00,224
You, Jordan, Sidney,
and Evan are all safe

918
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:01,793
and can head back
to the makeup room.

919
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:03,761
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

920
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:11,202
All right, guys, unfortunately,

921
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,970
that means one of you
will be going home tonight.

922
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,440
If you'd please step forward.

923
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:24,315
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom teams.

924
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,883
Kevon and Omar,

925
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,086
the idea of the mouth gag
was great,

926
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,221
but it was your
straightforward concept

927
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:32,490
that was at the heart of what
went wrong for you this week.

928
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:34,158
Libby and Stevie,

929
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:35,893
your paint job captured
the essence

930
00:41:35,928 --> 00:41:38,029
of your native silver,
but it was

931
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,598
the scope of the work
and poor use of models

932
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:41,866
that really did you in.

933
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,535
All right, Glenn,
so who is going home tonight?

934
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:52,043
No one is going home tonight.

935
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:54,612
- Oh, my God.
- What?

936
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:57,014
My God.

937
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:58,483
What?

938
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:01,085
We threw this incredibly
difficult challenge at you...

939
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,489
...because we wanted to see
what you were capable of.

940
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:05,957
Needless to say,

941
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,826
we learned a lot
about every single one of you

942
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,828
this week,
but you definitely have

943
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:11,896
a lot to prove next week,

944
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,500
so do not waste
this opportunity.

945
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,837
All right, guys, you can all
head back to the makeup room.

946
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:21,372
Thank you.

947
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:22,373
- See you next week.
- Good night.

948
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:23,407
Got all teary eyed.

949
00:42:23,442 --> 00:42:24,709
Me too.

950
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,444
I can't believe
that this just happened.

951
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:29,480
I can't believe that
they are keeping us around.

952
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:34,352
It's all of us.

953
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:35,887
- You serious?
- What?

954
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:36,921
We're all staying.

955
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:44,228
Being given a second chance
is awesome.

956
00:42:44,263 --> 00:42:47,031
I'm incredibly relieved,
and I have

957
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,533
so much more to show.

958
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,600
Oh.

959
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:52,069
And I'm ready to kick some ass.

960
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:56,207
Season nine! Season nine!
