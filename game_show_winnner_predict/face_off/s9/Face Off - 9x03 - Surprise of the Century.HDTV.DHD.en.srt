1
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:04,579
It's a
competition like no other.

2
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:06,648
Get ready for <i>Face Off.</i>

3
00:00:11,354 --> 00:00:13,588
Tonight, the show
of 1,000 faces

4
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:16,658
reaches one epic milestone.

5
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:21,996
This is the 100th
episode of<i> Face Off.</i>

6
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:23,198
Ahh!

7
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:24,899
It's till un-death do us part

8
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:28,670
in the biggest celebration
in<i> Face Off</i> history.

9
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:30,705
I'm part of the 100th episode.
This is crazy.

10
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:31,940
You could be in big trouble.

11
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:34,275
I've made a huge mistake.

12
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:37,312
I'm excited to see these guys
and get them married.

13
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:40,048
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,683
In the end, only one

15
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:44,786
will win a VIP trip
from Kryolan Professional Makeup

16
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,389
to one of their 85
international locations,

17
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:51,693
a brand new 2015 Fiat 500,

18
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:54,529
and $100,000.

19
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:04,973
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

20
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:05,974
<i>Face Off.</i>

21
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:06,975
<i>Face Off.</i>

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,976
<i>Face Off.</i>

23

24
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,493
We are walking
through a graveyard.

25
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,828
These types of places
really creep me out.

26
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,564
Dead bodies everywhere.

27
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,532
Angel of Death would be amazing.

28
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:06,701
Grim Reaper would
just be cool too.

29
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:10,438
Then we see
this huge mausoleum.

30
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,140
And I think, "Oh, my God.

31
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,076
Please don't make me
go in there."

32
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:18,146
Oh, my God.

33
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,614
Wow.

34
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:22,083
Inside the mausoleum,
there's a hallway of tombs

35
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:23,184
all the way to the ceiling.

36
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,719
Oh, my God.

37
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:26,804
Then we see McKenzie standing
next to a table

38
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,190
full of pictures of couples.

39
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:31,142
I hope these people aren't dead
and they expect me

40
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,795
to bring them back to life.

41
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,014
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

42
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,733
Welcome to
the Pasadena Mausoleum.

43
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:40,435
As you can see,
I have something

44
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:43,171
very special in store
for you this week

45
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:47,208
because this is
the 100th episode of<i> Face Off.</i>

46
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:51,629
This is huge.
This is awesome.

47
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,915
I've been watching
<i>Face Off</i> since season one,

48
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,900
so I'm really honored
and excited to be a part

49
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:56,901
of this milestone.

50
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,336
Yes!

51
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:01,205
There's only gonna be
one 100th episode of<i> Face Off</i>

52
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,407
and we all get to be in it.

53
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,958
This is a really cool moment.

54
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,843
Well, in honor
of our anniversary,

55
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,261
we're gonna mark this occasion

56
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:09,914
with one of
the most special events

57
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,467
in many people's lives...

58
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:13,618
a wedding.

59
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,069
Ooh.

60
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:17,739
In films like<i> The Corpse Bride</i>
and<i> Beetlejuice,</i>

61
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:20,174
we saw that love truly has
no bounds

62
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,145
and can continue way beyond
until death do us part.

63
00:03:24,197 --> 00:03:27,415
So for this unique
spotlight challenge,

64
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,784
you'll be working
in teams of two,

65
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:31,285
but your models
won't be the ones

66
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:32,754
that you're used to.

67
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,640
Instead, each team
will choose one

68
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:38,292
of the real life
engaged couples

69
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,378
on these tablets
and transform them

70
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,464
into a whimsical
but macabre duo.

71
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,699
Yes!

72
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,534
In fact, we're going
to do something

73
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,586
that we have never done before,

74
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,438
and it's huge!

75
00:03:50,473 --> 00:03:52,740
Your corpse-like couples
will be getting married

76
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,976
on the<i> Face Off</i> reveal stage.

77
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:57,278
- Ohh.
- Oh, that's nuts!

78
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,464
And, as an ordained minister,

79
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:01,482
I have the honor of officiating

80
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:02,800
the wedding ceremony.

81
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:04,535
All of these couples
are gonna get married

82
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:06,120
in our character makeups?

83
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,388
That's insane.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,223
- Wow.
- What? That's so cool.

85
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:10,408
Oh, my God.

86
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:11,693
All right, well, you're
gonna need some teams

87
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,995
before we get started,
so why don't you go ahead

88
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,897
and choose your own teammate?

89
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:17,632
- Oh, my goodness.
- Brandon?

90
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:18,983
- What's up?
- Jasmine?

91
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,685
- Yes.
- Dude, awesome.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,003
Yes.

93
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:24,472
Okay, it's time to choose
your engaged couples.

94
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,040
Libby and Brittany,
you're up first.

95
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:33,347
All right, guys,
each of your tablets

96
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,749
has been preloaded with a video

97
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:36,901
that will help you
get to know your couples.

98
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:39,337
Try to find something unique
about them to help

99
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:41,422
drive your creative choices.

100
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,441
Remember, you're only
creating makeups

101
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:46,260
for the biggest day
of these people's lives.

102
00:04:46,296 --> 00:04:47,562
- So no pressure there.
- Wow.

103
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:49,864
- God.
- Good luck. Bye, guys.

104
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,966
- Bye.
- Let's do this!

105
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,054
All right, well,
first things first,

106
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:57,905
we need to watch this video.

107
00:04:57,907 --> 00:04:59,607
Let's meet our couple.

108
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:02,677
My name is Serge Conis.
I'm from Tampa, Florida.

109
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:05,246
I'm Charlotte Langley
from Florida, too.

110
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:07,515
I enjoy classic
game collecting.

111
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, we like video games.

112
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:10,418
I'm pretty excited
with the couple.

113
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:13,654
They seem very fun, very nerdy.
Kinda like myself and Ricky.

114
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,556
If we could make me
look hot--

115
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,726
Got it.

116
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:22,663
Yeah.

117
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:28,736
So our concept is Serge was out
by the pool playing PlayStation,

118
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:31,239
and they both fell in
and got electrocuted.

119
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,775
- This is gonna be super cool.
- Yeah.

120
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,643
- I'm Tom.
- I'm Liza.

121
00:05:35,678 --> 00:05:38,696
And we're from
Tustin, California.

122
00:05:38,748 --> 00:05:43,151
We love cats so much, we were
probably cats in another life.

123
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:46,237
Tom and Liza's love for cats
begs for a feline character.

124
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:49,690
Our dream wedding theme
would be<i> Beauty and The Beast.</i>

125
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,893
So we ultimately come up
with a felined

126
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:52,894
<i>Beauty and The Beast.</i>

127
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,279
I mean, even making
him large in a--

128
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,949
- But still non-threatening.
- Yeah.

129
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:00,201
Liza is gonna be a cat lady.

130
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,404
She's in love with her cat
and, in the afterlife,

131
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,641
her cat is living his fantasy
out by being the beast

132
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,276
he thought he was in real life.

133
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,380
- That would be fun.
- Yeah.

134
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,215
Hey, guys.
I'm Leah.

135
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,416
Hi, I'm Andrew.

136
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,585
Was it love at first sight?
What do you think?

137
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:20,254
Nope.

138
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,390
Leah and Andrew
have big personalities.

139
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:23,991
We both like playing games.

140
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,426
I'm really competitive.

141
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:32,066
I proposed Christmas morning
with my family in Houston.

142
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,335
We could always tie in
the Christmas part.

143
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:37,171
That would certainly
add in the whimsy.

144
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:38,272
Right.

145
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:41,108
Because they were engaged
over Christmas time,

146
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:43,277
we decide that
they are carolers.

147
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:45,479
He steals her away
to the woods and asks

148
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:48,049
for her hand in marriage
and they get lost

149
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:49,617
and freeze in the woods.

150
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,686
We have to shoot
for top look this week.

151
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:52,687
Yeah.

152
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:56,140
We are Cassandra and Matthew.

153
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,124
Hi.

154
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:59,594
Our proposal was
in the Grand Canyon.

155
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:00,995
I took her out
to the Black Bridge

156
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,797
over the Colorado River
while the sun was setting.

157
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:05,766
- It was really beautiful.
- What are we gonna do?

158
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:08,519
Ooh, I mean, they said
they got engaged

159
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,537
on a bridge.

160
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:11,439
Maybe they committed
suicide together

161
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,823
so they could be
together forever.

162
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:15,376
Maybe he hit a rock
and got a broken neck.

163
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:17,578
- Yeah.
- He's gonna have a broken neck.

164
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:19,080
In order to keep it
more whimsical,

165
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,315
she's gonna grab him by the hair
and pick his head up

166
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,500
to give him a kiss.

167
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:24,285
That will add a bit
of physicality to it

168
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:25,319
for the reveal stage.

169
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:27,889
- This is gonna be cute.
- Yes.

170
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,223
My name is Michael.

171
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,276
I live in Los Angeles
with Devin.

172
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,228
So I'm stoked that
we've got the gay couple

173
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:35,496
because I'm gay.

174
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:36,898
I'm all about
gay marriage rights.

175
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,700
I like to do makeup,
I like to style wigs,

176
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:41,369
even though that's what
I do for a living.

177
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:43,838
If I'm doing drag,
we'll go out together.

178
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:45,806
Yeah.

179
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:46,807
Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:48,843
Michael is so creative.

181
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,778
I like to paint, draw.

182
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:52,563
Michael is an artist,
so I think we're gonna try

183
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:53,814
to play off that.

184
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,400
We decide we'll do
an artist chick.

185
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,486
She draws a character
in her sketch book

186
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,388
and falls so madly in love
with it.

187
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,590
She is so distraught
that she can't be with him,

188
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,725
she stabs herself through
the heart with her art supplies.

189
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:06,861
Her sacrifice brings
the drawing to life.

190
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:08,396
The drawing is so deeply in love
with her

191
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:10,031
that he ends up taking his life,

192
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,549
and it reunites the two of them.

193
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,834
I like that idea.
That's-- that's good.

194
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,070
Hi, I am Kelly Vince.

195
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,571
Hi, I'm Rudy Castro.

196
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:20,007
Brittany and I choose
Rudy and Kelly.

197
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:21,275
- I love you.
- I love you.

198
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,978
We love nature, fantasy,
and magic,

199
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,264
and I would love to be
in the magical woods.

200
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,583
A fantastical, woodsy wedding.

201
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:32,353
- Yeah.
- "Fantastical woodsy wedding."

202
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,523
We also have to remember
the-- the dead part.

203
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:39,076
Everything they're talking about
is life and light and nature,

204
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:40,661
and trying to bring
the macabre back in

205
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:42,596
is going to be really tricky.

206
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:44,198
All right, guys, let's head
back to the lab.

207
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,401
We're going to need
more time to think about this.

208
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:50,438
Yes!

209
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:51,505
We get back to the lab.

210
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,974
Ricky and I start
on our sculptures.

211
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,709
Right away, I'm gonna work
on Charlotte,

212
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:55,960
and he's gonna work on Serge.

213
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,816
We have to keep her pretty
on her wedding day.

214
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,486
Hey, Missy?

215
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:07,288
I might need you to step aside
for me for a minute, yeah.

216
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:08,522
Okay.

217
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:12,977
Let's try and get
something set up

218
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:15,029
in with-- at least
the next hour or so.

219
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,164
Kevin and I still haven't
come up with a concept,

220
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,366
and I'm starting to stress.

221
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:19,967
I'm gonna watch this
one more time.

222
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:22,453
I'm Jamie Hutchinson.
This is Chris Whitney.

223
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:23,771
- This is our dog, Porta.
- Porta.

224
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:25,239
She's a pug.

225
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:28,009
Jamie is the most positive
person I've ever met in my life.

226
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,378
We're like yin and yang.
She balances me out.

227
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:33,314
Chris is more on
the negative side,

228
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,782
while Jamie is very positive,

229
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,817
so we want to bring that out
in their makeup.

230
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:39,003
I like the idea
of her looking angelic,

231
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:40,187
him looking demonic.

232
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:43,657
Finally, we decide
to make Chris a pug demon

233
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,494
and Jamie this ethereal,
moon-like angel

234
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,030
because she is the light
to his dark.

235
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:51,365
Could the horns be shaped
kind of like pug ears?

236
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:54,185
- Like this?
- Yeah, let's do that.

237
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:55,403
Once we get sculpting,

238
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:57,405
Kevon takes the bride
and I take the groom.

239
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,881
Hey, guys, we're here
to take a look at your work.

240
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:08,999
Hey.

241
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,000
All right, so how do you feel

242
00:10:10,036 --> 00:10:11,202
about this challenge?

243
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:13,220
We had a really hard time
finding a concept.

244
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:14,955
So tell us what you've kind
of settled on then.

245
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:17,691
We are doing a tree-like
creature for him

246
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,894
and a water goddess for her.

247
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:21,529
When they hold hands,
they're going to be

248
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:22,863
melding into each other.

249
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:23,864
- Yeah?
- I do like that a lot.

250
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,366
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

251
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:26,317
Show us what you're doing.

252
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:27,568
I'm working on her piece.

253
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,403
I wanted to bring
some of the shapes

254
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:30,738
from his face into her.

255
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,107
Right, by extending this--
bit of a crown

256
00:10:33,142 --> 00:10:34,108
right here in the front.

257
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:35,376
- Cool.
- Yeah.

258
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:37,812
And I was actually about
to start softening this out.

259
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,815
This is a totally different
design than that.

260
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,850
This looks more
of the whimsical death

261
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,201
that we're--
we're trying to do.

262
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:45,453
Yeah.
Yeah.

263
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:46,437
This has more
of a reality to it.

264
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,555
Mm-hmm.

265
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:49,023
So you might put a little
bit of that into here.

266
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:50,141
Absolutely.

267
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:51,892
We got two lovely grooms.

268
00:10:51,928 --> 00:10:54,328
That's gonna be our drag-y,
Elvira-y artist.

269
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,997
You know, I think you
can push it a little more.

270
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:59,133
You've got this great,
cartoony type of look.

271
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:00,167
- Angular.
- Make it bigger.

272
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:02,036
It's okay to do
the cartoony thing?

273
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,554
- Yes.
- Okay.

274
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,172
This is Andrew and Leah.

275
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:06,974
They were Christmas carolers.

276
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,143
They got lost and froze
in the woods.

277
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,478
What's your faces?

278
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,446
Are you planning on foam
or silicone?

279
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:13,547
Hopefully going with foam.

280
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:16,484
Let me tell you-- they are
way too thin for foam.

281
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:17,952
Yeah.

282
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,653
You'd really have
to beef this up.

283
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:21,922
For having such a thin
skin on this,

284
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,507
you're not gonna be
able to glue it down.

285
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,042
This is not good.

286
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:27,061
We want them to look
thin and gaunt,

287
00:11:27,096 --> 00:11:28,746
but we risk losing that effect

288
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:30,364
if we add more clay onto him.

289
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,451
You could be in big trouble.

290
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,604
Now I'm really worried because
I don't want to destroy

291
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,956
our couple's wedding day.

292
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:46,226
They are way too thin for foam.

293
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:47,961
Yeah.

294
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,263
Mr. Westmore's worried
because our sculpture

295
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,733
is almost paper thin in places.

296
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,418
You're gonna have
to run silicone.

297
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:55,519
Okay.

298
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:57,704
I'm nervous because
I'm not confident

299
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,356
with pouring up silicone.

300
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:00,607
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

301
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:01,641
Good luck, can't wait
to see it.

302
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:02,909
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

303
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,378
Fortunately, I have more
experience with the silicone

304
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:09,015
than in the foam, so I think
I can make this work.

305
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:11,551
- I can nail it, I know it.
- Okay.

306
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:13,820
We're heading out, guys.
It looks amazing.

307
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:14,821
Good luck to everybody.

308
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:15,789
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

309
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,924
- See you guys.
- Bye.

310
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:22,946
Just thinking about
just turning the mold now.

311
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:24,197
All right.

312
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:25,532
Now that we're happy
with the face sculpts,

313
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,667
I'm gonna take them to the mold
room and start molding.

314
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,341
I really want to get these molds
done by the end of the day,

315
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:35,759
but there's not much time left,

316
00:12:35,794 --> 00:12:38,995
so I decide to just let the mold
sit overnight.

317
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:41,948
So I'm looking
at this sculpture,

318
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:43,283
and I know it's missing
something.

319
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,451
I mean, this guy needs to be

320
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:46,286
a living, breathing illustration

321
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:47,988
that just jumped off the page,

322
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:51,575
and I just cannot figure out
how to communicate that.

323
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:53,577
That ain't working.
Ahh.

324
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:55,996
I'm not used to doing
cartoony makeups,

325
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:57,747
but we've got a solid concept,

326
00:12:57,783 --> 00:13:00,200
so I just need to clear my head
and make it work.

327
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,505
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

328
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:07,407
15 minutes, everybody!

329
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,851
- That's time, everybody!
- Boom.

330
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:20,137
- Whoo!
- Come on, partner.

331
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:27,928
Whoa!

332
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,729
All right.

333
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:30,831
I'm still feeling like

334
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:32,299
we haven't caught up
from yesterday,

335
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:34,201
so we're just
trying to get all of this done

336
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:35,235
as quick as possible.

337
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,237
Grabbing my little tiny tool.

338
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:39,072
And matching texture.
All right.

339
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:40,807
We still have to finish
sculpting the arms,

340
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:43,376
I have to finish the male face
and cowl.

341
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:44,411
I'd really like to be
in the mold room

342
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:46,313
once two hours have gone by.

343
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:48,748
We've got a lot of molds to do,
a lot of molds to open,

344
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,083
and a lot of molds to clean.

345
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,821
Why don't you just leaven
the clay peels right out?

346
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:00,961
Just kind of, like, put,
like, sparse, like,

347
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,629
hard brush texture
in certain places.

348
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:03,797
That's what we talked
about, right?

349
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:05,565
We really gotta
make this guy more

350
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:09,236
of a living piece of art,
so I gotta re-work this fast.

351
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:11,905
So I decide to melt down
some soft chavant clay

352
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,808
and actually brush that
onto my sculpture

353
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:16,343
that I've already been
working on.

354
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,044
It definitely illustrates

355
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,331
the whole, like, living
brush stroke into the face.

356
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,616
It's looking really awesome.

357
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:23,817
I like that it looks
like globs of--

358
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,019
Oh-- literally,
you gave me goosebumps.

359
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,726
I'm worried that my face sculpt
isn't as strong

360
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:35,328
as I'd like it to be,
so I definitely gotta do

361
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,364
a little bit more and push
myself a little bit further

362
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,665
in this challenge.

363
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:42,869
So I decide to do a chest piece
with a heart that beats.

364
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:44,137
And these ribs are gonna be
broken out.

365
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:45,138
Cool.

366
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,307
So that way,
it makes physical sense.

367
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,627
I can cheat more of an
empty gap in the inside cavity

368
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,329
where the heart
could be pulled out.

369
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:55,682
This character is gonna be
really, really cool.

370
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:04,724
We open our molds and they are
a complete success.

371
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:07,560
Everything cleans out perfectly.
We couldn't be happier.

372
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:13,033
We even have time to do
a first run in silicone.

373
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:16,119
When it's done,
we should be ready to test.

374
00:15:16,171 --> 00:15:17,120
Right.

375
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:18,638
Pop it and see how we are.

376
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:21,975
And we're able to get
two flawless pieces out.

377
00:15:22,027 --> 00:15:24,894
I still want to do a foam run
as a backup,

378
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:28,315
so we can compare the two
on application day.

379
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:35,021
I need to get these wings
fabricated for the groom,

380
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,958
so I decide to use Worbla.

381
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,860
Worbla is plastic sheet
with glue on it,

382
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,595
and you can heat it up
and you can basically

383
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:44,698
form it around anything and then
after it cools off,

384
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,516
it becomes rock hard again.

385
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:49,219
So I just start cutting
it into strips and wrapping

386
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:52,522
the metal armature of the wings
to give it some stability.

387
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:54,941
And it looks like bone,
and it's super strong.

388
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:57,577
And then I grab a big piece
of dental dam,

389
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:00,547
and we start zip tying it to it
and then latexing it down.

390
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,132
Aw, that look fucking sweet.

391
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,086
To make this beating heart,
I decide

392
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:08,254
to do the heart in silicone.

393
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,423
Silicone will give it
more of a translucent,

394
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,359
glossy, living look.

395
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:16,046
So I rig the heart with some LED
lighting, tubing, and a pump

396
00:16:16,098 --> 00:16:20,183
so that by just moving his arm
just a wee bit,

397
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,635
this heart'll pump and beat
like it's alive.

398
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:24,371
- Ooh, yeah.
- Yeah, dude.

399
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:27,390
I think once it's installed
on the complete character,

400
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,392
it'll add that cartoony element.

401
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:30,510
This is gonna be great, dude.

402
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,561
Hell yeah.

403
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,665
It's time to open our molds.

404
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,200
And they are just not popping.

405
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:39,753
I hate these things.
I'm so bad at them.

406
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:41,588
Sometimes the suction
from the clay

407
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:43,289
is just really strong in there.

408
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,176
We're trying everything
we can think of.

409
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:48,826
That didn't even budge.

410
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,967
- Uh-oh.
- You having problems too?

411
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:56,886
If it takes all the strong men
here, we'll get them out.

412
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:58,838
These molds are just not
coming undone.

413
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,974
- Nothing yet?
- Nothing yet.

414
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,692
Sometimes you need
a much stronger person

415
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:04,677
to open the molds.

416
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:06,880
- Missy?
- Yeah?

417
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:08,715
- Help.
- Oh, do you need help?

418
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,767
Yeah.

419
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:13,002
Missy is like
the Mold Whisperer.

420
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,722
Just trying to pop--
do you see this?

421
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:16,923
- Do you see this?
- Oh, my God.

422
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,675
She just-- pop-- bing,
bang, boom and done.

423
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:21,428
Wait, can you do one more?

424
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,196
- Which one do you need?
- This one.

425
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:25,198
She just kind of
puts her hands over them

426
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,701
and it's like, dink,
and the molds just pop open.

427
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:30,587
- There you go.
- You're awesome.

428
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,055
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

429
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,641
In this competition, if you know
how to get molds open,

430
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:36,559
it definitely helps.

431
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:38,344
One day, I'm gonna learn
how to open the molds

432
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:39,562
that I make.

433
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:50,491
I've gotten the shape done
for my head piece

434
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,912
and I'm starting
my yarn-wrapping.

435
00:17:53,964 --> 00:17:56,231
I'm thinking, oh, yeah, this is
not gonna take long at all.

436
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,533
This is going rather quickly.

437
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,873
Two hours later,
I'm finally done

438
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,642
with the head piece.
Hallelujah.

439
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:10,311
- Come see how good I look.
- Oh, my God.

440
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:12,213
Yes!

441
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:14,115
And here comes Ben
with his horns.

442
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:16,117
Oh, man, this is gonna
take a minute.

443
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:18,169
- Yeah.
- Here we go again.

444
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:21,005
Let's play with some more yarn.

445
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:26,961
I'm gonna strangle myself
with all this yarn.

446
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:30,682
I hate yarn.
I'm going freaking loony.

447
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,351
One hour!

448
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:37,422
- Yeah, boy.
- There we go.

449
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,423
- Look at that.
- Beautiful.

450
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,174
No clean napping to do.

451
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,211
It's time to pop the neck mold,
and the back

452
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:46,514
comes off perfectly.

453
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:51,352
But we're having a really hard
time getting our bust out.

454
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:57,775
Oh, shit.
It cracked.

455
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:00,461
I've only had one other mold
crack on me before this.

456
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:03,648
I'm not getting upset,
because there's no time to.

457
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,450
I'm gonna try to patch it
with epoxy putty,

458
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:08,670
so hopefully we'll have
something on application day.

459
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,111
- Tired of wrapping?
- I hate it!

460
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,003
All right, time, everybody!

461
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,020
Boom.

462
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:37,799
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

463
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:39,267
Let's see what we got.

464
00:19:40,603 --> 00:19:42,070
- How's it looking?
- Not too bad.

465
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:43,971
This is an intense amount
of pressure.

466
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:45,940
You never forget
your wedding day,

467
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:48,810
and I'm in charge of what
a couple is going to look like

468
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:49,977
on their wedding day,

469
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,447
and it's the 100th episode.

470
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,116
I'm a mound of nerves
at this point.

471
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,718
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

472
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:58,002
- Yeah.
- It came out perfect.

473
00:19:58,054 --> 00:19:59,887
We're finally able
to see our pieces

474
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,956
and we're very happy
with the result in foam.

475
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:05,576
Comparing them side by side,
we decide to go with foam

476
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:07,929
just because it is lighter
and a little more comfortable

477
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:09,147
for the performer.

478
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,232
Yeah, and we don't need
the silicone then.

479
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,034
Yeah.

480
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,836
Oh, here they come.

481
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:17,455
- Hi!
- Good morning.

482
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,375
Kelly and Rudy arrive,
and we tell them our concept.

483
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,377
When you're joined together,
your hand fuses

484
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:24,829
are going to be bark
with water running through it

485
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,914
so that when you hold hands,
it'll be the combination of you guys.

486
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,633
What?
That's awesome.

487
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:29,884
They love it.

488
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,120
They think it fits
them perfectly.

489
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:33,254
They couldn't be happier.

490
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:35,757
- Aww.
- It's so sweet.

491
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:36,891
I'm just gonna finish patching

492
00:20:36,893 --> 00:20:38,860
and then we'll get started.

493
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,932
Look at this--
Oh, I didn't--!

494
00:20:44,968 --> 00:20:48,002
Tom and Liza are way more
excited about the makeup

495
00:20:48,054 --> 00:20:49,404
than we ever thought
they would be.

496
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,572
So I get started on the cowl
and the helmet

497
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:52,573
on Tom's character.

498
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:53,574
- Is that--
- Perfect.

499
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:54,792
- Does that feel good? Okay.
- Yeah?

500
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,144
There's a lot to do.

501
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:58,913
But Jasmine and I are already
feeling like we just--

502
00:20:58,915 --> 00:21:00,114
we nailed it.

503
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:04,952
It looks cool, man.

504
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:05,987
It looks good, dude.

505
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,523
No.

506
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,524
So I'm gonna have you just
take your tank top off.

507
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,591
Okay.

508
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:12,693
I start applying
the male shoulder piece.

509
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,562
The foam turned out pretty well.

510
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,397
Where the crack was,
you can't even tell.

511
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,733
It came out good.
It's looking so cool.

512
00:21:18,768 --> 00:21:20,234
And I'm really excited.

513
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:22,303
Oh, yeah, that's perfect.

514
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:31,095
Making Jamie's prosthetic blend
into her own face

515
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:33,431
takes a lot more time
than I thought it was going to,

516
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:34,649
but it's worth it.

517
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:37,485
So now I'm ready to slip
the moon cowl on.

518
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:40,288
- It just ripped completely.
- Oh, no.

519
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,790
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my God.

520
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:43,958
What'd you do?

521
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:47,411
I just-- I just
destroyed the prosthetic.

522
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,931
I've made a huge mistake.

523
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:52,817
We have a delicate prosthetic
that is sticky,

524
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:55,570
and all the edges roll,
you're fucked.

525
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,990
- Damn it.
- Calm down, Kevin.

526
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:00,775
Re-evaluate, man.

527
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:06,347
I have no choice but to just cut
these pieces off.

528
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:09,050
What I'm gonna have to do
is use the cotton and latex

529
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:12,153
to re-sculpt the parts
that I had to subtract.

530
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,888
Just gonna do it the hard way,
I guess.

531
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:16,123
This is the quickest method
I have for fixing this.

532
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,992
This is not ideal
for professional makeup,

533
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,377
but it's the best I can do
right now.

534
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:28,703
I start out basing her
in our pax mixture,

535
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,238
which is our bone color.

536
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,473
Since her skin is so much darker
than the prosthetic,

537
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:34,258
I really have to layer that up.

538
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,810
Once this layer has dried,

539
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:38,246
I go over this
with some aqua colors.

540
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:40,698
- I'm trying this inference.
- Oh, yeah?

541
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,149
Just to give her,
like, a glowy--

542
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,518
- Yeah, that'll be awesome.
- Do you want to do that?

543
00:22:43,553 --> 00:22:45,953
I can't wait to see how
this paint job comes to life.

544
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:52,627
You can relax that arm.

545
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,161
So I need to get
a wrinkled skin texture

546
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:55,830
on Charlotte's arms quickly.

547
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,932
So I start wrapping her arms
in plastic wrap,

548
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:00,368
and it's creating this really
nice wrinkle texture.

549
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,503
By adding the latex over top
the plastic wrap,

550
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:05,206
it's gluing everything down
while also rubberizing it,

551
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,141
so that she can move around
without anything pulling up.

552
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,125
- You can move.
- I can bend them?

553
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:09,126
I think so.

554
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:11,312
Oh, my God, this is
gonna be so cool.

555
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:13,931
10 minutes, everybody!

556
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:15,149
That's good enough, dude.

557
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:20,054
Good job.

558
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:21,522
- Oh, sorry.
- It's all good.

559
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:23,357
That's time, everyone!

560
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,408
Oh, fuck.

561
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,294
Time is called and
I'm not feeling great

562
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:27,612
about this right now.

563
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:29,363
I just need to figure out
how I want to brush him

564
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,032
'cause they're not
popping off enough.

565
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,700
I have to paint
them like a cartoon,

566
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,201
like a living illustration,

567
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:35,803
and I have no idea
how to do that.

568
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:37,622
We only have an hour
and last looks,

569
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:39,073
and I'm freaking out.

570
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,666
We get to the stage
for last looks

571
00:23:50,702 --> 00:23:54,603
and we have to finish painting
the female character,

572
00:23:54,656 --> 00:23:56,889
as well as detailing out
the male character,

573
00:23:56,924 --> 00:23:57,974
and then getting
their hair done,

574
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,325
getting them into wardrobe.

575
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,777
It's a lot of work,
but I know we can do it

576
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:03,429
as long as we keep pushing.

577
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:05,214
Oh, yeah, it looks awesome.

578
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:07,099
You're like a Jackson Pollack.

579
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:10,536
Last looks is always stressful
but today, it's extra stressful

580
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,672
'cause, no big deal,
people are getting married

581
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:14,690
and we have to make their day.

582
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:16,642
I'm painting as fast
as I can to pretty much

583
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:17,943
pull this whole
character together.

584
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:19,612
Right now, he's just
a pale face.

585
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:24,900
The wing just broke.

586
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:25,985
Fuck.

587
00:24:25,987 --> 00:24:27,787
Let's get this where
it needs to go.

588
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:29,372
So we're running low on time.

589
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,073
I get all the tubing lined

590
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,358
underneath the chest piece,

591
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,910
and the heart is in place
underneath the ribs.

592
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:36,879
Is it stuck?

593
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh, oh, oh.

594
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:39,849
As Serge goes to pull
the heart out,

595
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,834
it starts ripping
the chest piece off.

596
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:45,554
We can just have it
beat from inside.

597
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,406
15 minutes, everybody!

598
00:24:56,718 --> 00:25:00,052
All right, everybody,
that's time!

599
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:01,437
You guys are so
freaking amazing.

600
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:02,471
- Thank you for everything.
- See you out there.

601
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:03,773
- Congrats.
- Thank you for this.

602
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:04,990
Beautiful couple.

603
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:06,308
There's a lot of
emotions going on

604
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,227
because I really want
to be happy for these people,

605
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:09,545
but I'm devastated.

606
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,231
I can sense that it's not
gonna go in a good direction.

607
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,400
Oh, yeah. We did it.
It's okay.

608
00:25:17,739 --> 00:25:20,673
Wow.

609
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:24,310
The reveal stage has been
turned into a wedding ceremony

610
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:26,929
and I'm just blown away.

611
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,314
This is incredible.

612
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:30,883
I'm so thankful I get to share
this moment.

613
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:32,518
It's awesome.

614
00:25:32,553 --> 00:25:34,353
- Happy 100th, you guys.
- Yeah.

615
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:39,091
We did it.

616
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:42,294
Well, as you can see,

617
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,930
we have some of our couples'
friends and family here

618
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:49,001
to join us as witnesses
for this very special event.

619
00:25:49,036 --> 00:25:52,071
Good evening, everybody.
Thank you for joining us.

620
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:55,324
I'm excited to see these guys
and get them married.

621
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,844
Oh, yeah.

622
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:03,365
All right, for this very
special spotlight challenge,

623
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:06,752
we asked you to make over
real life, engaged couples

624
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:09,432
in whimsical macabre fashion.

625
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,590
So without further adieu,
let's take a look

626
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:13,876
at your final creations.

627
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:15,227
This is the big deal.

628
00:26:15,263 --> 00:26:17,813
Not only will our look be
scrutinized by the judges,

629
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:19,849
but also by the couples'
friends and family.

630
00:26:19,884 --> 00:26:21,867
So I really hope they like it.

631
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:50,563
They look funny and horror
at the same time.

632
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,898
We're really happy
with our makeup.

633
00:27:10,685 --> 00:27:13,819
It's not totally complete
like I wanted,

634
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:16,355
but they're looking adorable
together.

635
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:37,543
We hit the mark of whimsy
and macabre with this challenge.

636
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:39,161
It's like a cartoon
has been brought to life

637
00:27:39,213 --> 00:27:40,212
here in front of us.

638
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:58,664
They look lovely together.

639
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:01,417
I can really tell
that she feels beautiful, so,

640
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:02,501
that's a win for me.

641
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:23,872
The best work in my entire
career is right in front of me.

642
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:26,392
They look a-mazing.

643
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:49,748
Personally, I don't feel like
it is far enough into whimsical

644
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,383
or far enough into macabre.

645
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:12,788
Despite all of the problems
that we had,

646
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:13,989
I think they look awesome,

647
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,791
and I'm really happy
with this makeup.

648
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:22,398
All right, judges,
it's time to take a closer look

649
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:24,199
at our lovely couples.

650
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:30,122
I'm guessing they ended up
in the lake,

651
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:31,557
hence the fish in her hair.

652
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:33,792
I think this is so funny,
that it's sagging this way,

653
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:35,294
but his head's hanging
that way.

654
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:37,946
Yeah.

655
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:40,799
I think we could use
a lot more of the icicles.

656
00:29:40,835 --> 00:29:42,251
It's too minimal.

657
00:29:42,303 --> 00:29:45,771
That's the thing I actually like
about it, is the subtlety.

658
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:48,340
It feels authentic,
as a result.

659
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:49,695
Thank you.

660
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:53,512
This is fun.

661
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:56,799
There's a nice depth
to the sculpt.

662
00:29:56,834 --> 00:30:00,156
I love the day glow effect
she has, you know?

663
00:30:02,306 --> 00:30:03,672
Oh!
There's a spider.

664
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,107
- Oh.
- Oh.

665
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:07,493
Yeah, it reads better up close.

666
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:08,911
Nice texturing, nice sculpting.

667
00:30:08,963 --> 00:30:10,629
I'm a little confused
with this decision

668
00:30:10,664 --> 00:30:11,780
to end the appliance there

669
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:13,499
and have her hair
just coming out from behind.

670
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:14,817
Yeah.

671
00:30:14,852 --> 00:30:17,119
I think they look great,
but I'm still really nervous

672
00:30:17,154 --> 00:30:18,737
that this doesn't fit
the challenge.

673
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:22,541
They don't look macabre enough
and I am so worried.

674
00:30:24,145 --> 00:30:27,529
It's our 100th episode,
and it's time to get on Twitter.

675
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:30,532
Tell us made your favorite
whimsical corpse couple,

676
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:33,118
using #FaceOff100

677
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,308
I'm a little confused
with this decision

678
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:38,608
to end the appliance there

679
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:40,944
instead of laying hair over it
to help blend.

680
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:42,312
Exactly.

681
00:30:42,364 --> 00:30:45,048
I think they look great,
but I'm still really nervous

682
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,885
that they don't look
macabre enough.

683
00:30:48,921 --> 00:30:50,453
Can you tilt your head down?

684
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:52,289
- Oh, there.
- Look at the kitty.

685
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:56,192
- I just want to pet the cat.
- Yeah.

686
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,945
This is a cool thing they made
of the hair, too.

687
00:30:58,997 --> 00:31:01,948
Her makeup is beautiful.
I love all these colors in here.

688
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:06,102
Sculpted on paint strokes.

689
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:07,337
I like that idea.

690
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:09,739
In this, the forms
are very, very stylized.

691
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:10,774
Very cartoony.

692
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:15,295
I don't understand
the apex of this thing.

693
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,713
All of the stuff
they jammed in here

694
00:31:16,748 --> 00:31:18,381
makes it difficult
to interpret.

695
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:21,902
They must have had to repair
this with something.

696
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:30,126
All right, everyone.

697
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:32,429
It's time for you all
to get married.

698
00:31:32,464 --> 00:31:34,364
- You ready?
- Yes!

699
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,650
Excellent.
Here we go!

700
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:38,285
We are gathered here today

701
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,971
to celebrate one of
life's great moments,

702
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:44,140
the union of two hearts
in marriage.

703
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:46,710
Let this ceremony
serve as recognition

704
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:50,480
of these couples' undying love
for one another

705
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:54,034
and their commitment
to a lifetime together.

706
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:56,786
Today, you are all witnesses
to the joining

707
00:31:56,822 --> 00:31:59,623
of two souls as one.

708
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:04,778
Do you all promise to love,
honor, and cherish one another?

709
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,529
I do.

710
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:10,483
Do you promise to protect
your partner and forsake all others?

711
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:11,868
I do.

712
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,873
Then by the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you all married.

713
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:21,027
You may kiss.

714
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:25,015
Ah!

715
00:32:28,353 --> 00:32:29,769
It's so hard to kiss.

716
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,402
I love you, baby.

717
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,394
Congratulations, guys.
You got me.

718
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:39,062
We're honored to have
taken part in this today

719
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:40,764
with you on
this most special day.

720
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,048
And thank you, again,

721
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,734
to our couples' friends
and family for being here.

722
00:32:44,736 --> 00:32:46,419
We will celebrate
with all of you later.

723
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:48,822
However, we do have
some business to attend to.

724
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:50,357
Congratulations again,
everybody.

725
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:59,716
All right, guys, the judges
have scored your creations.

726
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:01,801
So let's find out
what they thought.

727
00:33:01,837 --> 00:33:04,454
Ben and Jasmine.

728
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:06,523
Meg and Nora.

729
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:08,858
Jason and Missy.

730
00:33:08,894 --> 00:33:12,512
Ricky and Jordan.

731
00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:15,215
You are the best and the worst
this week,

732
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:17,350
and the judges would like
to speak with each of you

733
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:19,085
to learn more about your work.

734
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:20,970
Congratulations to the rest
of you.

735
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:22,138
That means you are safe
this week

736
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,691
and can head back
to the makeup room.

737
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:31,581
Okay, Jason and Missy.
You're up first.

738
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:33,850
Please step forward.

739
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:40,990
Tell me about your concept
for this bride and groom couple.

740
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:43,376
Mattie and Cassie
got engaged on a bridge.

741
00:33:43,428 --> 00:33:46,496
They chose to be together
forever, so they jumped.

742
00:33:46,531 --> 00:33:48,181
We wanted them to look like
they would be

743
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:49,933
in the waiting room
in<i> Beetlejuice.</i>

744
00:33:49,968 --> 00:33:51,851
Tell me how you broke down
the duties

745
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:53,536
in creating these makeups.

746
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:57,006
I sculpted his face,
blocked out the chest.

747
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:58,708
I did the fish.
I did the rocks.

748
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:02,078
I sculpted her
face and his shoulder.

749
00:34:02,114 --> 00:34:04,697
How do you feel
you did in this challenge?

750
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:07,050
I'd say eight or nine.

751
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:08,651
We just love what we did.

752
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:12,655
I couldn't disagree
with you more.

753
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:14,357
You got some decent
forms going,

754
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:17,527
then you went and colored shadow
over some of the highlight

755
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:20,730
and vice versa, so you've
completely obscured

756
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:23,233
all of the form that you managed
in your sculpture.

757
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:26,553
And the bone structure that
was sticking out of his arms--

758
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:29,305
completely removed
from real anatomy,

759
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:32,442
and that is very problematic.

760
00:34:32,477 --> 00:34:34,344
All the characters in
the<i> Beetlejuice</i> waiting room

761
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:36,679
were all very bright,
pale colors.

762
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:38,648
Their silhouettes were great,
but the paint job

763
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,117
just killed you guys.

764
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,503
As his head was kind of lopped
off to one side,

765
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:46,322
the sagging was happening
on the other side of the face.

766
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:48,725
It read more like a paralysis.

767
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,061
I think that you both
fell very short.

768
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:53,630
Thank you. Will
you please step down?

769
00:34:59,037 --> 00:35:00,937
Ricky and Jordan.

770
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:07,710
Please tell us
about your concept.

771
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:09,445
They're both into video games,

772
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:11,214
and at their beachside wedding,

773
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:13,583
they both fell into the water
and got electrocuted.

774
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:16,052
I worked on Serge,
and Jordan worked on Charlotte.

775
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:20,673
I absolutely love these guys.

776
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,759
They were like pop art zombies.

777
00:35:22,794 --> 00:35:25,011
You really captured
the whimsical aspect

778
00:35:25,063 --> 00:35:26,029
of this challenge.

779
00:35:26,064 --> 00:35:28,298
Love the colors.
You did a great job.

780
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,849
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

781
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:31,367
The woman was fantastic.

782
00:35:31,403 --> 00:35:34,337
I think the forms on her
were the most whimsical.

783
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:38,124
On the male character--
anatomically, it felt real.

784
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,678
- The chest was so well done.
- Thanks.

785
00:35:41,713 --> 00:35:43,012
I liked the guy.

786
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:45,698
His hair sticking up is one
of the things that works.

787
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,685
It looks goofy and disco
and electrocuted.

788
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,437
And the gag really sold
up close

789
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:52,989
in a<i> Beetlejuice</i> way.

790
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,825
- Good work.
- Thanks.

791
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:58,077
Ricky and Jordan,
please step back.

792
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,102
Meg and Nora,
please step forward.

793
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:12,909
Tell us the story about your
two characters.

794
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:15,995
There is this gothy chick,
and she draws this one guy

795
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,181
that she falls so head over
heels in love with

796
00:36:18,216 --> 00:36:19,899
and becomes so distraught
that she can't be with,

797
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:21,251
that she takes her own life.

798
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:24,287
And her sacrifice actually
brings her drawing to life.

799
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:26,589
He takes his own life
so they can be together.

800
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,107
Who did what, exactly?

801
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,326
I sculpted the male
character's face,

802
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,095
as well as handled
the painting of it,

803
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:33,563
as well as his neck slit
appliance.

804
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:34,764
I did the female character.

805
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,967
I sculpted the chest appliance,
as well as the face.

806
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:41,104
We're, I think, both very aware
or our shortcomings this week.

807
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:43,907
We agree.

808
00:36:43,942 --> 00:36:47,911
The idea of this living painting
is too subtle

809
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:49,779
to help carry the whimsy,

810
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:53,650
and the female character was
poorly executed drag makeup,

811
00:36:53,652 --> 00:36:57,770
so I'm not quite
getting this one.

812
00:36:57,806 --> 00:37:00,073
I love that you were swinging
for the fences,

813
00:37:00,108 --> 00:37:02,358
but then you have to take
that idea and distill it

814
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:05,828
into something
that you can accomplish.

815
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:08,498
Do you know what the term
"whimsical" means?

816
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,984
That was the first thing
that you didn't accomplish.

817
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:13,736
And then we got up close and saw
these little paint strokes

818
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:15,705
that were sculpted in
that prosthetic.

819
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:17,857
Not in a million years would you
have seen that from back here,

820
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:20,543
or known what
we were looking at.

821
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:23,079
Thanks, guys.
Please step back.

822
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:31,037
Ben and Jasmine, if you'd please
come forward.

823
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:42,265
Tell me about your inspiration
for these crazy characters.

824
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,634
Tom, in life, is Liza's cat

825
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:47,253
and they both love
each other very much.

826
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:50,606
In death, they're able to spend
their afterlife together.

827
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:54,377
I worked on the female,
and Ben worked on the male.

828
00:37:54,412 --> 00:37:57,630
This is exactly
what whimsy means.

829
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,183
First of all,
stellar form language.

830
00:38:00,218 --> 00:38:02,018
In silhouette, before the light
comes on,

831
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:03,419
we're like, right, that's it.

832
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:06,389
Then the lights do come on,
and-- yarn horns?

833
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:08,041
Come on, what could be
more whimsical

834
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:09,759
than yarn beard and yarn horns?

835
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,060
I thought this was

836
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:14,080
such an amazing, colorful,
eventful collaboration.

837
00:38:14,132 --> 00:38:15,631
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

838
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:18,868
The paint job on the woman
was absolutely stunning.

839
00:38:18,903 --> 00:38:20,553
I was very pleased
with both the characters,

840
00:38:20,605 --> 00:38:22,322
and I thought they were both
really great.

841
00:38:22,374 --> 00:38:23,706
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

842
00:38:23,742 --> 00:38:27,043
We see graphic breakup,
we get into materiality,

843
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:29,679
we've got other details
and storytelling going on.

844
00:38:29,714 --> 00:38:32,081
This was a beautiful piece
of work.

845
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,483
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

846
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:35,935
Ben and Jasmine,
you can step back.

847
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:42,175
All right, thanks, guys.

848
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,493
Would you please head back
to the makeup room

849
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:45,862
while the judges deliberate?

850
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,136
All right, judges,
why don't we talk

851
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,387
about your favorites tonight?

852
00:38:54,422 --> 00:38:56,089
Let's start
with Ricky and Jordan.

853
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,740
I loved the
graphic design of it,

854
00:38:57,776 --> 00:39:00,410
the bright colors,
the whimsical aspect of it.

855
00:39:00,445 --> 00:39:01,944
Just all shone through for me.

856
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,280
It's very successful within
the challenge.

857
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:05,448
They did a lot of work

858
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,617
and both of them
really pushed themselves.

859
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:08,835
Yep.

860
00:39:08,887 --> 00:39:11,788
It was one of the few
that really added the humor.

861
00:39:11,823 --> 00:39:13,689
All right, let's move on
to Ben and Jasmine.

862
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:14,857
Nailed the whimsy.

863
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:17,093
You can see it as a silhouette
and know exactly

864
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:18,327
who the characters are.

865
00:39:18,363 --> 00:39:20,296
They created characters

866
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:22,665
that lived within that world
so successfully.

867
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:23,950
Yeah.

868
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:25,401
But if Jasmine would have
painted Ben's face,

869
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:26,719
it would have knocked it out
of the park

870
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,938
because her paint job
was so fantastic.

871
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:30,289
Okay, let's move on
to the makeups

872
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,375
that didn't work
for you this week.

873
00:39:32,377 --> 00:39:33,876
How about Jason and Missy?

874
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:35,745
This was another paint job

875
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:39,048
that Missy had her hand in
and made it really dark.

876
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:41,167
The male character's
wonky shoulder thing--

877
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:42,418
Ugh!

878
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,253
Which didn't look like
a broken shoulder.

879
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:46,089
They absolutely thought
they were top look.

880
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:47,323
That's alarming.

881
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:50,143
All right, let's move on
to Meg and Nora.

882
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:53,729
The story was lame.
The makeups were lamer.

883
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:54,997
I really like where
Nora was going with this--

884
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:57,633
the idea of the living painting.

885
00:39:57,669 --> 00:39:59,051
But it was so timid.

886
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:00,470
Yeah.

887
00:40:00,505 --> 00:40:01,737
A little brush stroke here,
a little brush stroke there.

888
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:03,523
It's like, hey, we get
the idea, but do it.

889
00:40:03,558 --> 00:40:04,640
Right.

890
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:07,210
All right, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

891
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:08,578
Yes, we have.

892
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,846
Okay, let's bring them back out.

893
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:21,941
Welcome back, guys.

894
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:24,527
All right, go ahead and tell us
about tonight's top teams.

895
00:40:24,562 --> 00:40:26,662
Ricky and Jordan,

896
00:40:26,698 --> 00:40:29,232
you did some really cool
three-dimensional sculpting.

897
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:31,400
And we thought that
the vivid color

898
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:34,570
was a great way
to convey whimsy.

899
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:36,672
Ben and Jasmine,

900
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:39,642
we loved how detailed
these characters were.

901
00:40:39,677 --> 00:40:41,644
Everywhere we looked,
there was something more

902
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:43,563
to take in and appreciate.

903
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:45,481
Okay, which team came out
on top?

904
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:47,750
The top team tonight is...

905
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,076
All right, Glenn.
Which team came out on top?

906
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:57,896
The top team tonight is...

907
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:05,237
Ben and Jasmine.

908
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,673
Your characters were the epitome
of whimsical macabre,

909
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:11,409
and we love how you incorporated
your couple's personalities

910
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:12,577
into your work.

911
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:14,446
- Well done.
- Congratulations, guys.

912
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:15,447
Thank you.

913
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:17,549
Ben and Jasmine,
excellent work.

914
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,717
Thank you.

915
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:20,785
But as you know, we can only
have one winner.

916
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:21,870
Glenn?

917
00:41:21,922 --> 00:41:24,589
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

918
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,560
- Jasmine.
- Oh, my God.

919
00:41:28,595 --> 00:41:29,728
Oh, my God.

920
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:31,229
We struggled a little
with this decision

921
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:35,500
because we really did enjoy
both characters so much,

922
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,570
but the beautiful painting
in the female character

923
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:40,071
is what put you over the edge.

924
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:41,973
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

925
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:45,493
To hear my name right now
on the 100th episode

926
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:48,480
is literally breathtaking.

927
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:51,600
- I'm so happy.
- Jasmine, congratulations.

928
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:52,651
Thank you.

929
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:54,419
Now, there will be
an elimination later

930
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,972
but for now, I think it's time
for us to celebrate

931
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,456
our 100th episode

932
00:41:58,492 --> 00:42:00,592
and, of course,
our newly married couples.

933
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:02,394
Ohh.

934
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,112
Come on, guys.

935
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:06,064
It's really cool to be
side-by-side

936
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:09,200
with McKenzie and Ve and Neville
and Glenn,

937
00:42:09,253 --> 00:42:11,336
celebrating the union
of these seven couples.

938
00:42:11,371 --> 00:42:13,288
It's definitely something
I'll never forget.

939
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:14,756
Okay, you guys ready
to cut the cake?

940
00:42:14,808 --> 00:42:17,609
- Yes!
- All right, go for it.

941
00:42:17,644 --> 00:42:20,345
Yay.

942
00:42:20,397 --> 00:42:22,180
It is very surreal to see

943
00:42:22,182 --> 00:42:24,382
all of these couples
get married,

944
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:27,519
plus to be a part of it
on the 100th episode.

945
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:28,954
It's just overwhelming.

946
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,488
Congratulations to you all.

947
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,374
Let's everybody raise a glass

948
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:36,261
and give a great toast
to our newly married couples.

949
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:42,567
Oh, my God!

950
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:45,816
It's one of those, like, once in
a lifetime opportunities

951
00:42:45,817 --> 00:42:49,176
to be able to stand here on stage
and watch this all happen.

952
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:51,788
It's really cool
to be a part of this.
