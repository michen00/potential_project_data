1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,883
It's absolutely spectacular.

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,786
It was just a mess visually.

3
00:00:04,788 --> 00:00:07,722
I thought
it was very successful.

4
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,190
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,793
Ben's stunning sculpture
wowed the judges,

6
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:15,496
and the bottom four artists
received some unexpected news.

7
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:17,448
No one is going home.

8
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,034
- Oh, my God.
- What?

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,904
And tonight they'll
head into uncharted waters.

10
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,172
Hey, guys,
want to go for a ride?

11
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:26,607
- This is so exciting!
- I am terrified.

12
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:27,839
Shit.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,758
_

14
00:00:29,793 --> 00:00:31,379
But not everyone
can handle pressure.

15
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,864
Seriously, like,
what am I gonna do?

16
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,416
- Should I give up?
- Oh, this mold's fucked.

17
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,851
I really love this thing.

18
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,753
You messed it up.

19
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,555
In the end, only one will win

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,957
a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

21
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,760
to one of their 85
international locations,

22
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,896
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

23
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:52,700
and $100,000.

24
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:02,627
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

26
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:44,652
- This is so rad.
- It is pretty awesome.

27
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,170
We're all feeling really good
this morning 'cause,

28
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,772
hey, we're all safe,

29
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,323
and it's a beautiful sunny day,

30
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,659
and in the distance
we see this huge ship.

31
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,428
We see McKenzie standing there.

32
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:55,029
Oh, boy, here we go.

33
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,197
Hey, guys,
want to go for a ride?

34
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:58,065
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

35
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,333
All right, come on board

36
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,836
the<i> US Coast Guard</i>
<i>Cutter George Cobb.</i>

37
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,987
This is just awesome

38
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,689
because the Coast Guard
protects our borders,

39
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,241
and for them to have us on
this ship with them is an honor.

40
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:11,012
- Oh, man.
- This is so exciting!

41
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,780
What is this ship's
general purpose?

42
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,817
It's, uh, ATON.
It aids navigation.

43
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,718
Whoa.

44
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,870
Does that mean
we're taking off?

45
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,421
- Yes.
- Awesome.

46
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,689
Take it away,
<i>Cutter George Cobb.</i>

47
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,723
We are underway at this time.

48
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,079
Ready, set...

49
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,797
Good-bye, LA.
Bye.

50
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,917
Good-bye, coastline.

51
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,168
What is that?

52
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,636
- Is that-- I don't know.
- A lighthouse.

53
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,139
It's pretty surreal to just
be hanging out on a boat.

54
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,590
I'm looking out
in front of the boat.

55
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:41,175
I make my way to
the back of the boat,

56
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,978
and before I know it,
I don't see land anymore.

57
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,413
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

58
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,981
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

59
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,016
Well, are you ready to learn
about your next challenge?

60
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:50,618
- Yes.
- All right, come with me.

61
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,208
Okay, guys.

62
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,544
The United States Coast Guard
does a phenomenal job

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,015
protecting our nation's maritime
interests all around the globe.

64
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:10,705
This year, they're celebrating
their 225th anniversary.

65
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,743
We are very lucky to have them,

66
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,462
but, in ancient Greek
and Roman times,

67
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,698
mariners
like Jason and his Argonauts

68
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,201
had to fend for themselves,
battling all manner

69
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:28,122
of sea creatures
to complete their epic quests,

70
00:03:28,157 --> 00:03:31,625
and perhaps the most deadly
of them all

71
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,096
was also the most beautiful...

72
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,464
The Sirens.

73
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,633
I love sirens.

74
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:43,971
I love that sexy, edgy, but full
of glitter kind of character,

75
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,507
so I'm super excited.

76
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,844
It was said that sirens
used their incredible beauty

77
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,780
and alluring songs
to lure mariners in,

78
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,766
leading them to a watery grave.

79
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,285
So, for this week's
spotlight challenge,

80
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,322
you will be working
in teams of two

81
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:06,160
to create your very own
beautiful and deadly siren.

82
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,295
Oh, my God.

83
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:10,498
I am terrified
about the challenge

84
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,633
because beauty is not my forte.

85
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,068
Do you guys
mind helping me out?

86
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,904
Of course.

87
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:20,107
Oh, nice.

88
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,609
So these are the names

89
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:26,447
of some of the ocean's most
beautiful yet deadly creatures,

90
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:30,751
and you'll be using them as
inspiration for your creations.

91
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:33,754
But, before you pick,
your randomly assigned teams

92
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,559
are Sidney and Omar,
Brittany and Nora,

93
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:41,495
Evan and Jason,
Ricky and Ben...

94
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:43,030
Yeah, buddy.

95
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,033
Scott and Stevie, Kevon and Meg,

96
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:49,954
Missy and Libby,
Jordan and Jasmine.

97
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,605
Go ahead and stand
with your new teammates, please.

98
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:56,076
- Okay.
- What's up?

99
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:58,846
Omar and Sidney,
you're up first.

100
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,574
All right, guys, it's time
to start designing your sirens.

101
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,430
Remember, your sirens need to be
both beautiful and deadly.

102
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:17,531
Good luck.
I can't wait.

103
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,799
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

104
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,973
The coloring is what's gonna
be so important on this.

105
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,541
Yeah.

106
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,909
We got the
Peacock Mantis Shrimp,

107
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,045
and with the way
the coloring is and the fact

108
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,581
that there's a little bit
of white around its eyes,

109
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,182
we lean towards geisha.

110
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:39,103
Also it has a strike
similar to the force

111
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,771
of a .22 caliber pistol,

112
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:42,256
so we think, "Assassin!"

113
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,859
Something that draws you in,
and, with one strike,

114
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,360
it takes you out.

115
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,229
Dagger hands.

116
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,583
All right, here's our
textile cone snail.

117
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,653
The concept for our siren
is there's a beautiful thing

118
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,205
that's coming out of something
that resembles a shell.

119
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:01,842
She is going to have flutes
on the end of her fingers,

120
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:03,777
and she's gonna play some kind
of instrument,

121
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,913
and that's gonna release
pheromones into the air,

122
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:09,216
and after our siren lures men
into her midst,

123
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:12,236
she's going to reveal
nasty, sharp teeth

124
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,088
that she can sink
into her victims.

125
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,823
I think we really
got a good shot with this.

126
00:06:20,663 --> 00:06:22,663
We picked the Flabellina
Nudibranch just 'cause

127
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,431
we have no idea what it is.

128
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,566
We're on<i> Face Off.</i>

129
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,717
We're living on the edge.

130
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,586
Sexy, but deadly.

131
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,622
Nora and I discussed that
we want to do a face piece

132
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,840
and a chest piece.

133
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,376
We decide to put e-wire
through the hair

134
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:37,444
to illuminate our creature
a little bit.

135
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,580
We also want to do
some cool nails

136
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,215
just to keep that beauty aspect,

137
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,652
but also make them pointy
so that they're a little deadly.

138
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:45,903
I'm gonna need to just

139
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,504
mold up my fingers
with her finger measurements.

140
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,872
I saw this. You hold this.

141
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:49,957
- You block up the clay and--
- You make the thing, and then--

142
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,625
You do dental acrylic!

143
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:58,165
Everything's very elongated.

144
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,168
The Yellow Boxfish
secretes poison from its skin,

145
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:04,221
so our siren
is poisonous to the touch.

146
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,407
Jordan sketches out
this beautiful shape

147
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,776
around the head
that gives it a box-like effect

148
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:10,611
but with more rounded edges.

149
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:13,297
We also want to give it
a slightly bondage look

150
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,601
to give it
that dangerous effect.

151
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,520
All right, guys, time's up.

152
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,388
We got to head back.
I need to get you to the lab.

153
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,823
All right.

154
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,558
Snailed it.

155
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:26,944
Hanging out
on a ship was really cool,

156
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,762
but we are ready
to get into the lab.

157
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:32,416
I think we're gonna have
really cool makeup on our hands.

158
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,942
It's time to choose
our models and start sculpting.

159
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:46,797
You can go about
this far if you wanted to.

160
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,132
All right.

161
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,351
We picked the Blue Sea Slug.

162
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,453
It has a lot of ridges
where the tendrils are,

163
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:55,105
so Ben's gonna sculpt
a cowl piece

164
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:56,957
that has a lot of those ridges,

165
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,559
and I'm gonna do a chest piece

166
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,128
that incorporates a lot of that
into a bustier kind of look.

167
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:03,514
- What about a purple fishnet?
- No.

168
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,765
It's a little
too tongue in cheek I think.

169
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,383
It is. It is.

170
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:12,623
Well, I want to be able
to cover the bald cap

171
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,508
even if we bring it, like, here.

172
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,310
We picked
a Portuguese Man O'War,

173
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,946
and we come up with
this warrior princess concept.

174
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,881
We do know we have
to keep her beautiful,

175
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:25,119
so we don't want to go overboard
by doing too many prosthetics.

176
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,671
So, Omar's in charge
of the cowl,

177
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,058
and because this is
a jellyfish-like character,

178
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,027
I think it'd be really cool
to do some nernies.

179
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:36,697
Nernies are latex brushed
on a table, and when it dries,

180
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:39,366
you roll it up
to give these cool tentacles.

181
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,372
Should I sculpt
this with a safety just in case

182
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,174
- that doesn't work?
- Okay, yeah.

183
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,076
We picked
the Blue Ring Octopus.

184
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,578
She is beautiful enough
to get them close but then

185
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,781
is deadly enough
to keep them there,

186
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,417
so our design
incorporates a cowl,

187
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,153
octopus-like suckers
on the appendages,

188
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,472
but it has to be
a beautiful creature,

189
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,690
so we're gonna make the cowl

190
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:07,428
and other additions
secondary to her beauty.

191
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,884
Hey, guys, we're here
to come check on you.

192
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,035
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi!

193
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,905
We want to do
a Japanese assassin.

194
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,523
And we're gonna do a hairpiece

195
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,657
that kind of looks
like chopsticks.

196
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,093
In this area here,
extend that whole thing.

197
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,411
Give it a little bit
more fantasy.

198
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:25,579
Awesome.

199
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:28,482
So we've got
Flabellina Nudibranch.

200
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,350
What are you gonna do there
on that piece?

201
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,119
This pattern's gonna
continue up

202
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,620
and fade into the chest piece,

203
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,722
and we're gonna have chiffon
fabric hanging on her shoulders.

204
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:37,841
Is it gonna be so subtle
it's not even worth doing?

205
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,193
That's what I was wondering.

206
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,161
It's gonna be more trouble
to glue this sucker down

207
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,230
if you don't make
it a little thicker.

208
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,315
What you've created
there is a giant blender,

209
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,201
so make it into something
that actually is part

210
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,469
of your character.

211
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,271
We got the Surgeonfish.

212
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:54,208
We're gonna have these shapes
kind of going throughout.

213
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,692
What are you doing there, now?

214
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,694
These are nice and soft
as they're going up,

215
00:09:57,746 --> 00:09:59,646
and then all of a sudden
on your chest piece,

216
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,081
it's like
all these little accents

217
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,166
that you have everywhere.

218
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:03,917
So we should mimic the cowl

219
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,469
and bring it around here?

220
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,121
- Yeah.
- Okay.

221
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,590
We chose the Yellow Boxfish.

222
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,825
Our main concern
was how boxy the head was.

223
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,895
To me, because you've
rounded it all off,

224
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,698
this looks like you've
put a cap on somebody.

225
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,300
I would beef this up
back here and maybe

226
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:23,537
put your point back up
in here, 'cause it-- it could

227
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,638
wind up looking
like a bathing cap.

228
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:25,639
Yeah.

229
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,108
We chose the Textile
Cone Snail,

230
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:31,612
and we don't want to distract
from the human form too much.

231
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:33,864
With the face, it looks like

232
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,616
the person had an accident.

233
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:36,650
I think that's where
I'm having the problem.

234
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,703
It's just the face.

235
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:40,854
They hate it.

236
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,241
The face is either going
to keep you or lose you,

237
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,927
and the way you've done the nose
and those cheek bones,

238
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:48,896
you're gonna lose
the beauty part of it.

239
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:51,331
I'm feeling kind
of slapped here,

240
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:55,269
but I see it 100% that it
definitely looks not pretty.

241
00:10:55,304 --> 00:10:57,921
For another challenge, great.

242
00:10:57,973 --> 00:10:59,256
I'm not feeling so good.

243
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:00,257
It looks like
we're gonna have to

244
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:02,709
start the face over
from square one,

245
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,279
and that is really scary.

246
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,068
To mee the face looks
like the person had an accident

247
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:16,569
they're recovering from.

248
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:20,707
Mr. Westmore drops the bomb
that he hates my face piece.

249
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:26,312
I wouldn't waste your time
with anything from there down.

250
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:27,647
I'm not feeling so good
about it.

251
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:29,649
There's no way
to use what we've already done.

252
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,951
Take this off,
make this into a forehead,

253
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,653
possibly, that comes down
to here,

254
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:35,855
and do a nice beauty makeup,
a really nice beauty makeup...

255
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,923
Okay.
Sure.

256
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:39,625
...that ties in with
your colors and everything.

257
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,361
Time to start over.

258
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:42,528
- Good luck.
- You'll get it.

259
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,213
- You got a lot of work to do.
- Thank you.

260
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:45,348
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

261
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:47,583
- Can't wait to see your sirens.
- Bye.

262
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,335
- See you guys later.
- Thank you.

263
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:52,972
The second Mr. Westmore
walks away,

264
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:54,991
I start just tearing
that clay off

265
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:57,694
and starting over.

266
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:58,861
I start incorporating

267
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:00,646
these beautiful,
kind of fluted shapes

268
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:02,448
that come down very organically,

269
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:05,852
just like the end of the fluting
on our reference photo,

270
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:08,771
and I'm feeling really,
really good about it,

271
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:12,759
way better than I was
feeling 20 seconds ago.

272
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,369
My goal, personally,
is to make the cowl

273
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,171
as beautiful as possible.

274
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:27,373
So I decided to take
Mr. Westmore's advice

275
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:28,841
and add a little bit more clay

276
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:31,844
to make up
for the size of the wig.

277
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,312
I'm feeling good
about what we've done,

278
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:37,250
and it's just a matter of
cranking out the mold tomorrow.

279
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,323
It's almost the end of day one,

280
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:46,526
and I'm struggling a little bit.

281
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:48,227
I'm nowhere near finished
with this cowl.

282
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,663
It's looking too much
like a dinosaur head.

283
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:54,867
That's time, everybody!

284
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:57,587
Time's up.

285
00:12:57,622 --> 00:13:00,840
So since I'm not gonna
have a finished sculpt today,

286
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,242
we're not gonna be able to do
any pre-painting on this cowl.

287
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,145
It is very risky
because we only have one shot

288
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:09,749
to get this right, and since
we only have one piece,

289
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:12,785
this has to be perfect.

290
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,566
I'm looking at the torso shell,

291
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,234
and I'm starting
to doubt myself.

292
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,704
I don't know how I can make
this shell feminine.

293
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,172
This has to be sexy

294
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,758
and covering up a woman's torso
is not sexy,

295
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,893
so forget about it.

296
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:40,513
I get a new one,
and I start sculpting on it.

297
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:42,965
Instead of having
a big, thick shell,

298
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:46,619
I'm going to create
the soft, feminine fluting

299
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:49,689
that kind of matches
the mollusk part of the snail.

300
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:51,691
So what do you think
of this form here?

301
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:52,692
What do I think of that form?

302
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:53,759
- Yes.
- I think it's beautiful.

303
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:56,062
We have absolutely no time
to waste.

304
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,930
We have got to work fast today.

305
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:06,772
Today, I have to finish
sculpting that cowl,

306
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:08,825
and overnight, I thought,

307
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,578
"Why not make the fins
fade into the back of the head?"

308
00:14:12,614 --> 00:14:14,213
I feel that is a very good idea

309
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,615
because I don't need
to start over.

310
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,984
I just need to redesign
a little bit

311
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:22,655
and cut away
some of the extra clay.

312
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:26,242
I'm trying
to decorate the bodice

313
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:28,094
so it's not
just, like, a flat piece,

314
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:29,762
and I see these feathers

315
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:31,063
and I'm like,
oh, you know what?

316
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,533
They would actually kind of make
a cool little fish bone,

317
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:36,869
and maybe that would help
incorporate the deadly aspect.

318
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:38,337
So I take these feathers,

319
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:40,106
and I start stripping them down,

320
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:43,242
and I think
they're looking pretty cool.

321
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm liking the chest piece.

322
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:49,882
It seems to be matching up
with Nora's face piece.

323
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:52,952
So we take them both into
the mold room to start to mold.

324
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:55,021
- Yep.
- Cool.

325
00:14:58,626 --> 00:14:59,926
I'm a little concerned

326
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:02,929
because if the tips
of the tentacles

327
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:03,930
get stuck in the mold,

328
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,431
they're just gonna break off,

329
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:08,134
but hopefully it'll be nice
and clean and quick,

330
00:15:08,136 --> 00:15:09,602
and we'll have time

331
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:12,638
to make sure everything
gets applied correctly.

332
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,310
I finally get a good hold
on this sculpture,

333
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:18,895
and I think it looks great.

334
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:20,863
So it's time to get it molded.

335
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,448
- Do it like that, man.
- Okay. You got it?

336
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:23,950
- Yep, yep.
- Cool, cool.

337
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:26,269
So while Sidney's
getting the mold prepped,

338
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:28,387
I start fabricating the staff.

339
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:32,024
We're using a piece of foam
that I shaped,

340
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,944
and then I hit it with
some acetone to dissolve it

341
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:36,429
and it gives it
a nice coral look,

342
00:15:36,431 --> 00:15:40,099
and then I give it a basecoat
with black acrylic paint.

343
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:51,277
Scott and I decided to make
the suckers out of silicone.

344
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:53,279
I make a plate mold
to sculpt out

345
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:55,431
all of the suckers,
block them out,

346
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:57,633
and fill that up
so that tomorrow,

347
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,604
I can keep making
several castings of those.

348
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:08,828
The siren's song is so,
so integral to the siren lore

349
00:16:08,863 --> 00:16:10,630
that I'd feel
it would be inappropriate

350
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,198
to ignore the mythos of it,

351
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,567
so I am fabricating
an instrument.

352
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,484
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it looks good.

353
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:19,068
_

354
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:21,621
_

355
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:22,833
_

356
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:28,993
I go to open the cowl mold,

357
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,085
and it is just not gonna move.

358
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:35,154
It's locking up.

359
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:36,589
Shit.

360
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,145
_

361
00:16:38,343 --> 00:16:39,743
_

362
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:40,976
Okay.

363
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:43,325
I'm basically thinking to myself
"This could be it."

364
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:45,154
I mean, this could
totally ruin everything.

365
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,742
_

366
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,358
This is the crème de la crème
of our make up

367
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,210
and seriously, like,
what am I gonna do?

368
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,113
Should I give up?

369
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:58,467
- Ugh.
- We're gonna have to bust this.

370
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,902
I panic,
and I break it to get it out.

371
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,252
_

372
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:13,066
- Okay, hold, you want to wreck it?
- Yeah, yeah.

373
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:15,051
Oh, this mold's fucked.

374
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:16,469
We're gonna have to bust this.

375
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:20,540
Trying to get this mold unlocked
is just wasting a lot of time.

376
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:25,562
I panic, and I realize I got
to break it and get it out.

377
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:28,865
I'm feeling terrible because I
have to destroy this thing.

378
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,118
Oh, damn it.

379
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,203
Look at how bad that is.

380
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:35,038
The damage is pretty severe.

381
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:37,257
It's cracked
in about three or four places,

382
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,692
and it's the key to the makeup,

383
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,944
and I just am pretty sad
about it.

384
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:42,028
- I have to go back in.
- Oh, yeah.

385
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,580
Just go, man.
I got it.

386
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:45,448
When we run the foam,
I'm thinking we're gonna

387
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,918
have a pile of torn-up,
shredded cowl,

388
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,121
and I just hope
that it comes out.

389
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:02,649
Her hair might
be brighter than the lights.

390
00:18:02,684 --> 00:18:03,950
I need to test the e-wire

391
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:06,386
and make sure that everything
is in working order.

392
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:08,838
This will really
make our siren glow

393
00:18:08,874 --> 00:18:13,026
and pull in our inspiration
from the Flabellina Nudibranch.

394
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:14,994
So I'm taking four strands

395
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,097
and putting them at different
places throughout the wig,

396
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:18,848
that way it's nice and
comfortable,

397
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,683
and nothing's gonna move
anywhere.

398
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:21,768
Here we go.

399
00:18:27,743 --> 00:18:30,226
The shell piece on the head
is going to be pretty big,

400
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:33,446
so I'm gonna
have to cast that in poly foam.

401
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:35,064
Poly foam
is a lot more beneficial

402
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:37,834
in this case because it
is a lot more durable.

403
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:38,835
It's a lot lighter,

404
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,804
and it'll hold its shape better,

405
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:43,139
but I can't get that done today.

406
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,794
All right, guys, time!

407
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:48,795
We're gonna figure it out.
Come on.

408
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,380
All right.

409
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:51,848
Whew.

410
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:53,983
I hate when I have to run poly
foam the day of application.

411
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:56,352
That's always risky
because if something goes wrong,

412
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:58,071
that's time I can't afford,

413
00:18:58,123 --> 00:19:01,324
but I have no choice, so I'm
just gonna hope for the best.

414
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:13,736
Are you serious?

415
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:16,339
Somehow there is the cowl
standing there in front of us.

416
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:17,724
This is not the prettiest cowl,

417
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,276
but it is still way better
than we expected.

418
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:21,444
That's not bad.

419
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,246
- How are we looking, Brit?
- Not so hot.

420
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,597
What's going on?

421
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:26,850
- We lost all the tips.
- How's the headpiece looking?

422
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,468
We got those tips,
but it's majorly cracked.

423
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:29,619
Fuck.

424
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,455
All of our tips on our
chest piece are not there.

425
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:34,357
So we got to get
some makeup sponges

426
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:35,692
and make ourselves some tips.

427
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,060
- Yeah.
- Let's just get right on that.

428
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:39,729
Rather than trying
to refabricate the tips,

429
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,431
it's gonna be a lot
quicker for us to take

430
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,132
some white makeup sponges

431
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:44,901
and cut them down
into fine points.

432
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:46,369
It's a small setback,

433
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:49,272
but I'm fairly confident
that this'll work.

434
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:59,883
First thing I'm gonna do
is cast up that poly foam shell.

435
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,718
So I grab all this poly foam,

436
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,320
and I mix up a lot, 'cause
it's a pretty big shell.

437
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:05,488
Shh...

438
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,458
And I look over,
and these magnificent wings

439
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,009
are about to get swallowed

440
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,779
by this big-ass volcano
of poly foam.

441
00:20:12,814 --> 00:20:14,176
Fucking shit.

442
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,185
_

443
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:16,732
_

444
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,467
_

445
00:20:17,502 --> 00:20:19,853
Fortunately, I catch it
before it ruins all of them.

446
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:21,604
I think I'm just gonna
suggest to Ricky

447
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,308
that we put the one
with the poly foam on the legs.

448
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:29,279
Hello, how are you, Rachel?

449
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:30,847
Geisha assassin.

450
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:31,831
And you're gonna be like that,

451
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,416
and then do what you do.

452
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,218
The edges look horrendous.

453
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,788
The seams in the cutting edge
on this cowl are terrible,

454
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,324
so I'm just gonna
start seaming this thing.

455
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,526
This is probably the best
it's gonna get.

456
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:45,778
This is the last thing
that we needed right now,

457
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,797
because we don't have
a lot of pieces,

458
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:51,501
and the ones that we do have
need to be really good.

459
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,240
Soon as I finish this patch
we're working on,

460
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:58,241
you're gonna be able to tell.

461
00:20:58,243 --> 00:20:59,576
It's gonna be fine.

462
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:01,127
Luckily, the patchwork
hasn't taken us too long,

463
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:02,362
so everything looks great,

464
00:21:02,414 --> 00:21:04,614
and we both start
applying our pieces.

465
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:06,249
Get comfy here.

466
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:12,188
Ben applies a wig cap

467
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,624
and begins applying
the cowl piece,

468
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:16,476
and as he does that,

469
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:19,379
I begin applying feathers
to these fins

470
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:22,398
so that it creates the shape
of the Blue Sea Slug,

471
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:25,501
like a very flamboyant
Vegas drag queen.

472
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:28,371
They are looking fantastic.

473
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:30,890
Should I do the black
or the teal down the center?

474
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,375
I think black.

475
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:39,299
I start painting her up
with yellows and oranges,

476
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:41,551
but I have to tone
down the orange a bit,

477
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:44,921
so I start layering
a brown-orange on top,

478
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,490
and I think
it's looking much better.

479
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:56,532
- What do you think, Libby?
- Yellow's a bit bright.

480
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:58,935
Cowl's very yellow.

481
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,103
I thought that we were
just gonna do it

482
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:01,688
all black with,
like, an orange tip.

483
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:02,855
At this point, I'm confused

484
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:05,425
about what's happening
with our paint.

485
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,377
It looks like you're covering
up the whole paint job.

486
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:09,295
Oh, I thought we were
covering up the paint.

487
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:10,580
Not everything.

488
00:22:10,615 --> 00:22:13,066
I'm not necessarily a huge fan
of the paint job.

489
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:15,885
I feel like we're going
in two different directions.

490
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,420
I think that's good on the orange.

491
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:18,855
One hour!

492
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,460
While Meg is taking care
of the beauty makeup,

493
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:25,862
I'm in charge of the shell.

494
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:28,297
I give it a nice,
sexy gloss look.

495
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,999
I spray it with glitter.

496
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:31,768
It's starting
to look pretty good.

497
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,807
15 minutes, everybody!

498
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,446
That one is so badass, dude.

499
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:46,349
Now I'm able to see
what everyone else has done.

500
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:49,886
They have chest pieces,
breast pieces, wigs,

501
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:53,356
and we just have a staff
and a cowl.

502
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:56,526
All right, guys, brushes down!
That's time!

503
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:57,593
- Than you.
- Yes! - Whoo!

504
00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:01,164
At this moment,
I'm feeling 50/50.

505
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,632
I do like my make-up,

506
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,667
but I don't know
what the judges are gonna think.

507
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,418
We get to last looks.
We have one hour left.

508
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:18,686
We have a lot
of airbrushing to do,

509
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:20,738
and we need to get the acrylic
rods in her chest,

510
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:23,274
and I still want
to do glitter detail work.

511
00:23:23,326 --> 00:23:24,909
I think we can tag-team this,

512
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:27,345
and we can get it done.

513
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,997
I know they're gonna
check your palms.

514
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,166
We have to finish
the beauty makeup,

515
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:33,517
finish our paint job,

516
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:36,120
apply the nails,
change up some of the wardrobe.

517
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:38,806
We have a whole bunch to do.

518
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:41,943
I go to apply the shell,

519
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:44,695
and I am using Velcro
to stick it on there.

520
00:23:44,697 --> 00:23:46,564
Dude, you can
see all this Velcro.

521
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,699
And then I got a big
strap exposed,

522
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,084
so I have to find the filler.

523
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,370
I start stuffing seaweed
into this thing.

524
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,822
So I'll make this seaweed
a little more purposeful.

525
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:57,725
If I can freaking line
these lips.

526
00:23:57,777 --> 00:23:59,026
Killing me.

527
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:00,678
So Sidney's trying
to do a beauty makeup,

528
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,346
and he's having a little bit
of trouble.

529
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:04,315
- No, I can do that.
- You can do that?

530
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,733
Thank God
our model was stepping in,

531
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:07,318
and she's getting it
done very well.

532
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:08,352
I think it looks fantastic.

533
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:12,690
The paint job looks muddy,
so I'm putting more black in it

534
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:15,092
to get it to pop a little bit,
but at this point

535
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:18,012
we strayed very far away
from the inspiration.

536
00:24:18,064 --> 00:24:19,931
Ten minutes!

537
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:21,499
Evan's cutting in
with the airbrush

538
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:25,353
while I try really hard
to make that wig look pretty,

539
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,021
but I know beauty makeup,

540
00:24:27,056 --> 00:24:29,724
and this is not gonna be
the prettiest thing.

541
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,576
It would have looked really
cool, but we don't have time.

542
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:38,799
That's time, everybody!

543
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:40,334
There you go.

544
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,322
I'm feeling like we missed
the mark on making it beautiful,

545
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:46,941
and I'm like,
"Well, hope for the best."

546
00:24:58,254 --> 00:25:00,838
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
Reveal Stage.

547
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:04,041
You know
our incredible series judges.

548
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:07,044
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

549
00:25:07,096 --> 00:25:08,779
Good evening.

550
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:12,199
Oscar and Emmy award-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

551
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:14,235
- Hello, everyone.
- Evening.

552
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,587
And creature and conpt
designer, Neville Page.

553
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:18,155
Hi, guys.

554
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,925
Now before we see
your make-ups,

555
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:25,396
there's something very important
that I have to tell you.

556
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:27,898
Two of you will be going home.

557
00:25:31,254 --> 00:25:33,804
My stress level
is going through the roof,

558
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,391
'cause it's like, now my chances
of going home have doubled.

559
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:39,427
Okay, guys, this week
your Spotlight Challenge

560
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:40,945
was to choose a sea creature

561
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,697
and use it as inspiration

562
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:46,767
for your very own
beautiful but deadly siren.

563
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,486
Let's take a look
at your final creations.

564
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:11,642
I don't feel safe.

565
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:13,010
We just have a staff and a cowl.

566
00:26:13,046 --> 00:26:15,179
I don't know if this is gonna be
enough for the judges.

567
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:33,547
She's definitely beautiful,

568
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,750
and she definitely looks deadly
at the same time.

569
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,235
I think we've got a good chance
to be in top looks tonight.

570
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:58,155
The way our model dances
is just gorgeous.

571
00:26:58,157 --> 00:27:00,574
I could not be more happy
with that.

572
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:18,576
The paint job is muddier
than I thought.

573
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:21,278
If I'm on the bottom again,
I will be going home.

574
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,080
I think she looks good.

575
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,800
She is really terrifying,

576
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:45,870
and she definitely has that kind
of Greek look to her.

577
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:04,805
I just hope we're safe

578
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:08,692
because it's my first time
using such crazy colors.

579
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:27,728
She's not as beautiful
as we want her to be.

580
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,146
When those judgeget up close,

581
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:31,065
I have no idea
what they're gonna think.

582
00:28:47,733 --> 00:28:49,283
I don't know
what to think at this point.

583
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:51,235
We're the only ones
that didn't do a cowl,

584
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,270
and two people are going home.

585
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,945
Okay, judges,
go ahead and take a closer look.

586
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:09,086
The silicone is over tainted.

587
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:11,555
There's no translucency.

588
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:14,041
I'm having problems
with these forms.

589
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:15,459
They're so random.

590
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,844
The paint job is random.

591
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:19,129
None of this is highlighting
their sculpting at all.

592
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:21,298
Yeah.

593
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,666
I really like the way
that they're forcing us

594
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:24,018
to focus on the face,

595
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:27,071
but all of these shapes
fight the model's anatomy.

596
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,006
These are weird.

597
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,040
- I like it.
- Okay.

598
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:31,375
It's kind
of a stay-away feature.

599
00:29:31,427 --> 00:29:33,244
That's why I don't like it.

600
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,433
Such a confused set of forms.

601
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:42,469
It doesn't represent
the reference material at all.

602
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:43,954
The paintjob is muddy.

603
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:46,090
The cowl does not look amazing.

604
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,508
Beautiful little details
and textures,

605
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,160
but it disappears
with the paint.

606
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:52,363
I'm afraid that they're
gonna fucking crucify us.

607
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:57,201
All right, guys, it's time
to get on Twitter and tell us

608
00:29:57,236 --> 00:30:01,338
who made your favorite siren
using #FaceOff

609
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:08,427
This framing face is--
a bad choice.

610
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:10,728
It looks like two people
working against each other.

611
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,230
I'm very, very worried

612
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:14,265
because they're gonna look
at that cowl, see that it sucks,

613
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,516
and send me home.

614
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,736
I kind of like the shapes,
especially in profile,

615
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:22,674
but the transitions, ugh,
it's a travesty.

616
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:26,411
Gorgeous blends.

617
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:28,880
You can't see where one thing
starts and the other stops.

618
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:30,865
Yeah, I love this chest piece,

619
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,233
the look of motion that it has.

620
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:33,317
Incredibly unique.

621
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,105
I've never seen
anything like this before.

622
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,890
This is a mess, you guys.

623
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:41,125
So sloppy in its application.

624
00:30:41,177 --> 00:30:44,362
It looks like she's been shot
with a paintball gun.

625
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:49,267
These shapes are leaning
towards such a unique vision.

626
00:30:49,302 --> 00:30:52,453
I've never seen
anything quite like this.

627
00:30:52,489 --> 00:30:54,789
Yeah, well, that's...
the Flabellina.

628
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:58,543
They really captured
sculpturally what the forms are.

629
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:06,851
All right, guys, the judges
have scored your creations,

630
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:09,053
so let's find out
what they thought.

631
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:11,355
Jason and Evan,

632
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:13,991
Jordan and Jasmine,

633
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:16,894
Ricky and Ben,

634
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:19,864
Scott and Stevie.

635
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,999
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

636
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:24,018
and can head back
to the makeup room.

637
00:31:29,743 --> 00:31:33,311
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

638
00:31:33,346 --> 00:31:35,646
The judges would like to
find out more about your work.

639
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,715
Kevon and Meg,
would you please step up?

640
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:45,089
Tell us about the concept
behind your siren.

641
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,024
We had the Textile Cone Snail,

642
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,078
and our siren
is playing her siren song

643
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,612
on this little harp,

644
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:55,199
and as she plays it, a pheromone
is released from her fingertips

645
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:57,502
that lures people in
so that she can get close enough

646
00:31:57,504 --> 00:31:59,170
to bite them
and inject them with venom.

647
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:00,888
I sculpted the front
and back here.

648
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,206
I did the shell.

649
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:03,508
Meg did the face.

650
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:05,743
She also fabricated
the instrument.

651
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:07,845
What do you think
of this finished product?

652
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,547
- I think it's okay.
- I like it.

653
00:32:09,582 --> 00:32:11,783
I-- I'd go out with her.

654
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:15,286
That's a little worrisome to me.

655
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:16,838
Not only that
you would date her,

656
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:20,541
but the fact that you don't
realize how gorgeous that is.

657
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:22,543
Oh-- oh, I'll--
I'll take that.

658
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:23,795
Thank you.

659
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:25,763
There's some really fantastic
decision making.

660
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:29,083
You didn't try
to cover the entire body.

661
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:32,336
You picked exactly the right
things to focus on.

662
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:33,704
I think it's amazing.

663
00:32:33,706 --> 00:32:35,339
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

664
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:38,943
She's so creepy and
so beautiful at the same time.

665
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,212
I think you guys
did a fantastic job.

666
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:42,580
Thank you.

667
00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:44,866
There's a-- just a hint
of beauty makeup in there

668
00:32:44,918 --> 00:32:46,217
which is critical
'cause otherwise,

669
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:47,869
she would have been
very bland and monochrome.

670
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:50,138
It's a great job with this one.

671
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,556
- Awesome.
- Okay. Thank you.

672
00:32:51,608 --> 00:32:53,758
Kevon and Meg,
please step back.

673
00:32:57,363 --> 00:32:58,429
Fuck.

674
00:32:58,481 --> 00:33:00,531
Sidney and Omar.

675
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:08,639
Please tell us how
your Portuguese Man O' War

676
00:33:08,675 --> 00:33:10,408
inspired your creation.

677
00:33:10,443 --> 00:33:14,412
We tried to emulate the spine
on the Man O' War,

678
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:19,083
and she lures her pray with
a lure on the end of her rod.

679
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:23,888
The best part of your whole
makeup job is your wardrobe.

680
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,057
She really looks like
she's wearing a helmet, guys.

681
00:33:26,092 --> 00:33:28,176
She has a ton of hair.

682
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:30,578
You should have figured out
a way to use her hair

683
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,581
and put these spines
someplace else on her body.

684
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:36,117
You messed it up.

685
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:38,803
How did you guys
break down the duties?

686
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:40,922
Well, I decided I was
gonna sculpt the cowl.

687
00:33:40,957 --> 00:33:43,274
I went with, you know,
running the silicone,

688
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:45,176
and then we both worked
on the staff.

689
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:46,844
Both worked on the staff.

690
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,297
When you look at some of
the other creations this week,

691
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:51,983
there's massive amounts of work,

692
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:55,920
so I'm not sure
what the two of you were doing.

693
00:33:55,955 --> 00:34:00,157
The paintjob doesn't feel
like patterning or natural.

694
00:34:00,193 --> 00:34:03,511
She does not look
like either a siren

695
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:07,848
or a Portuguese Man O' War
inspired character.

696
00:34:07,901 --> 00:34:11,469
Sidney and Omar,
you can head back.

697
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:17,642
Missy and Libby, could you
please step to the center?

698
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,099
Tell us about your character
and how it was inspired.

699
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:26,984
We had the Striped Surgeonfish.

700
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,221
We used the inspiration
in the cowl, in the back piece,

701
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:31,956
and in the front piece
with these spines.

702
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:33,124
And who did what?

703
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,226
I sculpted the cowl,
the face piece,

704
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:38,846
and Libby sculpted the arms
and the chest piece.

705
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:40,698
The form and color

706
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:46,237
don't relate back to
your Striped Surgeonfish.

707
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,045
There's a nice silhouette
going on,

708
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:52,014
but the head piece is
so out of balance.

709
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:54,504
For me, that's not
the biggest problem.

710
00:34:54,505 --> 00:34:57,222
I really do like the fact that
it's out of proportion.

711
00:34:57,317 --> 00:35:00,251
But the transition
between the prosthetic,

712
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:02,853
and the model's face--
I've seen football helmets

713
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:05,089
that blend more seamlessly
onto a player's head.

714
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:07,308
Yeah,
I sculpted the face piece,

715
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,661
and in the mold,
it got air pockets--

716
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:11,712
Ohh.

717
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:12,997
Basically, so I had to put
the cowl,

718
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:14,565
like, over the face piece.

719
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,100
Okay.

720
00:35:16,102 --> 00:35:18,819
What man is gonna
go to that thing?

721
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:19,870
- Kevon, probably.
- She is frightening.

722
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:20,938
Right over there.

723
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,406
- Right over there.
- Maybe.

724
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:23,874
One of the elements
of this challenge

725
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:27,111
was to create something
that can lure men in.

726
00:35:27,113 --> 00:35:31,215
This poor darling doesn't have
anything that's alluring.

727
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:34,552
Missy and Libby,
please step back.

728
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:42,043
Nora and Brittany.

729
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,166
Tell me about your concept
for your siren.

730
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:52,370
Our siren has been wronged
by all these different men

731
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:54,038
who have come
into her coastline,

732
00:35:54,073 --> 00:35:56,007
so she has all these bits
and pieces of each guy

733
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,242
that she consumed and destroyed.

734
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,044
I sculpted the chest piece.

735
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:01,512
Nora did the face piece.

736
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:03,614
I did the wig
and all the wiring

737
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:05,733
and I did a little bit
of the costuming.

738
00:36:05,768 --> 00:36:07,752
I really love this thing.

739
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:09,186
Thank you, Glenn.

740
00:36:09,222 --> 00:36:12,189
You exercised
very wise restraint,

741
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:14,608
and the color
throughout the appliance

742
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,111
is extraordinarily cohesive.

743
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:19,163
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

744
00:36:19,198 --> 00:36:23,167
The interpretation
of the Nudibranch's appendages,

745
00:36:23,202 --> 00:36:24,368
those little tendrils,

746
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,921
are beautifully crafted
on the sulders.

747
00:36:26,956 --> 00:36:27,922
Beautiful work.

748
00:36:27,957 --> 00:36:29,040
Thank you so much.

749
00:36:29,092 --> 00:36:30,207
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

750
00:36:30,209 --> 00:36:32,476
I love the fact
that she actually has hair.

751
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:34,678
It does bring in the coloration
of the slug,

752
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,714
and she looks absolutely
beautiful.

753
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,549
Thank you.
Thank you.

754
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:41,519
Nora and Brittany,
you can step down.

755
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,526
All right, guys, if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

756
00:36:48,528 --> 00:36:49,660
while the judges deliberate.

757
00:36:49,695 --> 00:36:51,429
Thank you.

758
00:36:55,968 --> 00:36:57,768
All right, judges,
let's talk about the looks

759
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:59,136
you liked the most tonight.

760
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:01,772
Why don't we start
with Kevon and Meg.

761
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,741
I think that they
really hit all the notes

762
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:04,809
that we were looking for.

763
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:07,144
It's definitely a siren,

764
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:08,462
definitely looks like
it could be

765
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:10,247
a creature from Greek mythology,

766
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:11,582
but it's still beautiful.

767
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:14,602
The face was just so stunning
and so unique.

768
00:37:14,654 --> 00:37:16,437
Even with those teeth,

769
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:18,856
she still looked appropriately
beautiful.

770
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:21,392
Okay, let's move on
to Brittany and Nora.

771
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:23,294
They nailed the form language,

772
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,979
particularly in the shoulders.

773
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:26,097
The fact that they figured out

774
00:37:26,132 --> 00:37:27,832
a way to incorporate
that bright orange

775
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:31,419
and that lavendery-blue color
was really well done, I thought.

776
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:33,437
All right, judges,
let's move on to the looks

777
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:35,289
that you didn't like
so much this week.

778
00:37:35,324 --> 00:37:37,942
Let's start
with Sidney and Omar.

779
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:40,177
It was one of the
biggest disappointments.

780
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:42,713
- It looked like shells or--
- Cabbage.

781
00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:44,331
Cabbage is never good
for a character.

782
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:45,916
Unless it's like a taco guy,
or something.

783
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:48,018
It's like-- it was like
a Cabbage Patch fish.

784
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,753
The shapes were so nebulous.

785
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:53,023
And this is supposed
to be a beautiful siren.

786
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:56,494
This has to be appealing,
has to be luring men to her.

787
00:37:56,496 --> 00:37:58,245
It looked like a little boy
with a helmet on.

788
00:37:58,297 --> 00:37:59,463
I don't know
what they were doing.

789
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,599
Did they, like, go to a bar
for one of the two days

790
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:03,751
that they had?

791
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:06,036
All right, let's move on
to Missy and Libby.

792
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:07,571
It was a giant helmet.

793
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:09,106
And where does that come
from, anyway?

794
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:11,208
Where was that inspiration
for that head shape?

795
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:12,409
I have no idea.

796
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:14,011
I thought there
was some really beautiful

797
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:15,729
sculptural ideas in the head,

798
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:17,281
albeit disproportionate,

799
00:38:17,316 --> 00:38:19,817
and I don't think they're
appropriate for this challenge,

800
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,386
but I did see promise,

801
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:26,090
even though it became
a muddy pile of confusion.

802
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,192
All right, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

803
00:38:28,227 --> 00:38:29,677
- Yes, we have.
- Yes.

804
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:31,529
Let's bring them back out.

805
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:44,175
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

806
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:46,076
Kevon and Meg.

807
00:38:46,112 --> 00:38:49,780
We love the wild shapes
and the monochromatic paint job,

808
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:52,583
and you definitely nailed
the deadly beautiful aspect

809
00:38:52,618 --> 00:38:53,751
of this challenge.

810
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:56,353
Nora and Brittany,
the beauty of your makeup

811
00:38:56,389 --> 00:38:58,389
was not only
in its general aesthetic,

812
00:38:58,424 --> 00:39:02,459
but in its subtle forms
and its flowing color gradients.

813
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:04,562
All right, Glenn,
so which team came out on top?

814
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:07,231
The top team tonight is...

815
00:39:12,473 --> 00:39:15,473
All right, Glenn,
so which team came out on top?

816
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:18,692
The top team tonight is...

817
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,031
Kevon and Meg.

818
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:26,466
What a cool character this was

819
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:29,169
with her beautiful head-to-toe,
fleshy paint job

820
00:39:29,204 --> 00:39:31,605
and that super-adventurous
chest piece.

821
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,223
- Fine work.
- Thank you.

822
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:35,092
Kevon and Meg, excellent work,

823
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:38,044
but as you know,
we can only have one winner.

824
00:39:38,097 --> 00:39:39,129
Glenn?

825
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:42,582
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

826
00:39:42,584 --> 00:39:43,567
Meg.

827
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:45,519
Good job.
Good job.

828
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:46,720
Thank you.

829
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:48,789
This makeup was
all about the face

830
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:52,626
and finding that perfect balance
of beautiful and deadly.

831
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:54,661
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

832
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:56,346
I win the challenge.

833
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:57,864
It's an overwhelming feeling.

834
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,767
I'm just really, really proud
of what we accomplished.

835
00:40:00,803 --> 00:40:02,936
- Meg, congratulations.
- Thank you.

836
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:05,188
You, Kevon, Nora, and Brittany

837
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:08,942
are all safe and can head back
to the make-up room.

838
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:18,735
All right, guys, that means that
you are on the bottom this week,

839
00:40:18,787 --> 00:40:22,522
and two of you will be
going home tonight.

840
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:24,574
Would you please step forward?

841
00:40:29,865 --> 00:40:32,232
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

842
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:34,951
Sidney and Omar, you guys
struggled to find

843
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:38,138
a graceful way to integrate
your inspiration animal,

844
00:40:38,173 --> 00:40:41,308
and the paint seemed unfinished.

845
00:40:41,343 --> 00:40:42,876
Missy and Libby,

846
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:46,246
we also saw few signs
of your inspirational animal,

847
00:40:46,281 --> 00:40:48,615
and there are
just too many disparate ideas

848
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,634
going on for your design
to work.

849
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,770
So who is the first person
to go home tonight?

850
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:57,257
The first person
going home tonight is...

851
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:03,830
Sidney.

852
00:41:03,866 --> 00:41:07,517
Your contribution to this makeup
seemed very minimal,

853
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:09,936
and the one piece of yours
that we did see

854
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:13,840
didn't give us a great sense
of your future potential.

855
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,559
Sidney, I'm so sorry,

856
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:17,611
but you have been eliminated.

857
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,579
It's been great
having you here with us,

858
00:41:19,615 --> 00:41:21,231
but if you'd please head back
to the makeup room

859
00:41:21,283 --> 00:41:23,783
and pack up your kit.

860
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:26,052
It is really disappointing
that I'm going home,

861
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:27,954
but everybody's so good
this season

862
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,690
that you could do a good makeup
and get kicked off.

863
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:32,559
What can I do?

864
00:41:34,763 --> 00:41:37,731
So who is the second person
going home tonight?

865
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:41,568
The second person
going home tonight is...

866
00:41:45,574 --> 00:41:47,807
Omar.

867
00:41:47,843 --> 00:41:52,112
Your cowl sculpture
sort of resembled a brain

868
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:56,583
or a cabbage, which is
the opposite of beautiful.

869
00:41:56,618 --> 00:41:57,951
Omar, I'm sorry,

870
00:41:58,003 --> 00:42:00,720
but you have also been
eliminated.

871
00:42:00,756 --> 00:42:03,473
Missy, Libby,
you're both safe this week.

872
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:05,825
You can head back
to the makeup room.

873
00:42:09,314 --> 00:42:11,398
Omar, even though
this is the end

874
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:13,250
of your journey here
on<i> Face Off,</i>

875
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:16,553
tomorrow is the new journey
for you, so good luck.

876
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:17,771
Thank you.

877
00:42:17,823 --> 00:42:20,190
Omar, it's been great
having you here with us,

878
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:22,692
but if you'd please head back
to the makeup room

879
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:24,444
and pack up your kit.

880
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:25,829
Thank you.

881
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,113
I am disappointed that I'm not

882
00:42:27,165 --> 00:42:29,449
gonna be able to show
a lot more of what I can do,

883
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:31,167
but it's a competition,

884
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:36,623
and I knew I was gonna be
surrounded by amazing artists.

885
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:37,791
- Aw.
- Seriously?

886
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:39,009
And me.

887
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:40,460
I've definitely learned
a lot about myself.

888
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:42,045
Okay, all right, guys.

889
00:42:42,097 --> 00:42:43,997
I was only here
for a short period of time,

890
00:42:44,032 --> 00:42:46,199
but I was really pushed
to my limit.

891
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:48,718
I've learned that I can do this.

892
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,572
Moving forward, I'm gonna
continue doing special effects.

893
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:54,724
I love it, it's my passion,

894
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:56,307
and this is not the end
of the line for me.
