1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:04,000
We are live from Los
Angeles on Halloween.

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:05,868
SyFy's biggest
night of the year.

3
00:00:05,869 --> 00:00:09,638
Tonight for the first time in
"Face Off" history, your votes

4
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,240
will crown our champion.

5
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:14,576
It's a night filled with
exclusive behind-the-scenes

6
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:17,246
footage and
never-before-seen moments.

7
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:20,283
Plus, a sneak peek at what's
in store for next season.

8
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:24,353
The live season finale of
"Face Off" starts now!

9
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:32,228
- 11 weeks ago on the biggest season
of "Face Off"-- - I'm freaking out.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,062
This is stunning.

11
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:36,065
The challenges were
bigger and bolder.

12
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,499
Took my breath away.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,601
The competition was fierce.

14
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:42,471
My mold just starts cracking.

15
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:44,140
Fuck.
It's a disaster.

16
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,507
There is a lot of blood.

17
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,877
I'm bleeding like a maniac.

18
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,114
You are incredibly ambitious and
the huge risk really paid off.

19
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,115
I don't know what to say.

20
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:53,782
I love it.

21
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:59,508
- The design is vey exquisite.
- And now just three remain-- Derek--

22
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:01,199
I definitely want to win this.

23
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,059
Laura.

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,121
I will try to knock
it out of the park.

25
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:04,696
Nicole.

26
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,865
I just want to win this.

27
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,067
Really bad.
Really, really bad.

28
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:11,736
But only one will win.

Good evening, everybody,
and happy Halloween.

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,150
I'm McKenzie Westmore.

32
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:33,396
Welcome to SyFy's biggest night of the year
and the first ever live "Face Off" season finale.

33
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:36,298
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:41,666
Last night, you witnessed an
incredible stunt routine

35
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:45,674
featuring witches and demons
created by our three finalists.

36
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:48,348
Then we asked you to
determine the winner.

37
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:49,302
You rocked.

38
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:51,637
Well over a million votes.

39
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,673
Tonight, a brand new "Face Off"

40
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,190
champion will be crowned.

41
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:58,461
Plus, the cast and judges will
be answering your questions

42
00:01:58,578 --> 00:01:59,753

00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:03,317
Joining us tonight is our expert
panel of judges-- owner of

Production designer and
director Patrick Tatopoulos.

47
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:25,643
Thank you so much for
being here tonight.

48
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,048
Thanks for joining us.

49
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,229
As you can see, we are missing a
familiar face on our panel here.

50
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:35,247
Our three-time Oscar-winning makeup
artist Ve Neill, she is currently on set

51
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:38,453
for The Hunger Games sequel
"Catching Fire" but she sent a

52
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:42,400
message to our finalists which
we'll show you later in the show.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,041
Now... let's say hi to the
cast for the season.

54
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,408
Hey, guys.

55
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,088
I have some questions for you.

56
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,524
Before we do that let's
bring out our finalists.

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,777
First up, from Florida,
we have Laura.

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,687
You look beautiful!

59
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:16,841
Next up from Miami,
Florida, we have Derek.

60
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:30,613
And finally from Sacramento,
California, we have Nicole.

61
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:40,762
All right.

62
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,556
So there is a huge grand prize
package on the line here tonight

63
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,899
for one of these three
very talented artists.

64
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:49,332
The opportunity to become a guest
lecturer at Makeup Forever's

65
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:56,151
academies at New York and Paris,
the 2012 Toyota Prius V, and

66
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,642
$100,000.

67
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:07,856
It's great to see
you guys again.

68
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,924
Nice to see you as
regular human beings.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,289
We're like on a stage here.

70
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,621
I heard that you have all been
up to some amazing things,

71
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,715
really working hard
since we wrapped up.

72
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:21,679
Jason, I hear you
have a new gig.

73
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:22,459
What's going on?

74
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:24,100
I do.
I work at "Saturday Night Live."

75
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,181
I have been assisting
in the shop.

76
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,211
It's been awesome.

77
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:32,174
It was a nice transition to go
from this crazy show to another

78
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:32,923
crazy show.

79
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:36,267
Just the wealth of
knowledge there.

80
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,764
They have so much experience.

81
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,317
It's awesome to work there.

82
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:43,491
I'm sure this was a great training
ground to head over there.

83
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:44,786
Same turn around.

84
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,027
Two days and the show.

85
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,201
That's fantastic.
I love "SNL".

86
00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:49,885
Tommy, what's
going on with you?

87
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,638
"Face off" hasn't ended for me.

88
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:57,396
I hit the ground running, packed
up the car in Ohio and me and my

89
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:01,582
girlfriend took the long drive
to California, moved out here.

90
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:02,991
Welcome to LA.

91
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,011
Thank you.

92
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:07,217
Just to pursue my career as a makeup
artist, special effects artist.

93
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,997
As soon as I landed I was
welcomed by the "Face Off"

94
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:12,571
family from the previous cast.

95
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:16,690
Here we go!
I love that picture!

96
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:19,758
They have been helping me out.

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,738
They have been showing me how
to handle the new life I have

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,258
and how to be more professional.

99
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:32,797
I live with Gage from season
1 and Greg from season 2.

100
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:35,600
- It's like some Face Off's fart house
there. - It's like that every week.

101
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,794
We all watch the episodes together
and take care of each other.

102
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:39,882
We're like a family.

103
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:40,709
Very cool.

104
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,051
I couldn't have done
it without them.

105
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:43,729
That's awesome.

106
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:44,970
Rod.

107
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,853
Yeah?

108
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:49,542
My heart went out to you through
the season with your wrist.

109
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:50,388
How are you doing?

110
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,835
The wrist is much better.

111
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,062
I have to thank the viewers
that have written in and asked.

112
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,362
It's much, much better.

113
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,208
I had great physical
therapy on it.

114
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,483
It's stronger.

115
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:03,902
Now I can sculpt and do
everything I need to do.

116
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:04,640
Thank God.

117
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:10,122
CC, I hear you have a
new business venture.

118
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:10,934
Tell us about it.

119
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:14,346
I got a great opportunity to
start my own makeup brush line.

120
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:16,591
It's been really amazing.

121
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,807
You can see there.

122
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:20,572
Check them out and
find them online.

123
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:21,650
Go, CC!

124
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:23,554
Congratulations.

125
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:24,844
You'll hook me up
with some, right?

126
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:25,752
Of course!

127
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,255
It's great to hear how
well you're doing.

128
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:35,003
You all did amazing makeups
and creations this season.

129
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:38,144
What we didn't always get to see
is what you thought of each

130
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:39,315
other's makeups.

131
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,810
Let's take a look.

132
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:49,944
- The winner of this challenge is--
- The first spotlight challenge

133
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,103
and we're doing "Star Wars."

134
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,372
All of us start freaking out.

135
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:59,147
Rod and Roy's was unlike
any other makeup.

136
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:00,332
Really, really cool.

137
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:01,395
Awesome!

138
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,936
I have never seen anything
like that before.

139
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,635
The sheer concept
is unbelievable.

140
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:07,167
Thank you.

141
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:08,446
I'm extremely impressed.

142
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,716
Oh!

143
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:12,218
We have to do it.

144
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,345
I love her.

145
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:14,444
I knew you were
going to kill it.

146
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,382
I'm in love with Sarah's.

147
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:19,092
I want to rock the
sea urchin dress.

148
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:19,953
It's perfect.

149
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh, God.

150
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,841
They love my ooze trick.

151
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:25,475
I'm happy I did it.

152
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:27,327
That is great.

153
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,762
Awesome!

154
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,291
I'm looking at Tommy
and Derek's makeup.

155
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,963
They nailed it.

156
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:42,302
What they incorporated, if you
look at the detail work, it

157
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:43,376
is phenomenal.

158
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:46,203
One of the strongest collaborations
I have seen on the show.

159
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,067
Thanks.

160
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,635
I'm pretty thrilled
with this thing.

161
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:53,038
Laura, I look at her sculpt
and it's incredible.

162
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,329
I'm happy with it.

163
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,316
She's going with a longer chin
and it's really, really creepy.

164
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,372
The tubing around the head so it
bleeds from the eyes, it's a

165
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,581
sick, solid design.

166
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:08,921
Can you stick your tongue
out of the mouth hole?

167
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:11,161
Ooh!

168
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,432
Welcome to the junkward.

169
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,420
I like this one.

170
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:17,110
Nicole, you suck.

171
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:18,311
That's amazing.

172
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:22,823
She had a really elegant
cyborg princess thing.

173
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,054
It's the coolest thing
I have ever done.

174
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:27,587
You could put her in front
of a camera right now.

175
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:31,531
Your final spotlight challenge.

176
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:34,205
We have to do good
witch and demon.

177
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,501
This is a toughy tonight, guys.

178
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,058
We like them all.

179
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:39,808
It's a difficult decision.

180
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,118
I'm glad we don't have
to make it tonight.

181
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:48,465
Okay.

182
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:51,336
Well, you guys have been sending
us great questions about this

183
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:53,364
season's makeups and challenges.

184
00:08:53,502 --> 00:08:56,160
We're going to answer some of
them throughout tonight's show.

185
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:59,369
If you have a question for us,
post it on Twitter now using

186
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:01,367
♪ FaceOff.

187
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,878
Let's get started.

188
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:06,343
The first question
is for Sarah.

189
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:09,277
What was your favorite
challenge this season?

190
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:11,541
I loved the pirate.

191
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:16,953
But I think my favorite challenge
was probably the kid challenge.

192
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:18,905
It was really fun to
work with the kids.

193
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:23,121
They have such creativity and
haven't learned to hold back yet.

194
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,205
It's inspiring to
work with them.

195
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:29,294
Kind of like working with a
client-- that's a lot younger.

196
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,145
A 7-year-old client.

197
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:32,122
Yes.

198
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:32,908
It was fun.

199
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:33,984
That was my favorite, too.

200
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:34,849
I loved that with the kids.

201
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:38,092
Derek, what was your favorite?

202
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,641
Definitely the dragon challenge
was one of my favorites.

203
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:46,492
The dragon one hit me at home.

204
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:52,592
Just because I'm a tattoo artist I
wanted to incorporate a tattoo

205
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,136
design in one of my makeups.

206
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:57,640
With Tommy, we made it happen.

207
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:00,551
I loved how it came out.

208
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:03,620
That one show cased your
talents as a tattoo artist.

209
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,811
It was beautifully done.

210
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:05,849
I appreciate it.

211
00:10:05,994 --> 00:10:07,836
Nicole, what was yours?

212
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:09,464
Definitely the cyborg.

213
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:12,146
That's up my aisle.

214
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,443
There she is.

215
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:19,604
It's dark, dangerous
but still beautiful.

216
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:22,230
That's my aesthetic.

217
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:24,644
Can you make me that for
Halloween this year?

218
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:25,542
I would love it.

219
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,316
That would be awesome.

220
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:28,337
Okay.

221
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,469
Let's go to the next
question from Maddie R.

222
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,799
Alana.

223
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:37,888
Whose creation our of all the
challenges was your favorite?

224
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:41,451
My favorite hast to be Rod's from
the pirate challenge.

225
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,925
He did a fabulous seahorse.

226
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:48,403
It had so much detail and the
application was absolutely flawless.

227
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:50,418
It was two characters in one.

228
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:51,960
I was blown away.

229
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:54,638
Speaking of Rod, you were very
close through the show and

230
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,267
you were upset when
he was eliminated.

231
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,689
Do you keep in touch?

232
00:10:57,802 --> 00:10:58,859
Every day.

233
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,677
I love you, Rod.

234
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:06,391
I ask myself every morning,
what would Rod do.

235
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,857
You wake up with that
thought to start the day.

236
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,663
Now all of us,
what would Rod do?

237
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,327
Eric, whose makeup did you
really like this season?

238
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,685
There was a lot of them.

239
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,232
They were all awesome.

240
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:25,118
- But it's not just because of
my brother-- - Sure, sure.

241
00:11:25,238 --> 00:11:26,547
Uh-huh, right.

242
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,514
But the cyborg
creation was awesome.

243
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:31,952
The design he made was so
cool-looking from the drawing to

244
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:32,931
the makeups.

245
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,152
It just looked sweet.

246
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,778
I definitely want to wear
that if I get a chance to.

247
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,349
Brotherly love.

248
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,397
I love it.

249
00:11:42,514 --> 00:11:43,924
Laura, what about you?

250
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:49,146
I really liked Roy's watchman
from the "Dishonored" video game.

251
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:52,181
It looked like a videogame character.

252
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,929
I play so many RPGs and
video games myself.

253
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,072
It looks like it was
straight out of one.

254
00:11:58,154 --> 00:11:59,626
He made the articulated arm.

255
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:03,296
- Well done.
- Totally agree.

256
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:07,899
Roy, you made such an
impression and everybody was

257
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,432
sorry to see you go.

258
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:12,273
Many questions came in for you.

259
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:17,046
We have one from
Zach Hill @dudeinabox for Roy.

260
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:21,467
What kind of background led you to
being so awesome at fabrication?

261
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,590
First of all, I don't
think I'm that awesome.

262
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:29,625
But it started when I was a kid
and I would take things apart to

263
00:12:29,753 --> 00:12:30,974
see how they worked.

264
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,250
That led to trial and error.

265
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:38,427
That taught me not to be afraid
to fail and learn from mistakes.

266
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,381
That's the biggest thing.

267
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,725
You did amazing work and you
are the king of fabrication.

268
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:49,438
Thank you.

269
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:50,608
All right.

270
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:53,849
For those of you at home who would
like to see more exclusive

271
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:56,970
footage from the show including
Roy's incredible creations, be

272
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,917
sure to check out the SyFy synch
app and keep an eye on it.

273
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:04,704
More bonus content will be unlocked
there throughout the night.

274
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:08,800
Now let's switch gears a little
bit and get to your questions

275
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,495
for our judges.

276
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,295
Glenn, we'll start with you.

277
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,853
The first question
comes from Linda S.

278
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,472
What movie makeup inspired you
to get into this industry?

279
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,433
That's a really
difficult question.

280
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,060
I have been asked
that many times.

281
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:27,100
There are so many films that
were so important to me.

282
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:33,074
First are the films like Dracula
which I watched at a young age.

283
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:38,721
But the I have to say honestly that the
cinebite makeups in "Hellraiser."

284
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:43,551
I had such an impression that I really
galvanized my decision to make this my carreer.

285
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:47,120
I'm shocked, to be honest with you.

286
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:48,532
Not Mary poppins?

287
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,425
Not Mary poppins.

288
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:53,605
I'm shocked.

289
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:55,208
Neville?

290
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,700
You would be surprised.

291
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,376
It doesn't show up in the work I
do but "The Exorcist" was a film

292
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:07,655
my mom took my mom and my sister
and I to when I was 9 years old.

293
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:08,899
What is wrong with your parents?

294
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:09,743
I know.

295
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:12,692
It made such an impact.

296
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:18,998
It horrified me but it presented
what you can do to an audience

297
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,106
with powerful makeup.

298
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:23,759
I wanted to know
how it was done.

299
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:30,350
Dick Smith who did the makeup
for the movie came out with a

300
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:32,182
monster maker kit.

301
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,682
I was lucky to
get one of those.

302
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:38,080
Used up the whole
kit in one weekend.

303
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,564
At that point I guess you
could say I was-- possessed.

304
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:46,783
I have to say I'm not shocked.

305
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:48,711
This explains a lot to me now.

306
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:49,273
Really?

307
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:50,356
Totally get you now.

308
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,790
Glad I could help.

309
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:54,413
Patrick, this is for you
from Alexis Taylor.

310
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:01,567
How does taking a risk stack up
to playing it safe in elimination and can a

311
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,290
creative concept help save you?

312
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:08,094
Playing safe for me is
not giving all of it.

313
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,907
If you're safe, you're
not giving it all.

314
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:12,337
That's a problem.

315
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,338
Especially on the final.

316
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,899
You have to give
everything you have.

317
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,520
You have to go beyond that.

318
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,658
The final is about winning, but
even if you don't win you want

319
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:22,209
to be remembered for
something special.

320
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,274
You don't want to
be bland, boring.

321
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,066
Take the chances and
go all the way.

322
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,411
That's the way to go.

323
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:31,080
Couldn't agree more.

324
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:32,215
Boring is bad.

325
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,576
Don't like boring.

326
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,983
Later on in the show we will
reveal which artist will see

327
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,685
their "Face Off" dream
become a reality.

328
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,702
When we come back, you will see
how Laura landed a place in the

329
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:50,130
final three and surprising
unseen moments with our judges.

330
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,633
This is the live season
finale of "Face Off."

331
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,909
Welcome back to SyFy's biggest
night of the year and

332
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:13,119
the first ever live season
finale of "Face Off."

333
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:16,710
Later on, we will reveal the
results of your vote and crown

334
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,255
this season's "Face Off"

335
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:19,304
champion.

336
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,441
Now, remember, if you have
questions you would like to have

337
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:24,472
answered on tonight's show, send
them to us using hash tag,

♪FaceOff.

339
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:29,536
So with that, Laura,
I have a question for you.

340
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,563
Is it hard to fall asleep at
night or do you keep tweaking your

341
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:37,633
designs instead of
counting sheep?

342
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:40,523
It was never hard
to fall asleep.

343
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,120
We would be very, very tired
from our busy day of work.

344
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:46,741
But, yes.

345
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:50,179
I would continuously tweak my
designs throughout the three

346
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,613
days of the challenge.

347
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:55,281
You never know what's going to
make or break your character.

348
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:59,145
It could be the last-minute decision
that takes it over the top.

349
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,121
So true.

350
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:04,010
Let's take a look at the highlights
of your journey this season.

351
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:05,343
Laura.

352
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:06,566
Oh, my gosh!

353
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:07,714
My name is Laura.

354
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,941
I'm a self-taught special
effects makeup artist.

355
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:12,329
I can't believe we
got "Star Wars."

356
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:14,230
I'm such a nerd.

357
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,756
I like seeing my
art come to life.

358
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,583
This is probably the
cleanest makeup I have seen.

359
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,869
Excellent job, ladies.

360
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:23,703
Thank you.

361
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:26,021
My art creates a story.

362
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:28,240
Tell us about the top look.

363
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:29,590
Laura and Sarah.

364
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:30,256
Laura.

365
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:30,729
Laura.

366
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,845
Laura and Tommy.

367
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:33,374
I have only been safe twice.

368
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:35,741
The rest of the time I have
been in the top looks.

369
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:38,787
But I haven't won a challenge.

370
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:40,056
Winner is Derek.

371
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:41,629
Sarah.

372
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:43,070
Alana.

373
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:49,894
The only way I can get my head in
the game is to block out emotion.

374
00:17:50,053 --> 00:17:51,315
Looks like you're
really going for it.

375
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:52,705
Trying!

376
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,677
I'm not going to say
"next time" anymore.

377
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:58,649
I can just be myself
and have fun.

378
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:00,048
I know I can do this.

379
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,922
Our winner tonight is Laura.

380
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:05,475
You got it!

381
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:06,397
What?
No.

382
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:07,328
Laura.

383
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:10,215
- Congratulations
- Thank you!

384
00:18:10,337 --> 00:18:11,254
Very impressive.

385
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,809
My heart is soaring.

386
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:15,968
I can't help but think how
proud my husband would be.

387
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:20,281
Without him I wouldn't have had the
confidence to try out for this.

388
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:21,616
Couldn't be more proud.

389
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,717
"Face Off" has been inspiring.

390
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:27,807
If I win, I can do anything.

391
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:36,271
Don't cry.

392
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,555
Congratulations on being the
only artist this season to not

393
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,030
have a bottom look.

394
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:45,631
Well done.

395
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:47,821
All right.

396
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:51,387
So, Glenn, what was it about
Laura's work this season for you

397
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,428
that helped land her a
spot in the final three?

398
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:56,844
I think it's three
things really.

399
00:18:56,957 --> 00:19:00,927
She starts off with truly
stellar conceptual design.

400
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:04,286
She follows through on the
design with excellent

401
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,792
decision-making in the lab.

402
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:08,243
She sticks to the concept
and plays it out.

403
00:19:08,385 --> 00:19:12,581
That allows her to create these
really well-made prosthetics.

404
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:15,679
When she applies them
it's beautiful edge work.

405
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,096
The edges are blend blended
seamlessly, beautiful paint job

406
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,033
and color.

407
00:19:20,143 --> 00:19:21,725
Everything comes
together in the end.

408
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:22,858
Perfect.

409
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:24,779
Thank you!

410
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,835
Nice work, Laura.

411
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:35,352
We love our amazing judges
but there are times we have

412
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:38,282
wondered if Glenn and Neville
are the only two people in the

413
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:41,857
room who have any idea as to
what they are talking about.

414
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:44,891
I'm disappointed in what
you have done this week.

415
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:48,841
You have this indiscriminately
applied makeup.

416
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,372
It's calamitous.

417
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,939
It's ecorche-ish.

418
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:57,063
The bald cap gives you a primary,
secondary and tertiary level.

419
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:00,364
So cromagnan-like in a way.

420
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,649
The external mastoids
are discordant.

421
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:08,470
It's a dissertation of love
that was quite palpable.

422
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:14,045
♪

423
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:16,019
- What?
- *

424
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,050
The iconography.

425
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:20,087
There is no connection.

426
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:21,773
The anti-diluvian technology.

427
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:23,847
- What?
- The anti-diluvian technology.

429

Sexual dimorphism, etcetera.

430
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:45,929
It's very efficacious,
subcutaneous and scintillating.

431
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,341
Seafaring ambivalence.

432
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,609
I'm glad you talk and not me.

433
00:21:00,621 --> 00:21:01,322
Wow.

434
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,898
Big words.

435
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:06,169
I'm glad I'm not the only
one that doesn't know.

436
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:07,550
Ve doesn't know either.

437
00:21:07,718 --> 00:21:08,541
Thank God.

438
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:11,985
Up next, we'll show you
hilarious behind-the-scenes

439
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,088
footage plus how Derek and Nicole
earned their spots in the

440
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,186
final three.

441
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,178
This is the live season finale
of Face Off.

442
00:21:31,734 --> 00:21:36,025
Welcome back to the first ever
live season finale of "Face Off."

443
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:39,359
We are well on our way towards
crowning a new "Face Off"

444
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:40,568
champion.

445
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:44,485
Now syfy.com recently held a
transformation of the week

446
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:48,668
contest for our viewers to submit
their own makeup creations.

447
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,319
We have the winner right here in
our audience tonight-- Brittany

448
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,660
Mitchell.

449
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,193
Brittany, congratulations
on your winning design!

450
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:03,672
Really nice work.

451
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:07,515
Let's get back to some
of the questions here.

452
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:10,919
Derek, here's another question
from one of our viewers at home.

453
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:13,937
This is from
McKenzie, nice name.

454
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:17,954
Did you or your brother start
special effects first, and why?

455
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:21,678
We definitely started at
the same time, I think.

456
00:22:21,805 --> 00:22:25,421
Just growing up, definitely my
dad influenced us with his

457
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:30,278
stories of makeup that he's
done-- well, costumes he made

458
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,947
growing up and all that.

459
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:36,446
Just him painting us as
zombies one year, all that.

460
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:37,537
Who's who?

461
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:38,882
I'm on the right.

462
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,004
I think the left.

463
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:42,640
Pretty sure I'm on the right.

464
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:43,844
Yeah.

465
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:46,081
Creepy.

466
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:47,243
I love it.

467
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:48,356
That's so great.

468
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:51,760
Let's look at how you
impressed our judges.

469
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:53,184
Derek.

470
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:53,702
Derek.

471
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:54,850
Are you related?

472
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:55,688
My name's Derek.

473
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:58,518
I'm a tattoo artist but
my passion is makeup.

474
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,510
Me and my brother have never
competed against each other.

475
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:04,604
Whoever gets it,
we'll be proud.

476
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:05,595
I think it will be me.

477
00:23:06,757 --> 00:23:08,959
That's awesome.

478
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:11,152
The winner this
evening is Derek.

479
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,504
Who's leaving us tonight?

480
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:14,810
Eric.

481
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:15,636
I'm going home.

482
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:17,233
The win last night
was bittersweet.

483
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,577
Eric had to go home.

484
00:23:18,704 --> 00:23:19,720
We pushed each other.

485
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:22,738
The mouth on the
left is fantastic.

486
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:27,405
It's slipping.

487
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:28,510
Dang.

488
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:32,890
I want to win this but it's
going to push me to win it for

489
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,022
my brother.

490
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,746
The winner is-- Derek.

491
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:39,266
He's a very good visual artist.

492
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:40,073
I'm feeling great.

493
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,560
My brother would be proud.

494
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,818
This is truly stunning.

495
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:45,643
I could see it in
one of my films.

496
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,097
I want my wife to see this.

497
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,793
Gives me inspiration.

498
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,749
I miss you.

499
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:50,658
I miss you, too.

500
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:52,138
There's only three spots left.

501
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:53,090
I want one.

502
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:55,949
The second person going
to the finale is Derek.

503
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:57,794
Thank you.

504
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:00,841
Week after week he
comes out so strong.

505
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:03,332
I can't believe I
made it this far.

506
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:08,414
You will each get to choose two
former competitors to join your team.

507
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:09,536
My brother.

508
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:10,497
Yeah!

509
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:11,746
My brother could help me win.

510
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:17,048
This is my last chance to impress
the judges and impress America.

511
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:23,264
Beautiful work.

512
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:26,099
Nice work, Derek.

513
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:31,725
All right, so Neville, what do
you feel earned him a spot in

514
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,105
the finale?

515
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:37,547
Derek's ability to conceive
on paper gives him a leg up.

516
00:24:37,663 --> 00:24:43,644
It gives him a road he's created
that he can navigate with great

517
00:24:43,756 --> 00:24:45,722
efficacy to the bitter end.

518
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:48,042
Plus, he's a good designer.

519
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:51,995
You really have the skills to
design because you have a great

520
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,205
sense of form, of color.

521
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,921
And he's under the radar.

522
00:24:57,141 --> 00:25:02,548
You know, he plays it cool and I
think that's one of-- when you

523
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:07,708
combine all that you've gotten out
of boobfish is what you've got.

524
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,460
Thank God we got out of that.

525
00:25:13,168 --> 00:25:13,874
Thank you.

526
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:15,113
I appreciate it.

527
00:25:15,239 --> 00:25:16,815
Nice work, Derek.

528
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:23,516
Even though all these guys worked
long hours and were under

529
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:26,738
a lot of pressure, they still
managed to have a lot of fun

530
00:25:26,994 --> 00:25:28,073
this season.

531
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,970
I think they don't want
you to make any noise.

532
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:32,707
Nothing loud or
anything like that.

533
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:38,731
This must be what's
left of the bunny ear.

534
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:42,016
There is something about
that color I like.

535
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,889
My first think--
my first think?

536
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:57,546
I didn't know that spray
paint melts styrofoam.

537
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:59,169
Yes, it does.

538
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:00,080
Awesome.

539
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:02,686
You were calling it a periscope
and it's a telescope.

540
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:05,337
My apologies.

541
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:06,957
Use a microscope.

542
00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:09,388
Can you help me here or what?

543
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,130
No.

544
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:14,822
Is your hand bleeding again?

545
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:15,896
Is this blood?

546
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:17,604
Why am I always bleeding?

547
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,002
I'm going to slip
and kill myself.

548
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,388
Alana.

549
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:22,569
I curse like a sailor.

550
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,238
Let me stop myself.

551
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,675
I can't fucking curse anymore.

552
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:27,130
Time out.

553
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,688
That doesn't fucking count.

554
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:32,319
I need more booty.

555
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,113
Very shiny chest.

556
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:36,307
Not a big one.

557
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:37,212
That's crappy.

558
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:38,316
My chest?

559
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,404
Plastic boobs.

560
00:26:39,571 --> 00:26:40,432
I'm sorry.

561
00:26:40,543 --> 00:26:41,758
Didn't mean to be fresh.

562
00:26:41,887 --> 00:26:43,295
So much for child friendly.

563
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:45,258
This is a tickle monster.

564
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:47,073
I can't talk about this one.

565
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,328
When you're tickling me.

566
00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:58,610
Huh?

567
00:26:58,728 --> 00:26:59,837
What?

568
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:02,630
Medic.

569
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:16,524
You're a bad influence, Neville.

570
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:18,170
You can see we have
a lot of fun here.

571
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:22,819
Well, we have more exclusive
moments coming your way right

572
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:26,416
after this break, including a
look at the biggest twist in

573
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:27,742
"Face Off" history.

574
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,523
Right here on the live
season finale of "Face Off."

575
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:47,449
Welcome back to the live
season finale of "Face Off."

576
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:51,408
We are getting closer and closer
to crowning our new champion.

577
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:55,418
Now this season featured
our biggest twist ever.

578
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:57,821
It was one that dramatically
changed the course of the whole

579
00:27:57,955 --> 00:27:58,998
competition.

580
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,350
Let's take a look.

581
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,958
This has never happened
in "Face Off" history.

582
00:28:04,276 --> 00:28:07,821
Today's challenge could potentially
change someone's life.

583
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:11,297
There is always some M
Night Shamylan twist here.

584
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:13,592
You guys won't be
competing today.

585
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,652
They will.

586
00:28:16,054 --> 00:28:17,267
Oh, my gosh!

587
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,690
Everyone is back.

588
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:24,657
The winner will rejoin the cast
and earn another chance at

589
00:28:24,775 --> 00:28:26,616
winning our grand prize.

590
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:28,265
Ready for a shot at redemption?

591
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,110
Yes!

592
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:33,375
This would be a tremendous
opportunity for anyone to have a

593
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:34,666
second chance.

594
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,531
I'm not sure how I feel
about that at this point.

595
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:40,728
I'm definitely wanting my
brother to win, come back and

596
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,432
join the competition.

597
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:48,625
The winner is-- Nicole.

598
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,549
Oh, my God!

599
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:53,022
I'm back.

600
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:55,255
Thank you.

601
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:57,876
You get to rejoin the
cast of "Face Off."

602
00:28:57,983 --> 00:28:58,520
Oh, my God.

603
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,166
My mom is going to
be proud of me.

604
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:02,546
Oh, this is insane!

605
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,372
Nicole, you quickly
became a fan favorite.

606
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:18,026
We received many comments, a lot
saying how people were inspired

607
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,842
by your story of how you
deal with fibromyalgia.

608
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:23,998
How was it to cope with that, to
get through the season with that?

609
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,042
It was insane.

610
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:29,702
The amount of people-- in the
beginning I didn't want to bring

611
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:30,444
it up.

612
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:32,760
I didn't want to talk about the
fact that I had fibromyalgia.

613
00:29:32,877 --> 00:29:35,519
I'm really glad that I did.

614
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:38,679
The amount of people that wrote
me messages saying I have

615
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:42,407
inspired them to follow their
dreams and other people with

616
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,472
fibromyalgia and everyone's
just been so great.

617
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,626
You know, I think I have helped
a lot of people put that

618
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,290
strength back into it.

619
00:29:52,454 --> 00:29:55,698
I really get that strength from
my mom because my mom also has

620
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:56,999
fibromyalgia.

621
00:29:57,139 --> 00:30:00,484
Growing up, I never knew there
was anything wrong with her.

622
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:05,158
She lived a normal life and we did
everything the same as anybody.

623
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:08,367
So I definitely get that
from her, from my mama.

624
00:30:08,554 --> 00:30:09,912
Oh.

625
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:15,601
I cope with the pain with focusing
on something I'm passionate about.

626
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,063
Makeup is my passion.

627
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,374
It's my whole life.

628
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:19,502
It's my dream.

629
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:23,566
When I'm doing makeup it takes me
to a whole nother place and I

630
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:27,194
forget about the pain and
do something that I love.

631
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:30,262
Well, you are definitely
an inspiration.

632
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,967
Thank you for
sharing your story.

633
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:39,137
As you know, it takes more than
winning just one challenge to

634
00:30:39,274 --> 00:30:40,710
land a spot in the finale.

635
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,974
Let's see what got you here.

636
00:30:44,114 --> 00:30:44,843
Nicole!

637
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,812
Oh, my gosh.

638
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,247
My love for special effects started
with my love for Halloween.

639
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:52,529
I will be the next "Face Off"

640
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:53,330
champion.

641
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,681
Your time starts now.

642
00:30:55,782 --> 00:30:58,419
Part of the challenge is to put a
piece of myself into the makeup.

643
00:30:58,538 --> 00:31:02,590
I'm making a warrior and he
just rips a dude's heart out.

644
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:07,822
I like the ideas.

645
00:31:07,977 --> 00:31:11,455
But it's the paint work that
really makes it go flat.

646
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,689
The person going home
tonight is Nicole.

647
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:17,497
I don't think I got to
show what I can do yet.

648
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,168
What would I give for
a second chance?

649
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:20,096
Everything.

650
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:21,208
Nicole!

651
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:22,822
Oh, my God.

652
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,492
You get to rejoin the
cast of "Face Off."

653
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,741
I'm so thankful for
making it here.

654
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:28,570
Mom!

655
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:31,732
I said, mom, I'm going
to win for you.

656
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,786
Everything I do here I want
it to be the best work.

657
00:31:34,911 --> 00:31:39,320
In the beginning I was doing stuff
I thought you wanted to see.

658
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,695
Now I'm doing what I
would like to see.

659
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:43,340
The winner is Nicole.

660
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:44,979
Yay!

661
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,326
She's spectacular.

662
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:47,222
It's a different Nicole.

663
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,389
This is awesome.

664
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,547
Nicole.

665
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:53,367
I was eliminated and I
just won my second one.

666
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:56,238
She's fighting back since she
got her second opportunity.

667
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:57,780
She's got the hunger.

668
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:58,965
One more chance.

669
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:00,062
You've got this.

670
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:03,782
I have one last chance to
bring everything I've got.

671
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,988
To win would be the greatest
accomplishment of my life and

672
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:08,848
that's what I will do.

673
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:19,876
Great work, Nicole.

674
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:23,349
So, Patrick, you were the one to
actually bring Nicole back into

675
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:24,807
the competition.

676
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,556
Oh, yeah.

677
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:29,113
What do you feel about her work
earned her a spot in the finale?

678
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:31,603
Yes, this is a great story.

679
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,357
I saw the work of
Nicole early on.

680
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:38,756
I noticed she had a very bold
design sense, great application

681
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:39,922
work as well.

682
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:45,236
When I came back I was
shocked she was eliminated.

683
00:32:45,357 --> 00:32:48,790
Because the job she
did was unbelievable.

684
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,586
Very quick, bold, strong.

685
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:54,369
And since then she's
been amazing.

686
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,797
I think something happened.

687
00:32:55,924 --> 00:32:57,557
I think that switch was made.

688
00:32:57,686 --> 00:33:01,520
She found something deep inside her
that made her so much stronger.

689
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:04,907
Sometimes it's a great opportunity
in life to have this situation.

690
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:07,576
Since then I have
been a big, big fan.

691
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,571
She's certainly never boring.

692
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:12,011
Thank you so much.

693
00:33:12,344 --> 00:33:16,058
Coming up, more never before seen
moments from the show and a

694
00:33:16,189 --> 00:33:18,875
special message from Ve Neill.

695
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:22,302
Plus we'll reveal who you have
chosen as this season's winner

696
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:23,159
of "Face Off."

697
00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:26,473
First an exclusive look at the
shocking season of "Total

698
00:33:26,582 --> 00:33:30,390
Blackout" airing Tuesdays at
10 right here on SyFy.

699
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,716
We'll be rigth back.

700
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,183
Welcome back to the live
season finale of "Face Off."

701
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:46,239
We are just minutes away from
naming our new champion and we

702
00:33:46,348 --> 00:33:49,250
have a sneak peek
at the next season.

703
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,693
But first, Alana.

704
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:52,509
Hey, girl.

705
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,536
Hey, girl.

706
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,265
You definitely were
a fan favorite.

707
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:59,031
And you certainly had
a way with words.

708
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:03,010
Let's take a look at some
of our favorite Alana-isms.

709
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:05,436
The world is more interesting
through my eyes.

710
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:07,267
Alana has a way
of saying things.

711
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:07,899
Hello.

712
00:34:08,017 --> 00:34:08,667
Nice to meet you.

713
00:34:08,774 --> 00:34:10,182
My brain is all over the place.

714
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:10,928
All over the shop.

715
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:14,736
I still coudln't tell you
some of the things Alana says.

716
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,069
Here we go.

717
00:34:19,381 --> 00:34:20,444
Keep my eyes on the prize.

718
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:21,693
I'm shaking like a leaf.

719
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:22,737
Bingeo-bango.

720
00:34:22,867 --> 00:34:28,199
I'm borderline having a
seizure, borderline.

721
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:28,934
I'm sorry.

722
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:30,432
I don't speak other
side of the room.

723
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,803
I'm going to give it a hundred
and thousand ten percent.

724
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:36,383
130,000%.

725
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,129
50/50 teamwork.

726
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:39,221
Sell me out.

727
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,334
Let's go.

728
00:34:40,443 --> 00:34:45,498
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, hioyo,
here we go, Face Off, the best.

729
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,634
Come on.

730
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:47,431
Cut it out.

731
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:48,554
You'll forgive me.

732
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,672
Alana, where do you come
up with this stuff?

733
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:59,026
I guess I have been blessed
with a beautiful mind.

734
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:03,132
All right.

735
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:06,491
Well, let's talk about some of
our other memorable moments.

736
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,676
We were very lucky to have
some of the biggest names in

737
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:12,379
Hollywood join us as our
guest judge of the season.

738
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:13,757
Let's take a look.

739
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,791
I want to introduce you
to your guest judge.

740
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:21,771
Leila Ali, Kevin
Smith, Brian Grazer.

741
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:27,303
I'm ready to judge
and eliminate.

742
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,470
I looked at his crotch.

743
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,925
That's the last thing
I want to look at.

744
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:31,356
Eric, Derek.

745
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:32,292
Nice to see you.

746
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:32,968
Welcome.

747
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:35,313
It's Sean Astin.

748
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:36,660
How long have you
guys been brothers?

749
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:40,820
Wow.

750
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:42,248
Brian freaking Grazier.

751
00:35:42,404 --> 00:35:44,894
You're cute, he's cute.

752
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:47,579
This is probably the biggest person
we've ever had on the Face Off history.

753
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:48,637
Speaking of God.

754
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,707
You need to phone
home, my friend.

755
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,034
I love Kevin Smith.

756
00:35:57,292 --> 00:36:00,319
I feel like I'm on the
deck of a star destroyer.

757
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,680
I'm sorry.

758
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:04,196
Are we not allowed to talk?

759
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:05,155
This is weird.

760
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:06,537
Shh!
What are you doing?

761
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:11,334
It's awesome having
producers, judges, guests.

762
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:12,110
The hamster wheel.

763
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,537
I love that hyper sexualized
monstrosity of it all.

764
00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:20,444
That's who hires us.

765
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:21,450
I love the hair.

766
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,465
As you can see, I'm
interested in hair.

767
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,180
So was I.

768
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:29,940
To have them give insight on our
makeups is an opportunity for us.

769
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:30,672
See you Monday.

770
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:31,633
Bring doughnuts.

771
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:32,314
Jelly?

772
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:33,480
Look at me.

773
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,934
Of course jelly.

774
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:46,161
We did have great guest judges,
but we are lucky enough

775
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:49,265
to have our own industry
titans right here.

776
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:52,397
The fans are asking what you
gentlemen are up to now.

777
00:36:52,555 --> 00:36:53,887
Glenn, let's start with you.

778
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:57,097
Building and designing the
effects for CSI New York,

779
00:36:57,226 --> 00:37:00,885
"Hunger Games 2" with Ve and
another project called

780
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:06,082
Necroscope which is a series
of books with Brian Lumley.

781
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:08,938
Very cool.
Patrick? What about you?

782
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:10,700
Just finished the new "300"

783
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:15,304
movie, designing a new beast
for "Beauty & The Beast," the

784
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:20,983
European production and casting for
my next job starting next year.

785
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,573
Very cool.
Neville?

786
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:27,078
Finished working with JJ Abrams on the
most recent "Star Trek."

787
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:33,415
Been working with the creator of
"Spartacus" on his new piece of

788
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:37,985
science fiction and have been
working with Brian Grazer in

789
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,397
blacklight and a lot
of development.

790
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:46,319
The last thing that's kind of
interesting is I'm developing a

791
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:50,659
creature design book that's being
published by Design Studio Press.

792
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:51,806
Amazing.

793
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:53,630
Great to hear what
you guys are up to.

794
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:57,199
We haven't crowned the winner
for the season yet and we are

795
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,432
already talking about the
next season of "Face Off."

796
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:00,046
That's right.

797
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,137
It's already in the works.

798
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:05,174
Premiering in January it will
feature the biggest, most

799
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:06,831
extreme challenges yet.

800
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,856
Here is an exclusive
sneak peek.

801
00:38:19,794 --> 00:38:23,634
This January, the
search begins again.

802
00:38:24,288 --> 00:38:27,538
Face Off is back for our
biggest season ever.

803
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:35,948
14 talented makeup artists will
take the ult mall plunge in a

804
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,356
competition unlike any other.

805
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:39,948
That's just crazy.

806
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:42,171
They will face
breathtaking challenges.

807
00:38:42,284 --> 00:38:42,976
Wow!

808
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:44,877
That's freaking cold!

809
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:46,346
Unbelievable deadlines.

810
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,711
Two minutes!

811
00:38:49,044 --> 00:38:50,083
I can't do this.

812
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:50,957
Take it off.

813
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:51,886
Just take it off.

814
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:52,548
I'm sorry.

815
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:53,916
It's a disaster.

816
00:38:54,019 --> 00:38:56,334
And the most extreme
competition in "Face Off"

817
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:57,376
history.

818
00:38:57,496 --> 00:38:59,256
I'm really blown away.

819
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:03,386
Along the way they will come face
to face with industry titans.

820
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:05,244
You guys really pulled it off.

821
00:39:05,352 --> 00:39:06,989
Great silhouette, great
first impression.

822
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:09,852
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic?

823
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:14,051
Find out in the all new
season of "Face Off."

824
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:26,805
I can't believe we already
got through another season.

825
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,784
When we get back, the moment
we have all been waiting for.

826
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,819
We'll reveal our new champion on
the live season finale of "Face

827
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:36,526
Off."

828
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:54,205
Welcome back to our live
finale where we are about to

829
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:55,818
announce the new "Face Off"

830
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:56,916
champion.

831
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:59,061
I have the results right here.

832
00:39:59,192 --> 00:40:01,629
But first I mentioned earlier
that Ve wasn't able to be here

833
00:40:01,736 --> 00:40:04,634
tonight because she's on set for
"The Hunger Games" sequel,

834
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:05,788
"Catching Fire."

835
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:08,233
She sent a special message.

836
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:10,884
Hi, guys.

837
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:13,584
I'm sorry I can't be here, but
I'm so excited to see who

838
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:15,576
America has chosen
as our winner.

839
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:21,521
Laura, Nicole, Derek. You have done an
amazing job this season and may the odds be

840
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:23,050
ever in your favor.

841
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,404
With that, it's time to find out
who America has chosen

842
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:35,984
as the Face Off champion.

843
00:40:37,179 --> 00:40:39,948
Laura, Derek, Nicole.

844
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,576
Please, step forward.

845
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,976
Last night America saw
each of you create an

846
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,605
incredible witch and
damon character.

847
00:40:57,606 --> 00:41:01,771
And then watched as they battled
out in a spectacular stunt routine.

848
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:10,697
Laura, you have consistenly
impressed the judged with your

849
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:13,694
sculpts and impecable detail work.

850
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:22,794
Derek, your vision for design
helped you create some

851
00:41:22,795 --> 00:41:27,252
outstanding characters and elevated
you all the way to the top three.

852
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:35,523
Nicole, you struggled early on
the competition,

853
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:40,968
But fought your way back with a clear
focus and relentless determination.

854
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:48,482
All right, America has voted
and I have the results right here.

855
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:53,402
The winner of Face Off is...

856
00:42:17,637 --> 00:42:19,051
Nicole!

857
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:35,706
Nicole!

858
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:39,079
It's real!

859
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,635
How does it feel?

860
00:42:43,636 --> 00:42:45,311
Say hello to your family.

861
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:50,020
Congratulations.
Thank you everyone for

862
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:52,610
watching the live season
finale of Face Off.

863
00:42:57,894 --> 00:43:01,760
Happy Halloween!
