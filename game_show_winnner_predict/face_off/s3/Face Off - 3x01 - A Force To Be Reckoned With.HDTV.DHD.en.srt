00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:02,066
Welcome to the search

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,385
for the next great name
in movie magic.

3
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:06,573
<i>Face Off</i> is back.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,424
12 talented makeup artists
will battle it out

5
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:13,727
in our most explosive
season yet.

6
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:17,297
My heart is pounding out
of my chest.

7
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:18,515
- Oh... no.
- Don't panic.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,167
Are you kidding me?

9
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:23,303
Along the way, they'll face
mind-blowing challenges.

10
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,239
<i>Star Wars.</i>

11
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:27,941
The imaginative characters
of Dr. Seuss.

12
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,677
So many of the mistakes
are completely indefensible.

13
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:33,347
This week,
we are switching things up.

14
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:35,682
That's just too nasty.

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,051
You'll be incorporating items
from this junkyard

16
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,587
into a cyborg character.

17
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:43,190
The finish is stunning.
The design's very exquisite.

18
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,793
There will be
heart-stopping surprises.

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,028
Today's challenge could change
someone's life.

20
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:49,363
This is it.

21
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:51,081
And some of the biggest names
in the industry.

22
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,282
This is phenomenal.

23
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,535
You've done
a truly remarkable job.

24
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:56,102
He's a wonderful creation.

25
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,205
But to come out on top,
they'll have to impress

26
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:00,674
our award-winning
panel of judges.

27
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,477

and critically acclaimed
<i>Mad Men.</i>

34
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:19,927
It's so well done
it blows my mind.

35
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,495
Patrick Tatopoulos,

36
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:23,230

to be a guest lecturer
at Makeup For Ever's academies

46
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:48,355
in New York and Paris...

47
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:49,590
I want this so bad.

48
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:52,576
A new 2012 Toyota Prius V...

49
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,827
I came here to fight
and compete.

50
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:54,995
Damn it, I'm gonna compete.

51
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,297
And $100,000.

52
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:58,932
I'm gonna be the next
<i>Face Off</i> champion.

53
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:01,235

America,

57
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:52,803
My name is Tommy, and I just
quit my full-time chef job

58
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,187
back in Columbus, Ohio

59
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:56,957
to become a full-time
special effects artist.

60
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,875
I just got off the plane,
I'm in L.A.

61
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,361
I know that I'm invited
to this exclusive party

62
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:03,096
where I'm supposed to meet
the rest of the contestants.

63
00:03:03,164 --> 00:03:05,832
And there are some mystery
celebrity party hosts.

64
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,150
I just can't wait
to see who it is.

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,155
My name is Alana,
and I graduated

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,142
from the Tom Savini
makeup effects program.

67
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:16,843
I recently moved
from New York to L.A.

68
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:21,198
With my boyfriend, Ian
who was a finalist on season 2.

69
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:29,806
I finally get to where
this VIP party's supposed to be.

70
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,361
I walk out onto the roof...

71
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,730
and there's this beautiful party
overlooking Los Angeles.

72
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,732
There's pool,
there's a hot tub,

73
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,084
there's gorgeous women
everywhere.

74
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,986
There's a full bar
and then all of a sudden...

75
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:45,072
Awesome!
Hi!

76
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:46,573
It's Sean Astin.

77
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,659
Oh, my God, I was just watching
you like not two days ago.

78
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:49,776
- Really?
- Yeah!

79
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:51,044
He's the party host.

80
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:52,613
He was Samwise
in <i>Lord Of The Rings,</i>

81
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,648
he was <i>Rudy,</i>
and he was in <i>The Goonies.</i>

82
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:56,266
I don't think
I could have asked for

83
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,501
a better celebrity to greet me.

84
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,802
Fired up?

85
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,355
Yeah, dude, I'm ready to go,
this is awesome.

86
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:03,557
I'm Rod,
I'm a digital effects artist.

87
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:06,026
I've loved special effects
ever since I was a kid.

88
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,862
My passion is creating
characters.

89
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,449
I wrote a film where I play
26 different people.

90
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,867
- There's Rod.
- Yes.

91
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:15,202
- Sean Astin.
- Oh, hey.

92
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,687
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:18,372
- I'm your host for the day.
- That's great.

94
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,474
So get a drink,
make yourself comfortable.

95
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:23,727
- Alana.
- Hey, how are you?

96
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:25,745
Oh, my gosh, it's Sean Astin.

97
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:28,181
I had the biggest crush on him
when I was a little girl.

98
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:30,967
I'm totally overwhelmed
by all of this.

99
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,303
I am surrounded by only
beautiful people.

100
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:35,722
And the view is unbelievable.

101
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:39,159
- Eric, Derek.
- What's going on?

102
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,577
How are you?
Sean Astin.

103
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:41,745
- Wow. How you doing?
- It's nice to see you, welcome.

104
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:43,196
- I'm Derek.
- I'm Eric.

105
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:45,365
And we are fraternal twins.

106
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,334
I'm more of a sci-fi
effects artist.

107
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:50,120
I like to do creatures
and design aliens.

108
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:52,439
I just wanna make
that next big creature

109
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:54,191
that you see in an alien film.

110
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:55,492
- Eric?
- Yes.

111
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,277
And Derek.

112
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:58,178
I'm Derek, I'm a tattoo artist.

113
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:00,380
But my passion is makeup.

114
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:03,216
I'm into creepy horror-type
characters.

115
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:04,217
- Hey.
- Hey, there.

116
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,535
I'm Sean.

117
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,687
Pleasure to see you,
how are you?

118
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:08,038
You know,
I'm about ready to cry.

119
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:09,272
- This is so cool.
- Uh, don't cry.

120
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:10,807
No crying, it's all right.
It's all right.

121
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:13,110
My name is Joe and I am
a writer, producer, director,

122
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:15,028
and a special effects artist.

123
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:17,831
I've produced and directed
and created special effects

124
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,400
for 16 micro budget
motion pictures.

125
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:25,572
I'm CC.

126
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,075
I love to do beauty makeup,
weddings,

127
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:30,777
but I can also do gore
and monsters.

128
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:33,313
My second year in college,
I wanted to do makeup.

129
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:36,349
It just was in my heart,
but my dad didn't understand.

130
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,385
Being on the show
is a dream come true.

131
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,471
I feel like I'm gonna be able
to prove something to him.

132
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:43,273
- My name is CC.
- CC? Eric.

133
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:44,624
- Nicole.
- Oh, my God.

134
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:46,626
- Hello.
- How's it going?

135
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:49,096
My name is Nicole and my love
for special effects started

136
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:50,897
with my love of Halloween.

137
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,733
I have fibromyalgia.

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,702
It's a disease that attacks
all your nerve endings,

139
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,904
and it makes your body hurt
all the time.

140
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,456
The only time I don't feel it
is when I'm doing makeup.

141
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,126
Hi, nice to meet you.

142
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:04,928
Hi, there.
Sean Astin.

143
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,613
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,048
Contestants came filtering in
from all over the country.

145
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:09,216
I'm excited.

146
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:11,184
Hey! How are you?

147
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:14,171
We're sipping champagne
and everything is fantastic.

148
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:16,106
Then out of nowhere--

149
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,590
Hey, everybody.

150
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:18,809
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

151
00:06:21,428 --> 00:06:23,663
The stunning, star-quality
McKenzie arrives.

152
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:26,666
Come on and gather around.

153
00:06:26,717 --> 00:06:27,834
I am absolutely blown away.

154
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:30,170
McKenzie is so gorgeous.

155
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:33,840
And she just lights up
the whole rooftop.

156
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:36,209
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

157
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,745
We are in the heart
of Los Angeles

158
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,714
overlooking Hollywood.

159
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:44,100
You are one huge step closer
to achieving your dream

160
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:47,504
of becoming the next big name
in movie magic.

161
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:50,423
Now, Sean here is not just
your party host,

162
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:52,175
he also happens to be the judge

163
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,244
of your first foundation
challenge...

164
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:59,231
Which starts right now.

165
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:04,137
Oh, my God.

166
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:05,989
I can't even stop my heart
from pounding out of my chest

167
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:08,325
'cause now I know
I shouldn't have had

168
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:09,743
those two glasses of champagne,

169
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,277
something's gonna go down.

170
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,965
Now, those are your makeup
stations and kits,

171
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,867
and you've actually already
met your models.

172
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,668
Models, take your places.

173
00:07:22,757 --> 00:07:27,260
Your foundation challenge is to
create an original face makeup

174
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:30,030
that shows us
your artistic sensibility.

175
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:35,502
Your makeup must incorporate at
least one item from this party.

176
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,504
Everything is in play.

177
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:39,940
The winner will receive immunity
and cannot be eliminated

178
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,508
from this week's
spotlight challenge.

179
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,212
I want that immunity because
I would love to just have

180
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:47,647
the freedom in the shop
to experiment

181
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:49,382
without the consequences.

182
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,818
Now, Sean, you have spent
a great deal

183
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:53,553
in and around the world
of special effects makeup.

184
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:55,572
What advice do you have
for these guys?

185
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,023
Be yourselves, relax,

186
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,892
don't be nervous,
and let your passion come out.

187
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:01,061
It's my big-- big advice.

188
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,946
Nicely put.

189
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,565
All right, you've got two hours
to complete your makeups.

190
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,068
Your models and your stations
have been assigned randomly.

191
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:11,972
Good luck because your time
starts now.

192
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,967
Have all these plants and I
have no idea what I wanna do.

193
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:27,003
So I just start going through
the kit and I see a witch nose.

194
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,755
So I'm just gonna try
to maybe do

195
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:31,324
some kind of primitive
witch doctor-type of thing.

196
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,209
I've never done it before.

197
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:36,496
But I'm doing this kind of goofy
really neat-looking treebeard

198
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,266
lord tropicanas--
this God of the tropical land.

199
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:44,671
I'm Sarah and I am currently
working in an office

200
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:48,291
for my day job
but I wanna do makeup full-time.

201
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,443
In my kit, I found this mask.

202
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,413
So for my concept, I decided
to go with a superhero look.

203
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,218
I'm Jason and I got into
special effects when I was 12.

204
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:00,687
I always had of passion
for haunted houses and Halloween

205
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,289
and that's really
what got me going.

206
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:04,257
I found an evil
brow looking piece,

207
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,993
and then, I'm gonna try
to fit plant life into it.

208
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:11,631
My concept is a character
in a slasher film.

209
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,051
She is a cheerleader who is
burned in a hazing incident.

210
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:19,005
I'm using paper napkins
to create this burnt-fresh look

211
00:09:19,073 --> 00:09:20,440
and pretzels
from the hors d'oeuvres bowl

212
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:24,027
to make a full set of teeth.

213
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,913
My name is Roy and I have been
doing special effects makeup

214
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:28,682
for almost 30 years.

215
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:30,700
I've been fortunate enough
in the last two years

216
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:32,485
to get to where this is
all I'm doing all the time.

217
00:09:32,536 --> 00:09:35,188
For this challenge,
I wanna do something different,

218
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,906
so I decided
to make a human bird.

219
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:40,059
I'm thinkin' I can take
a soda bottle and twist it

220
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,312
and make a beak out of it.

221
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:46,366
Part of this challenge is
to put a piece of myself

222
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:47,751
into this makeup.

223
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,136
So what better
than something scary?

224
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:53,089
So I'm making this warrior,
and he's in a battle,

225
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:55,842
and he just rips
a dude's heart out.

226
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,310
You have one hour left.

227
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:04,300
I'm creating
a reptilian-type character.

228
00:10:04,385 --> 00:10:06,686
I'm using lentils to give it
a little bit of texture.

229
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,940
My name is Laura

230
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,660
and I'm a self-taught
special effects makeup artist.

231
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,696
I would love to be
the first woman to win this.

232
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:19,532
I would also like to give some
of the prize money to my mother

233
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,851
so she can be as happy
as she's made me.

234
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:23,770
For this challenge,

235
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:28,491
I'm going to make a jungle cat
with a flower as an accent.

236
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,777
When I saw the bird
of paradise flower,

237
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:32,312
I thought I could
make something with this.

238
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,515
I'm thinkin' some kind of
forest princess creature.

239
00:10:35,566 --> 00:10:38,318
She needs camouflage
'cause it's a colorful forest.

240
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:39,719
Even though I'm so focused
in what I'm doing,

241
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,237
I look over
to my brother Derek's makeup

242
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:42,955
and I'm like,
damn, I'm blown away

243
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:44,357
by how awesome it looks.

244
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:49,913
Fantasy with plants is not
in my comfort zone at all,

245
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:52,482
so I'm taking huge chances.

246
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,635
Going through my kit,
I pull out eye bags.

247
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:58,038
I flip them upside down
and make them into eyebrows.

248
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,640
I'm taking napkins and creating
texture to his face.

249
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:05,795
I think my makeup's starting
to come together.

250
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,113
I'm looking at the leaves
I put on her

251
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:08,865
and I go with the color
scheme of the reds,

252
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:10,366
and then I start highlighting
some yellows

253
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:12,419
to give her a flowery-look.

254
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:18,408
I wanna make my model into
a voodoo-esque twisted man.

255
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:19,959
Knowing the time limit
that I have,

256
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,545
I'm sticking with materials
that I'm used to

257
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,932
so I go for the third-degree
for the scarification detail.

258
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:29,486
I'm also using leaves
to make a neckpiece.

259
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,939
I am not thinking at all
about the competition.

260
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,407
I'm having a blast doing this

261
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,443
because this is right up
my alley, it's my forte.

262
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,944
Close your eyes.

263
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,178
I really know how to gross
people out

264
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,280
and this is coming
along smoothly.

265
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:41,915
Hold your breath.

266
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,583
All right, everybody,
that is five minutes.

267
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,819
It's panic time.

268
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:58,264
That's it, time's up.
Brushes down.

269
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,168
I am so excited to have Sean
look at my work.

270
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:04,837
I definitely want
to impress him.

271
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:06,773
He's been around makeup and he
knows what he's talking about.

272
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:08,941
I was thinking something
like a-- like a tribal warrior.

273
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:11,494
He rips hearts
out of other villagers.

274
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,346
I like the way
you synthesized the character.

275
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,014
This thing-- all of a sudden
informs everything.

276
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,549
Yeah.

277
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,569
I just gathered cool-looking,
bright-colored leaves and stuff.

278
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:21,354
And I thought, "okay, maybe
I can do some kind of witch."

279
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:23,890
I think it looks like
an exotic bird

280
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:25,141
and sabretooth or something.
Yeah.

281
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:27,794
- You did a really good job.
- It's really good work.

282
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,462
- Joe!
- Sean, how are you?

283
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,097
I'm scared, man.
I'm not gonna lie.

284
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:32,549
Hi, Joe.

285
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:36,019
She is a senior cheerleader.
She was burnt.

286
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:37,520
She returns to seek revenge

287
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:38,922
on the cheerleaders
that did this to her.

288
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:41,274
It definitely has an emotional
and evocative feeling.

289
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:42,725
It is creepy and scary.

290
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,878
But there's something
erratic about it.

291
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:47,747
Don't love it.

292
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,283
I'm not surprised.

293
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:51,768
This comes with creating
something truly original.

294
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:56,022
I have encountered this kind
of criticism my entire career.

295
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,907
I just went off from the
colors of the bird of paradise

296
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:59,275
for the makeup.

297
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,677
Most of it's airbrush.

298
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:02,896
The coloring and shading
is pretty amazing.

299
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:06,049
- Thank you.
- I created a voodoo man.

300
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,700
I wanted to incorporate
the pattern

301
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,519
from the plant onto his face.

302
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:11,437
I mean, it's interesting you
chose not to do any prosthetics,

303
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:14,090
so it looks not finished
and the painting,

304
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:16,442
there's something
unnatural about it.

305
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,345
I am disappointed with myself.

306
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:21,080
I've done much better work
than this.

307
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,286
When I see everyone's makeup,
it's anybody's game.

308
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:29,956
I see that I'm surrounded
by crazy talent

309
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:33,493
and I'm getting
very intimidated.

310
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:36,896
All right, Sean.
So how did they do overall?

311
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:38,565
They did great.
They did great.

312
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:40,433
They're all incredibly talented

313
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:41,951
and the work was beautiful
to look at.

314
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:43,102
All right.

315
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,370
Who were your favorites
of the day?

316
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:45,538
It wasn't easy.

317
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,357
One of the top two picks
is Derek.

318
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:49,726
The painting work,
the lines, the shading--

319
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,011
It just really felt
like a character,

320
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:54,380
so congratulations on that.

321
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:58,084
My other top one is Eric.

322
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,119
The craftsmanship and the way
that you did the shading

323
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,121
and getting the lines
so organic and natural

324
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:04,624
and yet be really precise
at the same time.

325
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:07,126
I'm surprised
that out of 12 people,

326
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:09,379
both of us would be
the-- the top two.

327
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:11,097
But whoever wins it, we're
gonna be proud of each other,

328
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:12,298
no matter what.

329
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:13,650
All right, Sean.

330
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,134
Who is the winner
of today's challenge?

331
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,803
The winner
of today's challenge is...

332
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:23,860
Coming up...
Your challenge is based on

333
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:27,880
the most influential
film franchise in the history.

334
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:28,915
Oh, my God.

335
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:31,417
- No, no, no.
- Fuck.

336
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,052
It's singularly unexceptional.

337
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:39,522
All right, Sean.

338
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,041
Who is the winner of
our first foundation challenge?

339
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,927
The winner of today's
challenge is...

340
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:50,132
- Eric.
- Yes.

341
00:14:50,184 --> 00:14:51,701
Wow, that's cool.
Thanks, man.

342
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,108
The silhouette of that
character just kept grabbing me,

343
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,060
so that's why I picked you.
Good job.

344
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:03,646
Having that first win is gonna
give me more confidence to go on

345
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:06,182
to the next challenge where
I can do even more cool work.

346
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:07,683
Eric, congratulations.

347
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:10,252
You have earned immunity
in the first spotlight challenge

348
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:12,271
and cannot be eliminated.

349
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,256
All right, guys,
with that I will let you go

350
00:15:14,308 --> 00:15:16,025
to check out your new house,

351
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:19,529
and I'll see you tomorrow for
your first spotlight challenge.

352
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:21,096
Bye, thank you.

353
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,542
Oh, my God.

354
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:39,799
So we pull up to the house
and we all bolt inside.

355
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:43,069
Running around checking out
all the work from last year.

356
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:44,737
We really couldn't
have expected more.

357
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:46,572
- Claiming, claiming!
- This is it, this is it.

358
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:48,608
I'm jumping up and down
and I look on the wall

359
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:51,844
and there is Rayce's
Tim Burtonesque cello player.

360
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:54,180
I'm like, "ah! Burtonesque
room, Burtonesque room."

361
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:55,398
I'm so excited.

362
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:57,750
We gotta see the outside.

363
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,836
We're on the top of a mountain
and there's a gorgeous view.

364
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:03,723
This house, it's something
that a celebrity would stay in.

365
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,818
Today's the first spotlight
challenge,

366
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,703
and we're walking
around the FOX studio lot.

367
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:23,626
This is where we all wanna be,
we wanna work in films.

368
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,194
Everyone's excited.

369
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:28,197
And then, we turned the corner.

370
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,899
No... no way.

371
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:36,088
There's McKenzie and there's
this giant <i>Star Wars</i> mural.

372
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:39,541
Welcome to the 20th Century
FOX back lot.

373
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:43,663
Your first spotlight challenge
is based on the most influential

374
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:45,348
film franchise in history...

375
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,583
<i>Star Wars.</i>

376
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:50,603
Oh, my God.

377
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,239
I'm old enough that I actually
saw <i>Star Wars</i> in--

378
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:54,957
in it's original
theatrical run.

379
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,760
Since 1977,
<i>Star Wars</i> has expanded

380
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,463
to everything from
action figures to video games.

381
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,115
There's even an animated series,
<i>The Clone Wars.</i>

382
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,285
And that brings us
to today's special guest.

383
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,804
He is a longtime Lucas Film
collaborator,

384
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,873
and he also happens to be
the voice of General Grievous

385
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,825
in <i>Star Wars, The Clone Wars.</i>

386
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:14,910
Please say hello
to Matthew Wood.

387
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:18,047
What's up, bro?

388
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:21,283
As a long-time Lucas Film
collaborator,

389
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:23,318
there are many classic
<i>Star Wars</i> scenes.

390
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,087
What's one of your favorites?

391
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,589
First scene I remember as
a kid when I was five years old

392
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:29,258
was the cantina.

393
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,294
Every little corner is filled
with a different race of alien,

394
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:33,729
so that was my favorite.

395
00:17:33,797 --> 00:17:35,514
And that, my friends,

396
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,951
is the focus of our first
spotlight challenge.

397
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:41,871
You're going to need to create
an alien that would fit

398
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:45,358
in a modern version
of that classic cantina scene.

399
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:48,044
Oh.
I'm geeking out.

400
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,945
I know that cantina scene
inside and out,

401
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:52,081
so this is a dream come true.

402
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:55,117
Now, you'll be working in
randomly selected teams of two.

403
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:58,854
Team one is Alana and Nicole.

404
00:17:58,905 --> 00:17:59,955
Yeah, girl.

405
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:01,223
- Yeah!
- Get it.

406
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,025
Team two is CC and Derek.

407
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:04,627
Cool.

408
00:18:04,694 --> 00:18:07,997
Team three--
Joe and Tommy.

409
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,599
Joe's foundation challenge had
to be nerves and I'm like,

410
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,803
"okay, benefit of the doubt,
we can make this a great team."

411
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,305
Team four--
Roy and Rod.

412
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,590
Oh, cool.

413
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:21,577
Team five is Laura and Sarah.

414
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,946
Team six is Eric and Jason.

415
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:25,414
Awesome.

416
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:27,083
Eric has immunity,
and if something goes wrong,

417
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,567
I'm the one that's gonna go.

418
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:30,453
All right guys,
we have a surprise for you.

419
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,004
Matthew?

420
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:33,956
We're gonna feature
the winning character

421
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:36,625
in this challenge on the
official starwars.com website.

422
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:40,963
Both in its original form
that you've created

423
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,598
and in the style
of <i>The Clone Wars.</i>

424
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,400
Wow.

425
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:46,635
Being on the actual
<i>Star Wars</i> web site--

426
00:18:46,686 --> 00:18:48,671
how many people get
that chance?

427
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:50,005
It just makes me wanna win
this even more.

428
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:52,007
Good luck, and may the force
be with you.

429
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:54,610
- Thank you.
- Bye.

430
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:07,123
Oh.

431
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,391
Oh, my God!
Yes!

432
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:11,777
Walking into the lab
is literally a dream come true.

433
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:16,565
Oh, these are the models.

434
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,602
So, it's time to pick
our lifecasts.

435
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,904
When you pick a lifecast,
you're picking a stone copy

436
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,272
of what your model's
face looks like

437
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:25,991
so you can sculpt on top of it.

438
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,964
I'll get my sketchbook.

439
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:34,717
Okay, so we're gonna
draw out your ideas.

440
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:36,719
I'll draw mine
and we'll compare them.

441
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:38,287
We need to get our concept
and our design down

442
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:39,572
before we start sculpting.

443
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:43,192
As we're talking,

444
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,526
we realize that we have
basically the same idea.

445
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:51,934
Roy's describing
his exoskeleton,

446
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:54,203
I'm describing my little guy.

447
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:56,005
And they fit
perfectly together.

448
00:19:59,826 --> 00:20:01,777
I can't believe
we got <i>Star Wars.</i>

449
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:04,313
We find out we're both
<i>Star Wars</i> fans.

450
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:07,483
It is exciting to work
with someone who is a geek too.

451
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,151
I want something
to read female too.

452
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:10,753
- Yeah.
- You know?

453
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:13,689
We decide to make her
this bad-ass femme fatale

454
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:14,957
bounty hunter.

455
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:16,425
- I like this idea.
- Perfect, let's do it.

456
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,993
I really wanted to do a woman.

457
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:19,778
I start to bounce
my ideas off Joe.

458
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,230
Two nostrils
and just simple teeth.

459
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,731
She's a-- she's a tough girl.

460
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:25,201
If a turtle's shell
was actually made of flesh.

461
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,935
But it's was really hard
to get my thoughts across.

462
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:28,537
I was thinking of this.

463
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,556
It's important to do something
that's truly original.

464
00:20:33,176 --> 00:20:35,728
He wants to put the eyes up
here and make the nostrils

465
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:36,862
where she can see out of...

466
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,432
So our character ends up
being a female bodyguard.

467
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,325
Our character, we're gonna do
actually like a jazzy-type alien

468
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:52,728
so I felt like this character's
gonna be how jazz is,

469
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:55,548
just very laid back.

470
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:57,666
Our design is a bounty hunter.

471
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,636
So Jason and I want him to look
like a mercenary martial arts

472
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:02,037
assassin-type of character.

473
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:07,042
The next step
in making a prosthetic

474
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,712
is sculpting clay on the cast
of a model's face

475
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,513
which will be used to make
the prosthetic.

476
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:13,215
- You want me to try it out?
- Yeah, man.

477
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,717
Do what you do.

478
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:16,886
Nicole and I, we're totally
vibing off one another.

479
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:19,555
We're thinking
super pointy shoulders,

480
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:21,273
super high cheek bones.

481
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:24,660
She is going to be the party
girl of the cantina scene.

482
00:21:24,711 --> 00:21:26,528
She's gonna be a waitress
to collect those tips

483
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,830
so she can get on
to the next party.

484
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,404
I start right in
on sculpting the face

485
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:39,207
and the little fat body that's
gonna be in the exoskeleton.

486
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:43,395
And Roy,
the master of fabrication,

487
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,667
starts building
the entire exoskeleton.

488
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:50,319
I think, it should be,
you know,

489
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,704
dark to light in the middle,
you know,

490
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:52,938
where the pupil's gonna be.

491
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:54,940
I think our character
is actually gonna

492
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:56,558
pop out of the scene
a little bit more

493
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,861
just because of the color
choices that we wanna go with.

494
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:02,431
I don't want the character
to get lost in the background.

495
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:03,799
I start sculpting out the face.

496
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:07,303
I'm in the zone and I have
a constant distraction.

497
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:10,005
I told you that this was not
supposed to be a nose.

498
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:13,842
It's supposed to be cut off
altogether.

499
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,511
I'm being treated like
I've never done this before.

500
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,479
I am miserable.
I can't create.

501
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,881
I feel blocked.

502
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:20,099
No, no, no.

503
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:22,167
Dude, separate the teardrops.

504
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:24,903
It's very hard for me to focus
and this is the first challenge

505
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:26,889
and I don't want
to screw it up.

506
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,890
Fuck it.

507
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,704
It's phenomenal to do
this Star Wars challenge.

508
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,600
Star Wars is such
a classic movie.

509
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,831
It's hard to believe that
anyone has not seen it.

510
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:42,485
I personally... um...
embarrassingly enough,

511
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:44,742
I've never watched
the Star Wars movie.

512
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,634
I should know these characters.
I should know it's in this movie.

513
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:49,317
I'm not a big Star Wars fan.

514
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,793
I've seen parts of the movie,
I just haven't watched it.

515
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:57,759
I don't know how it's gonna work for
those folks that haven't ever seen Sta--

516
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:06,617
- So push it down
and bring it in.

517
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,417
I am miserable
working with Joe.

518
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,585
I can't create.
I feel blocked.

519
00:23:10,653 --> 00:23:13,288
I told you that this
was not supposed to be a nose.

520
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:15,123
So cut it off altogether.

521
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:16,741
Fuck it.

522
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:20,345
Look at that!

523
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,546
It's cool.

524
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,234
I just feel like
we should do something else.

525
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:27,819
After looking around the room,

526
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:30,105
I think Alana and I need
to add something to our design

527
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:32,040
to just really
kick it up a notch.

528
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:33,592
So I'm making a cowl,

529
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,727
which is a prosthetic
for the back of the head.

530
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:37,062
Neither one of you
have done a cowl,

531
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:38,230
but we're like, you know what?

532
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:41,433
We're gonna do it, yeah.

533
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:43,135
So it's the end
of the first day,

534
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:44,686
the hands are pretty much done.

535
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:46,521
So for tomorrow, Eric and I were
hoping to get all our pieces

536
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:47,722
molded and ready
to run the foam.

537
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:57,031
That flair needs to come out
further than this one.

538
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:01,136
Neither one of us have done
anything this difficult before.

539
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:03,472
We have the least experience
out of anyone who's around us,

540
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,957
and that makes me nervous.

541
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:07,042
All right, guys, time's up.

542
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:08,076
Wrap it up, we gotta go.

543
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:25,460
So it's day two in the lab
and we have ten hours today

544
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,362
and there is a lot to get done.

545
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,634
I like that.

546
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:34,536
The face is sculpted,
it's ready for molding.

547
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:38,240
This is the process where you
make an outside shell

548
00:24:38,307 --> 00:24:40,041
of the sculpture.

549
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:43,211
You open it up,
you put the foam latex, bake it,

550
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,613
and when you're done,

551
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,548
you have a foam latex appliance
that fits perfectly

552
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,601
on the actor in the shape
of the new face.

553
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:57,726
I finished the face piece
pretty quickly

554
00:24:57,793 --> 00:24:59,060
but CC's taking
a little longer than I thought.

555
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:01,696
I'll help you with this
so it goes a lot faster.

556
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:06,935
Hey, everybody.

557
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:09,270
I'm here with your series
judge Patrick Tatopoulos.

558
00:25:09,322 --> 00:25:10,422
Hi.

559
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,923
Ah! Okay. Oh, my God.

560
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:13,158
Patrick's here.
Oh, my God.

561
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:14,910
Okay, so tell us
about your concept.

562
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:18,430
I wanted to work with the
alien's body, making it smaller.

563
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:21,666
But in something big just to
change the shape of the human.

564
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,401
- You have any designs?
- Yeah.

565
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:26,004
Whoa!

566
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:27,505
Yup.

567
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,492
That's pretty ambitious,
that's fantastic.

568
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:33,128
Sleazy, dirty person,
just nasty looking.

569
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:35,313
It's really
a very interesting design.

570
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:38,500
In the scene, we wanted to go
more of the music aspect,

571
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:40,702
so he's actually gonna be
like a jazz player.

572
00:25:40,753 --> 00:25:43,238
Any kind of craziness
on the coloring?

573
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:44,573
Normally,
when you think of jazz,

574
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:45,974
it's very sensual.

575
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:47,559
So we wanna actually bring that
through with the color.

576
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:49,261
Great stuff, I love the design.

577
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:51,012
I look at some of
the shapes you have.

578
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:53,515
They are very kind of wobbly
which is cool, I love that.

579
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:55,083
Yeah, I'm just worried
about this head like being able

580
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:56,384
to dig out the mold in here.

581
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:59,588
Our sculpture has
a lot of undercuts

582
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:02,574
and the casting material
getting stuck

583
00:26:02,658 --> 00:26:04,276
and locking into the mold

584
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,845
is very high-risk
with our design.

585
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:08,329
Good luck, it's gonna be
an interesting one.

586
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:09,631
Yeah.

587
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,334
We want to do
a bounty hunter or assassin--

588
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,019
kind of more martial arts.

589
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:15,186
What's the texture of it?

590
00:26:15,271 --> 00:26:16,904
Some metallics and iridescence.

591
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:19,357
Great.
It's very interesting, this

592
00:26:19,442 --> 00:26:22,294
is this like a reptilian,
hard shell kind of thing?

593
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:23,728
She is almost amphibian

594
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:25,880
and that's why we we're
gonna put a mask on her

595
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,265
and maybe have her
reveal it later.

596
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,217
This is a very nice design.

597
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:30,635
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh.

598
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,970
Color-wise, you already have
some sort of an idea

599
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:33,471
where you wanna go?

600
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:36,925
I would like to go
very sun-dried and dark

601
00:26:36,976 --> 00:26:39,344
like the planet that she's on.

602
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:41,212
Joe's painting it,
and I'm not fighting him.

603
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:42,580
It's either his way
or the highway,

604
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,633
so let's try to get
through this.

605
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:46,117
How are you guys working
together?

606
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:47,669
We wouldn't fight if we
weren't passionate about it so.

607
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,703
- I can see that.
- Thank you.

608
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,672
Good luck, thank you.

609
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:54,376
Okay, so let's start
with Roy and Rod.

610
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:56,077
What do you think
about their concept?

611
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:57,362
- I'm very impressed with them.
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:26:57,446 --> 00:26:59,080
It's super ambitious.

613
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:00,715
If they pull it off,
I think it's amazing.

614
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:02,684
Let's move on to CC and Derek.

615
00:27:02,752 --> 00:27:05,420
They have the jazz player,
the saxophonist.

616
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:07,155
I think the sculpting
is amazing.

617
00:27:07,206 --> 00:27:08,239
The concept is, again,
very good.

618
00:27:08,324 --> 00:27:09,441
Mm-hmm.

619
00:27:09,525 --> 00:27:11,076
It's very, very tight
sculpting-wise.

620
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,593
Okay, Alana and Nicole.

621
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:14,095
You seemed to be
a little worried.

622
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:15,930
Oh, yeah, for the approach
on the back of the head...

623
00:27:15,998 --> 00:27:17,398
Right.

624
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,933
And trying to create
an incredibly complex mold

625
00:27:19,001 --> 00:27:22,387
when there was options for them
to go via fabrication.

626
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:24,005
Okay, and then we have
Joe and Tommy.

627
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:26,508
Some of the conceptual ideas
are very strong.

628
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:29,210
It's very important that people
come up with ideas

629
00:27:29,261 --> 00:27:31,062
we haven't seen before--
very, very important.

630
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:32,814
- We'll see tomorrow.
- Sounds good.

631
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:34,315
- Thank you.
- All right.

632
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,616
All right, everybody.

633
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:37,952
Thank you very much
and good luck.

634
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,192
We gotta mold.

635
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:45,660
It's-- it's not--
We don't have any time

636
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:47,295
to play around with it.

637
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:51,099
Molding a cowl, a face,
two hands, two arms--

638
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,685
That's a pretty daunting task
in the time allotted.

639
00:27:56,138 --> 00:27:58,239
Yes.

640
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:06,314
Perfect.

641
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:09,016
About halfway through the day,
Roy finished the head mold.

642
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:11,469
And I'm having to work
on this mechanical suit.

643
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:13,287
- You had it on?
- Yeah, yeah.

644
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:14,773
Show it to me real quick.

645
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:18,076
I see Roy doing an excellent
job building this piece of art.

646
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,528
To me, it's so unbelievable
that he can build that

647
00:28:20,596 --> 00:28:24,282
in such a short amount of time.

648
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:26,267
I seem to work better
under pressure

649
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:27,669
than I do whenever I have
a lot of time,

650
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:28,620
'cause then I tend to waste it.

651
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,057
Excellent.

652
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:35,110
On the armor, I'm thinkin'
instead of doing like two

653
00:28:35,177 --> 00:28:36,478
like mechanical arms,

654
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:37,729
I wanna do one
for like a weapon

655
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:40,482
so it has-- actually has
a little bit of motion.

656
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:43,768
This is either gonna be--
just blow people's minds

657
00:28:43,853 --> 00:28:45,420
or it's gonna really suck.

658
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,976
It's getting down
to the deadline

659
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,278
where we need to get our molds
done and cleaned.

660
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,897
Joe was working on the cowl.

661
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:57,899
And I have to mold my hands.

662
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,250
We got to get them out,
we gotta get them cleaned,

663
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:00,585
we gotta go.

664
00:29:06,325 --> 00:29:09,344
Unfortunately for me,
Joe is constantly needing help.

665
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:11,513
Will you do me a favor
and stop and clean this one out?

666
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,765
So I have to keep stopping
and going over

667
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:15,066
to help him finish his work.

668
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,202
- Tommy?
- Yup, coming.

669
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:19,654
You wanna grab
that side right here?

670
00:29:19,705 --> 00:29:21,005
It's out, it's out.

671
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,791
If I have this mold cleaned out

672
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:24,092
by the time you're done there,

673
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:28,049
I'm gonna be pissed as hell.
I'm gonna be so pissed at you.

674
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:30,765
I don't see this make up coming out
as we envisioned it.

675
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,133
I had to stop, dude.

676
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:33,535
I didn't get a chance
to start cleaning these.

677
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:34,902
Don't blame me for those hands
is all I'm saying.

678
00:29:34,954 --> 00:29:36,237
It sounds like you're
getting ready to.

679
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:39,157
- I'm not blaming anybody, Joe.
- Yeah, you are.

680
00:29:39,241 --> 00:29:40,975
Tommy doesn't appreciate
the amount of work

681
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:43,311
that is involved in creating
a complete character

682
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:45,063
and this is
a big struggle for me.

683
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:48,016
You're saying that you had
to stop and help me.

684
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,534
That's why your
hands aren't done, right?

685
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:51,018
Multiple times.

686
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,238
I'm trying my best
to just hold it together

687
00:29:53,322 --> 00:29:55,990
and get this project done,
but I'm just beat.

688
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,842
Now, if you'd just stop
running your fucking mouth

689
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,460
and help me half the time,
we'd be all right.

690
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:01,196
Instead, you just got to make
little smart-ass comments

691
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:02,664
on how you've been doing it
for 20 years.

692
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:04,232
- What, what, what, what?
- Life's too short, guys.

693
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:06,034
It is impossible
to save this team.

694
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:07,285
Bye.

695
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:13,725
Now, if you just stop
running your fucking mouth

696
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:16,310
and help me half the time,
we'd be all right.

697
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:17,795
Instead you just got to make
little smart-ass comments

698
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:19,614
on how you've been doing it
for 20 years.

699
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:21,282
It's our second day
in the studio,

700
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:24,802
and I'm already dealing
with this level of drama,

701
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,287
and I snap at him.
Get the fuck out of my face.

702
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:28,222
- No, I'm not going to.
- Life's too short, guys.

703
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:30,141
Bye.

704
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:33,711
I'm very upset at this point.

705
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:35,913
I think that the only way
for us to accomplish anything

706
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:37,365
is just to work separately.

707
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,004
Watch your back.

708
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:44,422
We have a lot of work

709
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,691
and it's gonna be
a really big time crunch.

710
00:30:47,743 --> 00:30:52,363
I have never ever done
anything close to this.

711
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:54,215
I'm trying to mold this cowl
as fast as I can,

712
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:55,466
and it's gigantic.

713
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,051
There's tons of clay
on this thing.

714
00:30:57,136 --> 00:30:59,404
I'm worried about it locking.

715
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,105
Oh, my God, it hope it works.

716
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:06,894
So is there anything else
I can help you?

717
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:09,981
I need help getting
these slips casts on.

718
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:12,133
At this point, I feel sorry
for Tommy a little bit

719
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:13,451
because I know he's trying

720
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:14,485
and he wants to get out
a good piece,

721
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:16,120
but Joe keeps going off on him.

722
00:31:16,171 --> 00:31:17,839
No, seriously, are you gonna
feather these edges?

723
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:19,424
You're like completely--

724
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,426
completely acting
irrational right now.

725
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:22,627
If you're not feathering
these edges,

726
00:31:22,694 --> 00:31:24,529
this is not gonna work.

727
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,830
Oh, my God.

728
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:28,166
Together, Tommy and Joe are
a train wreck

729
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:29,567
waiting to hit a car.

730
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:31,102
This is really thick,

731
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,905
I probably wouldn't have
gone this thick but okay.

732
00:31:33,972 --> 00:31:36,474
I would have done
just like one layer thick

733
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:39,177
and then the other-- okay.

734
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,764
I hope it's not too Jedi.

735
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,365
We're doing
a <i>Star Wars</i> challenge,

736
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:49,120
and we are making a character
for the iconic cantina scene.

737
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:50,471
The pressure is incredibly on.

738
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:52,140
Just thinking about fabricating

739
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,175
this backpack respirator.

740
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:55,726
Yeah, go for it.

741
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:58,863
Our alien is from the Dagobah
System like Yoda.

742
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,315
Which we thought would be
a nice contrast,

743
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,985
because if she's from a moist,
wet planet

744
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:06,437
and she has to change
to a desert planet

745
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:08,573
she would need some sort
of breathing apparatus

746
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,374
in order to survive.

747
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:11,509
And that's our concept
going in.

748
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,344
Not only does it look cool

749
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:15,980
but it's also keeping
her alive.

750
00:32:16,031 --> 00:32:16,948
There.

751
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:24,755
Me and Alana are
in the mold room

752
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,790
and I'm realizing
this is taking way too long.

753
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:30,127
People are coming in and leaving
and we're still there.

754
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,063
- We need to get out of here.
- It's gonna be fine.

755
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,948
I don't have enough time
to get the cowl done.

756
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:35,449
I'm gonna forget
about that right now

757
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:38,336
and I'm just gonna focus on
cleaning out our face mold

758
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:40,037
and getting these arm pieces
ready to go.

759
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,123
Can I help?

760
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:43,774
Dude, we messed up the cowl.

761
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:47,311
Rod sees us struggling,
he sees the panic on my face,

762
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:49,747
and he just comes over
and saves our whole day.

763
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:51,749
- My hands are your hands.
- All right, yeah.

764
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,267
Okay?

765
00:32:53,352 --> 00:32:56,654
I wanna make sure that their
molds are ready for foam latex,

766
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,022
because that would be horrible

767
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,391
if they don't have
their key pieces done.

768
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:02,360
I'm gonna take these over
to the other shop.

769
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:05,029
Rod figured out what we need
to do, when we need to do it,

770
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,131
and how we need to do it.
Careful, careful.

771
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:09,100
I'm in love with him
at this moment.

772
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:12,536
Without Rod we wouldn't have
had our pieces ready in time.

773
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:13,838
There we go.

774
00:33:13,906 --> 00:33:14,772
Oh, beautiful.
Beautiful.

775
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,610
If this mold
doesn't open up right

776
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:21,579
or just falls apart and cracks,
I'm in trouble.

777
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:24,982
Me and my brother,

778
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,184
we've never competed
against each other.

779
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:27,385
We're always working together.

780
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:30,388
It's not coming out.

781
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:31,556
Do you have the strap
on the right way?

782
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:33,124
Oh, I don't know.

783
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:37,128
Eric and I are tight and we
always like to push each other.

784
00:33:37,196 --> 00:33:39,430
It's a little nerve-wracking
opening up a mold.

785
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:42,099
You just don't know
if it's gonna open easy

786
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,786
or break while you're trying
to get it pried open.

787
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:52,543
Luckily we ended up popping it
open pretty easy.

788
00:33:52,611 --> 00:33:54,712
- Alana?
- Yeah, girl.

789
00:33:54,763 --> 00:33:56,080
You wanna start helping me
with this?

790
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:58,766
We finally get our-- our face
and our arms done,

791
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,501
but the clock is still ticking

792
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:03,504
and I'm trying to think about
finishing up the cowl.

793
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:09,159
This cowl is crucial
to our makeup.

794
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:11,495
It completes the overall
look of everything.

795
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:13,431
So I just feel like I should
break it open

796
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,516
and at least see
if it turned out.

797
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,551
- Got it?
- Yeah.

798
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:20,638
Without the cowl,
the headpiece is just a face.

799
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:22,439
And it wouldn't look good.

800
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:24,742
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

801
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,193
This is good.

802
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:28,813
We finished the mold
but we're running out of time.

803
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,997
All right.
Let's do it.

804
00:34:30,082 --> 00:34:31,382
And we just start
cleaning it out.

805
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,301
We're grabbing the clay
out of it any which way we can

806
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:36,137
and Nicole is not ready
to give up on it.

807
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,406
I finally get this thing
cleaned out,

808
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,025
so I have a little bit of time.

809
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:43,327
I find the right latex

810
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,564
and I start painting
my first layer in.

811
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:48,582
All right, guys, that's time!

812
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,384
It doesn't have time to dry.

813
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,686
There's nothing I can do
at this point.

814
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,888
Our prop is not finished.

815
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:56,941
Our cowl is half-assed
and our stations are a mess.

816
00:34:57,009 --> 00:35:00,344
We have a lot of work to do
in five hours tomorrow.

817
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,170
Good to be home.

818
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:10,671
Looks like we spent a day
in the quarry.

819
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:13,290
So how do you feel now?

820
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:14,976
We have a lot of obstacles
tomorrow.

821
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,627
I'm worried about our cowl.

822
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:19,297
I'm having super mixed emotions
about tomorrow.

823
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:20,715
Concentrate on the work.

824
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:23,200
Do your best work
the best you can.

825
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:26,120
I have, at this point, I think
more faith in Alana

826
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,722
than Alana does in herself.

827
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,307
Come here!

828
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:37,648
I could see in Tommy's face
just this ridiculous pain.

829
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:39,116
If it gets down
to like the bottom

830
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,501
and you guys are one of
the bottom groups,

831
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:42,203
what are you
gonna say to the judges?

832
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:43,738
You know, I don't wanna be
one of those guys

833
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:44,789
that throws somebody
under the bus,

834
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,057
but I'm sure not gonna--

835
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:47,625
I'm not gonna go down
without a fight.

836
00:35:57,419 --> 00:35:58,869
So it's application day.

837
00:35:58,937 --> 00:36:02,373
We have four hours to get
everything done in the lab.

838
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:04,275
And then we have one hour
for last looks

839
00:36:04,343 --> 00:36:06,243
and then it's out of our hands
at that point.

840
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,402
Hi.

841
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:17,355
You're gonna be a badass
assassin bounty hunter.

842
00:36:17,406 --> 00:36:20,291
Okay, okay.
Boba Fett watch out.

843
00:36:20,342 --> 00:36:24,061
Its very, very alien flower
inspired.

844
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:25,863
The cowl has to go down first
before the face.

845
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:29,116
So the first thing
that I have to do is run latex.

846
00:36:29,201 --> 00:36:33,554
It dries very quickly--
about 20, 30 minutes.

847
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:36,424
Hello. I'm Joe.
Nice to meet you.

848
00:36:36,508 --> 00:36:37,541
Today,
going into this challenge,

849
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:39,260
I'm telling myself
no matter what,

850
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,379
I am just going to do
what he asks me to do.

851
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:42,630
There is no options
on not using these.

852
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:44,315
Got you.

853
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:49,353
Oh! Awesome!

854
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:51,889
There's a lot to get done
in four hours.

855
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,425
Rod's gonna spend his time
applying the makeup.

856
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:56,694
So while he's doing that
I'm making our polyfoam body.

857
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:58,362
I need to see
where I place the body.

858
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,815
If I just put it on there and
it's not in the right position,

859
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:02,216
there's gonna be a big gap

860
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,168
between
the appliance and the body.

861
00:37:04,219 --> 00:37:06,170
Base of your neck.
There.

862
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:07,521
So right around the bottom
of these right here

863
00:37:07,606 --> 00:37:09,139
is where this here needs go.

864
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:10,708
He looks like a tubby bastard.

865
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:17,047
Seriously, girl,
we're not gonna have any edges.

866
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,382
We still need to finalize
our costume,

867
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,151
we still need to get
everything glued down

868
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:24,255
but the main thing
we want do is color.

869
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:30,044
Fuck.

870
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:32,630
I'm starting to peel out
the latex mold.

871
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,682
I start to feel wet latex.

872
00:37:34,766 --> 00:37:37,635
And I know that it's already
ripping and it's not working.

873
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:40,154
- We have three hours left.
- Okay.

874
00:37:40,238 --> 00:37:42,739
- I know I can make a hat.
- All right, make something.

875
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,175
If this doesn't come out,

876
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:46,410
our makeup's gonna be very,
very minimal

877
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:48,562
compared to what
everybody else is doing.

878
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:52,833
- Are you stressed?
- No, I'm good.

879
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:54,552
I'm just trying to work
as fast as possible.

880
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:55,970
Yeah.

881
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:57,388
We gotta-- we gotta
step it up today, you know.

882
00:37:57,456 --> 00:37:58,889
Derek keeps saying like,
"we need to step it up.

883
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:00,357
You know,
we don't have a lot of time."

884
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:01,459
We need to step it up.

885
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:02,960
We got to go a little bit
faster.

886
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:04,295
It is what it is.

887
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:05,496
We're gonna need to--
we need to step it up.

888
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:06,763
I just wanna go fast, you know.

889
00:38:06,815 --> 00:38:08,282
Yeah. No, I get it.
I get it.

890
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:10,634
I'm trying to stay out of
Derek's way because I'm noticing

891
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,786
that he's not working well
under stress at all.

892
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,243
- The colors are looking good.
- Yeah.

893
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:20,978
As I'm working I'm noticing

894
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,146
I can't find what I need
to make this work.

895
00:38:23,198 --> 00:38:25,315
Wow.
I don't know.

896
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:27,351
I'm in a little bit
of a loss right now.

897
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:29,720
Alana has a piece in her hand
and it doesn't look good.

898
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:33,390
All right, well, do you want me
to go back to that?

899
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,426
I'm really starting to worry.

900
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:38,095
- Just keep casting the thing.
- All right then.

901
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:39,597
I'm sorry.

902
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:42,283
So I'm gonna do it.
And I'm gonna start over again.

903
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:45,819
I have faith right now...
Sort of.

904
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:49,306
The paint is so important.

905
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:50,574
Like right now I'm freaking out

906
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:52,176
because the color
is not coming out.

907
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,912
It's too red and I wasn't
really going for a red look.

908
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,814
We were trying to go
for an orangey, you know,

909
00:38:56,865 --> 00:38:58,632
maybe even skin-tone color,

910
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:00,317
and it just didn't
come out that way.

911
00:39:08,693 --> 00:39:11,328
- Yeah, dude, be nice.
- Okay, okay, okay.

912
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:16,333
I can hear her going,
"ow! Stop!"

913
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:17,801
And like she's not happy.

914
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:19,486
- When you press down...
- I understand.

915
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,222
- Like my neck is like...
- I understand completely.

916
00:39:21,306 --> 00:39:22,573
At this point
I'm just getting embarrassed.

917
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:31,748
- 49 minutes.
- Fuck.

918
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,367
That's the fastest four hours
I've ever we had in my life.

919
00:39:35,554 --> 00:39:38,389
I don't understand how it's
gonna stand up on the head.

920
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,393
I'm starting to peel out
the slip latex mold

921
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,345
and Alana's really,
really frantic at this point.

922
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:46,297
Are you sure you wanna be
responsible for that?

923
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:48,632
I could go make something
right now.

924
00:39:48,683 --> 00:39:50,200
Oh, man.

925
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:54,605
A cowl goes down before the
face especially for our design.

926
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:57,258
So until this cowl is finished,
I cannot lay this face down.

927
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:59,893
I'm pulling it out right now.

928
00:39:59,978 --> 00:40:03,797
If this doesn't come out,
we're gonna be screwed.

929
00:40:03,882 --> 00:40:06,684
It worked dude.

930
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,085
Now we rock n' roll, girl.

931
00:40:11,056 --> 00:40:12,957
Try to fill a little bit
of paint on that face, too.

932
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:14,658
We're so behind at this point.

933
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:17,628
I'm looking around
and everyone has

934
00:40:17,696 --> 00:40:19,096
amazing paint jobs on
right now.

935
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:21,465
And our girl is bare.

936
00:40:21,516 --> 00:40:22,900
This is not good.

937
00:40:22,968 --> 00:40:25,386
If we don't pull
this paint job off like amazing

938
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,837
we're gonna be in the bottom--
No pressure.

939
00:40:30,508 --> 00:40:33,227
All right, that's it!
Times up!

940
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,928
Our cowl is not painted.

941
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:38,132
Our model has her arms
painted barely

942
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:41,101
and our face
is completely blank.

943
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:44,655
There's no way
this is gonna work.

944
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:46,290
We're in trouble.

945
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,593
Coming up...

946
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:51,845
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

947
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,064
I think it's amazing.

948
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:55,883
I'm just smiling
from ear to ear.

949
00:40:55,967 --> 00:41:00,037
It looks like a squished frog
that you put an easter hat on.

950
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,305
It's singularly unexceptional.

951
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:02,923
I'm starting to stress

952
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:04,274
especially after seeing
everybody else's work.

953
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:13,458
We have one hour backstage
for last looks.

954
00:41:13,526 --> 00:41:16,061
And there's a lot to get done.

955
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:22,667
Please be careful
with this prop.

956
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,686
It's made with a lick
and a promise.

957
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:26,805
I honestly believe we're gonna
be in the bottom two with this.

958
00:41:26,856 --> 00:41:28,473
So maybe not the costume first.

959
00:41:28,524 --> 00:41:30,509
We absolutely should put
the costume on first.

960
00:41:30,576 --> 00:41:31,710
We have to get that costume on

961
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,712
because it's a full suit
of female armor

962
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:36,798
- and it's gonna take time to put in on.
- Not the costume first.

963
00:41:36,883 --> 00:41:39,468
Joe decides, "oh, no,
I gotta paint everything.

964
00:41:39,552 --> 00:41:41,619
We can't put the costume
on yet."

965
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,774
Maybe we should have him stand.

966
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:47,275
Now is the time to panic.

967
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,877
Because we haven't tested
any of this

968
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:50,379
except for the main body piece.

969
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:52,497
I don't know how the legs
and the arms and all that

970
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:53,765
are gonna fit our actor.

971
00:41:58,187 --> 00:42:01,256
That's ten minutes everybody.
Ten minutes.

972
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:02,641
This is good.

973
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:03,976
All right, I'm gonna
keep painting, okay?

974
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:08,813
Oh, my God,
I am in love with it right now.

975
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:13,435
Our creature's
just wearing underwear.

976
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,487
The entire concept
is completely lost.

977
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:19,775
All right, guys.
That's time.

978
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,410
- We got it right here.
- Whoo!

979
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:23,445
She doesn't have her shoes
or her staff or anything.

980
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:25,063
It's okay.
It's okay.

981
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:26,548
We didn't even have a chance
to put her boots on.

982
00:42:26,632 --> 00:42:27,766
So she's barefoot.

983
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:40,479
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

984
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:42,647
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

985
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:44,616
Say hello to your judges.

986
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:47,703
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effect Studio Glenn Hetrick.

987
00:42:47,787 --> 00:42:49,721
Welcome, everyone.

988
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:51,373
Three-time Oscar winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

989
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:52,991
Hi, guys.

990
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:55,777
Creature designer and
director Patrick Tatopoulos.

991
00:42:55,862 --> 00:42:57,312
Hello.

992
00:42:57,397 --> 00:42:58,947
And just so you all know,
starting next week,

993
00:42:59,032 --> 00:43:01,566
Patrick is gonna begin working
in Bulgaria.

994
00:43:01,634 --> 00:43:03,235
He's the production designer

995
00:43:03,302 --> 00:43:05,370
for the highly anticipated
<i>300</i> film

996
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:06,671
<i>Battle Of Artemisia.</i>

997
00:43:06,739 --> 00:43:09,207
So, Patrick, we will all
miss you so much,

998
00:43:09,258 --> 00:43:10,759
and we wish you the best
of luck.

999
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:12,227
Well, I'm gonna miss
you all too,

1000
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:14,012
but you guys are
in great hands.

1001
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,314
And good luck to all of you.

1002
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:19,618
With that, let me introduce
you to your new series judge.

1003
00:43:19,669 --> 00:43:23,705
He's an incredibly accomplished
creature and concept designer

1004
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,625
who's worked on <i>Avatar,</i>
<i>Star Trek, Super 8,</i>

1005
00:43:26,692 --> 00:43:29,261
<i>Green Lantern,</i> and <i>Prometheus.</i>

1006
00:43:29,328 --> 00:43:32,647
Please give a warm welcome
to Neville Page.

1007
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:37,402
Neville just has a huge list
of credits.

1008
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,722
It is so impressive
to have him on the panel.

1009
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:42,274
Thank you very for having me.

1010
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:46,328
Well, thank you so much
for joining our amazing panel.

1011
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:48,346
So, guys, this week
your spotlight challenge

1012
00:43:48,414 --> 00:43:50,582
was to create an original alien

1013
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:52,317
that would fit
into a modern version

1014
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:55,053
of the classic
<i>Star Wars</i> cantina scene.

1015
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:58,824
Let's see what
you've come up with.

1016
00:44:20,546 --> 00:44:22,564
I'm feeling pretty good
about our makeup

1017
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:25,617
but at the same time,
with my partner having immunity,

1018
00:44:25,668 --> 00:44:28,186
if they decide they don't like
something about this one,

1019
00:44:28,254 --> 00:44:29,754
that's on me and me only.

1020
00:44:51,777 --> 00:44:56,665
It's just... awful.
I can't even look at the judges.

1021
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:18,854
I think she looks amazing.

1022
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:21,089
I'm just smiling
from ear to ear.

1023
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:24,809
Hopefully the <i>Star Wars</i> geeks
out there appreciate it

1024
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:26,778
as much as me and Sarah do.

1025
00:45:50,936 --> 00:45:53,838
As we planned,
the silhouette looks awesome.

1026
00:45:53,906 --> 00:45:55,190
Everything else
I'm starting to stress

1027
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:56,774
especially after seeing
everybody else's work.

1028
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,467
This is perfect.

1029
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:24,603
This is better than I thought
we could ever do.

1030
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,671
I think we can honestly maybe be
a top look for this.

1031
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:52,998
I'm not 100% crazy
about our creature.

1032
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:55,383
But I'm most happy about
my chest piece because you can

1033
00:46:55,468 --> 00:46:57,769
actually see the texture
which was my goal.

1034
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:03,174
All right.

1035
00:47:03,225 --> 00:47:04,809
Let's see them all together
in our version

1036
00:47:04,877 --> 00:47:09,030
of the <i>Star Wars</i> cantina scene.

1037
00:47:42,915 --> 00:47:45,483
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

1038
00:47:48,787 --> 00:47:49,921
For them doing all that stuff

1039
00:47:49,972 --> 00:47:51,322
it stayed together really well.

1040
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:54,225
Move your face around
as much as you can in there.

1041
00:47:54,276 --> 00:47:55,877
Hmm.

1042
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:57,595
Glenn's, like, knocking
on the vacuform pieces

1043
00:47:57,663 --> 00:48:00,832
and they're poking at the pieces
that weren't really glued down

1044
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:02,384
all the way.

1045
00:48:02,468 --> 00:48:04,519
So I'm not sure where we stand
in the judges' eyes.

1046
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:15,330
Okay.
So this is worn out.

1047
00:48:18,718 --> 00:48:20,017
Uh, does that look intentional?

1048
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:27,425
There's not
a whole lot happening.

1049
00:48:27,476 --> 00:48:28,660
No. No.

1050
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:30,862
Structurally on the neck
either.

1051
00:48:30,913 --> 00:48:33,231
You can almost smell
their disgust with the makeup.

1052
00:48:33,298 --> 00:48:34,732
No toes.

1053
00:48:34,784 --> 00:48:36,167
No feet.

1054
00:48:36,218 --> 00:48:38,503
You can see it from
a mile away, it's garbage.

1055
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,737
It's a mess.

1056
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:43,742
I'm thinking
I might be going home.

1057
00:48:43,793 --> 00:48:47,162
We wanna know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

1058
00:48:47,246 --> 00:48:49,631
Tell us on Twitter using
#faceoff.

1059
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:56,286
Anyone can see, from a mile
away, our makeup's garbage.

1060
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:57,504
Where did they pick this up at?

1061
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:02,592
And I'll be damned if I'm not
gonna defend myself.

1062
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:06,246
Can you put that on so I can
just get a look at those?

1063
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,834
It's very nerve-wracking
to see all four judges

1064
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:13,403
looking at your work,
poking, prodding.

1065
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:15,038
Really around the lip.

1066
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,739
They used the lip liner
that just covered it.

1067
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,375
That's beautiful.

1068
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:23,346
Can you articulate that?

1069
00:49:23,414 --> 00:49:25,865
Oh.

1070
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,108
I like that it does make
a connection to the head.

1071
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:39,396
- I mean, it's cool.
- Yeah.

1072
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:42,532
Open your mouth and close.

1073
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,667
Thanks.

1074
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:48,972
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations.

1075
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:51,174
Let's find out
what they thought.

1076
00:49:51,242 --> 00:49:53,376
Eric, Jason.

1077
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:57,497
Nicole and Alana.

1078
00:49:59,617 --> 00:50:01,384
Congratulations.

1079
00:50:01,452 --> 00:50:03,970
You are all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

1080
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:05,221
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1081
00:50:05,289 --> 00:50:07,090
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, guys.

1082
00:50:07,157 --> 00:50:10,276
I am jumping for joy, 'cause
I'm here for one more week.

1083
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,064
Okay, that means the rest
of you were the best

1084
00:50:15,116 --> 00:50:17,500
and the worst of the week.

1085
00:50:17,568 --> 00:50:20,269
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

1086
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,571
to learn more about your work.

1087
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:24,607
Laura and Sarah, step forward.

1088
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:31,097
All right.
Glenn, let's start with you.

1089
00:50:31,182 --> 00:50:33,850
I'd like to begin by asking
to tell us a little bit

1090
00:50:33,901 --> 00:50:36,019
about the concept
behind your character.

1091
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,588
She comes from the Dagobah
System which is very moist,

1092
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:40,957
but she lives on Tatooine.

1093
00:50:41,025 --> 00:50:43,192
That's why she's got
the breathing apparatus.

1094
00:50:43,244 --> 00:50:45,428
And her costume helps retain
that moisture.

1095
00:50:45,496 --> 00:50:47,330
It's the whole suit get-up.

1096
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,566
I'm pleased with this.

1097
00:50:49,617 --> 00:50:53,436
Rick Baker's work on the aliens
in the cantina--

1098
00:50:53,504 --> 00:50:56,573
even though they're technically
background characters,

1099
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,991
each of them have
their own backstory.

1100
00:50:58,075 --> 00:50:59,775
And the fans have come
to embrace that

1101
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:01,327
and extrapolate upon it.

1102
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:02,779
It meets that bar to me,

1103
00:51:02,846 --> 00:51:04,847
it feels like it has a story
when I look at it,

1104
00:51:04,899 --> 00:51:06,499
and it feels like it belongs
in the cantina.

1105
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:07,584
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1106
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,002
That's what we were going for.

1107
00:51:09,086 --> 00:51:10,904
Would you mind removing
the cowl for us

1108
00:51:10,988 --> 00:51:13,490
so we can see the
whole costume?

1109
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,442
Yeah, she's fantastic.
She has a great profile.

1110
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,328
I really love
your color choices.

1111
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:21,231
I love the costume.
Really excellent job, ladies.

1112
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:22,782
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1113
00:51:22,867 --> 00:51:24,617
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, guys.

1114
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:26,269
You know,
there's one thing you did

1115
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:27,720
that nobody else did

1116
00:51:27,805 --> 00:51:28,972
is put that cloak on top
of the character.

1117
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:31,040
And when I look
at this cantina scene,

1118
00:51:31,108 --> 00:51:32,942
they all seemed
to be coming from the desert

1119
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:34,878
and they're wearing
those cloak on top

1120
00:51:34,945 --> 00:51:36,212
and that was
a very clever touch

1121
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,530
to bring it into that world.

1122
00:51:37,615 --> 00:51:39,465
- Good stuff there.
- Thank you.

1123
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,551
I like the fact that you
mentioned the Dagobah System.

1124
00:51:42,836 --> 00:51:45,021
She has a specific origin.

1125
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:46,706
So you've been doing
your homework which is great.

1126
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,508
We're such geeks.

1127
00:51:48,592 --> 00:51:50,226
The fact that you brought
all these bone lines

1128
00:51:50,294 --> 00:51:51,761
throughout the head

1129
00:51:51,812 --> 00:51:56,832
down into this really very cool
wrist articulate treatment,

1130
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,651
I thought it was beautiful
detail.

1131
00:52:00,137 --> 00:52:01,354
Out of all the makeups
that I think we've seen,

1132
00:52:01,438 --> 00:52:03,022
several seasons, edgewise,

1133
00:52:03,107 --> 00:52:05,308
this is probably the cleanest
makeup that I've seen.

1134
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,327
Wow.

1135
00:52:07,411 --> 00:52:08,945
Thank you.
Please step back.

1136
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:15,668
Derek and CC, you're up.

1137
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:22,458
Can you tell me a little bit
of back story

1138
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:25,295
about where your character
comes from, why he's red?

1139
00:52:25,362 --> 00:52:27,380
He's a desert creature
from Tatooine.

1140
00:52:27,464 --> 00:52:29,949
We wanted to pull
the musical element into it.

1141
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:32,752
So we decided to give him
a musical instrument

1142
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:36,356
and just kinda make him more
of a jazzy-type alien.

1143
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,308
I think maybe you've done
yourself a great injustice

1144
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:42,045
by choosing that color
to paint him.

1145
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:43,596
Painting him red,
it's really difficult

1146
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:46,349
to even see the sculpting
in the character.

1147
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,620
He just kind of looks like--
It was sort of a bad burn job.

1148
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:52,872
I'm feeling very similar
to that.

1149
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:53,923
Yesterday when I saw you,
I thought,

1150
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:55,258
I was actually really impressed

1151
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:56,542
with the way
you were sculpting this.

1152
00:52:56,627 --> 00:52:58,060
And going just red

1153
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:00,830
you actually cancelled all those
great detail you had done.

1154
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:02,365
Those eyes at the top
of the head,

1155
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:03,916
I wish you had done something
that hold the real eyes

1156
00:53:04,001 --> 00:53:06,252
- in the same world.
- Right.

1157
00:53:06,337 --> 00:53:08,638
Something sort of
tying them together.

1158
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,391
I'm curious, who was
responsible for what aspect?

1159
00:53:11,475 --> 00:53:13,042
I sculpted the face.

1160
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:16,479
Um, CC sculpted the arms
and chest area.

1161
00:53:16,546 --> 00:53:18,748
And I did a majority
of the paint job.

1162
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:21,651
The thing for me that I think
you have to be very careful with

1163
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:24,354
is when you bake
in an expression.

1164
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:25,788
If you're gonna bake it in,

1165
00:53:25,856 --> 00:53:27,190
that's all that they're
gonna be able to emote

1166
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:30,059
but I'd like to think that
the actor underneath it

1167
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:35,031
is gonna have the opportunity
to express themselves.

1168
00:53:35,098 --> 00:53:36,566
Okay. Please step back.

1169
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:43,506
Let's talk to Roy and Rod.

1170
00:53:48,095 --> 00:53:50,380
Tell us a bit
about your concept.

1171
00:53:50,447 --> 00:53:51,847
Nobody knows
where this guy's from.

1172
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,616
He just hangs around Mos Eisley

1173
00:53:53,684 --> 00:53:56,269
and cons other visitors
out of their possessions.

1174
00:53:56,353 --> 00:53:58,421
He's so small that he has
to have this contraption

1175
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:00,356
to get around,
and he's too cheap to take--

1176
00:54:00,424 --> 00:54:01,941
buy one that floats,

1177
00:54:02,026 --> 00:54:03,459
so he's got the older model
that has the legs with it.

1178
00:54:03,527 --> 00:54:04,711
Got you.

1179
00:54:04,795 --> 00:54:07,613
The sheer concept
is just unbelievable.

1180
00:54:07,698 --> 00:54:09,599
- Thank you.
- So I'm extremely impressed.

1181
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,535
I'm thinking of the detail,
just the dirty feet.

1182
00:54:12,602 --> 00:54:14,020
All those little detail,

1183
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:17,173
add it on top of the humungous
amount of work is unbelievable.

1184
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,675
Thank you.

1185
00:54:18,742 --> 00:54:20,076
I'm so impressed with the fact

1186
00:54:20,143 --> 00:54:22,078
that you pulled this off in such
a short period of time.

1187
00:54:22,146 --> 00:54:24,630
So which of the two of you did
what on this project?

1188
00:54:24,715 --> 00:54:27,750
Is this--
this defines ambitious.

1189
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:31,537
Roy is an amazing fabricator.

1190
00:54:31,622 --> 00:54:35,525
And this vehicle is his.

1191
00:54:35,576 --> 00:54:39,112
Rod, your deal was primarily
the humanoid...

1192
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:40,530
- Yes.
- Thingamajig?

1193
00:54:40,597 --> 00:54:42,364
Rod took it
and sculpted the face

1194
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:44,801
and then me and him together
worked on the body.

1195
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:47,103
When you take on
this much work, time and again,

1196
00:54:47,154 --> 00:54:49,906
we've seen that can be
the key to failure.

1197
00:54:49,973 --> 00:54:51,474
But it wasn't,
so that speaks volumes

1198
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,775
about your time
management skills.

1199
00:54:52,843 --> 00:54:54,761
Well done.

1200
00:54:54,845 --> 00:54:56,713
You did everything well,
even the hair work.

1201
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:59,248
Your paint job is beautiful.
Your edges are great.

1202
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,750
It's an amazing creature

1203
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,351
and I think you just did
a wonderful job.

1204
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:03,352
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1205
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,872
You can both step back.

1206
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:12,462
Tommy and Joe, step forward.

1207
00:55:14,264 --> 00:55:16,649
There's no way in hell
I'm going down with this.

1208
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:19,368
Joe led this project.

1209
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,905
If I don't explain
what I'm responsible for

1210
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:25,508
and why this piece failed
and apologize,

1211
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:27,043
I might be going home.

1212
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:31,180
Can I just say something?

1213
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:32,598
I'm gonna try to do this

1214
00:55:32,683 --> 00:55:37,987
in the most tasteful way
possible.

1215
00:55:38,038 --> 00:55:39,956
I can honestly say
it's my fault.

1216
00:55:40,023 --> 00:55:43,126
I really wish I would have
taken lead on this.

1217
00:55:43,193 --> 00:55:45,378
I wish I would have painted it.

1218
00:55:45,462 --> 00:55:49,382
I'm ashamed to bring this
before you guys.

1219
00:55:49,466 --> 00:55:50,983
We had a lot of problems
working together.

1220
00:55:51,068 --> 00:55:55,238
I felt that the only way for us
to accomplish anything

1221
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:58,307
was for one of us
to take point,

1222
00:55:58,375 --> 00:56:00,743
and halfway through
the second day apparently,

1223
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:02,145
the only way
that was going to happen

1224
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:03,980
is if I took direction,

1225
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:05,715
I mean, I'm not throwing him
under the bus by any means.

1226
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,416
Kind of, you are.
Actually, yes.

1227
00:56:07,484 --> 00:56:09,485
- I'm not trying to.
- Yeah.

1228
00:56:09,536 --> 00:56:12,388
It just breaks my heart to
have to stand here like this

1229
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:13,623
for you guys.

1230
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,358
Yeah.
Are you finished?

1231
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:16,476
Can we get to talking
about the makeup?

1232
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:23,632
- Yeah.
- It's singularly unexceptional.

1233
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:26,402
I'm drawn to the crudeness
of the color application,

1234
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:29,071
and so many of the mistakes
are completely indefensible.

1235
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:32,441
The color scheme looks like
layer, after layer, after layer

1236
00:56:32,509 --> 00:56:37,230
of one color resulting
in a stunning shade of mud.

1237
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:39,031
When you're doing
the color application,

1238
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:41,150
tell me exactly
who's doing what

1239
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:43,236
and how that happened?

1240
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,955
I actually painted
the entire head.

1241
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:47,390
What color scheme
were you going for?

1242
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:48,791
Like what was the intent?

1243
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:51,494
I was gonna do something like
a turtle on top.

1244
00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:53,830
Wow! I never would
have picked that one.

1245
00:56:53,897 --> 00:56:55,414
It looks like a squished frog

1246
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,683
- that you put an easter hat on.
- Okay.

1247
00:56:57,768 --> 00:57:01,170
One of the problems is
there's no focal point.

1248
00:57:01,238 --> 00:57:04,273
There's no place that I think
I want to look.

1249
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:06,075
Quite frankly,
I just wanna look away

1250
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:09,362
because it's so offensive
aesthetically.

1251
00:57:09,446 --> 00:57:10,947
And what happened to her feet?

1252
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:13,583
We ran out of time.

1253
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,134
You guys do realize that,

1254
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:17,470
if and when you make it
into the profession,

1255
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:19,272
you're going to have
to work with people

1256
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:21,557
that you do not like.
It's a fact.

1257
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,025
- No. Absolutely.
- It happens.

1258
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:25,228
And so this is a mark
of professionalism,

1259
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:27,363
your ability to overcome
that obstacle

1260
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:30,232
and get on with it, because
it's extremely important.

1261
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:34,136
I was trying to accomplish
what he originally envisioned

1262
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:36,155
or what he originally drew.

1263
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,407
I couldn't do a single thing
without you touching it

1264
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,376
or telling me how wrong
I was doing it,

1265
00:57:40,443 --> 00:57:41,911
because apparently
you know everything.

1266
00:57:41,979 --> 00:57:44,713
Somebody back me up here.

1267
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,489
I'm sorry.

1268
00:58:05,118 --> 00:58:07,086
All right, the judges have
heard what you have to say.

1269
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:08,454
Please head back
to the makeup room

1270
00:58:08,538 --> 00:58:09,855
while they make
their decisions.

1271
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1272
00:58:11,692 --> 00:58:13,075
Thank you.

1273
00:58:13,143 --> 00:58:16,545
That last one was torturous.

1274
00:58:18,315 --> 00:58:19,682
All right, guys.

1275
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:22,285
So why don't we start
with the top looks?

1276
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:24,387
What are your thoughts
on Rod and Roy?

1277
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:27,156
- I loved it.
- Extremely ambitious.

1278
00:58:27,224 --> 00:58:28,858
The amount
that they accomplished,

1279
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:30,359
in their first week too,

1280
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,994
that makes it even
more exceptional.

1281
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:34,263
Kind of telling too
how well they got on.

1282
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:36,582
You couldn't have done it
any other way.

1283
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:39,935
Everything they did was
absolutely well thought-out.

1284
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:41,537
Rod did the makeup part
and what,

1285
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:42,622
Roy did the fabrication, right?

1286
00:58:42,706 --> 00:58:43,823
Mm-hmm.

1287
00:58:43,907 --> 00:58:45,708
Each of those fingers
had a different,

1288
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:46,842
weird little gnarled claw.

1289
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:47,994
There's a story in each one.

1290
00:58:48,078 --> 00:58:49,545
They thought of everything.

1291
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:51,347
Okay, let's move on
to Laura and Sarah.

1292
00:58:51,398 --> 00:58:53,783
I'm extremely pleased with
what they did in this challenge.

1293
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:56,886
I think it fits the <i>Star Wars</i>
aspect of our challenge.

1294
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:59,505
A lot of it has to do
with the cloak and the hood.

1295
00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:03,142
That felt like it fit
into the old <i>Star Wars.</i>

1296
00:59:03,226 --> 00:59:05,461
I love the organic sculpting
in the head,

1297
00:59:05,512 --> 00:59:07,263
as we've not really seen
anything like that.

1298
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,031
- It was beautiful.
- Beautifully done.

1299
00:59:09,082 --> 00:59:11,334
So the question, I think,
we have to ask ourselves now

1300
00:59:11,401 --> 00:59:13,736
is do we go
with Sarah and Laura's

1301
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:16,005
really beautifully executed
makeup,

1302
00:59:16,072 --> 00:59:18,807
which may be the cleanest
we've ever seen on the show?

1303
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:23,312
Or do we award Rod and Roy
for this really incredibly

1304
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:26,615
ambitious concept that in the
end they executed brilliantly?

1305
00:59:26,683 --> 00:59:29,986
All right, so let's move on
to the bottom looks.

1306
00:59:30,053 --> 00:59:32,221
Why don't we start
with Joe and Tommy?

1307
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,224
- You talk about a hot mess...
- Yeah, right?

1308
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:36,525
That was a hot mess.

1309
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:39,195
Both emotionally
and creatively.

1310
00:59:39,262 --> 00:59:42,031
The sculpting was really
creative and interesting.

1311
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:43,866
It disappeared
into the paint job.

1312
00:59:43,934 --> 00:59:45,801
If they would have
painted it differently

1313
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:47,553
it would have been a completely
different creature.

1314
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:48,671
Yeah.

1315
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:50,172
Equally loathsome,

1316
00:59:50,223 --> 00:59:53,008
the approach that Tommy took
to the Q and A.

1317
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,276
Yes.

1318
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:56,278
It felt very groveling
and desperate.

1319
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:58,013
- It's a lose-lose situation.
- It is.

1320
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,649
Because that's his only
opportunity to save face.

1321
01:00:00,717 --> 01:00:04,754
All right.
Let's talk about CC and Derek.

1322
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:07,990
This one for me was
a disaster of boredom

1323
01:00:08,058 --> 01:00:09,591
and a disastrous creature

1324
01:00:09,643 --> 01:00:11,644
that looked like it
could be used for anything.

1325
01:00:11,728 --> 01:00:13,729
There is no personality
whatsoever.

1326
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:15,798
What they've done with the paint
completely killed it.

1327
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:19,118
I was so surprised to see that
how much you can kill

1328
01:00:19,202 --> 01:00:21,120
a sculpture
with a bad paint job.

1329
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:24,106
I thought this thing was,
at best, uninspired.

1330
01:00:24,157 --> 01:00:26,659
If you're going to make him
a saxophone player,

1331
01:00:26,743 --> 01:00:28,143
I would have loved for them

1332
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:30,012
to have worked on the saxophone
a little bit as a prop

1333
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:31,781
and made it something
that we can believe

1334
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:33,416
belongs in the cantina.

1335
01:00:33,483 --> 01:00:34,950
His eyes were lighting up

1336
01:00:35,018 --> 01:00:36,752
but his actual eyes
were like dead holes.

1337
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:38,704
They had no direction.

1338
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:40,005
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

1339
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,257
Yeah, I think we're there.

1340
01:00:41,324 --> 01:00:43,225
Okay.
Let's bring them back out.

1341
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:53,135
All of us are backstage
and Tommy looks tormented.

1342
01:00:53,203 --> 01:00:56,689
I can't imagine the pressure
building on him and Joe.

1343
01:00:56,773 --> 01:01:00,209
I'm sitting backstage
and the door flies open

1344
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:02,027
and Joe's just gone.

1345
01:01:02,112 --> 01:01:06,715
- What happened?
- Joe left.

1346
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:08,884
I'm so confused right now.
Where's Joey?

1347
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:16,291
Did he just run like
out of the building?

1348
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:18,594
If he just like
decided to take off,

1349
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:21,430
then I don't understand
what that means.

1350
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:24,967
What happens if Joe doesn't
come back?

1351
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:33,821
I'm sitting backstage
and the door flies open

1352
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:37,124
and Joe's gone.

1353
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:41,728
It's gotta feel horrendous to
have judges just rip into you.

1354
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:43,297
What happens
if Joe doesn't come back?

1355
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:57,294
As you've noticed Joe
is not here with us on stage.

1356
01:01:57,379 --> 01:02:00,047
He has chosen to leave the set

1357
01:02:00,098 --> 01:02:01,715
and has therefore been
disqualified

1358
01:02:01,766 --> 01:02:04,034
from the competition.

1359
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:05,469
I really don't know
what's going to happen now.

1360
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:07,071
Does that affect the judging?

1361
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:09,523
If he wasn't
the one going home anyways

1362
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:11,592
is somebody still gonna
kicked off?

1363
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:17,848
Derek, CC, Tommy...

1364
01:02:17,933 --> 01:02:19,250
You are all safe.

1365
01:02:19,334 --> 01:02:21,886
No one is going
to be eliminated tonight.

1366
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:23,437
You can head back
to the makeup room.

1367
01:02:23,488 --> 01:02:26,390
Thank you.

1368
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:30,761
He's disqualified.
One more week, one more time.

1369
01:02:30,845 --> 01:02:32,246
- You're safe.
- One more time.

1370
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:33,747
Yay!

1371
01:02:33,798 --> 01:02:35,816
I'm just so happy
that this challenge is over

1372
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:37,935
and I can finally show
that I can do something.

1373
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:40,271
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

1374
01:02:40,355 --> 01:02:44,158
Our top two makeups tonight
were Rod and Roy.

1375
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:45,926
You were incredibly ambitious

1376
01:02:45,994 --> 01:02:48,379
and that huge risk
really paid off.

1377
01:02:48,463 --> 01:02:52,733
Laura and Sarah, we felt
that your character captured

1378
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:55,619
the quintessence
of the <i>Star Wars</i> cantina scene.

1379
01:02:55,704 --> 01:02:56,971
Which team came out on top?

1380
01:02:57,038 --> 01:03:02,726
The top team tonight is...

1381
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,745
Rod and Roy.

1382
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,534
This was a really tough
decision tonight.

1383
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:13,203
But we felt that
in this challenge,

1384
01:03:13,288 --> 01:03:14,888
had to reward the amount
of creativity

1385
01:03:14,956 --> 01:03:16,206
that went into that concept.

1386
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:18,058
It's something
we have not seen yet.

1387
01:03:18,109 --> 01:03:20,894
- Rod and Roy, great job.
- Thank you.

1388
01:03:20,946 --> 01:03:22,829
As the winners
of this challenge,

1389
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:24,214
your character will be featured

1390
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:26,733
on the official
<i>Star Wars</i> website

1391
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:29,169
in its original
design and recreated

1392
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,004
in the style of <i>The Clone Wars.</i>

1393
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:32,439
I can't believe
that the piece that we made

1394
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:34,975
is gonna be part
of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe.

1395
01:03:35,026 --> 01:03:38,712
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

1396
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,980
Glenn?

1397
01:03:40,048 --> 01:03:43,717
The winner tonight is...

1398
01:03:44,828 --> 01:03:46,053
Rod.

1399
01:03:47,272 --> 01:03:51,058
Thanks.

1400
01:03:51,125 --> 01:03:52,443
You both did an incredible job.

1401
01:03:52,527 --> 01:03:54,695
But ultimately it came down
to the makeup aspect

1402
01:03:54,762 --> 01:03:57,831
of this creation which we felt
was a bit more you, Rod.

1403
01:03:57,882 --> 01:04:00,284
- Rod, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1404
01:04:00,368 --> 01:04:03,003
The four of you can head back
to the makeup room.

1405
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,305
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1406
01:04:04,372 --> 01:04:06,340
Great job.

1407
01:04:08,143 --> 01:04:09,843
- Who won?
- Rod.

1408
01:04:09,911 --> 01:04:11,312
- Here's the winner.
- Good job.

1409
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:12,713
Yay.

1410
01:04:12,764 --> 01:04:14,214
Winning the spotlight challenge

1411
01:04:14,265 --> 01:04:17,184
feels great to have my work
acknowledged in that way.

1412
01:04:17,235 --> 01:04:18,986
You guys are gonna be
on the <i>Star Wars</i> website.

1413
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:20,487
Isn't that amazing?

1414
01:04:20,555 --> 01:04:22,656
To have the judges recognize
how much work went into it

1415
01:04:22,724 --> 01:04:25,792
and for them to sincerely
congratulate us--

1416
01:04:25,844 --> 01:04:27,094
What a wonderful thing.

1417
01:04:27,145 --> 01:04:29,500
Whoo!
