Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:04,026
The artists teamed up

3
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:06,199
to make original
Chinese new-year dragons,

4
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:08,043
and their makeups
were put to the test

5
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:10,455
in an acrobatic dance.

6
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:13,364
Derek's unique vision
took him to the top.

7
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,270
But his twin brother Eric
fell short and was sent home.

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,209
Now nine artists remain.

9
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:20,350
Tonight they will dive
down the rabbit hole.

10
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:23,325
Yay!
I love <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

11
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:25,263
The virus
has infected Wonderland.

12
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:26,802
I got a plan.

13
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,605
It's gonna be something
nobody's ever seen before.

14
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:31,747
It just crumbles
into, like, four pieces.

15
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,951
I screwed up really bad.

16
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:37,423
And zombies take over
the reveal stage.

17
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,092
I love it.
Well done.

18
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,831
- That is the most distracting,
God-awful thing I've ever seen.

19
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:45,267
I'm definitely going home.

20
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,636
In the end,

21
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:48,441
only one will win
the opportunity

22
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,982
to be a guest lecturer at
Make Up For Ever's academies

23
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,684
in New York and Paris,

00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,556
a new 2012 Toyota Prius V,

25
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:59,128
and $100,000.

26
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:01,536
And for the first time ever,
America,

27
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,176
your voice will be heard

Derek had to go home.

Oh, no.

Before I tell you anything more,

I want to introduce you

She's a four time

51
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:37,489
world-championship

52
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,725
who went undefeated
her entire career.

53
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:44,198
- Please welcome Laila Ali.
- Thank you.

54
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,501
Laila Ali--
She's a legend.

55
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,869
It's really cool to meet her.

56
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,437
So excited to be here.
Thank you.

57
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:51,006
We are excited to have you.

58
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:53,641
So, guys,
in films like <i>Raging Bull</i>

59
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:54,843
and <i>Rocky</i> and <i>The Fighter,</i>

60
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:56,480
makeup artists
have been called upon

61
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,281
to create
a realistic trauma makeup

62
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,681
for the big screen.

63
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:02,983
That is the basis
of your foundation challenge,

64
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,385
to make your models look like
they have just gone through

65
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,620
a nasty ten rounds in the ring.

66
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,321
So, Laila,

67
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:11,656
needless to say, you do know
what this stuff looks like.

68
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,691
A lot can happen in a fight.

69
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,893
You can get anything

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,095
from a busted lip
to a broken nose,

71
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,329
bruising, swelling,

72
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:19,831
a gash over your eye.

73
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,301
So there's a lot that can happen
over ten rounds.

74
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,902
Your models and makeup stations

75
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,502
have been randomly assigned.

76
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,771
The winner will receive immunity

77
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,844
and cannot be eliminated
in the spotlight challenge.

78
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:35,314
Remember, guys,
realism is everything today.

79
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,747
You have 90 minutes.

80
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:38,881
Get ready, contenders,

81
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:44,291
because your time starts now.

82
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,831
Ready to get all bloody
and disgusting today?

83
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,033
Yeah.
This is pretty easy.

84
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:50,837
I used to take martial arts,

85
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,173
and I feel like
I got a good shot

86
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,509
at taking
this foundation challenge.

87
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:55,544
And I think I'm gonna
go subtle and realistic

88
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,348
with the swollen-eye
prosthetic.

89
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,148
Ready to beat you up.

90
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:02,382
My plan is to build up a lot
of swelling around the face,

91
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,283
do a broken nose, busted lip,

92
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,684
and then some body bruising.

93
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:11,419
Just blend, blend, blend,
blend, blend.

94
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:12,754
I'm trying
to incorporate everything

95
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:13,889
that laila had to say--

96
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,792
punches, bruising,
to swelling--

97
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,194
without overdoing it.

98
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:21,727
I'm going with some blues
on my paint job.

99
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:24,430
And once I do that,
it just starts turning purple.

100
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,199
This ain't gonna be good.

101
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,567
Five minutes, guys.

102
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,471
I need to just kind of like,
smear across your face.

103
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:40,315
That's it.
Brushes down.

104
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,719
He got his eye pretty
messed up in this fight,

105
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:46,324
and his lip is cut,
and he's bleeding everywhere.

106
00:04:46,392 --> 00:04:48,892
I like the way that the blood
is splattered over his body.

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,393
The only thing I will say

108
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,328
is that the color of the blood

109
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:54,030
looks like it's older.

110
00:04:54,098 --> 00:04:55,232
When you just come out
of a fight,

111
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,836
it wouldn't be that thick
and that dark.

112
00:04:57,903 --> 00:04:59,768
He's actually the winner
of the fight,

113
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:00,836
despite how he looks.

114
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:02,037
Swelled up his eye.

115
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,171
Both his ears got cut
in the fight.

116
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,672
You did a pretty good job
with the thickness of the blood,

117
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,840
it's kind of watery,

118
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:08,674
because in a fight
you're sweating.

119
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,042
It looks good.

120
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,278
Busted lip, broken nose,
a little bit of gashes.

121
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,948
I think you did a good job
with the swelling,

122
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:16,816
just the shape of it
around the eye

123
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,050
and then down the cheekbone.

124
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,484
The lip looks
very, very bloody.

125
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:21,652
He's taken a couple blows
to the face,

126
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:24,287
and we have a busted nose

127
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:27,455
and a split in the eyebrow
that's still fresh.

128
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:29,324
Being that he is beat up
pretty bad,

129
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:30,726
there would be more blood
on his body.

130
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:33,327
Got you.

131
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:42,934
All right, Laila,

132
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:44,935
so how did they do overall?

133
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:47,637
You know, I thought everyone
did a really great job.

134
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:49,039
It seems like they knew
in their mind

135
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,639
what their fighter
was going through,

136
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:52,307
and they went from there.

137
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,907
Who were your favorites?

138
00:05:53,975 --> 00:05:55,744
Nicole,

139
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:58,748
your model looks like he just
came out of a bloody fight.

140
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,082
Very believable.

141
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,916
Jason, that eye was great,

142
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:05,318
the cuts were very realistic
for a boxing match.

143
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:06,986
Thank you.

144
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:10,088
All right, Laila, who is
the winner of this challenge?

145
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:14,789
The winner
of this challenge is...

146
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:16,290
Jason.

147
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:17,692
- Sweet.
- Yoo-hoo.

148
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,128
Even though

149
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:20,829
your model didn't have as much

150
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:23,461
as everybody else's,
what you did do, you nailed.

151
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:25,362
Jason, congratulations.

152
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,894
You have earned immunity

153
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:29,229
and cannot be eliminated in
this week's spotlight challenge.

154
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:30,966
That feels good.

155
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,868
This is the first time that I've
been on top, on any challenge.

156
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,402
- I'm stoked.
- Great job today, everyone.

157
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:40,110
I will see you tomorrow for
your next spotlight challenge.

158
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:43,647
Good job, everybody.

159
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,195
We're walking
around Descanso Gardens,

160
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:01,365
and it's absolutely beautiful.

161
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:06,834
We come through the woods,

162
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:09,639
come around this bend,
then, all of a sudden,

163
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:10,674
all of these colors pop out.

164
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,110
There's pink mushrooms

165
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:15,345
and oversized sunflowers,
and it looks amazing.

166
00:07:15,414 --> 00:07:17,749
And McKenzie's standing
in this magical garden,

167
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:20,285
and I'm thinking, "oh, great.

168
00:07:20,353 --> 00:07:23,584
We're gonna do munchkins
or fairies."

169
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,789
Welcome to
the beautiful Descanso Gardens.

170
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:31,523
This week your
spotlight challenge inspiration

171
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,993
comes from a very famous book.

172
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:37,528
<i>Alice's Adventures</i>
<i>in Wonderland.</i>

173
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:40,195
Yay!
I love <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

174
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:41,931
If I had a tail,
it'd be wagging.

175
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:43,430
This book has become
a phenomenon,

176
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:47,333
saturating pop culture and
spawning several feature films.

177
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,333
But it's also found its way
into places

178
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,433
that you really
would never expect,

179
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,968
like the <i>Resident Evil</i>
film franchise.

180
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,468
I love the franchise.

181
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,237
I've watched the movies
since I was a kid.

182
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:00,174
Finally a challenge
that I wanna tackle.

183
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:02,846
The <i>Resident Evil</i> films
take place in a world infected

184
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:04,314
by the T-virus,

185
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:07,014
which turns humans and animals
into zombies.

186
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:11,285
Today, that virus
has infected Wonderland.

187
00:08:11,353 --> 00:08:14,083
- Yes.
- This is amazing.

188
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,483
Oh, my God.

189
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,884
Your spotlight challenge is

190
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:19,222
to create
a completely original take

191
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:21,056
on one of the iconic characters

192
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:24,090
from <i>Alice's Adventures</i>
<i>in Wonderland</i>

193
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,792
as a virus infected zombie.

194
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,227
Wow.

195
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:29,761
We have Alice,

196
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,395
the Hatter,

197
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:32,595
the Queen,

198
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,163
Cheshire Cat,

199
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:35,602
and White Rabbit.

200
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,408
Jason, go ahead
and pick your card.

201
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,309
I choose the Hatter.

202
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:44,918
Rabbit.

203
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:46,718
Ooh.
I'm taking the rabbit.

204
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:48,821
The Hatter.

205
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:51,790
The Queen.

206
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,091
Cheshire Cat.

207
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,557
Okay, now that you each have
your characters,

208
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,358
take some time here
to work on your designs,

209
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,292
and then head back to the lab,

210
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:04,496
pick your models
and get started.

211
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,900
It's really important
to have a good design

212
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,101
before you go into makeup,
because it's easier to execute.

213
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,635
I'm gonna be wanting her
to have the rabbit in her hands

214
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:15,670
and she's just gnawing away
on it.

215
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:17,104
Just really dark.

216
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:19,438
I'm gonna make Alice more
my style.

217
00:09:22,643 --> 00:09:26,146
My idea is to have her
becoming a mutant zombie.

218
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:30,682
It's like her skin creates
a crown in her clothing.

219
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,651
I grew up in
a Mennonite community,

220
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:36,152
so I don't really know very much
about zombies.

221
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,421
I'm not really getting
any sketching done.

222
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:41,024
Nothing's really coming to me.

223
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,859
I'm thinking more
of, like, a thrasher zombie.

224
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:45,061
He has all these wristwatches
going arm

225
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,562
for each stage
of the infection.

226
00:09:48,563 --> 00:09:50,635
All right.
That's it.

227
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,935
We get to the lab, and I
immediately started sculpting.

228
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:01,170
First step
to creating a prosthetic

229
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:04,272
is sculpting clay
on the cast of the model.

230
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:05,773
And for my cheshire cat,

231
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,442
part of his face is gonna be
missing a lot of the skin.

232
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:11,142
So it's only gonna have whiskers
on one side of his face,

233
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,110
and then the other side,
his teeth are gonna be exposed.

234
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:17,513
I'm gonna individually glue
teeth on the prosthetic.

235
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,615
My character, she ripped all
of her hair out.

236
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,217
She's tweaking out.

237
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:23,587
But just like everything I do,

238
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:27,323
there'll be some form
of sex appeal in this.

239
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:29,456
I'm lost on the concept
and frustrated

240
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:33,028
that I don't know what to make.

241
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:35,532
Just one concept
not completely going through

242
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,032
the way you want it to--

243
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,433
That's what's gonna send
somebody home.

244
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:45,005
Coming up...

245
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,073
My cowl falls
on the ground, ears first.

246
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,338
I want to cry.

247
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:53,008
- That is the most God-awful
thing I've ever seen.

248
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:02,312
The pressure is on.

249
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,383
I have to turn a Cheshire Cat
into a zombie.

250
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:07,251
I am having some trouble
sculpting.

251
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,786
I don't know what to make,

252
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,654
other than just a cat
with a big grin.

253
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:14,022
Think of, like, the original,

254
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:15,292
and then think about

255
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,731
just shredding up
the original version.

256
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,268
I talked
to Nicole a little bit,

257
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:21,269
and her suggestion
really helped.

258
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:24,572
So I decided that this cat
is not a happy kitty

259
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,209
that sits in your window
and looks outside all day long.

260
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:31,921
This is a dead, run over
roadkill cat.

261
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,390
I'm going to use this immunity

262
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,925
to try out some new things
and different techniques.

263
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,661
My makeup is gonna look cool
or it's gonna look terrible.

264
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,062
Regardless,
I'm gonna still be here.

265
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,963
So this is probably

266
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,197
one of the most complicated
makeups that I've done.

267
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:45,298
My concept is a skull piece
on the bottom,

268
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:46,699
and there's skin over it.

269
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,299
If I can pull it off,

270
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,235
it's gonna be something
that nobody's ever seen before.

271
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:57,373
By the end of today, I want to
have my face and chest sculpted.

272
00:11:57,441 --> 00:12:00,312
With the chest piece,
you could see the rib cage

273
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,780
and the deterioration
of the skin.

274
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,587
My goal is to have this sculpt
out in the next two hours.

275
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,456
It's time to make the mold.

276
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:12,459
We do this
by covering the sculpture

277
00:12:12,527 --> 00:12:14,493
with a cement-like product.

278
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,827
After that hardens,

279
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:17,895
it's time to remove the clay
on the inside,

280
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,361
and we either pour silicone
or foam latex into it

281
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,596
and have our final piece.

282
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,076
I have my face done.
I have my cowl roughed out.

283
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:31,277
I'm feeling really good
at this point.

284
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:33,279
- 19 seconds.
- Shit.

285
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:36,948
Five, four, three, two, one.

286
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:40,455
Time.
That's it.

287
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,357
There you go.

288
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,332
It's day two

289
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,100
of our "Alice in Zombieland"
challenge.

290
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:55,771
My cowl is on its way
to being finished,

291
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,207
and I'm feeling really good.

292
00:12:58,643 --> 00:12:59,543
- You okay?
- Oh, shit.

293
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,846
Alana, what happened?

294
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:03,446
My cowl falls
on the ground, ears first.

295
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,096
What the fuck am I gonna do?

296
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:06,848
I want to cry.

297
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,083
I don't have time for this.

298
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:12,221
No use crying
over a spilled bunny, right?

299
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:15,692
I'm thinking,
wouldn't it be cool

300
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,597
if the mad hatter's
measuring tape

301
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,967
was some of his intestines,

302
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:22,136
and he was confused,
because he's a zombie,

303
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:24,771
that it's
his actual measuring tape?

304
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:28,476
So that's when it starts getting
a little gory.

305
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:32,417
Hey guys.

306
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,654
I'm here with Neville

307
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:35,989
to do a little walkthrough,
see how you're doing.

308
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:37,391
I'm really excited
to talk to Neville.

309
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,892
I'm really anxious for him
to see this

310
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,563
from the drawing stage
to where it's at right now.

311
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:42,765
So tell us about your concept

312
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,000
and what you're doing
with the queen.

313
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,268
The plan is to take it

314
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:46,503
and have, like, her skin
and her muscles

315
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:48,474
actually coming up
and creating the crown.

316
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,843
So the face is actually--

317
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,944
Yeah, the skin on it
is just, like, tearing away

318
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:52,245
and it goes up
and forms a crown.

319
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:54,246
- Cool idea.
- Yeah.

320
00:13:54,312 --> 00:13:55,478
So you have the queen.

321
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:57,045
Tell us about your concept.

322
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:58,046
The queen is infected
with something

323
00:13:58,113 --> 00:13:59,214
that speeds up her metabolism.

324
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:01,919
And she just needs fresh blood.

325
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,323
The more she gets,
the fatter she gets.

326
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:04,825
Such a great idea,

327
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:06,359
but it needs
to work visually as well.

328
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:09,429
So you want it
to be demonstrative visually.

329
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:10,664
- So you have Alice.
- I do.

330
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:11,465
You were the only person
to chose Alice.

331
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:12,867
I know.

332
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,271
She's gonna have, like,
her rib cage kind of showing

333
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:17,272
and then this bottle.

334
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,337
Can you explain a bit more
about the wound.

335
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:21,371
Has this bottle
been stabbed into her?

336
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,640
And somebody went--

337
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,142
It feels more
like the bottle is...

338
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,311
- Coming out.
- Exploding out, yeah.

339
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:26,279
- Pushing from the inside.
- Right.

340
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:27,714
Once he said that, it clicked.

341
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:28,948
I'm like, "oh, my God.
It's like a bullet."

342
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:30,952
So, you chose the hatter.

343
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,220
Tell us about your concept.

344
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,589
When he died,
he fell on the table,

345
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:37,589
and all of the dishes and cups
and teapots got into him.

346
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:38,857
So I'll be adding it
into the body.

347
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:39,825
All embedded into his body?

348
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,393
- Exactly.
- That's cool.

349
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,994
We're going totally
<i>Resident Evil</i> on this one.

350
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:44,096
Good.

351
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,531
I thought

352
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,933
if the white rabbit was
just thrown in this situation

353
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,300
and he's infected,
he's always worried about time.

354
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:50,801
He puts all these wristwatches
on his arm,

355
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:54,103
and each watch is a timer
to each stage of the infection.

356
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:57,208
I'm curious how you're gonna
go about painting these pieces.

357
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,476
We're gonna start
with a dark wash,

358
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:00,379
so I can get all
of these nice crevasses,

359
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:03,680
but the outer layer is a nice
clean base for me to brush over.

360
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:05,081
Just be careful.

361
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,850
You might end up
with so much texture

362
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,584
that, at a distance...

363
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,588
It's gonna be hard
to read much.

364
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,056
Okay.
Very cool.

365
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:14,256
So with the cheshire cat,

366
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:15,223
what are you doing conceptually
with it?

367
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,590
Head to toe costume.

368
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:18,790
So I'm actually making
a body suit right now.

369
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,124
- I'm gonna use some of this fur.
- Wow. - Wow.

370
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:22,226
Yeah, I realize
it's incredibly ambitious.

371
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,460
God, yeah.

372
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:26,261
The overall dominance
of your character

373
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,861
is gonna be in how you make
the fur zombie-like.

374
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,760
And maybe even some hair product
would be good.

375
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:33,727
Oh, that's a good idea.

376
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:36,800
Who do you think
is really standing out?

377
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,905
Rod.
I love the idea a lot.

378
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:41,309
Will he be able
to pull that off?

379
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:44,379
And Roy, conceptually,
head to toe, very cool idea.

380
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:46,715
- He's doing a lot.
- He is.

381
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,117
So with Sarah
and her cheshire cat?

382
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:50,588
I'm a little concerned
she is gonna be burdened

383
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:54,559
with this choice
of making this huge statement.

384
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,560
And I'm a little concerned
about Tommy's.

385
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:58,061
I think that it could get worse
in paint.

386
00:15:58,128 --> 00:15:59,496
Mm.
Thank you very much.

387
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:00,864
We'll see how
this all turns out.

388
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:02,600
All right, everybody,
we're heading out.

389
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:03,768
Good luck tomorrow.

390
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:04,704
- Thank you.
- See you.

391
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:06,807
See you later.

392
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,841
Now I'm starting to do

393
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,641
a decapitated version
of the human head.

394
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:15,210
But it's a whole another makeup,
it really is.

395
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,778
It's not just a head prop,
it's a key feature here.

396
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:20,946
Since I have a cat costume,

397
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,679
and I don't want them to look
like a mascot or like a kitty,

398
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:27,681
I'm making some foam pieces
to put underneath the fur

399
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:30,252
to give it kind of
a lumpy, bumpy, creatur-y thing.

400
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,354
I want it to look really ratty,

401
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:35,524
have skin pieces on it
falling apart.

402
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,691
And then I decide
to use some gelatin.

403
00:16:36,758 --> 00:16:38,723
Basically,
just making it a mess.

404
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:42,561
I'm back in the mold room.

405
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,063
And as I'm scraping out clay...

406
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:46,266
Oh.

407
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:49,170
The wrist literally shatters,
on it, into, like, four pieces.

408
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:50,606
It just crumbles.

409
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:53,979
I'm just like, "no."

410
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,061
I don't know if you
noticed this, but...

411
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,260
I'm pretty jealous.
I wish I had some sexy glasses.

412
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:13,207
Sadly, as one gets older,
they need glasses to see detail up close.

413
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,008
So I have these glasses and they're
really great glasses.

414
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:18,077
You can snap them together,
snap them apart.

415
00:17:18,181 --> 00:17:20,450
And they're there,
they're not gonna fall.

416
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,824
Oh, I don't know, know, man.

417
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:31,926
Fuck, I don't know.

418
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:33,028
I'm freaking out.

419
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:34,362
I got 30 minutes left,

420
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,196
and I got this shattered mold,

421
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:37,962
and I'm just like, "no."

422
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,531
I really want this extra arm.

423
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,503
I feel like this
is gonna give me the leg up.

424
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,239
So I brush in two nice coats
of latex,

425
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:46,107
kind of slap one
on top the other,

426
00:17:46,175 --> 00:17:48,844
and then duct-tape it all
together so the pieces hold.

427
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,281
I hope it dries overnight

428
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:52,983
and, you know, the next day,
come what may, man.

429
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,252
All right, that's got to work.

430
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:57,025
If it doesn't work, I'm fucked.

431
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,166
Everyone's doing
these amazing creatures.

432
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,636
Wow, that outfit came together.

433
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:08,473
All I got is a human zombie.

434
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,941
I got to amp it up a little bit.

435
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:12,077
I find some rope.

436
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,547
This is gonna be
a quick and easy way

437
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:15,450
to make some intestines.

438
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:17,153
You just look so disgusted.

439
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,454
You're like, "Ew."

440
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,559
All right, guys, that's time.

441
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,291
So by the end of the day,
I'm nervous about tomorrow.

442
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,892
I'm worried about my painting,

443
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,665
and getting all the pieces
applied on time and finished.

444
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,100
'Cause we only have
five hours altogether

445
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:37,566
to finish our piece,

446
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:42,505
and that's not that much time
for a whole character.

447
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:54,018
It's application day.

448
00:18:54,086 --> 00:18:55,352
We have four hours in the lab

449
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,156
to do all of our application
with our models.

450
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,858
Then we have one hour
for last looks.

451
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:02,195
The first thing I do
is I look at my pieces.

452
00:19:02,262 --> 00:19:04,431
And they all turned out
fantastic.

453
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:05,633
I came here
to fight and compete.

454
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,535
And I'm-- Damn it--
I'm gonna compete.

455
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:10,873
I just know I need
to save my rabbit zombie arm.

456
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:19,548
Got more work in here.

457
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:26,121
This is the first time
I've ever done a zombie.

458
00:19:26,188 --> 00:19:29,258
I want my queen to be short,

459
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:32,261
so decide to go with Kevin,
who was shorter.

460
00:19:32,331 --> 00:19:33,933
I hope you're ready
for the mad hatter.

461
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:35,202
I really do.

462
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:36,837
How does it feel?

463
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,040
- I mean, nose and everything?
- It feels good.

464
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,519
I'm not liking
my paint job right now,

465
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:45,522
because it seems a little flat.

466
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,889
So I need to put
some kind of detail for depth.

467
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:55,397
I'm hoping
that having my little extras

468
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:57,401
make this character
over the top

469
00:19:57,469 --> 00:19:58,869
and awesome to look at.

470
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:02,007
Squeeze it.

471
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,839
Yes! It worked.
Oh, my God.

472
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:06,537
It's exactly
what I was thinking.

473
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,205
Like, just these boils--
just, like, infection,

474
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:09,807
just, you know?

475
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,876
Oh! Loving it!
I'm loving it.

476
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,911
It looks cool!

477
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,553
All right.
Let's start this makeup.

478
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,023
I'm feeling so nervous,

479
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,757
and I'm looking around me,

480
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,057
and I'm seeing that everybody

481
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,526
is basically done
applying their makeup.

482
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:30,098
And I'm-- I don't even
have the ears on my thing yet!

483
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:34,068
I'm just staring at this thing
and I'm just baffled

484
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:38,976
on how I'm gonna get this
to work.

485
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:41,079
At this point,
I cannot figure out a way

486
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:42,448
to get these ears to stay up.

487
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:45,252
I don't know how
to get these ears to stay up.

488
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,388
I'm freaking out.

489
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,521
I'm-- I feel like an idiot.

490
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:51,657
I'm just like "how could I not
prepare for this to happen?"

491
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm just like, "don't cry,
don't cry, don't cry."

492
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,361
Just calm down.
Don't panic.

493
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,864
Who do I go to but Roy,
because that's my mold cowboy.

494
00:20:57,932 --> 00:20:59,901
Just turn it inside out.

495
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:01,536
The foam is what's giving it
so much weight,

496
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,373
so Roy helps me
pull the foam out

497
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:04,676
to get this ears to stay up.

498
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:06,613
Or we bend it that away.

499
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:08,549
- Yeah, that'll work.
- Okay.

500
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:12,651
I'd kiss you on the mouth,
but it's very inappropriate.

501
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,454
I can't thank you enough, dude.

502
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:19,754
Sorry, I wont torture you
that much longer.

503
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:21,056
I've got the face applied,

504
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:22,991
and now I'm pinning the skin
over the face,

505
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:25,225
and everything has
just come together on this.

506
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,893
Do me a favor
and open your mouth for me.

507
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,297
You're the prettiest ugliest
thing I've seen in a while.

508
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:32,932
I look up,
and I see Derek's makeup,

509
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,204
and I see how fantastic
he's doing.

510
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:36,605
It's pushing me to go harder.

511
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,874
I'm almost thinking,
"let's not use that."

512
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:43,341
I am nervous about the look
of the overall character,

513
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,810
because with so many
prosthetics,

514
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:50,175
it looks too realistic,
as if he's not wearing anything.

515
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:54,579
And I don't know
if that's gonna hurt or help me.

516
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,881
Look straight ahead.

517
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,883
Laying hair is not something
I normally do,

518
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,382
so with the immunity,
I'd like to just give it a shot

519
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,751
and see what I can do.

520
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,018
If this arm would have
came out like it would,

521
00:22:05,086 --> 00:22:06,184
you'd be able
to slip it on like a glove.

522
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:07,653
That's how I designed it.

523
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,456
My zombie rabbit arm--
of course, it looks like crap.

524
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,623
I'm just wrapping it tight,

525
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,557
and I'm stuffing foam
in some of the bulgier areas.

526
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,625
You know,
old-school bush-league tactics,

527
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:16,560
but you know, when you're put up
against the wall,

528
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:17,928
what are you gonna do?

529
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,663
A rabbit, for me--
this is how I feel all the time.

530
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:23,231
I feel like I'm constantly
running out of time.

531
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:25,400
It really is <i>ripping</i>
her head back.

532
00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:31,073
A real dead body
is pretty colorful.

533
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,407
There's a lot of blues,
there's a lot of purples,

534
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:35,143
there's a lot of green, yellow.

535
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:40,014
And I'm painting and it's not
looking like what I'm picturing.

536
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:42,517
Oh, please make me be able
to do the detail in time.

537
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:45,020
- What's the time?
- Five minutes.

538
00:22:45,088 --> 00:22:47,322
Thank you.

539
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,055
- I'm excited.
- Is that yours?

540
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:50,455
Fits better?

541
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:55,024
I'm now freaking out.

542
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:56,893
That's time, everybody.

543
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,295
I've got a lot of work
for the last hour.

544
00:22:59,363 --> 00:23:02,363
I have to do all these veins
that I haven't touched yet,

545
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:04,231
because I'm not sure what color
to put on them.

546
00:23:04,298 --> 00:23:06,464
There's just a lot of things

547
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,432
that aren't clicking
in this paint job,

548
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,501
and I'm really concerned.

549
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,001
Coming up...

550
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:15,304
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

551
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:17,307
I'm feeling like I could be
one of the bottom looks.

552
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,775
A bit of a mess.

553
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:21,746
I'm just mesmerized
by the look of this makeup.

554
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,024
We have one hour of last looks,

555
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:35,028
and we got to get everything
done as fast as we can.

556
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:37,561
Oh, my God. All right.
I'm just gonna start painting.

557
00:23:40,197 --> 00:23:42,097
My airbrush is broken.

558
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:44,801
Plan "B" is
to just paint by hand,

559
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:48,573
which is gonna take
so much more time.

560
00:23:48,641 --> 00:23:50,043
All right guys,
that's ten minutes.

561
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:52,580
We got ten minutes.

562
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,683
My paint it getting darker
and darker.

563
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:56,318
I made a lot
of wrong color choices.

564
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:59,288
Fuck!

565
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:04,996
And that's time, everyone.

566
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,733
Brushes down.

567
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:09,271
Everybody's look so good,

568
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:10,906
and I'm a little worried
at this point.

569
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:13,345
Everything went wrong,

570
00:24:13,413 --> 00:24:17,487
and I ran out of time.

571
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:26,900
♪

572
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:30,102
Welcome to
the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

573
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:33,137
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

574
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,339
First let's say hello
to your judges.

575
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,607
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

576
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:40,677
- Good evening.
- Hey.

577
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,680
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

578
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,612
Hi guys.

579
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,778
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

580
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:47,310
Hello.

581
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:49,749
And joining our panel
this week,

582
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:51,754
writer, producer, and director,

583
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:54,188
with films like <i>Event Horizon,</i>

584
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:56,190
<i>Death Race,</i>
<i>Alien Vs. Predator,</i>

585
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:59,127
and, most recently,
<i>The Three Musketeers.</i>

586
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:02,992
He's also written and produced
all the <i>Resident Evil</i> films.

587
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,160
The newest addition
to the franchise,

588
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:06,294
<i>Resident Evil, Retribution,</i>

589
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:08,896
which he also directed,
comes out this Friday.

590
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:14,803
Please welcome
Paul WS Anderson.

591
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:16,838
It's really cool
to have Paul WS Anderson here

592
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:18,207
to judge our zombie makeups.

593
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:19,777
I'm hoping that when he looks
at my piece,

594
00:25:19,844 --> 00:25:21,645
he sees
that <i>Resident Evil</i> quality.

595
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:23,413
Paul, thank you so much
for joining us.

596
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,281
It's my pleasure to be here
with so many talented people.

597
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,316
Okay, guys.

598
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:30,885
So your spotlight challenge this
week was an original take

599
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:32,788
on one
of the classic characters

600
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:35,792
from <i>Alice's Adventures</i>
<i>in Wonderland,</i> as a zombie.

601
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,260
Let's see what you come up with.

602
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:48,972
♪

603
00:26:03,182 --> 00:26:04,816
I still don't think I've got
a chance at the top.

604
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:08,151
I think my cat's too generic.

605
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,065
I feel good at this point, but
I've been feeling good all day.

606
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:34,667
It's just a nice feeling
to know that I'm safe.

607
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:56,592
Under the lights on the stage,

608
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,190
it's looking
really, really, really dark,

609
00:26:59,258 --> 00:27:01,993
and I'm noticing a bunch
of flaws.

610
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,317
I think I put
too much blood on him.

611
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:25,085
I'm worried that maybe they're
not gonna see all the details

612
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:27,756
as well as I hoped.

613
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,610
I see my creature come out,

614
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:47,612
and it looks
like a hillbilly rabbit.

615
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,747
I should have taken a step back
and looked at it as one piece,

616
00:27:49,814 --> 00:27:53,414
but I was so into it,
I got blinded.

617
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:16,429
Everybody else's looks
so much more developed.

618
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:19,965
I'm feeling like I could be
one of the bottom looks.

619
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,190
I'm feeling really good
about this makeup.

620
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:42,424
It's probably one
of the best ones that I've done

621
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:43,626
since I've been here.

622
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:46,629
I'm really, really pleased
with it.

623
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:08,585
It's definitely different from
what other people have created.

624
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:11,823
I'm thinking,
"that's not too bad."

625
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:36,646
My makeup walks out,
and I am thrilled.

626
00:29:36,714 --> 00:29:39,681
If I go home, I will go home
with my head held up high.

627
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:47,018
Well, judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

628
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:57,588
Wow, this is colorful.

629
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:05,431
Ah, thank you.

630
00:30:05,498 --> 00:30:09,303
- Nice brain.
- Thank you.

631
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:10,838
Mouth open and close?

632
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:12,107
Mm-mm.

633
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,176
- It doesn't open at all?
- Mm-mm.

634
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:16,845
Okay, thanks.

635
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:24,325
Tilt your head
all the way back, please.

636
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:48,213
I like the top half of it.

637
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,247
And from the bottom down,

638
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:51,782
I screwed up really bad.

639
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,419
That's gonna put me
at the bottom.

640
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,059
We want to know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

641
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:01,896
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

642
00:31:06,225 --> 00:31:07,258
I know it's bad.

643
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:08,326
I'm just hoping
that my concept,

644
00:31:08,394 --> 00:31:10,895
at this point,
is gonna save me.

645
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:12,797
Shoulder pad?

646
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:14,866
- It's creeping me out.
- Yeah.

647
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:17,300
I know.
I still love it.

648
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:22,372
I'm really confident
that I'm at least safe.

649
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,311
Open and close your moth.

650
00:31:26,379 --> 00:31:28,714
Can you turn profile for us?

651
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,217
Don't pull on those ears.

652
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:31,587
Those things are put together

653
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:34,621
with latex, a lick,
and a promise.

654
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:39,361
Paul, what were your thoughts?

655
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:40,728
How do you think they did?

656
00:31:40,796 --> 00:31:42,296
There was a lot of creativity
that went into it.

657
00:31:42,364 --> 00:31:44,966
And to see how many great ideas
there are here,

658
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,168
I was really impressed.

659
00:31:46,236 --> 00:31:47,736
Thank you.

660
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:50,805
All right, well, the judges
have scored your creations,

661
00:31:50,873 --> 00:31:52,674
so let's find out
what they thought.

662
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:57,848
Sarah, Jason, and Alana...

663
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:00,151
You are safe.

664
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,386
Thank you so much, guys.

665
00:32:01,454 --> 00:32:06,224
Please head back
to the makeup room.

666
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,493
So that means the rest of you

667
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,928
were the best
and the worst looks of the week.

668
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:14,365
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

669
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,399
to learn more about your work.

670
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:18,332
Tommy, you're up first.

671
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:24,907
Tommy, give us a background

672
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:26,108
on the ideas
you were working with here.

673
00:32:26,176 --> 00:32:27,944
Well, my concept was

674
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,779
the infection is running
through his body.

675
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:30,815
He can see that different stages
are happening

676
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,018
at different times,

677
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:33,254
so he puts
all these wristwatches on.

678
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:35,156
While those watches
are still ticking,

679
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:37,557
he's running through the city,
and he's taking out zombies.

680
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,825
And what we have here is

681
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,394
finally the last watch ran out,

682
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:43,497
and he quite literally
ran out of time.

683
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:44,766
It seems like there's some
cool ideas in there.

684
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:47,137
I can't see them.

685
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:48,773
I don't know what's happening,

686
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,741
because you've just kind of got
that loathsome device

687
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:53,877
known as fun, fur, and gore.

688
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:57,083
I love all the concepts
behind your creation.

689
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:59,751
And, I've got to say,
I love the top 15% of it,

690
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,750
which is the head.

691
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:04,618
I just wish the rest
of your creation kind of matched

692
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,487
what you've done
with the-- with the head.

693
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:09,690
His left eye
is such a big feature,

694
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:12,923
but there's not enough gloss
to make it stand out.

695
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,324
It's a bit of a mess.

696
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:19,298
What the heck is he wearing,
and why?

697
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:23,398
That is the most distracting,
God-awful crap I've ever seen.

698
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:24,966
Um, well, in the storybook,

699
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,568
he has got, like,
that tweed jacket.

700
00:33:26,635 --> 00:33:28,772
- Dude, that is not tweed.
- Oh.

701
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,540
That is a bloody flannel shirt.

702
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,373
Tommy, thank you.

703
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:33,840
You can step back.

704
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:40,344
Laura.

705
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,713
So, Laura,

706
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,715
tell us about your
thought process behind this.

707
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:50,848
He's a zombie but he still has
that memory of being a hatter,

708
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:52,116
so he uses his intestine

709
00:33:52,184 --> 00:33:55,386
as a measuring stick
to measure the hats.

710
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:57,354
Nice.

711
00:33:57,422 --> 00:33:59,790
One of the things I love about
him is there's a real unity.

712
00:33:59,858 --> 00:34:02,958
The color pallet
is all very unified,

713
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,661
which, I think,
is very, very strong.

714
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:07,097
I think
he's a wonderful creation.

715
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:08,866
- Thank you.
- I love it.

716
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:11,102
I love the fact
that it's sympathetic,

717
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,404
and it's locked in this echo
of the human emotions,

718
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:14,338
and it makes it
more frightening.

719
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:15,339
Well done.

720
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,942
Yes. Thank you.

721
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,845
Laura, please step back.

722
00:34:20,913 --> 00:34:23,917
Roy.

723
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:29,955
Tell us about the inspiration

724
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:32,125
behind this character
you've created.

725
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:34,459
Uh, the inspiration
is that this is the queen,

726
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:35,926
and she's been infected
with the virus,

727
00:34:35,994 --> 00:34:37,293
and so she's starting to mutate.

728
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:40,028
And her skin is making her
into the queen,

729
00:34:40,096 --> 00:34:41,596
so she's forming the crown
out of her skin,

730
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:45,297
and all of her clothing
is starting to just rip away

731
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:48,668
and pull and bend and twist
into-- into her wardrobe.

732
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:50,371
I'm just mesmerized

733
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,638
by the look of this makeup
that you did.

734
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:54,770
- Really beautifully done.
- Thank you very much.

735
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:56,070
If I was making a movie,

736
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,071
I'd be delighted
to see a design like this.

737
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,871
But also, I'd be expecting

738
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:02,042
a team of like six or seven
people to execute it.

739
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:04,378
I think it's quite remarkable.

740
00:35:04,446 --> 00:35:05,846
Roy, the fact
that you've created the design

741
00:35:05,913 --> 00:35:09,480
on the top of the head
that is so regal and elegant

742
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:12,383
is my absolute favorite thing
about this makeup.

743
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,718
Well done.

744
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:16,719
Roy, thank you very much.
You can step back.

745
00:35:16,787 --> 00:35:18,420
Thank you.

746
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:23,689
Nicole, you're up.

747
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:28,125
Give us a brief description
of the concept.

748
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:31,025
I wanted to play off
the eat me, drink me.

749
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:33,361
I wanted this vial
to be the infection,

750
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:37,063
and then she's
now eating the rabbit.

751
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:38,564
I like the ideas,

752
00:35:38,632 --> 00:35:43,402
but it's the paintwork
that really makes it go flat.

753
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,004
She just disappears.

754
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:47,038
I don't know
what would have possessed you

755
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:48,807
to make her face all dark.

756
00:35:48,874 --> 00:35:50,507
Even if your veins went south,

757
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:52,109
you could have painted
the veins on by hand.

758
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:55,078
I applaud the ambition
of the pulsing boils,

759
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:58,215
but that stuff is really
difficult to get right.

760
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,114
You know, maybe just
a bit too ambitious

761
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:02,418
for the time that you had.

762
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:03,652
Nicole, thank you.

763
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,957
Will you please step back?

764
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:11,891
Derek.

765
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,935
I got to tell you,
when he first walked out,

766
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:21,436
I thought he made
a pink cat, own criminy."

767
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:25,409
And then I got up close.

768
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,078
And it's pretty cool.

769
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,048
I mean, the asymmetry is great.

770
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:32,785
The whiskers on one side,
the teeth on the other.

771
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:34,653
He's morphed, he's gross,

772
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:37,758
he's very colorful--
I got to give it--

773
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:40,396
but the cheshire cat was purple,
so there you go.

774
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:41,930
I'm not sure what it is,

775
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:44,631
but there's something about that
shirt color that I really like.

776
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:51,101
The mouth on the left side
is fantastic.

777
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:52,901
I love this design.

778
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,902
It encapsulates the world
of mutation in <i>Resident Evil.</i>

779
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,606
I love how asymmetrical
the whole design is,

780
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:58,908
which I think is really fresh.

781
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:00,242
Cool, thank you.
Appreciate it.

782
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,145
Derek, thank you so much.

783
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:04,917
Will you please step back?

784
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:07,919
Rod, please step forward.

785
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,396
Rod, give us the backstory
to your character here.

786
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:16,062
The virus
that she's infected with

787
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,266
has hyper-accelerated
her metabolism.

788
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,804
Because of that, her skin goes
from full-sized to shriveled

789
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,104
and back and forth.

790
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,839
And that's what all the texture
has come from.

791
00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:26,539
I'm having a hard time

792
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:32,148
finding the driving forces
propelling this design.

793
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,550
I don't really understand
the color choice

794
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:37,356
that you made
by giving her this skin color.

795
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:40,358
It's not really rotten
and it's not really dead,

796
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,960
and it's just kind of
an odd color choice.

797
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,860
And I think, for me, you just
kind of missed the mark on it.

798
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:47,232
What I don't find at all

799
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,635
is a zombie infected
with the virus.

800
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:50,638
You've missed the point
of the whole challenge.

801
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:53,440
Rod, thank you very much.

802
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:54,808
- Thank you, thank you.
- Please step back.

803
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:01,143
Okay, well, the judges have
heard what you have to say.

804
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:02,544
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

805
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:05,982
while they make their decisions.

806
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:09,653
All right guys,

807
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,755
so let's start with the looks
that you like the most.

808
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:13,125
Why don't we start with Roy.

809
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:15,294
I really dug that makeup.

810
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,031
You know, with the right
lighting and a little gloss,

811
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:20,369
that thing could be
amazing-looking just as it is.

812
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:21,737
It really captured

813
00:38:21,805 --> 00:38:23,205
what I think is great
about <i>Resident Evil,</i>

814
00:38:23,272 --> 00:38:24,640
which is the kind of
mutation aspect of it.

815
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:28,613
Okay, let's move on
to Laura's makeup.

816
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,815
There are no gaps between
the coloring of her makeup,

817
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,050
the wardrobe choices,
even the concept.

818
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:36,052
Very, very solid
all the way through.

819
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,320
Very well executed.

820
00:38:37,388 --> 00:38:38,454
All right, let's move on
to Derek.

821
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:42,526
It was really, really good.

822
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:43,561
I loved the mask.

823
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:45,163
I loved the asymmetry of it.

824
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:46,463
When we got up close to it,

825
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:48,431
you really could see the detail
a lot better.

826
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:50,866
All right,
so why don't we move on

827
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:52,434
to the looks
that you liked the least.

828
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:53,836
Let's start with Tommy.

829
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:56,844
It looks like even
that one big bulging eye

830
00:38:56,912 --> 00:38:58,747
just sort of got lost
in the makeup.

831
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,150
I was disappointed
with the design.

832
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:01,752
It felt very thrown-together.

833
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,854
All right,
let's move on to Nicole.

834
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:05,189
I can't believe that she would

835
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:08,226
just paint the face
charcoal gray.

836
00:39:08,294 --> 00:39:10,796
The boils
that looked like brains,

837
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:12,464
you know, it just looked
like bad brains.

838
00:39:12,532 --> 00:39:13,565
Yeah.

839
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,868
All right, let's move on
to Rod.

840
00:39:15,935 --> 00:39:17,669
This bums me out so much.

841
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:22,409
For me that makeup looked like
a very bizarre old-age makeup.

842
00:39:22,477 --> 00:39:24,946
It has nothing
to do with <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

843
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:26,482
And then it has nothing
to do with zombies.

844
00:39:26,549 --> 00:39:27,716
- Right.
- Like drinking blood.

845
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,018
That's more kind of vampiric.

846
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:31,089
Okay, judges,
have you made your decisions?

847
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:31,958
- I think so.
- We have.

848
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:33,026
Yes.

849
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:34,127
Let's bring them back out.

850
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:43,674
♪

851
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:46,344
all right, Glenn, why don't you
tell us about the top looks?

852
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:48,915
This week our top looks are...

853
00:39:48,983 --> 00:39:50,283
Roy...

854
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:53,286
We loved
your hyper-stylized queen,

855
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:54,788
and we thought
that you accomplished

856
00:39:54,856 --> 00:39:57,660
an absolutely amazing amount of
work in the time that you had.

857
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,430
Thank you.

858
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,698
Laura...

859
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,035
You made some really interesting
sculptural choices,

860
00:40:04,103 --> 00:40:05,939
and you really managed
to create

861
00:40:06,006 --> 00:40:09,142
this feeling of sympathy
with your character.

862
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:10,876
Derek...

863
00:40:10,943 --> 00:40:13,811
Your design really captured
the spirit of this challenge.

864
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,912
And your asymmetrical approach
to your design

865
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,615
left a big impression on us.

866
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,517
Paul, why don't you do
the honors tonight,

867
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,217
and tell us who the winner
of this challenge is?

868
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:27,186
The winner is...

869
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,084
Paul, why don't you do
the honors tonight,

870
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:36,987
and tell us who the winner
of this challenge is?

871
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:41,691
The winner is...

872
00:40:41,759 --> 00:40:42,791
Roy.

873
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:44,859
Thank you very much.

874
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,561
Thank you.

875
00:40:46,629 --> 00:40:48,329
This is the best moment
I've had on the show,

876
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:51,598
because this is me individually
with a win, finally.

877
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:53,501
Roy, congratulations.

878
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:55,905
You can head back
to the makeup room.

879
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:57,573
Laura and Derek,
you are also safe.

880
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:02,781
Please head back
to the makeup room.

881
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,214
Unfortunately, that means

882
00:41:04,282 --> 00:41:06,449
the three of you were
on the bottom this week,

883
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:08,020
and one of you
will be eliminated.

884
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:12,824
Nicole, Tommy, Rod...

885
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:14,825
If you'd please step
to the center.

886
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:22,469
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about the bottom looks?

887
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:25,172
Tommy, I think you might
have had some good ideas,

888
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,140
but it's just impossible
to see any of them.

889
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:31,547
Nicole, there is
just too many things

890
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,149
that went wrong
for you tonight,

891
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:35,319
in particular, your paint job.

892
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:38,358
Rod, it didn't read as a zombie,

893
00:41:38,426 --> 00:41:41,862
and we were just confused.

894
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:45,999
All right, Glenn,
who's going home tonight?

895
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:49,638
The person going home
tonight is...

896
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,608
Nicole.

897
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:58,777
Ultimately, we felt
that there were so many ways

898
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:02,781
that you could have saved
your makeup.

899
00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:04,182
The rest of you are safe
this week,

900
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,182
and can head back
to the makeup room.

901
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,086
Thank you.

902
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:15,726
Nicole, we can tell

903
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:17,294
that you have a great passion
for your craft.

904
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:19,296
Just keep plugging away,
you'll get there.

905
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:21,364
I will.
Thank you.

906
00:42:21,432 --> 00:42:23,767
Nicole, it's been really great
having you here with us.

907
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:26,237
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room,

908
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:27,505
and pack up your kit.

909
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:30,306
Thank you guys.

910
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:37,278
Hi.

911
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:39,846
- Me.
- No.

912
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,353
A lot of people go through life

913
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,253
and never find what they love
to do,

914
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:47,090
and I'm a lucky person
that's found that.

915
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,462
Makeup is my soul.

916
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,000
It's what I live for.
