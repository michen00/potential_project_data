00:00:01,497 --> 00:00:03,298
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,666
In a monster-sized twist,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,302
the eliminated contestants
return for a shot at redemption.

4
00:00:07,336 --> 00:00:09,938
And Nicole fought her way
back into the competition.

5
00:00:09,972 --> 00:00:12,807
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:14,643
In the spotlight challenge,
Laura's makeup

7
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,578
took her to the top.

8
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:18,780
And Rod was sent home.

9
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:21,449
Now only six artists remain.

10
00:00:21,484 --> 00:00:23,151
Tonight they will
reinvent characters

11
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,953
from a legendary artist.

12
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:28,923
Your challenge this week
is based on a true classic.

13
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,191
Awesome!

14
00:00:30,226 --> 00:00:32,260
And get judged
by a titan of Tinsel Town.

15
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:33,762
Oh, my God!

16
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:35,463
This is the biggest person
we've ever had on <i>Face Off.</i>

17
00:00:35,498 --> 00:00:37,766
Dude, I'm just
not a happy camper.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,735
This will be the one
that sends me home.

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,339
I have a lot to prove because
I got pulled back from the dead.

20
00:00:44,373 --> 00:00:46,074
I'm just, like,
totally in turmoil.

21
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:48,743
I feel like such an idiot.

22
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:52,280
Your paint application
is a morbid failure.

23
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:56,451
Something about this
makes me smile.

24
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,720
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

25
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:01,756
to be a guest lecturer
at Makeup Forever's academies

26
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,025
in New York and Paris.

27
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,596
A new 2012 Toyota Prius V
and $100,000.

28
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,665
And for the first time ever,

29
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,600
America, your voice
will be heard

30
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:14,002
in selecting the winner.

31
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:17,505
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

32

33
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:03,852
I wake up in the morning
and I just feel horrible.

34
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:07,789
I'm bummed to go into this day
without having Rod around.

35
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:08,790
Morning!

36
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,458
Girl.

37
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:11,826
What's up?

38
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:14,729
Alana's really sad.
Her best friend Rod is gone.

39
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:15,797
I'm concerned about her.

40
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,466
It just tore me up, you know?

41
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,601
Yeah.

44
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:23,938
I think that without Rod,
she's really confused

45
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:26,808
on how she's gonna do this
and it's all up to her now.

46
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,443
Come on, get up.
Let's go!

47
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:30,345
I don't wanna get up yet.

48
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,580
Get up, sleepyhead!
Let's go to work!

49
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:34,949
I'm just feeling
a little sour apples.

50
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:37,786
I miss my friend.

51
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,634
We are on
the Universal back lot.

52
00:02:52,668 --> 00:02:55,236
Which is so awesome,
I've never been here before.

53
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:56,604
Oh, cool!

54
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,806
We come walking
around the corner

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,807
and there's snow on the ground.

56
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,875
Okay, so what is this place?

57
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm freaking out
with excitement because

58
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:07,982
this is where
movie magic happens.

59
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:09,284
There's these two cars.

60
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:11,119
There's these crazy houses
with snow all over them.

61
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:14,322
And there's McKenzie.

62
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:16,424
Welcome to the set of Whoville,

63
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,593
on the Universal
Studios backlit.

64
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,228
- Awesome!
- Oh, my gosh.

65
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:22,430
This is one
of the many elaborate sets

66
00:03:22,465 --> 00:03:25,400
used in the film,
<i>How The Grinch Stole Christmas.</i>

67
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,535
So for generations
the rhythmic words

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,405
and imaginative characters
of Dr. Seuss have been adapted

69
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,042
into numerous TV shows,
musicals and films.

70
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:37,212
Including <i>The Cat In The Hat</i>
and <i>The Lorax.</i>

71
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:39,747
So in honor
of its 50th anniversary,

72
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:43,918
your challenge this week
is based on a true classic.

73
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:46,087
<i>Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book.</i>

74
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,422
- That's cool.
- Yeah!

75
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,257
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

76
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,925
- Whoo!
- I'm excited.

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,361
<i>Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book</i>
is about how they go to sleep.

78
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:54,963
It's just a really
good bedtime story.

79
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:57,332
Dr. Seuss had a knack
for making creatures

80
00:03:57,366 --> 00:04:00,368
that have an almost
human-like quality to them.

81
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:02,637
With that in mind,
your spotlight challenge

82
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:05,773
is to select a character
from the Sleep Book

83
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:09,911
and use it to inspire
an original human-hybrid makeup

84
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,447
that captures
the essence of Dr. Seuss.

85
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,682
- Awesome.
- I love Dr. Seuss.

86
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,017
I can't think
of any other artist

87
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,686
that has such
a definitive style.

88
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,388
So right now
I would like to introduce

89
00:04:20,422 --> 00:04:22,957
a very special guest
who definitely knows

90
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:26,628
a thing or two about
making a classic character.

91
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:29,898
He's an academy award-winning
producer for <i>A Beautiful Mind,</i>

92
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:32,367
has been nominated
for Apollo 13,

93
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:36,237
Frost/Nixon and Splash,
which he also co-wrote.

94
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:40,375
In total, he has produced
over 100 films.

95
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,376
Wow.

96
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,244
Please welcome
Mr. Brian Grazer.

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,548
Yay! Oh, my gosh!

98
00:04:46,582 --> 00:04:48,650
Oh, my God!

99
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:51,786
Brian Grazer.
He's won an Oscar.

100
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,321
Wow. This is probably
the biggest person

101
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:54,889
we've ever had
in <i>Face Off</i> history.

102
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:55,890
Hi.

103
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:56,991
Thank you so much
for being here.

104
00:04:57,026 --> 00:04:58,026
Thanks for having me.

105
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,761
You have made
so many great films,

106
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:01,296
including <i>Dr. Seuss's</i>
<i>The Cat In The Hat,</i>

107
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,697
<i>The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.</i>

108
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:05,833
So tell us, how were you
able to make it so successful?

109
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:08,369
To take Dr. Seuss's
imaginative characters

110
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:10,638
from the page and then
translate it to a screen?

111
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:14,108
Well, you want to feel
the reality and the truth

112
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:15,543
of the actor.

113
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:18,379
And so to do that the makeup
has to feel seamless and real

114
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,982
so that you're not distracted
by makeup that feels

115
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,817
in any way artificial.

116
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:24,319
Brian gives us
some great advice,

117
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:26,421
'cause as a producer
he has to look at all makeup's

118
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:29,257
and pretty much every aspect
of the films that he works on.

119
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,559
So he's somebody
at you want to listen to.

120
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:33,328
Okay, so what
you guys don't know

121
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:35,563
is that Brian is not
just a guest here today,

122
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:36,965
he's actually
going to be joining us

123
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:40,802
on the reveal stage to take
a look at your final creations.

124
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,070
Oh, wow.

125
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:44,205
All right, so displayed
behind me are the names

126
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:47,709
of eight characters
from <i>Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book.</i>

127
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,677
Each of you will get
to select one from which

128
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:51,913
to base your designs on.

129
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:53,982
Nicole, you get to pick first.

130
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:56,517
I really just like the sound
of Bumble-Tub.

131
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:57,552
So I grabbed Bumble-Tub.

132
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,154
Ian and I always go,
"Oof! Oof!"

133
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:01,422
- There you go.
- So Oof!

134
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:02,557
I don't know
what Alana's thinking.

135
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:05,026
She picks the only one
up there that has

136
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,461
nothing recognizable about it.

137
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:08,496
'Cause that's something
that her and her boyfriend say,

138
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,199
that's not a good enough reason
to pick a character for makeup.

139
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,601
Chippendale Mupp.

140
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:15,637
Foona-Lagoona Baboona.

141
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,271
The Hinkle-Horn Honker.

142
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:18,473
I think it just
sounds kind of fun.

143
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:19,574
I don't know
what it's gonna be.

144
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,175
Last but not least.

145
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,443
Snorter McPhail's
still on the board

146
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:24,178
and that's the one I pick.

147
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:29,183
So, cool, I'm excited to see
what this character looks like.

148
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:31,419
All right, guys, it is time
to get started on your designs

149
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,855
so grab a sketchpad
and get started.

150
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,824
I will see you all soon.

151
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,563
The challenge is to not only
create a Seuss character,

152
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:44,232
but it has to be
a human-hybrid character.

153
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,601
So the first thing obviously
is I need to figure out

154
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:49,570
what my character looks like.

155
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,406
I find out
the Hinkle-Horn Honkers

156
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,042
are these little yellow guys
with crazy hair, in beds,

157
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,077
and they are horn players.

158
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,713
I really like that they've
got long noses, big smiles,

159
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:01,449
and I can do some
really fun hair work.

160
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,351
I'm looking through the book
and Snorter McPhail

161
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:07,355
is a conductor
of snores that make music.

162
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,458
He has long ears,
so my idea is to do a hairstyle

163
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:12,794
with the hair long
like the ears.

164
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:15,463
And the nose, I'm gonna
make kind of like the Who nose

165
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:17,098
but more human-looking.

166
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:20,401
But still have that
pointy upward look to it.

167
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:23,905
My character is Bumble-Tub.

168
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,973
He sits in this little crate
and he floats down the river

169
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:27,709
with his sleep crew.

170
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,577
So there's Sleepy.

171
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,612
I'm sketching curly-Q's
on his head.

172
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:33,081
And then I want them to be big.

173
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,583
I wanna have this big belly,
these crazy fingers,

174
00:07:35,617 --> 00:07:37,318
and lots of curly stuff.

175
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:38,720
I'm not really sure
how I'm gonna do this,

176
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:43,324
but it looks cool on paper.

177
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:44,892
I'm flipping through the book
and I'm flipping, I'm flipping.

178
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:47,995
I finally find my character.

179
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,266
And it looks like
a cotton ball puff monster.

180
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:56,904
There's really no detail at all.
It doesn't look like any animal.

181
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,541
Everyone else has characters
that resemble a dog or a dragon

182
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:02,210
or a chimp.

183
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:05,413
And I got this
cotton ball monster.

184
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:12,086
I got the
Foona-Lagoona-Baboona.

185
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,355
This is the picture and
I'm basically just thinking,

186
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,191
like, chimp that's
swinging from tree to tree.

187
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:19,160
I decided to go with
my character-- more human,

188
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,695
more realistic ape.

189
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,029
'Cause a human-hybrid
with Dr. Seuss

190
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:23,965
could be, like, what
the Grinch looks like.

191
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:25,833
Or it can be more human
than the Grinch.

192
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:28,336
So that's where
my concept's going.

193
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,037
Oh, your character looks cool.

194
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:32,240
Mine has a giant tail.

195
00:08:32,274 --> 00:08:34,108
My character
is the Chippendale Mupp

196
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:37,078
and he'll bite his tail
right before he goes to sleep

197
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:38,913
and then about eight
or nine hours later,

198
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:40,915
he'll wake up again
and go, "ow!"

199
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:45,486
It's either gonna look cartoony
or really, really weird.

200
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,455
Everybody's doing amazing stuff

201
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:48,523
so it's gonna be hard.

202
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:51,392
It's anybody's game, I think.

203
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:01,102
We get back to the lab
and choose our models.

204
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,407
Immediately start sculpting.

205
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,043
I'm trying to get the nose
to look more human

206
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:11,312
and make it look real.

207
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:13,014
Oh, God.

208
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:14,916
- How would you do this bitch?
- Uh...

209
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,318
I'm miserable.

210
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:20,822
I have no feeling of inspiration
from this particular character.

211
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:23,257
I don't want
to do a big fur suit.

212
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,126
I just don't want
to say anything

213
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,427
and then the judges
not like it, you know?

214
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:27,728
I know, I just
want your advice.

215
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:28,863
I'm not gonna
be saying it--

216
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:30,198
'Cause really I'm just so lost.

217
00:09:30,232 --> 00:09:31,899
You're really good
at this stuff.

218
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,434
I'm lost.

219
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:35,303
I think Alana
is worried about going home.

220
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:37,772
I'm thinking about doing,
like, a chubby girl.

221
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:40,174
Big head with this tail
on the top.

222
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,742
You could do that.

223
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,578
It doesn't seem like she has
a clue what she's gonna do.

224
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,846
Thank you.

225
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,548
I mean, I-- honestly,
I mean-- I don't know.

226
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:50,952
- Hi.
- What?

227
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:51,953
- Hi.
- Hello?

228
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,521
- Huh?
- Hey.

229
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:54,956
Since Nicole's been back
we've really started connecting.

230
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,357
She's a really cool chick.

231
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:57,425
I'm just glad I'm getting
to know her better.

232
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,426
- This is fun.
- Mm-hm.

233
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,527
I like this one.

234
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:00,661
I'm taking what
Brian Grazer said

235
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:02,063
and I'm using my model

236
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:04,031
and I'm going with the forms
of his face.

237
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,766
And I'm sculpting that out.

238
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:06,801
It's really looking
like something

239
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:07,969
that would happen naturally.

240
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:11,572
If he was turning into
a Seuss character.

241
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,775
You having fun, Laura?

242
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,745
My concept for
the Chippendale Mupp

243
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,413
human-hybrid...

244
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:21,883
it's a mix
of interesting genres.

245
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,084
And I thought, oh!

246
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:26,053
Dr. Moreau. Dr. Seuss.
That might be cool.

247
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:29,290
A little realistic
Dr. Moreau route

248
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:34,762
while still keeping
to the Dr. Seuss world.

249
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:36,931
Can I ask you what
you're doing for your costume?

250
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:39,433
- I am doing--
- Are you making him furry?

251
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:40,434
This.

252
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,370
Yeah.

253
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,272
Yours is more like
a pajamas, huh?

254
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:46,040
He is kind of but I don't know
if I want him in pajamas.

255
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:47,341
Pajamas would be cute.

256
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:49,277
'Cause this is a whole
sleepy, bedtime book.

257
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:50,278
Good idea.
Good. You're right.

258
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,580
You know?

259
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:54,882
- Hey, Roy.
- I'm just not a happy camper.

260
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:56,517
I'm trying to make sure
it doesn't look like the Grinch

261
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,752
but I can't really remember

262
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:59,153
what the Grinch
looks like either.

263
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:00,154
And that's looking
more and more like the Grinch.

264
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:01,389
- Really?
- Yeah.

265
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,990
Hold on, I'm trying
to figure it out.

266
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,158
This will be the one
that sends me home

267
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:07,161
because it has a big,
Grinchy grin on it.

268
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,934
I see everybody
knowing what direction

269
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:14,402
they want to take,
getting inspired.

270
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:15,736
How's it coming?

271
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:17,838
I'm just, like,
totally in turmoil right now.

272
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:19,507
I just wanna cry my eyes out.

273
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,208
I feel like such an idiot.

274
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:22,543
I don't know how
to make this work.

275
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,578
I just want to do
a great makeup and it's, like,

276
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:26,847
this huge chicken
with a mask on.

277
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:28,616
That's, like,
the number one thing.

278
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,917
- Alana, Alana--
- I, like, never want to do now.

279
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:31,285
I'm going home.

280
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,720
Like, I'm just so freakin'
defeated right now.

281
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:35,756
Coming up...

282
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,558
I'm gonna
paint it mustardy yellow

283
00:11:37,592 --> 00:11:38,693
and then hints of brown.

284
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,494
But we're back
into that fun fur zone,

285
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:41,495
which is unfortunate.

286
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,331
Please welcome
Oscar-winning producer,

287
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:44,465
Brian Grazer.

288
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:47,668
I don't feel
the Seussian heartbeat.

289
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:49,704
Something about this
makes me smile.

290
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,596
Today is the first day
of our Dr. Seuss challenge.

291
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,198
And I'm a mess right now.

292
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,732
I just want
to do a great makeup--

293
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,034
- But here's-- listen.
- And it's, like, this huge...

294
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,469
- Okay.
- ...chicken.

295
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,270
Take a deep breath.

296
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:06,538
Use what you like to do,

297
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:08,340
which is use
the person's face, right?

298
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:09,641
Use that.

299
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:12,044
I'm still feeling
like I'm in trouble,

300
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,345
but I don't feel alone.

301
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,949
Give me a Sarah hug.

302
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:21,420
- That is too cool.
- Why, thank you.

303
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:22,721
It's looking more and more
like the Grinch.

304
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,022
I gotta change it.

305
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,757
I don't think it looks
anything like the Grinch.

306
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,293
Especially the eyes
and everything.

307
00:12:28,328 --> 00:12:29,661
The most important part
is the face.

308
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:32,698
So hearing Nicole say that
gives me a lot of encouragement.

309
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,737
What you making with the wire?

310
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,706
- I wanna make his wand.
- Ah.

311
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,808
Kind of all swirly
like Dr. Seuss.

312
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,376
I'm gonna do some fabrication

313
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,080
'cause I want to get my makeup
detailed as much as possible.

314
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:50,482
I want to do a huge belly.

315
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,417
So it can be,
like, a human belly

316
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:56,121
but in the shape
of a Dr. Seuss character.

317
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:57,122
Five minutes.

318
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:58,223
By the end of the day,

319
00:12:58,258 --> 00:12:59,458
I'm actually
in pretty good shape.

320
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:00,826
'Cause I've got
my face sculpted

321
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,262
and I actually have my body
halfway sculpted.

322
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,865
So tomorrow I'll just
be making the mold.

323
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:09,735
All right, that's it.

324
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:11,370
Let's go home.

325
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:14,072
I really have
so much work to do tomorrow.

326
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:16,642
So I really need to keep
my eyes on the prize here

327
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,912
and stay focused.

328
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:25,951
Good luck.

329
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,653
It's day two,
I've got ten hours.

330
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,989
In this challenge I have
to be top or, better yet, win.

331
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:32,891
And I cannot be bottom.

332
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:35,861
If I'm bottom,
I might as well leave.

333
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,702
I'm definitely going
for a more realistic sculpt.

334
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,971
So I find pictures of primates.

335
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,807
I'm gonna try to combine it
with the nose of a lion

336
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:51,577
and do the mouth
of an older person.

337
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,011
So this creature's
just a hodgepodge

338
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,948
of many different elements.

339
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:57,683
- Need help with that?
- Yeah.

340
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,084
Come on, then.
Great.

341
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:02,187
So this torso belly
is a really big piece.

342
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:05,857
I mean, I've got 250 pounds
of wet clay on it.

343
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,159
Got a lot of clay.

344
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,160
This is a gigantic mold.

345
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,361
This thing is gonna
be a nightmare.

346
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,330
We need, like,
a little mold gnome.

347
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,199
All right, give me your gnome.
It's time to mold.

348
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,174
I'm still not sure
how to color the hair.

349
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,443
The character
in the book is yellow,

350
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:27,646
but I see that a lot
of people are going for yellow.

351
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,348
So I definitely
want my character

352
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:32,150
to look different
than anybody else's.

353
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:36,521
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, guys.

354
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:37,623
I have Ve with me.

355
00:14:37,657 --> 00:14:39,658
We're gonna come
do a little walkthrough.

356
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,960
So I see Ve and I'm, like,

357
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:43,629
"I really don't want
to let you down.

358
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,464
Please say that I'm going
in the right direction."

359
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,599
Oh, my gosh, Ve.

360
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,167
Are you okay?
What's going on?

361
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:51,136
Look at that.

362
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,038
Oh, my gosh.
What am I gonna do?

363
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,172
It's called an Offt.

364
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,775
So I'm gonna do
a yellowy flesh tone.

365
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:57,843
Mm-hm.

366
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,778
And I really
want it to be a girl.

367
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,580
But I'm so lost here.

368
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:03,015
This is very masculine.

369
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,384
And I know she's supposed
to be, like, a little fluffy

370
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,619
but I wouldn't
put too many chins.

371
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:08,820
If you're going
for a little girl,

372
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:10,122
this is not gonna work for you.

373
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,490
Okay.

374
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,392
Is there a reason why
you wanna go with silicone

375
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:14,660
as opposed to foam?

376
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,495
I want it to have
that human flesh look to it.

377
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,263
'Cause it's supposed
to be a human-hybrid.

378
00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:19,531
It's kind of heavy.

379
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:20,899
That's what
I'm worried about though.

380
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,334
So that's why I'm asking
for a little advice here.

381
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,202
Which way would you go?
Would you go foam or silicone?

382
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,038
I would go back
to foam personally.

383
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,040
- I dig your wig.
- I know. I love that.

384
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:29,408
That is really cool.

385
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:31,076
- So instead of the ears--
- Mm-hm.

386
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,145
I want to incorporate
the hairstyle.

387
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:34,913
Oh, look at the hair,
that's--

388
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,682
So it's more of a human-hybrid
kind of a thing.

389
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,350
- That's a cute idea.
- Smart.

390
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:39,418
What's his wardrobe?

391
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:40,952
All this is gonna be fur and

392
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,621
I'm gonna paint it
mustardy-yellow

393
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,056
and then hints of brown.

394
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,657
But we're back
into that fun fur zone

395
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:46,958
which is kind of unfortunate.

396
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,928
Fun fur is cheap-looking,
costume-y fur material

397
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,563
that doesn't look
professional enough.

398
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,398
I know Glenn does not
like fun fur

399
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,533
and I'm worried about it,

400
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,268
but my guy's
gonna be in fun fur.

401
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:58,870
So I have the
Hinkle-Horn Honker

402
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:00,872
and he's yellows
and greens with plum.

403
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:02,507
Everybody has yellow creatures
this week.

404
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:03,642
- I know.
- Yes.

405
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,043
It's gonna
be pretty interesting.

406
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:07,079
I'm hoping his hair
is the yellow-est part of him.

407
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:09,848
And the rest is gonna be
a little more flesh-esque.

408
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,718
Okay.

409
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,287
So Derek, he had
the Snorter McPhail.

410
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:16,822
I do like the idea of the hair,

411
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:17,856
then using it as the ears.

412
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,224
I love that.
Using that as ears.

413
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,792
- That, to me is--
- Yeah.

414
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:24,629
Adding in that Dr. Seuss
quality with a human aspect.

415
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:27,632
- Yeah, it will be great.
- So let's move on to Sarah's then.

416
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,168
I didn't really think
a lot of the sculpture.

417
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:31,269
Right.

418
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:32,571
I think the sculpture
was kind of weak.

419
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:33,739
We'll have to see
how that one comes together.

420
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:36,208
Exactly.
So let's move on to Alana.

421
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:38,009
I'm concerned it's not
gonna be a sweet little girl,

422
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:39,711
if that's what she's going for.

423
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,113
Right.

424
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,380
And plus she's got
the big ball for a suit again.

425
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,982
So that's kind of
a worry for me.

426
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:45,317
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

427
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:47,552
Sarah and Alana are
kind of my concerns right now.

428
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:48,754
The two that
you're concerned about?

429
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:52,390
- I can't wait for tomorrow.
- Me neither.

430
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,259
All right, gang,
we're heading out.

431
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:55,627
- It's looking good.
- Bye, everybody.

432
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:56,661
- Bye.
- Good luck.

433
00:16:56,696 --> 00:17:00,065
Thank you.

434
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,466
Ve's not down with my character

435
00:17:01,501 --> 00:17:02,968
and I'm just freaking out.

436
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:05,971
So I have to re-sculpt the face.
The cowl's not finished yet.

437
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,173
So I need to get it together
and keep moving

438
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:12,544
or else I'm gonna go home.

439
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,346
At this point I've pretty much
got everything done

440
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,047
that I needed to get done.

441
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:18,550
I wish I could listen
to music or something.

442
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,219
I don't know what to do,
I'm just bored.

443
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,295
I decide that
I'm going to fabricate a horn.

444
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,664
I take some armature wire
and foam tube

445
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:36,301
and wrap it around
this armature wire.

446
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,670
Spray paint everything.

447
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,105
I'm enjoying
what it looks like.

448
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,841
Hey, Roy.

449
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,711
I'm now left with
hardly any time at all

450
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:49,414
before the end of the day,
and my mold is not popped.

451
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,484
I'm getting really nervous.

452
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:55,253
Heat is what's gonna
cure this mold faster.

453
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,689
So I'm throwing
garbage bags over it.

454
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:59,858
Bringing two hair dryers up
to it and I'm trying to create

455
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:01,893
this heat bubble.

456
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:04,996
Time's running out
and if this mold is not cast

457
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:06,431
for tomorrow's application,

458
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:08,033
I'm not gonna
have anything here.

459
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,068
It's gonna be a nightmare.

460
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:14,310
Hey, Roy.

461
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:16,513
I don't know
if I can crack this.

462
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,548
I'm now left with
hardly any time at all

463
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:21,184
before the end of the day
and my md is not popped.

464
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:23,086
That there needs
to dry some more.

465
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,521
I'm totally in turmoil.

466
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:27,690
I'm having such a hard time
coming up with a concept.

467
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:29,092
But now I'm not even
gonna have a cowl

468
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:31,561
and that's the whole thing
that even inspired me

469
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:34,564
even a little bit
on this makeup.

470
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,740
I got all the hair
laid up where I want it.

471
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,742
The swirls are
turning out really well.

472
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,044
- Looks cool.
- Thank you.

473
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,479
- Yeah.
- I super-respect Derek.

474
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:50,914
I think he's awesome.

475
00:18:50,948 --> 00:18:53,216
So for him to come over and
be, like, "dude," was awesome.

476
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,418
It, like, felt really good.

477
00:18:58,556 --> 00:18:59,856
Originally I was gonna
make, like, a fur hood

478
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,591
to put overtop of the cowl.

479
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,959
But I'm running out of time.

480
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:07,397
I've opted to just
lay the hair by hand.

481
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,935
We have six minutes.

482
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,472
Time is running out
and my mold is not popped.

483
00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:17,874
If this is gonna get done,
it needs to get done right now.

484
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,945
Do it carefully.
Carefully. Very carefully.

485
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:23,947
- He's coming.
- There we go.

486
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:26,449
So we all start going to town,

487
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:29,886
picking the clay
out of this mold.

488
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:33,089
Just slip it right out.

489
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:34,924
Get those little guys or you
won't have your little bumps.

490
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:37,961
Let's take it outside
and we'll clean it out there.

491
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:46,836
Oh, I could cry.
I love you guys so much.

492
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:49,939
A minute, 17.

493
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:51,374
All right.
This side's done.

494
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:54,277
Thank you.

495
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,884
- That's time, everybody.
- Thank you so much, dude.

496
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:04,687
Oh, man, what a day.

497
00:20:18,335 --> 00:20:19,702
It's application day.

498
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:22,305
We have four hours to apply
and then one hour of last looks

499
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:24,807
at the stage.

500
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:26,442
Application day is really
the make or break day

501
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,844
for any of these makeup's.

502
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,212
'Cause I've heard
the judges say 1,000 times,

503
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:31,381
"you can save a bad prosthetic
with a good makeup.

504
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:34,017
You can also destroy a good
prosthetic with a bad makeup."

505
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,022
I'm ecstatic.

506
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:41,291
My foam came out amazing.

507
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,793
At this point it's all
a matter of time management

508
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,196
and to do all of the details.

509
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:51,568
Hee-hee-hee.

510
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:57,073
Good morning.

511
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:58,575
That's your costume.

512
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:00,443
You're a conductor
of a snoring band.

513
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:02,145
Oh, cool.

514
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:06,583
- I got a big noggin, huh?
- You got a big ol' noggin.

515
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:07,984
Lay your head back.

516
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,054
Immediately I start applying
the prosthetic on the model.

517
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:13,489
I'm taking my time.
It's not a big piece.

518
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,192
Trying to get
the edges really clean.

519
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:18,194
I definitely think I have
a shot at winning this one.

520
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:20,129
I think I have
a strong concept.

521
00:21:20,164 --> 00:21:23,666
But I'm also kind of worried.
Did I do too little?

522
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:29,439
How does that feel, mama?

523
00:21:29,473 --> 00:21:32,675
I get my pieces and my edges
are, like, thick wedges.

524
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,044
And on top of this,
I still don't even know

525
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:37,547
how or what I'm painting here.

526
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:41,651
I can't use
the same paint techniques

527
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,253
I've been using.

528
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:45,421
I need to challenge myself
and do something new.

529
00:21:45,456 --> 00:21:46,789
I'm a fighter.

530
00:21:46,824 --> 00:21:48,725
I'm not rolling over
and dying in this competition,

531
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,861
I need to keep pushing.

532
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,197
I don't like
this poofy right here.

533
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:58,001
With that fun fur on I'm, like,
"this is so bright yellow."

534
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:59,936
You're gonna look like
a frickin' chicken.

535
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:03,840
I'm really, like,
not liking this color.

536
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:04,907
Oh, lord.

537
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:13,783
You're fluffy today.

538
00:22:27,965 --> 00:22:30,400
The gloves are taken care of.
The feet are taken care of.

539
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,669
I just need to work on
the cowl and the face.

540
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:36,439
So having all this time
to just focus on blending

541
00:22:36,473 --> 00:22:39,442
and airbrushing
and detail work...

542
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:41,577
I'm excited.

543
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,581
I love this.

544
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,283
Everything is going
pretty smooth for me

545
00:22:47,318 --> 00:22:48,951
here in applications.

546
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:50,320
For some reason
I just had this idea

547
00:22:50,354 --> 00:22:51,921
to put some purple
in with the pink.

548
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:54,023
I thought that along
with the yellow pajama suit

549
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:55,725
would pull everything together.

550
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,094
One foot at a time, I guess.

551
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:02,899
I'm gonna have you
put your head forward.

552
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,467
I'm gonna put
the wig on real quick

553
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:06,202
and see what it looks like.

554
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:07,537
I feel like I'm in
a pretty good place.

555
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:09,305
I'm happy with what
I'm coming up with.

556
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,242
I think he's looking cool.

557
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:14,711
This one piece
is not gonna work.

558
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:16,479
It's way too tight.
Turn for me.

559
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:19,382
If I have to I'll cut it off
at the zipper at last looks.

560
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,285
Make it like
a Grinch Christmas suit.

561
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,187
I decided to go with human hair
and I'm liking the way

562
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,889
this is turning out.

563
00:23:26,924 --> 00:23:29,158
30 seconds.

564
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,635
That's time! Time!

565
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,373
Now that everything's done
I'm looking around and thinking,

566
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:44,874
"oh, wow, there's
a lot of color."

567
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:47,977
I'm wishing I had put color
somewhere else on him

568
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,345
rather than just the hair.

569
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,784
So this could either
go really good or really bad.

570
00:23:54,818 --> 00:23:55,852
Coming up...

571
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:57,653
I have a giant chicken
I have to make

572
00:23:57,688 --> 00:24:00,189
not look like a chicken.

573
00:24:00,224 --> 00:24:01,791
You're freaking me out.

574
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:04,026
I don't feel
a Seussian heartbeat

575
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:06,396
living inside of this.

576
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,797
That's just tragic.

577
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:09,832
This makeup could
be sending me home.

578
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:13,496
My model's sitting
in his suit and

579
00:24:13,616 --> 00:24:16,255
I get his face on and
he's starting to fall asleep.

580
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,021
And it's kind of hilarious.

581
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:25,296
He's in this fat suit and he's
got this little greeny face,

582
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:27,291
it's happy, and he's sleeping.

583
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:28,545
And he's just like...

584
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:32,075
♪ away and he
is living Bumble-Tub right now.

585
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:36,308
♪ he wakes up.

586
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:41,732
You're killing me.

587
00:24:45,515 --> 00:24:47,683
So we get the last looks,
we have an hour left

588
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:50,453
to apply everything else
that's needed.

589
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:54,657
This last hour
is really important to this

590
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:57,560
because I have a giant chicken
I have to make

591
00:24:57,594 --> 00:24:59,762
not look like a chicken.

592
00:25:06,336 --> 00:25:08,638
I'm still slightly
unsure about my paintjob.

593
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:12,308
I'm wondering if I should
still pop in some of that color.

594
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:18,514
God, that's creepy as hell.

595
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:21,851
The edges of my prosthetic
around the mouth are lifting.

596
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,021
I am pretty worried.

597
00:25:25,055 --> 00:25:28,157
It is tough getting those edges
to look flawless.

598
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:30,726
If it's not blended out,
you're gonna see it.

599
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:33,796
I'm gonna keep painting you
until the last second.

600
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,732
Come on over here, girl.

601
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,547
Guys, that's time!

602
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:54,083
That's it.

603
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:05,394
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

604
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:08,531
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

605
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:09,965
Say hello to your judges.

606
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,469
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

607
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:15,071
- Good evening.
- Evening.

608
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,440
Three time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

609
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,575
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, ve.

610
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:22,244
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

611
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,879
Hello.

612
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:25,147
And please welcome back

613
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:27,483
our very special
guest judge this week,

614
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:31,721
Oscar and Emmy-winning producer,
Brian Grazer.

615
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:36,992
Whoo!

616
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:39,695
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.

617
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,664
All right, guys, so this week
your spotlight challenge

618
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:44,333
was to select a character
from <i>The Sleep Book</i>

619
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:47,536
and use it to inspire an
original human-hybrid makeup

620
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:50,606
that captures the essence
of Dr. Seuss.

621
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,408
Let's see what
you came up with.

622
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:17,299
The hair is just very,
like, standout-ish and fun

623
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:19,268
and over-the-top,
very Seuss-like.

624
00:27:19,302 --> 00:27:21,370
And I'm very happy.

625
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:41,390
He is able to show emotion
through the prosthetic,

626
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:43,325
which is exactly
what Brian asked for.

627
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,328
So I think I pulled
that part of it off very well.

628
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,284
I'm liking
how the makeup looks.

629
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:11,153
The judges I'm sure got a good
first impression from far away.

630
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:14,356
I'm just a little
worried about closer looks.

631
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:33,809
Overall I'm very happy
with the makeup.

632
00:28:33,844 --> 00:28:37,313
Whether it looks like
a Dr. Seuss character or not

633
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:40,816
is the thing
that's up for question.

634
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:04,006
This is a nightmare.
My dream is over.

635
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,076
This is the worst makeup
I've ever done in my whole life.

636
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:29,632
I think he's cute
and I like him.

637
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,034
My makeup is probably
not on top,

638
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:33,769
but I'm hoping that it's safe.

639
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:36,505
I'd really like
to not be on the bottom.

640
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:43,379
Judges, why don't
you take a closer look?

641
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:48,150
This is cool, the way
that he did the brows.

642
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:49,919
- Yeah.
- That's a nice touch.

643
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:50,986
I love the hair.

644
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,755
As you can see,
I'm interested in hair.

645
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:54,423
- So was I, at one point.
- Yeah.

646
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:59,094
From where I'm at, looks like
everything's holding up, so...

647
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:03,299
Yeah, it's pretty
nerve-wracking still.

648
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,134
Gesticulate and let's
just see the movement.

649
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:06,602
Open your mouth
as much as you can.

650
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:09,371
Oh, wow. Great.
A little <i>planet of the apes.</i>

651
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:12,942
You're freaking me out.

652
00:30:12,976 --> 00:30:15,644
See this shape is working
really well for me.

653
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,047
I looked at it from far away,
I really hated the shape.

654
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:19,381
- Yeah.
- But now close up it works.

655
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,517
And it really looks Seussian
in profile.

656
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,718
- See the edges?
- Yeah.

657
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:24,119
Really rough.
Not even close.

658
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,622
It seems like they like it
and then they see Glenn

659
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:27,957
touch the edge of her mouth.

660
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:29,925
It doesn't really look good.

661
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,028
I'm really worried that this
makeup could be sending me home.

662
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,132
Join the conversation
on Twitter.

663
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,901
Use #FaceOff to tell us

664
00:30:38,935 --> 00:30:41,603
what you think
about tonight's designs.

665
00:30:42,517 --> 00:30:43,884
- These edges are really rough.
- Yeah.

666
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:46,687
I see Glenn touch
the edge of her mouth.

667
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:50,557
I'm really worried this makeup
could be sending me home.

668
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:53,227
The ears are
a little alien for me.

669
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:56,163
Now is this sculpted at all?
Oh, no. That's just all paint.

670
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:57,664
The texture
comes from the paint.

671
00:30:57,699 --> 00:31:01,602
I think it's cool.

672
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:03,670
This is actually the tail
up on the head.

673
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:05,239
She's covered it up.

674
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:06,740
Maybe she didn't like the way
it came out, I don't know.

675
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:10,577
Yeah, that makes two of us.

676
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:13,013
This a weird transition
right above the eye.

677
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:14,248
It's very strange.

678
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:17,785
It feels a little bit
like <i>Beetlejuice</i> to me.

679
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:22,990
So Brian, how do you
feel they did tonight?

680
00:31:23,024 --> 00:31:24,658
I know how difficult it is,

681
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:27,261
given that I've lived
in a few Seuss movies myself.

682
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:29,463
And I thought you guys
did a great job.

683
00:31:29,497 --> 00:31:31,064
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

684
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,866
All right, the judges
would now like to speak

685
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:35,569
with each of you,
to learn more about your work.

686
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:37,438
Roy. You're up first.

687
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:45,012
Begin by telling us
your basic concept

688
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,246
for this character.

689
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:49,082
This is a hybrid
of the Foona-Lagoona-Baboona

690
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,250
and a human.

691
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,952
So what I did is I tried
to capture the essence

692
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:54,221
in the face
of the Seuss character.

693
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:55,856
And then I decided
to go with human hair

694
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,091
instead of the wild Seuss hair.

695
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,494
Once again you've
certainly taken on

696
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:05,332
an incredibly ambitious endeavor
in the amount of work.

697
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:09,102
This week I think
it was the right decision.

698
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,804
I'm really impressed
with the amount of work.

699
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,041
- Thank you.
- This makes me smile.

700
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,109
- Don't know what it is.
- It's 'cause he's smiling.

701
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,712
Could be.
I really do like him.

702
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:19,813
Thank you.

703
00:32:19,848 --> 00:32:21,014
From a producer's
point of view,

704
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:22,416
there's a lot
to work with here.

705
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,786
I thought it was very Seussian.
I think you did a good job.

706
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,356
- Thank you very much.
- Roy, please step back.

707
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:34,161
Nicole.

708
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:40,501
So tell us about your concept.

709
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:44,204
My guy was the Bumble-Tub
and he had little curly-Q's

710
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:46,874
on his head in the drawing
and he had hair

711
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:48,475
coming from his cheeks.

712
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,644
So I just wanted
to take some of that

713
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,613
and just kind of bump it up
a little bit.

714
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:57,618
Feels like he automatically
plugs in to this world.

715
00:32:57,652 --> 00:33:01,221
You took the hair down
into kind of these sideburns.

716
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:02,222
Yeah.

717
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:04,324
That is great.

718
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,095
Probably the most Seussian
of all of the characters

719
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:09,263
that I'm looking at.

720
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:12,266
The hair is very groovy.
I like the hands.

721
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,667
Thank you.

722
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:17,571
Did you bring airbrush colors
down to the fun fur as well?

723
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:18,772
- Yeah.
- I think it's great.

724
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:20,741
It's quick, it's sloppy,
but it works.

725
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:23,043
It looks like a Seuss character
and for once

726
00:33:23,077 --> 00:33:25,979
I don't hate that there's
fun fur covering this guy.

727
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:27,481
Thank you so much.

728
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:30,951
Nicole, thank you very much.
You can step back.

729
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:35,923
Derek.

730
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:41,929
Derek, can you
explain the concept?

731
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:44,431
Uh, my character
is called Snorter McPhail.

732
00:33:44,465 --> 00:33:48,969
And he is a conductor
of a band of snores in a cave.

733
00:33:49,003 --> 00:33:51,371
There's something
that's out of balance.

734
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:54,274
It has to do with the size
of her face

735
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,110
and the size of the hair.

736
00:33:57,145 --> 00:34:00,080
The paint is marring
an otherwise salient concept.

737
00:34:00,114 --> 00:34:02,749
You sort of have this
very indiscriminately applied,

738
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:06,553
garish makeup
that's just tragic.

739
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:07,955
What happened to your wig?

740
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:10,991
It's, like, totally different
than it was yesterday.

741
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:13,694
And what's all this
mess down here? Good God.

742
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:16,096
Just trying to get
the hair, kind of-- continuation.

743
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:19,166
I think you kind of missed
the mark this week, honey.

744
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,567
Derek, thank you very much.

745
00:34:20,602 --> 00:34:24,671
- Please step back.
- Thank you. Thanks.

746
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:27,174
Alana.

747
00:34:30,178 --> 00:34:32,512
Let's start with
your basic concept.

748
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:35,949
I had a very, very hard time
with this makeup, I truly did.

749
00:34:35,984 --> 00:34:39,519
I just wish I could reset.

750
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:41,488
It's refreshing
that you're that aware

751
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,023
of where you're at this week.

752
00:34:43,057 --> 00:34:46,093
You can't get better if you
can't acknowledge your mistakes.

753
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,161
Which this most certainly is.

754
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,963
It is calamitous.

755
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:53,900
Your paint application this week
is a morbid failure.

756
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:57,738
Yesterday, honey,
you told me that your character

757
00:34:57,772 --> 00:35:01,108
was supposed to be
a sweet, little girl, right?

758
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,511
There's no nice, big,
soft, round bald cheeks.

759
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:08,081
Like, big cherry cheeks.
No cute little turned-up nose.

760
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:09,349
It's like a pinched
little weird--

761
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:11,018
like a bad nose job.

762
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:12,586
And where's your
little freckles?

763
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,554
You did some other weird thing,
I don't know.

764
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:16,289
I looks like bad age-spots
all over his head.

765
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,226
I just wish I could
have the opportunity

766
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,895
to do something better.

767
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:23,797
Alana, thank you very much.
Will you please step back.

768
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:27,200
Thank you.

769
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,333
Good job.

770
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:34,775
And Laura.

771
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:40,247
Would you tell us about
your character, please?

772
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:44,251
My character was called
a Chippendale Mupp.

773
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:49,489
The picture looks like
a dragon-dog-lion thing.

774
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,925
So this is what I came up with.

775
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,661
Overall I like the look
of this character.

776
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,997
I do like the color palette.
I love the hair.

777
00:35:57,031 --> 00:35:58,732
I think all that
works really well.

778
00:35:58,766 --> 00:35:59,866
Thank you.

779
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:02,135
If you can turn sideways.

780
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,906
Just below his ear
there's some really great

781
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,375
fake sculpt going on
with your paint.

782
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:09,843
Definitely.

783
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,778
And that's pretty magnificent
that you can render that well

784
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:13,180
with an airbrush.

785
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,314
Thank you.

786
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:16,416
For me, I like
the dimensions of the body

787
00:36:16,451 --> 00:36:18,251
and I like the color
of the body,

788
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:21,221
and I think it works very well
with your original idea.

789
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:24,191
- Congratulations, good work.
- Thank you.

790
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,258
Laura, thank you very much.

791
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:28,929
If you'd please step back.

792
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:32,432
Sarah, you're up next.

793
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:37,037
Would you tell us
about your creation

794
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,338
and who your character is?

795
00:36:38,372 --> 00:36:40,207
I have the Hinkle-Horn Honker.
They play horns.

796
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,642
They play horns.

797
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:45,312
From far away the paint job
doesn't look all that fantastic.

798
00:36:45,346 --> 00:36:46,646
I think there's probably
a lot of things

799
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:49,382
that you could have done
to really bump up the paint job.

800
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,651
And I also think you put
a little too much hair

801
00:36:51,686 --> 00:36:52,652
on this guy.

802
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:55,722
We're thinking he looks
a little <i>Beetlejuice-y.</i>

803
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,591
- Oh.
- Um, yeah.

804
00:36:57,625 --> 00:37:00,260
Well, for me, I probably--
if I were just to enter

805
00:37:00,294 --> 00:37:01,394
onto the set,

806
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:04,030
I'd say maybe
we have to start over.

807
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:07,267
'Cause I don't feel
the Seussian heartbeat

808
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:11,238
living inside
of this particular identity.

809
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,806
I'm disappointed
that you didn't disrupt

810
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,107
the human form here.

811
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:16,610
Something as simple
as a bell-shaped stomach

812
00:37:16,644 --> 00:37:17,778
or something.

813
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:19,713
Just anything other than
just a guy in pajamas,

814
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:21,848
because that
is what it feels like

815
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:24,017
and that's
a huge problem for me.

816
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,516
Sarah, thank you very much.
You can step back.

817
00:37:26,551 --> 00:37:27,788
Thank you.

818
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:34,161
All right, everybody, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

819
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:35,328
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

820
00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:36,496
while the make their decisions.

821
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:38,565
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

822
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,805
All right, guys,
let's start with the looks

823
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,072
you liked the most.

824
00:37:46,107 --> 00:37:47,707
Why don't we begin with Laura.

825
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:49,676
This one stands out
in stark contrast

826
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,645
against the work
of the competitors.

827
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,114
And she executed it so well
that I've gotta give her

828
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:55,649
massive credit for it.

829
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:57,617
I think there's
a lot of ability

830
00:37:57,652 --> 00:37:59,753
in this particular creation.

831
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:01,488
Let's move on to Nicole.

832
00:38:01,522 --> 00:38:03,890
I liked what she did
probably the best.

833
00:38:03,925 --> 00:38:06,293
And that hairdo
was so fabulous.

834
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,694
I'm really proud
of the fight from her

835
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:08,895
since she's come back.

836
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,063
- Oh, yeah.
- It's a different Nicole.

837
00:38:10,097 --> 00:38:11,264
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, it is.

838
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:12,532
All right, guys,
let's move on to Roy.

839
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:13,934
I really did
like this one a lot

840
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:16,937
because it so manipulated
the actor's eyes

841
00:38:16,971 --> 00:38:18,004
underneath the rubber.

842
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,706
It didn't just
feel like an actor

843
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,941
was looking through
a rubber mask.

844
00:38:20,975 --> 00:38:22,876
Even the stomach,
it's a little too big

845
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,477
and a little too lopsided.

846
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,446
- I'm not sure it's Seuss.
- It doesn't even bother me.

847
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,781
I'm not sure it's human,
I'm not sure that it did

848
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:29,850
any of the things they
were supposed to do this week.

849
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:31,618
But I still like it.

850
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:33,153
All right let's move on
to the looks

851
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,955
you liked the least.

852
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:36,189
Why don't we start with Derek.

853
00:38:36,224 --> 00:38:38,225
He wasn't thinking
about the big picture.

854
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:40,160
She has a tiny little face.

855
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:43,363
And he encapsulated her
with this giant hairdo.

856
00:38:43,397 --> 00:38:46,266
This show is about makeup
and that muddy paintjob

857
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,035
just won't fly tonight,
it's just not good enough.

858
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,338
All right, let's
move on to Alana.

859
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:54,674
Oh boy, Alana
kind of blew it today.

860
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:58,445
If that were presented
to me by the director,

861
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,813
it'd be a very bad day for me.

862
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,317
Because I just didn't think
it was within the world at all

863
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:07,921
of anything that I would want
in a Seuss movie.

864
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:09,756
Let's move on to Sarah.

865
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,858
I just thought it
was kind of a wipeout.

866
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,361
I think she didn't work
very hard at the costume

867
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:16,062
and getting us past that.

868
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:18,598
I just didn't feel like
there was much hope at all.

869
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,833
The mouth is a cool shape,

870
00:39:19,867 --> 00:39:21,768
but then you have to address
where that goes.

871
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:23,403
It's just these mounds
sitting out here.

872
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:24,504
Not good.

873
00:39:24,538 --> 00:39:26,139
Judges, have you
made your decisions?

874
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:28,008
- Yup.
- Yes, we have.

875
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:31,044
Let's bring them back out.

876
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:39,686
All right, Glenn, why don't you
tell us about the top looks.

877
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,689
Roy, this is
a really fun character.

878
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:45,625
Once again impressed with how
much you were able to get done

879
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,527
in the time
that you were given.

880
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:48,695
Laura.

881
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:50,563
You had a really
nice color palette

882
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,299
and you added some great
structure into your makeup

883
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,466
with your airbrushing.

884
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:56,369
And Nicole, you got
a lot right this week.

885
00:39:56,404 --> 00:39:58,571
We really liked
the character's hair.

886
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,607
The sculpture, and loved
that you brought your paintjob

887
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:02,075
down into the fur.

888
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,145
So Glenn, who is the winner
of this week's challenge?

889
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:07,180
The winner is...

890
00:40:14,064 --> 00:40:16,666
So Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

891
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,870
The winner is...

892
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:24,073
- Nicole.
- Yay!

893
00:40:24,107 --> 00:40:26,042
- Oh, my God.
- Ooh, girl.

894
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:28,210
Congratulations.

895
00:40:28,245 --> 00:40:30,513
We thought that
you did the best job

896
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:33,182
embracing both
your model's humanity

897
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:35,551
and the quintessential
Dr. Seuss aesthetic.

898
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:37,486
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

899
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,021
What an amazing feeling.

900
00:40:39,056 --> 00:40:41,023
I've come back
and now I'm doing something

901
00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:43,826
that the judges are loving.

902
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,761
Nicole, congratulations.

903
00:40:45,796 --> 00:40:49,198
You can head back
to the makeup room.

904
00:40:49,232 --> 00:40:51,767
Laura, Roy, you are
also safe this week.

905
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:53,135
Please head back
to the makeup room.

906
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,470
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

907
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:57,540
Good luck, guys.

908
00:40:57,574 --> 00:40:59,108
Unfortunately that means
the rest of you

909
00:40:59,142 --> 00:41:00,643
are on the bottom this week

910
00:41:00,677 --> 00:41:03,045
and one of you
will be eliminated.

911
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,115
Please step forward.

912
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:13,589
Glenn, please tell us
about the bottom looks.

913
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:16,692
Sarah, we liked some of
the aspects of your character,

914
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:19,395
but it ultimately felt
a little bit more <i>Beetlejuice</i>

915
00:41:19,429 --> 00:41:21,497
than it did Dr. Seuss.

916
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:23,566
Derek, we thought
your silhouette and profile

917
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,067
were really, really strong.

918
00:41:25,102 --> 00:41:26,469
But you made
some critical errors

919
00:41:26,503 --> 00:41:28,704
in your sculpt and paintjob.

920
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,173
And Alana, there were glimpses
of what it was

921
00:41:31,208 --> 00:41:33,142
that you had hoped to do
with your character,

922
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:36,379
but a lot of things did not
work out well for you this week.

923
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:39,715
So then who
is going home tonight?

924
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,653
The person
leaving tonight is...

925
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:47,790
Alana.

926
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:50,026
Your inability
to settle on a concept

927
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,128
was blindingly obvious tonight.

928
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:55,931
Alana, I'm sorry but
you have been eliminated.

929
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:58,901
Derek, Sarah, you guys
are safe this week.

930
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:02,004
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room.

931
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:09,812
Alana, honey, please
keep in touch with me.

932
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:11,347
Absolutely.

933
00:42:11,381 --> 00:42:13,049
I just can't wait to see
where you're gonna be in a year.

934
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:16,485
Hearing this from Ve Neill
is the highlight of my life.

935
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,387
I feel like a million bucks
right now.

936
00:42:18,422 --> 00:42:20,589
Thank you all so much,
this has been the best stress

937
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,425
I've ever been under
in my whole life.

938
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:27,697
Alana, it has been great
having you here with us.

939
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:29,098
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

940
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,633
and pack up your kit.

941
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:34,136
- Of course. Thank you.
- Thank you. Good luck.

942
00:42:34,171 --> 00:42:35,204
Thank you.

943
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:37,973
This has been
an amazing experience.

944
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:39,341
- It's me.
- Oh, there she is.

945
00:42:39,376 --> 00:42:41,277
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

946
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,578
Dude, I knew it.

947
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:45,181
I just knew the Offt
would get me offed, you know?

948
00:42:45,215 --> 00:42:47,917
I know that my family
and especially my dad

949
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:50,186
is gonna be so proud of me
and I'm so excited for him

950
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,021
to see the work
that I have done here.

951
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:55,458
<i>Face Off</i> has given me the
courage to believe in myself.
