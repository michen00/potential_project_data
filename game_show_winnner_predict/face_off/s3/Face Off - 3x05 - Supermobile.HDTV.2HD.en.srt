00:00:01,431 --> 00:00:03,701
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,735 --> 00:00:05,703
The artists created
original zombies

3
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:08,372
inspired by <i>Alice's Adventures</i>
<i>in Wonderland.</i>

4
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:09,707
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:12,982
Roy's terrifying queen
carried him to victory,

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,126
and Nicole was sent home.

7
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:18,032
Now eight artists remain.

8
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:19,734
Tonight they'll tackle
a challenge

9
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:21,169
of heroic proportion.

10
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:23,038
Yes!

11
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,641
I'm excited
about this challenge.

12
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:25,811
I do not like this shit.

13
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,381
I don't like
what I'm sculpting.

14
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,052
I need to start over.

15
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:30,087
The mold cracked.

16
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:32,489
And I'm gonna be
in serious trouble.

17
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:34,257
And onstage their work
will be showcased

18
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,428
before an entertainment icon.

19
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:38,032
Boy, what a bunch
of hard-asses.

20
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,204
You didn't do a good job.

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,409
I could be the one going home.

22
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,913
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

23
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:48,782
to be a guest lecturer
at Makeup Forever's academies

24
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:50,718
in New York and Paris,

25
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:56,095
a new 2012 Toyota Prius V,
and $100,000.

26
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,530
And for the first time ever--

27
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:59,534
America, your voice
will be heard

28
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:01,003
in selecting the winner.

29
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:03,240
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

31
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,076
I miss her already.

32
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,781
Nicole's eliminated,
and I'm devastated.

33
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:55,282
I don't think
she deserved to go home.

34
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,917
And if it wasn't gonna be me,
it was gonna be Rod.

35
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:58,419
No way was Nikki going home.

36
00:01:58,454 --> 00:01:59,822
I thought you were
gonna go home too.

37
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:02,426
Nicole was my best friend
in the house.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,692
It felt terrible.

39
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,592
I thought that I should have
gone home over her.

40
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,994
I just want to get back
in the shop

41
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:09,733
and not make
another catastrophe.

44
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:25,208
in front of this huge cave.

45
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,445
Welcome to Bronson Caves.

46
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,214
This location has been used
in countless films.

47
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:33,415
However, it's probably
best known as the entrance

48
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,390
to the bat cave in the classic
<i>Batman</i> television series.

49
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,724
What?

50
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,595
Superheroes come
in all shapes and sizes.

51
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,933
So, working together
in teams of two,

52
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:47,468
your spotlight challenge
is to create the superhero

53
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:50,870
and sidekick that would use
one of these vehicles.

54
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:03,252
Cars start coming
around the corner,

55
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,888
and they're the coolest ever...

56
00:03:04,922 --> 00:03:06,823
Is that a Lamborghini?

57
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:10,741
From every genre
and style and time period.

58
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,041
What the heck is that?

59
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:16,127
- Aw, yeah!
- Yeah!

60
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:19,662
All right, your teams
have been randomly selected,

61
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:20,863
and they are...

62
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:23,198
Derek and Sarah...

63
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:26,003
Jason and Rod...

64
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:28,038
Laura and Tommy...

65
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:29,605
Alana and Roy.

66
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,973
- Yeah, buddy.
- All right.

67
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,908
Alana's sweet,
but she's also very flighty.

68
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:35,478
So I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
have to take the lead on this.

69
00:03:35,513 --> 00:03:37,747
Okay, if everybody would stand
with their new team member.

70
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:42,116
All right, so these
are the vehicles you have

71
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,418
to choose from today--

72
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:46,823
The Dodge Charger,
the Tatra T87,

73
00:03:46,857 --> 00:03:48,425
the AJS Motorcycle,

74
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,161
the Lamborghini Gallardo,

75
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,796
the Space Mole,

76
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,464
and the Humber Pig
Armored Truck.

77
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:57,133
All right, it is time
to select your vehicles.

78
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,935
Derek and Sarah?

79
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,405
The AJS Motorcycle
with sidecar.

80
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,774
Jason and Rod.

81
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:05,442
- Tatra T87.
- T87.

82
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:08,244
- Alana and Roy.
- Let's do the Charger.

83
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,679
And Tommy and Laura.

84
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:12,312
We'll take the battle tank.

85
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:14,345
So, before you get started
on your designs,

86
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,913
I would like to introduce you
to a special guest

87
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:19,917
who knows a thing or two
about impressing our judges.

88
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,589
He also happens to be
a very gifted concept designer

89
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:25,522
and will consult with each
of you on your designs today.

90
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,723
Come on out!

91
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,493
- Yeah!
- Awesome!

92
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:31,695
Hey, buddy!

93
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,497
It's Rayce,
the winner of season two.

94
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:35,431
He has a really good eye
for detail.

95
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:38,097
Everything he did last year
just was very unique.

96
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,699
So I'm really looking forward
to see what he thinks

97
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:40,867
of our design.

98
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,536
Everybody please say hello

99
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,841
to the season-two winner
of <i>Face Off,</i> Rayce Bird.

100
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:46,909
Hey.

101
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,811
What have you been up to
since you won <i>Face Off?</i>

102
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:52,179
Um, I've been doing a lot
of conceptual-design work--

103
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:55,149
Anything from the digital stuff
to the makeup stuff.

104
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:57,083
Of course, tattooing has gotten
out of control as well.

105
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:58,585
- I can only imagine.
- So, yeah.

106
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,753
All right, guys, get started.

107
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:07,493
♪

108
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,761
- Just draw, homey, just draw.
- Okay.

109
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:13,265
What I'm playing with
is a weak, wealthy person

110
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:16,404
being driven in that great car.

111
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:19,740
Rod and I decided the Tatra
will inspire our superhero

112
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:20,742
and sidekick.

113
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:21,744
- Jason.
- Jason.

114
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:22,980
Rod.

115
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:24,950
We don't know
the superhero thing that well,

116
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,919
so the challenge is pretty
difficult for both of us.

117
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:28,622
Tell me a little bit
about what your plan is.

118
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:31,261
The idea is the person
in the back seat

119
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:32,897
is the brains of the operation,

120
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:34,633
and then the driver
is the muscle.

121
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,072
But the passenger
will be controlling the driver.

122
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:40,341
Build your story
based off of the vehicle--

123
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,610
The shapes, the way it flows.

124
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:42,946
It could even be
some kind of a vein pattern

125
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:44,584
- that flows that way.
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:47,220
Okay, so we decided
to go with a female hero

127
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:48,553
with a sidekick.

128
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:50,720
So we came up with
the characters fire and chaos.

129
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,220
Fire is the daughter
of the devil,

130
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:53,988
and her imp is there
to cause trouble,

131
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,991
but also to keep her
out of trouble.

132
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,761
What's cool
about this specific flame

133
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:00,795
is the circular pattern,
so play with the small circles.

134
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,298
Also, incorporate
something into him

135
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:04,465
that creates a cohesion.

136
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:06,400
It could even be just
the way the shapes move

137
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,601
and flow across the body.

138
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:10,239
So basically she is
a military experiment

139
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,243
that has escaped.

140
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:15,012
And she can do whatever
she wants with her body.

141
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,282
Like, it can morph
into whatever it needs to be

142
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,751
and that's why she's looking
a bit more badass.

143
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:22,956
The sidekick is a soldier.
He's in love with this woman.

144
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,224
He loses it and breaks her out.

145
00:06:25,258 --> 00:06:26,892
He blows a wall
inside the laboratory,

146
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,130
and he blows half his face off.

147
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:31,666
Now, this is
a very big, black vehicle.

148
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,466
So, even if you put
some blocky stuff on her

149
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:35,700
or a little more rigidity,

150
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:38,371
you should be very careful
of how you integrate it.

151
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:40,873
So tell me a little bit
about what you got going on?

152
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:42,343
We both want to go
with the superhero

153
00:06:42,377 --> 00:06:45,982
that doesn't have superpowers,
but is more like Batman.

154
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:47,786
We would like a girl and a guy.

155
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,721
We keep thinking definitely a
female Indiana Jones superhero.

156
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:53,790
Even if it's a very
normal-looking character

157
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,123
- with normal features...
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:57,224
It can still have some
of those subtle details

159
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:58,558
of the bike--

160
00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,060
You know, how it's very busy,
it's very dirty.

161
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:01,560
That can lead
to some kind of a scar.

162
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:04,126
It's the details that are gonna
help relate to the vehicle

163
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,427
you guys have chosen.

164
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,061
Hey, guys, everything's
looking really good.

165
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,362
Good luck. Go ahead and make
your way back to the shop

166
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:13,531
and get these things rolling.

167
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:14,699
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Rayce.

168
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,204
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

169
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,081
I love superheroes.

170
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:29,016
I grew up learning how to draw
from comic books,

171
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,021
so I'm excited
about this challenge.

172
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,057
First thing I want to do
is start sculpting.

173
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,758
I'm gonna work on the sidekick,

174
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:40,361
and Sarah is gonna work
on the superhero look.

175
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:46,566
Our concept is to go
with brains and brawn.

176
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,735
I'm going to attempt
to be the brain,

177
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,371
and Jason's going to be
the brawn.

178
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,174
His skin's
a little rough there,

179
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,842
with the veins
coming out of it.

180
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:57,310
One here, one here,
and then one on top.

181
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,291
Alana and I came up
with the concept fire and chaos.

182
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:08,760
I'm gonna work on chaos.
She's gonna work on fire.

183
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,928
My concern is even though
Alana's a good sculptor,

184
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:13,300
I just don't know
how fast she is.

185
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,540
I look at Laura's sculpt,

186
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,439
and it is very, very similar
to my own.

187
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:21,641
And I'm confused.

188
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,013
Why does Laura's headpiece
look like fire?

189
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,658
I've just been pushing around
clay for, like, an hour,

190
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,261
and it's just not translating
as a burn for me.

191
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:38,597
I don't know what
the fuck to do.

192
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,930
- Yeah.
- I do not like this shit.

193
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,698
I've never sculpted
a burn makeup.

194
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:45,167
It's supposed to look like
he's gotten hamburger-meated.

195
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,303
- I'm just gonna go with it.
- Totally.

196
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:48,771
It's a simple, simple sculpt.

197
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:51,742
It took me way too long
to wrap my head around it.

198
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:56,578
It's taking me way too long
to put the small amount of clay

199
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,080
that I put on the face.

200
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,684
So then I decide to jump over
to make the headpiece,

201
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,221
which is what will give
our superheroes

202
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,856
their superpowers.

203
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,756
I start with foam sheets.

204
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,160
That's not going the way
I want it to go.

205
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:11,062
So then I decide
I'm just gonna sculpt.

206
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,465
But I'm just not happy
with anything that I'm doing.

207
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,233
And I have a lot
of catching up to do.

208
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:17,067
One hour, three minutes.

209
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:22,770
I didn't think this
would be as hard as it is.

210
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,872
Alana's making the flames
way too small,

211
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:26,576
and flames
are really hard to sculpt.

212
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,877
I'm starting to get worried.

213
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:31,076
Okay, maybe this
is just a bad way to go.

214
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,678
Fire isn't choppy.

215
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:36,180
It's smooth. It's flowing.
It's alive almost.

216
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:38,849
Okay, guys, that's it!
Time's up!

217
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:41,782
I spent five hours
sculpting a face piece

218
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,414
that I am not happy with.

219
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,815
And, like, that's pathetic.

220
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:01,806
Let's get this.

221
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,873
It's day two
of the superhero challenge,

222
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,875
and I don't like
what I'm sculpting.

223
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,543
I'm disappointed in myself.

224
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:14,379
I really need to step my game
up, or else I'm gonna go home.

225
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,648
Bye.

226
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,251
I need to start over.
I'm, like, losing it.

227
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,389
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

228
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:20,758
I really don't.

229
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:23,294
I'm disappointed in the way
that this is going.

230
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:26,363
We could be in serious trouble.

231
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,102
Coming up...

232
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,204
- Fuck.
- Oh, no.

233
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:33,039
The mold cracked.

234
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:34,441
Rod, Ve wants to come back
really quick.

235
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:36,478
I just want to say
one more thing to you.

236
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,447
Wow.
I know I'm in trouble.

237
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,816
Joining our panel this week,
Kevin Smith.

238
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:42,852
Thanks for having me, man.
I'm ready to judge.

239
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,587
Bye.

240
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:55,388
It's day two
of the superhero challenge,

241
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,657
and I need to boogie down
and restart the sculpture

242
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,593
because I don't like it.

243
00:10:59,627 --> 00:11:00,995
It's not a winning piece.

244
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,698
It's not something
that's even commendable.

245
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,963
I'm starting my sculpture over.
That's how brave I am.

246
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,600
Changed my whole design.

247
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,701
Alana has this new excitement
about starting this piece,

248
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,669
and I'm starting to feel
a lot better about it.

249
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,171
I can actually see these
characters driving around

250
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,003
in the Dodge Charger.

251
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:17,437
Starting over.

252
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm sculpting faster
than I think I ever have

253
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:22,380
and I'm loving the way
that this is pulling together.

254
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,084
And I think it
looks more cohesive

255
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:26,084
with Roy's sidekick.

256
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,321
- I like the bat nose.
- Thank you.

257
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,922
- I love her so much now.
- Good.

258
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,890
I feel so much better
about the situation.

259
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,024
- How many hours we got today?
- Ten.

260
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,959
Awesome.
I'm gonna need 12 of them.

261
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,272
I'm still a little down
about how much work

262
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:44,607
I got done yesterday,

263
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,943
but I have a ton
of energy today.

264
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:49,245
First thing I do
is get my face done...

265
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,313
- That works, right?
- It's working.

266
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,312
The headpiece, which
is the device that controls

267
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,448
the brains to the brawn,

268
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,920
and now I'm sculpting
the chest piece.

269
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,290
I'm not happy with the piece
I sculpted,

270
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:04,094
but it needs to be molded
by the end of the day.

271
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:11,835
We have a lot of work to do,
so we start molding.

272
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,706
We need to get this ready to go
by the end of the day,

273
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,541
so we have our appliances
ready for the morning.

274
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,841
We're molding together.

275
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,342
I'm helping her out.
She's helping me out.

276
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:20,121
We're really working as a team.

277
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,787
Yeah.

278
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,368
Derek and I are doing
everything in silicone.

279
00:12:34,402 --> 00:12:37,474
So we need to get all of our
sculpting finished and molded

280
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,275
so that we can get
the silicone run,

281
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,643
and then we can focus
on making the props.

282
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:47,349
I honestly don't know
where Sarah's spending

283
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:48,416
all of her time.

284
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,584
Her design is very minimal.

285
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:53,053
It's an eye patch and a scar.

286
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,557
It seems like Derek is doing
most of the work.

287
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:00,931
I decide to go
with silicone again.

288
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:03,302
I'm hoping that it'll look good,
but I'm worried

289
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:06,569
about the weight of his face
and chest pieces.

290
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:08,570
Yeah.

291
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:11,742
All right, thank you.

292
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:14,047
Derek and I
are fabricating the props.

293
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:17,553
I'm making some goggles,
and he's making a helmet.

294
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,889
Hmm.

295
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,426
Are you doing
the goggles on it?

296
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:22,995
I'm thinking I am,
so it saves time.

297
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:24,361
Awesome.

298
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:26,163
I ended up spending lots of time
fabricating something

299
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:27,598
I don't need.

300
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,733
Sarah looks a little frustrated

301
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:30,268
'cause we're not
on the same page.

302
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:33,872
Hopefully we'll
get everything tied up.

303
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:36,275
Hey, everybody,
I am here with Ve.

304
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:37,576
We're gonna do
a little walk-through

305
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,911
and see how you're doing.

306
00:13:38,946 --> 00:13:41,248
Let's go.

307
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,981
Tell us your concept
of what you're creating

308
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:44,850
for a superhero and a sidekick.

309
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:46,588
This character is a scientist.

310
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,190
He's always been
wheelchair-bound.

311
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,225
As the brains of the operation,
he really needs muscle

312
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,026
to do all the harder work.

313
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,063
So the same apparatus
that he would be using

314
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:55,398
to make himself smarter,

315
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,902
we're going to put
onto the stronger guy,

316
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,871
so it would make him
super strong.

317
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,606
This guy looks very familiar.

318
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:05,144
He kind of looks like that weird
guy inside that pod suit...

319
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,412
- The queen also.
- And the queen.

320
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,081
Now you got three of them
that are very similar.

321
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,716
No.

322
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,151
Ve says, "it looks like
everything else you've done."

323
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,454
This is not good.

324
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:15,056
I will take note of that.

325
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,591
'Cause I won't be the only one
that will recognize that fact.

326
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,592
No, no.

327
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,261
She's giving me a hint now.

328
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:23,598
Change this, or there's probably
going to be trouble ahead.

329
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:24,667
Thank you.

330
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:26,402
Good luck.

331
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:27,837
It's never a good thing
when judges come through

332
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:30,506
and then say, "you should
probably change everything

333
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,607
about your sculpture."

334
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,911
We're doing minimal
prosthetics on her.

335
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,679
She has a big scar
across her lip.

336
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:39,082
You might consider taking
the scar down a little bit.

337
00:14:39,116 --> 00:14:41,050
She probably is attractive,
and you don't want to remove

338
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:42,417
that element
from your superhero.

339
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,319
Try to keep her
as sexy as possible,

340
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,120
especially if she's
in that '40s genre.

341
00:14:46,155 --> 00:14:48,587
I'd actually already
finished casting the scar,

342
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,387
so Derek and I
look at each other.

343
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,923
We're kind of like,
"well, let's pull it apart,

344
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,158
see what it looks like,

345
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:54,895
and then maybe we can just
quick re-sculpt it."

346
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,229
- We got the Dodge Charger.
- Love that.

347
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,595
Our characters' names
are Fire and Chaos.

348
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:00,729
Fire and Chaos, all right.

349
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,566
And Fire is
a daughter of the devil.

350
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,075
Chaos is sent along with her
as her guardian/troublemaker.

351
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,477
- What color is she gonna be?
- I'm sticking with reds.

352
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,447
But she's not
gonna be solid red?

353
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:13,216
- Oh, of course not.
- Good girl.

354
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,251
No, no.

355
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:17,191
We took the humber.
The giant tank.

356
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,460
The battle tank.

357
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:20,527
I'm pretty much concentrating
on the hero,

358
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:21,693
and he's got the sidekick.

359
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,262
Oh, so you did all
the sculpting on this.

360
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,432
- You did this.
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,104
This is her,
and she can morph her skin.

362
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:29,272
She's gonna have claws
and things that--

363
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:30,609
She's just combat ready.

364
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:31,977
It looks like
you're really going for it.

365
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,113
- I'm trying.
- Okay, good.

366
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:38,481
So what are your thoughts
of Rod and Jason?

367
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:40,313
They have the brains
and the brawn characters.

368
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:42,916
Yeah. He's repeating himself,
you know?

369
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,284
- A third time.
- Mm-hmm.

370
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,687
We don't want to see
the same thing every time.

371
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:49,588
Okay, let's move on
to Derek and Sarah.

372
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:51,257
I like their concept
and everything,

373
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:52,927
but they've really got to work
on their female.

374
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,030
Because they don't want to make
that female unattractive.

375
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,397
It's not gonna make
for a good superhero.

376
00:15:57,431 --> 00:15:59,564
Next we have Alana and Roy.

377
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,301
They're really
kind of a cohesive group.

378
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,403
They've got their backstory.

379
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:04,170
They're trying
to pull off a lot.

380
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:05,537
I hope they can do that.

381
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:08,207
All right, so let's
move on to Laura and Tommy.

382
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,742
I think they're
cool characters.

383
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:12,843
I don't know
if it's a cohesive idea.

384
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:16,614
A superhero that can morph--
Okay, cool.

385
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:18,684
Okay, everybody,
we are heading out.

386
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,818
It's looking good.
Good luck tomorrow.

387
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:22,320
Bye, everybody.

388
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,889
Bye, guys.

389
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:27,092
Okay.

390
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:29,525
After Ve's concerns
about my sculpture,

391
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,363
I'm determined to change
everything in this face

392
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:35,397
so nothing is similar.

393
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:39,366
So I start to reshape
the entire face.

394
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,700
Rod, Ve wants
to come back really quick.

395
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,598
I just want to say
one more thing to you.

396
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,232
The judges never come back.

397
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:47,235
This must be worse
than I thought.

398
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:54,299
Okay.

399
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,000
Ve hinted that I should change
my sculpture.

400
00:16:57,034 --> 00:17:00,770
So I'm determined to change
everything in this face

401
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:02,638
so nothing is similar.

402
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,173
Rod, Ve wants
to come back really quick.

403
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,740
I just want to say
one more thing to you.

404
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,808
Wow.
Ve coming back is serious.

405
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,310
I know I'm in trouble.

406
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,612
I like the fact that
you've taken off some wrinkles,

407
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,781
but it still looks
like the same guy.

408
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,515
So start thinking
about doing something

409
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,983
a little bit more aquiline,

410
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,785
to change the look
of the character.

411
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,658
I don't want to say too much,
but no droopy round-face guys.

412
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:23,692
Thank you.

413
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:24,991
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

414
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,867
Our inspiration
is the battle tank.

415
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:37,105
So I start working on my gun arm
and immediately change the idea

416
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,309
from it being a flamethrower arm
to being a grenade-launcher arm.

417
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:41,611
Boom!

418
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:47,744
I go back to molding
my hand pieces.

419
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:48,945
Fuck!

420
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,512
And the mold cracked.

421
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:51,912
Whenever you have a crack
in the mold,

422
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,646
one thing's gonna happen
for sure-- it's gonna break.

423
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,214
Cracked along the fingers.
The fingers curled up.

424
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:58,750
The piece just fell all apart,
and it's too late in the day

425
00:17:58,784 --> 00:18:00,653
to scrap the whole thing
and start over again.

426
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,389
So I've decided to risk it

427
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:04,193
and just finish the molds
the way that they are.

428
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:10,103
To piece it back together again,
it looks like Frankenstein,

429
00:18:10,137 --> 00:18:11,671
'cause it's all these pieces
just jammed together

430
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:13,339
with bubble gum and good luck.

431
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,580
I just keep on looking
at the clock, going...

432
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:19,781
Mm.

433
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:22,549
I'm being forced
to re-sculpt the face

434
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,184
in a very short amount of time.

435
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:26,320
Is this square enough?

436
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,656
And then also,
is it just a good makeup?

437
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,726
You know, more importantly,

438
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,262
is it gonna move
on his face well?

439
00:18:32,296 --> 00:18:34,298
This sculpt
I'm just not thrilled with,

440
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:38,236
but this is the best I can do
in this amount of time.

441
00:18:40,876 --> 00:18:42,744
- That's really coming together.
- No, it's not.

442
00:18:42,778 --> 00:18:43,877
- It's falling apart...
- Oh.

443
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:45,211
Is the problem.

444
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:47,044
Try some epoxy.

445
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,079
- Some what?
- Epoxy.

446
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,319
Thank you.

447
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:56,987
I managed to salvage the molds,

448
00:18:57,022 --> 00:18:58,723
so I poured some polyfoam
into them

449
00:18:58,757 --> 00:19:00,558
to give them more stability.

450
00:19:00,593 --> 00:19:02,060
I also need to keep
the molds hollow

451
00:19:02,094 --> 00:19:03,495
for the actor's hands.

452
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:05,429
So I saran-wrap my arm...

453
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:10,299
And then insert my arm
into the molds

454
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:13,504
while the polyfoam is curing.

455
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:15,774
I'm absolutely slow.

456
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:17,208
Rod's really behind.

457
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:19,810
I'm just trying to make sure
our superheroes get done.

458
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:21,877
So I have to do
as much as I can,

459
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,711
but it's just a lot
of weight to carry

460
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,144
when you know
you're already behind.

461
00:19:25,178 --> 00:19:26,643
I don't care
what this looks like,

462
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:29,511
it just needs to be done
by the end of the day.

463
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:41,259
That's time, everybody!

464
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:44,294
Because of this re-sculpt,
Jason and I didn't get to do

465
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:45,960
many other things
that needed to take place.

466
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:47,594
I don't like waiting
till the last minute,

467
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:49,161
but we have no choice.

468
00:19:59,436 --> 00:20:00,703
Okay.

469
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,474
It's application day.

470
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,610
We have four hours in the lab

471
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:09,314
and then one hour left
on last looks.

472
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:12,485
Jason has a silicone appliance
that he has to apply now.

473
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,620
I have my prosthetic.

474
00:20:13,654 --> 00:20:15,556
But we really need
to get two neck pieces

475
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,658
and two headpieces
run in polyfoam.

476
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,960
All of this is using up
our very limited amount of time

477
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:22,697
to actually do applications.

478
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:27,202
See that flamethrower
back there?

479
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:28,236
- Yeah.
- That's you.

480
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,771
These are your headpieces.

481
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,572
This is what gives you,
uh, your superpowers.

482
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,774
This is ripping everywhere.

483
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:40,843
I put a shellac coating over
my cowl when I ran the foam,

484
00:20:40,877 --> 00:20:42,677
but I didn't let
the shellac dry,

485
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:45,176
and it caused my foam to burn.

486
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,211
If you burn foam,
it's not stretchy anymore,

487
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,279
and it will tear very easily.

488
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:49,548
Just...

489
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,550
And that's what's happening.

490
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,522
It's a hot mess.

491
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,959
We are gonna be using silicone
for this project.

492
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:02,097
I've never worked with silicone,
but I want to try to get

493
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:05,304
that transparency that's just
a little different than foam.

494
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:06,740
It's a little heavier,

495
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,476
so I'm a little worried
about applying it.

496
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,043
How much longer on that, Alana?

497
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:14,148
Done. I'm just
waiting for it to dry.

498
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:15,184
Okay, don't worry
about that right now.

499
00:21:15,218 --> 00:21:16,552
Go ahead and get started
on Jenny.

500
00:21:16,586 --> 00:21:17,753
Alana's job is to apply
the bald caps,

501
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:19,588
and it's just taking forever.

502
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:21,556
Yo, Alana, it doesn't
have to be pretty.

503
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,026
It just has to be functional.

504
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:26,764
The silicone
was not the right color

505
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:28,267
for his skin,

506
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:31,337
so I have to airbrush
the whole thing a new color.

507
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:32,638
So you kind of lose the effect

508
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:34,507
that silicone would give you
to begin with,

509
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,077
which is the translucency
that it has.

510
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:37,913
- Laura.
- Yes, sir?

511
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,715
- It's just not working.
- What isn't?

512
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,816
This whole thing.

513
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,917
This is coming
out of the bald cap.

514
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,219
This is tearing up.

515
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:44,788
I'm thinking about taking
this fucking thing off.

516
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:45,857
Tommy is having some issues.

517
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:47,828
The cowl ripped.
The edges were bad.

518
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:51,067
It's just a spiral
of bad coincidences.

519
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,169
Just stick to the plan.

520
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:54,005
All this can be covered
with hair,

521
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,607
- and we'll hide it.
- All right.

522
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:56,776
Just keep going.
Just keep going.

523
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,178
All right.

524
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:00,380
The whole time that
we're doing the application,

525
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:02,316
I'm worried that
I don't have enough stuff.

526
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:03,883
Everybody else
has way more prosthetics

527
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:05,551
or at least bigger prosthetics.

528
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:08,089
Got the beauty makeup to do,
also a really cool hairstyle.

529
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:11,160
So I'm hoping
that's gonna be enough.

530
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:12,728
Roy, we got 30 minutes left.

531
00:22:12,762 --> 00:22:16,129
We got less
than 30 minutes left.

532
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:26,710
♪

533
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,380
- And that's time, everyone!
- Awesome.

534
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:30,482
- That's it.
- That's it.

535
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,684
Time.

536
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:32,853
All right, everybody, let's go.

537
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:33,956
I'm definitely feeling
a little nervous.

538
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,090
I'm a little worried
about the jaw.

539
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:36,224
It's a little heavy.

540
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:37,458
There's a big chin.
Big lips.

541
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:39,825
And, uh, I haven't glued it
down yet.

542
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,159
So I have to do that
during last looks.

543
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:45,126
Coming up...

544
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,395
Anything can happen
when you walk out onstage.

545
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,734
Everything about it
screams comic book to me.

546
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,134
She just looks like
she has dirty makeup on.

547
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,518
It's last looks. I have
one hour to complete my makeup.

548
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:05,185
I'm not happy about
how far behind Rod and I are.

549
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,420
I still have to airbrush
the whole thing

550
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,854
and lay down his eyebrows,

551
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,257
lay down some hair work
around his forehead.

552
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,891
But anything can happen
when you walk out onstage.

553
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:19,165
- Do you see his chin, Derek?
- I'll get it.

554
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,566
- Okay.
- Open your mouth.

555
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,569
I have to finish
gluing down the jaw,

556
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,306
and it's not staying.

557
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:27,743
The jaw seems
a little to heavy.

558
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:29,676
Are you about done on painting?

559
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,880
Almost done. I'm just about
to get those flames on her,

560
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,684
but I don't know
how to do that.

561
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:36,457
Alana's job is to apply
the flames on her arms.

562
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:37,826
She starts panicking
a little bit.

563
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:40,396
I'm so worried
about this not working out.

564
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,734
- You think it will work?
- Stop worrying.

565
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:45,138
I tell you what to do
and you do it-- that's it.

566
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:48,443
Take tape, wrap around it,
pull the gloves up.

567
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:52,115
- She's done.
- You look like a superhero.

568
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:58,324
Five minutes, everybody!
Five minutes!

569
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,559
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, get the flamethrower.

570
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:01,928
Excuse me, coming through.

571
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,804
And that's time, everyone.
Brushes down.

572
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,436
- Brushes down.
- All right.

573
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:12,073
I'm not sure how it's gonna go.
We did our best.

574
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:14,311
We both know that
this is not our strength.

575
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:18,377
It's not something
that I'm really proud of.

576
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,324
Oh, my God!

577
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,526
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

578
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,798
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

579
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:38,298
Say hello to your judges--

580
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,833
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick...

581
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,735
- Hello.
- Hi.

582
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,372
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

583
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:48,508
- Evening, guys.
- Hey.

584
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:51,411
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page...

585
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:52,411
Hello.

586
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:53,877
- Hey.
- Hello.

587
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:55,245
And joining our panel
this week...

588
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,283
He's an actor,
writer, and director

589
00:24:57,317 --> 00:25:01,221
with a huge fan following
for films like <i>Clerks, Dogma,</i>

590
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,523
and most recently, <i>Red State.</i>

591
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:07,898
He also runs a podcast empire
at smodcast.com.

592
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:11,001
Please give a warm welcome
to Kevin Smith.

593
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:12,268
Whoo!

594
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,236
Hi.

595
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,937
This is phenomenal, man.

596
00:25:16,972 --> 00:25:18,772
I literally feel like
I'm on the deck

597
00:25:18,807 --> 00:25:20,074
of a star destroyer.

598
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,012
Kevin Smith is an amazing

599
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:27,148
writer/director/
comic-book enthusiast.

600
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:28,384
I love Kevin Smith.

601
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,388
I got into filmmaking
because of Kevin Smith.

602
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:32,290
He made me believe
that I could do it myself.

603
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,058
Well, thank you so much
for being here.

604
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:35,827
Thanks for having me, man.
I'm ready to judge.

605
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:37,930
- That's what I'm here for.
- Fantastic.

606
00:25:37,964 --> 00:25:40,064
Well, everyone knows that
you are a huge comic-book fan.

607
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:42,465
You've even written
for <i>Daredevil, Batman.</i>

608
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,434
In your opinion,
what does it take

609
00:25:44,468 --> 00:25:46,202
to make a great superhero?

610
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:47,904
You got to kill
their parents early on.

611
00:25:47,938 --> 00:25:49,172
- Really?
- Oh, hands down.

612
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:51,906
Orphans, that's what makes
a great superhero.

613
00:25:54,576 --> 00:25:57,044
This week your spotlight
challenge was to create

614
00:25:57,078 --> 00:25:59,981
a superhero and sidekick
that would use the vehicles

615
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,317
you chose.

616
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,254
So let's see
what you came up with.

617
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:27,675
Our models walk out onstage,

618
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:30,678
and I love the contrast
between the two,

619
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:33,183
and I am hoping
that the judges realize

620
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,786
that the contrast
was deliberate.

621
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:54,208
It fits the genre
of what we were going for

622
00:26:54,242 --> 00:26:55,376
the best we could,

623
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,146
so I'm not sure
how this is gonna go.

624
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:18,400
Overall, the look of everything

625
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,204
and the cohesion
that the characters have

626
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,138
with the background,
with the motorcycle--

627
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,508
we're both feeling
pretty good about it.

628
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,358
I can't keep my eyes
off of Britney.

629
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:45,231
I think she's popping.
I think she's so confident.

630
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:47,166
And Jenny is just
this cute little imp

631
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,866
and just, like,
scurrying along behind her,

632
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,769
and it just looks fabulous.

633
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,711
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look.

634
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,252
I go right for the nails.
What does that say about me?

635
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,323
Well, see the inside
of your hands.

636
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:15,226
See, to me, that's
kind of interesting.

637
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,300
This is the edge
of the bald cap.

638
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:24,102
His muscles are getting so big

639
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,605
that he's busting out
of his skin.

640
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:28,642
That sculpture
does not say that to me.

641
00:28:28,676 --> 00:28:32,479
I'm just hoping that ve
can see that I listened to her.

642
00:28:32,513 --> 00:28:35,916
I changed everything.
It may not be enough.

643
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,252
I mentioned to Rod
that all of his sculptures

644
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:39,855
were looking very similar.

645
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,425
He's changed it a little bit,

646
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,694
but it still
looks like the same guy.

647
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:46,429
I sense trouble.
I could be the one going home.

648
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:51,732
We want to know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

649
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:57,971
I mentioned to Rod
that all of his sculptures

650
00:28:58,006 --> 00:28:59,773
were looking very similar.

651
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:02,212
I see ve talking
to the other judges

652
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:04,280
about the face that I did.

653
00:29:04,314 --> 00:29:07,116
He's changed it a little bit,
but it still looks like

654
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,317
the same guy.

655
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:11,954
And that is nerve-racking.

656
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:14,324
Now, this is
kind of interesting.

657
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:16,327
Can you open your mouth?

658
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:20,532
I hate mouth inside of mouth.

659
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:22,401
I just don't know what this is.

660
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:25,269
I mean, it's undefined.
Looks like he's into scars.

661
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:29,710
Well, it's supposed
to be a scar, yes.

662
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:32,014
Oh, my God.
Can I touch this?

663
00:29:33,718 --> 00:29:35,219
Tilt your head down
so we can take a look

664
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:37,923
at how this all integrates
in what's going on up here.

665
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:39,591
Looks like there
might have been some horns

666
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:40,592
supposed to be here.

667
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:41,726
How does it feel to wear?

668
00:29:41,761 --> 00:29:43,364
- All right.
- That's important.

669
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,034
You don't want to be on set
with somebody that's like,

670
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:48,806
"get it off!"

671
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:50,042
Move your hand.

672
00:29:50,077 --> 00:29:52,279
This is the character
I most identified with.

673
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:01,082
Kevin, you're a super fan.
What do you think?

674
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:02,919
This is stuff I've dreamed
about since I was a kid.

675
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:04,553
Back when I was a youngster,

676
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:07,118
I wanted to do special effects
and makeup.

677
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:10,089
You guys
did a great, great job.

678
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,691
The judges would like to speak
with each of you

679
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,257
to learn more about your work.

680
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:17,329
Laura and Tommy,
please step up.

681
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,975
Start us off
telling us the backstory.

682
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:25,144
Arthur Flynn,
AKA Kid Dynamite--

683
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:27,615
he's a special ops
demolition expert,

684
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:30,220
and he notices
his love is captured,

685
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:31,856
and he's like,
"I'm gonna break her out."

686
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,058
So he's lighting
all this dynamite,

687
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,760
and it blows off his hand
and my goggles.

688
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,295
And his face gets torn to crap,
but he rescues Thorn,

689
00:30:38,329 --> 00:30:40,662
and they both
are on the run now.

690
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,764
Laura, I see one
of the only makeups

691
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,301
with elements
of existing superheroes.

692
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:48,907
It feels like
a mutant superhero.

693
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:52,278
I think that the work
that you did as a team

694
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:55,279
is extremely polarized.

695
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,211
In plain English,
I like that...

696
00:30:58,245 --> 00:31:00,412
And I hate that.

697
00:31:00,447 --> 00:31:03,246
Tommy, your guy looks
like a football player

698
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,416
that got put
through a meat grinder.

699
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,986
Laura has got
a complete makeup job there.

700
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:12,189
Your attention to detail,
with her nails, her fingers,

701
00:31:12,223 --> 00:31:13,456
everything is still on her.

702
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,062
She's all intact,
and she's beautiful.

703
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:18,597
Boy, what a bunch
of hard-asses.

704
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:20,432
They both are very evocative.

705
00:31:20,466 --> 00:31:23,032
This is very Geiger-esque
on this side.

706
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:25,536
This over here,
Toxic Avenger-esque.

707
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,738
I think that's cool
because it calls to mind

708
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,271
something immediately.

709
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:32,173
But I love this.
This is fun for me.

710
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:34,406
- Please step back.
- Thank you.

711
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:38,807
Jason and Rod,
please step forward.

712
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,814
Now, tell me
what makes these guys

713
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,351
as cool as that car back there?

714
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:50,683
Um, these headpieces
are what gives them superpowers.

715
00:31:50,718 --> 00:31:52,415
We immediately thought,
just looking at that the car,

716
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,449
that that's a rich person's car,
for sure.

717
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:57,386
And they would have a driver and
that would be a good disguise

718
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,653
to go with during the day.

719
00:31:58,688 --> 00:32:01,056
Yesterday when
I did the walk-through,

720
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,893
I had a really long talk
with you,

721
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:04,862
- not once, but twice...
- Yes.

722
00:32:04,896 --> 00:32:06,430
About not doing the same guy.

723
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:09,033
Let me just say this-- it still
looks like the same guy.

724
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:10,401
Mm-hmm.

725
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:12,405
He's got a fat head
like all the other guys did.

726
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,508
Mm-hmm.

727
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:14,578
And you did not change
the mouth.

728
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:16,347
It still has
a turned-down mouth.

729
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:19,851
I'm disappointed that you didn't
think out of your little box

730
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:20,952
with your fat head.

731
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:23,656
Now, as far as you go,
explain to me

732
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,458
what those pieces
are supposed to be.

733
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:27,193
That's supposed to be,
like, when he gets pumped up

734
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:28,261
from the superpowers,

735
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:30,196
his skin is splitting
and cracking.

736
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:32,799
It doesn't really
read like that.

737
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:35,431
It just looks like weird patches
of some kind of growth

738
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:36,632
he has going on.

739
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:39,099
And as far as you using silicone
on his face,

740
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,068
you've destroyed it
by painting it too dark.

741
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,504
Your concept--

742
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,642
muscles expanding
and skin tearing--

743
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:47,710
you didn't do a good job
conveying that.

744
00:32:47,745 --> 00:32:50,511
You put a coat over it,
and we can't see it.

745
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,080
Do you mind
taking your coat off?

746
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:54,048
The guy's got
an incredible physique.

747
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,150
Don't put him in a coat.

748
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:57,787
It's gonna automatically
feel superhero.

749
00:32:57,822 --> 00:33:01,424
The devices that you created
as props are bothersome to me,

750
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,526
because it's a cool idea,

751
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,200
but there's no level
to the detail.

752
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,534
It's just a flat thing.

753
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,401
I don't know why
you picked floppy foam.

754
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:12,270
It's not even sitting
on their heads correctly.

755
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:13,705
Jason, Rod...

756
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,241
Step back.

757
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:20,714
Derek and Sarah.

758
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:27,320
Real quick--
explain the concepts.

759
00:33:27,354 --> 00:33:28,821
When we saw the bike,

760
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:32,124
we thought Dick Tracy
meets Indiana Jones.

761
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,228
The detail
of the lower-jaw piece--

762
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,730
it doesn't work for me
when I see that his bottom lip

763
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,203
is somewhere
buried in the makeup.

764
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:42,404
As soon as you
bake in an expression,

765
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,037
you do not give your character
the opportunity to emote

766
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:46,805
beyond what we see here.

767
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,405
Sarah, for you,
it's kind of cool,

768
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,539
but I just don't see the work.

769
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,876
I like the insignia
that you guys came up with.

770
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:55,945
Shocking nobody else
has done that yet.

771
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,281
This feels most like
a superhero team to me.

772
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:01,514
Thank you.

773
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:05,582
The eye patch-- in your mind,
how does it stay on?

774
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:07,284
Glue.

775
00:34:07,318 --> 00:34:11,354
Why would she
glue her eye patch on?

776
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:14,190
There's riveted plate
all over your vehicle.

777
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:17,023
Doesn't it make more sense to
have used the riveted-plate idea

778
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,820
that was so conspicuous?

779
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:21,656
Yeah, that's what you said.

780
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,493
Okay, guys,
explain to me--

781
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,428
it looks like this
should have been up higher.

782
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,562
Did it just slip?

783
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:29,063
- It's just slipping.
- Dang.

784
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:31,598
Sarah, I know yesterday
when I saw your sculpture,

785
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:34,835
which was this humongous thing
that was gonna be on her mouth--

786
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,304
I'm really glad
that you didn't do that,

787
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:38,139
but I think you might have gone
a little too far

788
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:39,407
in the other direction.

789
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:41,675
She just looks like
she has dirty makeup on.

790
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,975
And that's kind of unfortunate.

791
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,378
Derek, Sarah, please step back.

792
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:47,579
Thanks, guys.

793
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,982
Alana and Roy.

794
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:01,492
This-- I can't
take my eyes off of it.

795
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:03,759
I need to know the backstory,

796
00:35:03,794 --> 00:35:05,692
'cause this reminds me
of me and my wife, man.

797
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:08,226
Tall, hot chick,

798
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,030
trolly-looking dude
sitting at her knee

799
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,333
trying to get some play.

800
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:13,700
This is Fire and Chaos.

801
00:35:13,734 --> 00:35:16,099
Fire is a daughter of Satan,

802
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,701
and she's curious
about the human world,

803
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:19,070
so she comes to the surface,

804
00:35:19,105 --> 00:35:21,140
and Chaos is sent along
to cause trouble.

805
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:24,675
The way you did the flames
is really cool.

806
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:28,043
This reminds me
of a comic book.

807
00:35:28,077 --> 00:35:31,213
Please give us what each
of your contributions were.

808
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,616
I sculpted the face.

809
00:35:32,651 --> 00:35:35,524
I cut out all the pieces
of accuform here.

810
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:38,459
I assisted Roy
in his creature suit.

811
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:40,494
And Roy did
a lot of work as well.

812
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:43,797
This is the only team
that represents

813
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:46,299
comic-book art to me.

814
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:50,207
And I don't even need to ask
how it matches the vehicle,

815
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:51,675
which is awesome.

816
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,944
I think the two characters meld
together really well as well.

817
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:55,446
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

818
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,582
I know that you had sculpted
a whole different sculpt, right?

819
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,152
You were trying
to put the flames

820
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:00,386
into her head, into the makeup,

821
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:02,053
and you switched over to this.

822
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:04,489
I think that was probably
a really good choice.

823
00:36:04,524 --> 00:36:06,527
I would love to see them driving
down the street together.

824
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:08,831
That would be hysterical.

825
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:10,965
Alana, Roy,
will you please step back?

826
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:12,132
Thank you, guys.

827
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,900
Thank you, ladies.

828
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:18,871
All right, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

829
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:20,173
Please head back
to the makeup room

830
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:22,508
while they make
their decisions.

831
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:28,683
All right, guys, why don't
we talk about the looks

832
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:29,751
you liked the most?

833
00:36:29,785 --> 00:36:31,287
Let's start with Laura
and Tommy.

834
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,927
I think that one of the
strongest things about this team

835
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,730
is that Laura's concept
is very <i>X-Men</i> superhero to me.

836
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:40,100
Laura does succeed
in making sure she fills the--

837
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:42,635
She took
the comic-book thing literally.

838
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,235
- Yep.
- All right, let's do this.

839
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,237
I think that was brilliant.

840
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,173
The paint job
was really striking,

841
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,575
and I think she
has a great silhouette.

842
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,243
It's very superhero-looking.

843
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:54,081
The kid dynamite thing
was not nearly as strong.

844
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:56,015
The thick neck
kind of throws you off.

845
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,550
Laura's definitely superhero,

846
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,187
and for that reason
and that reason alone,

847
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:01,554
this team ends up
in the top looks.

848
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:05,057
All right, let's move on
to Alana and Roy.

849
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:06,458
Very colorful.

850
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:08,560
I mean, they were definitely
the most colorful duo out there.

851
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:10,428
The flames on the character
that she created

852
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:12,697
is immediately
recognizable to me

853
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,466
as an actual
comic-book character.

854
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,469
This week, that's
making me love this makeup.

855
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:20,104
Let's move on to the looks
you liked the least--

856
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:21,639
Jason and Rod's.

857
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:24,574
Jason and Rod just didn't feel
like as much effort was put in.

858
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,811
The idea was really clever,
the execution not so much.

859
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,980
The costume choices were
bizarre, to say the least.

860
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,249
There was nothing,
and particularly Jason--

861
00:37:33,283 --> 00:37:35,285
this guy had such
a fantastic physique.

862
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,720
Yes.

863
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,219
He wanted him to be the muscle,

864
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:39,453
and we barely see the muscle.

865
00:37:39,488 --> 00:37:41,022
It's like a little
peek-a-boo sport coat.

866
00:37:41,056 --> 00:37:43,227
Let's talk about the fact
that he used silicone

867
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,363
and then painted
this guy's face so dark.

868
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:48,331
His face was, like, about five
shades darker than his body.

869
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,367
Rod, for me, is failing
this week once again.

870
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,069
I specifically said to him,
"you have to change

871
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:57,239
the anatomy of this character
because it's the same person

872
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:59,409
we've seen every single time."

873
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,449
All right, let's move on
to Derek and Sarah.

874
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:04,584
There's nothing happening
on the female character.

875
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,221
I didn't care
for the wee eye patch

876
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:10,022
that is wood grain
that has no means of attachment.

877
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,692
Yeah.
It would have looked badass--

878
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:13,928
one spike right through
the middle of it.

879
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:15,697
It tells a story,
where you're like,

880
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:17,634
"oh, my God, that's how
it's stuck into her head?"

881
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:20,272
I was looking
for anything that told me

882
00:38:20,306 --> 00:38:21,740
there was a reason
it was glued on.

883
00:38:21,774 --> 00:38:23,907
My issue wasn't with her
as much as with him.

884
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,543
He reads as, "hey, I came
from the depths of hell."

885
00:38:26,577 --> 00:38:28,011
More monster-ish.

886
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,713
This makeup was
as muddy as it gets.

887
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:30,881
Yep.

888
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:32,982
Okay, judges, have you
made your decisions?

889
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:34,183
- Yes.
- I believe we have.

890
00:38:34,217 --> 00:38:37,351
- Let's bring them back out.
- Yeah.

891
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:45,493
Okay, Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

892
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:50,766
Our top teams tonight
are Gloria and Tommy.

893
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:53,206
The Dynamite character
was a bit of a mess,

894
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,241
but Thorn was
a really cool superhero

895
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:56,408
and helped hold it through.

896
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:58,475
Alana and Roy...

897
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,650
Your makeups both successfully
evoked the comic-book feel

898
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,586
we were looking for this week.

899
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,987
All right, so which team
came out on top?

900
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:09,091
Our top team tonight is...

901
00:39:14,984 --> 00:39:17,287
All right, so which team
came out on top?

902
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,421
Our top team tonight is...

903
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,995
Alana and Roy.

904
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,001
You guys did a lot
of work this week,

905
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,441
and you provided us with
two very complete characters,

906
00:39:34,476 --> 00:39:37,377
not to mention it tied in
really nicely with the car,

907
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:39,112
which was a huge part
of the challenge.

908
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:40,113
Well done.

909
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:42,282
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, guys.

910
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:46,087
Roy and Alana, great job.
But we can only have one winner.

911
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:47,389
So, Glenn...

912
00:39:47,423 --> 00:39:50,591
Our winner tonight is...

913
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,759
Alana.

914
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,131
Your character really
felt like she had stepped out

915
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:59,333
of the pages of a comic book--
Congratulations.

916
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:00,868
Thank you so much.

917
00:40:00,902 --> 00:40:03,505
This is the best makeup
I've ever done, ever.

918
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:07,176
And I know how much
Roy contributed to this as well.

919
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,443
But I could hear
the hallelujah chorus.

920
00:40:09,478 --> 00:40:10,645
I'm like, "Lord, take me now."

921
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,317
Alana, congratulations.

922
00:40:12,351 --> 00:40:14,586
You and Roy can head back
to the makeup room.

923
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,022
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

924
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:20,363
Laura, Tommy,
you are also safe this week.

925
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:22,365
You can head back
to the makeup room.

926
00:40:22,399 --> 00:40:24,164
- Thank you.
- Bye, Mr. Smith.

927
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:27,033
Uh, Mr. Smith
is my father, sir, so...

928
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,670
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

929
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:34,106
are on the bottom this week.

930
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,276
One of you will be eliminated.
Please step forward.

931
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:46,720
All right, so, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

932
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:48,121
Jason and Rod--

933
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:51,489
Poor sculpting, painting,
prop design, decision making.

934
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:53,558
Not a whole lot
was working for you.

935
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,559
Sarah and Derek--

936
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:59,731
We liked the overall concept,
but we just weren't sure

937
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:01,400
how you spent all of your time.

938
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:03,804
It felt like
so much was missing.

939
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:05,207
So who's going home tonight?

940
00:41:05,242 --> 00:41:09,076
The person going
home tonight is...

941
00:41:13,942 --> 00:41:17,144
Jason.

942
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:18,978
Your sculpture
just didn't represent

943
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:20,476
your concept at all.

944
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:23,175
The painting wasn't realistic.

945
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,110
All right, thank you
for the opportunity.

946
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:28,279
Jason, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

947
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:30,146
The rest of you are safe
and can head back

948
00:41:30,181 --> 00:41:32,781
to the makeup room.

949
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,750
You know what, man?

950
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,719
Forget these fools right here.
Come work for me, man.

951
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:42,290
We got some light makeup work
that we can do some stuff on

952
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:44,157
over at Smodco, if you want to.

953
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:45,392
Excellent.

954
00:41:45,426 --> 00:41:47,527
Jason, it has been great
having you here with us.

955
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:49,128
If you'll please head back
to the makeup room

956
00:41:49,162 --> 00:41:50,862
and pack up your kit.

957
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:52,564
Thank you, guys.

958
00:41:52,598 --> 00:41:54,465
- Thank you.
- See you Monday, dude.

959
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,733
- Bring doughnuts!
- Jelly?

960
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:56,900
Yes!

961
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,502
- All right.
- Look at me-- of course jelly.

962
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:01,735
I like that kid.

963
00:42:04,003 --> 00:42:05,335
It's me.

964
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,905
Aw, I'm sorry.

965
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,108
I'm disappointed
with the makeup that I just did,

966
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:13,682
and if I could do it again,
I'd do things differently.

967
00:42:13,716 --> 00:42:15,051
It sucks to go home,

968
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:16,985
but if anybody
was gonna send me home,

969
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:18,753
at least it was Kevin Smith.

970
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:20,958
The fact that I made it
this far is cool.

971
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:24,499
So I'm gonna just keep on
doing what I'm doing.
