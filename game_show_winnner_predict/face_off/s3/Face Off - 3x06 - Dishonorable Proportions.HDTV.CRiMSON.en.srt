00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,302
Well, great job today, guys.

180
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:49,506
I will see you all tomorrow
for your next challenge.

181
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,874
All: - Bye.
- Later.

182
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:53,076
- Bye.
- Thank you.

183
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:01,550
We walk into this bar,

184
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:07,222
and it is absolutely beautiful.

185
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:10,092
There's all this copper
and steel.

186
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:13,361
This could be steampunk.

187
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:14,896
Welcome to the Edison,

188
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,066
a world-class lounge known for
its authentic steampunk style.

189
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:22,236
Many of today's
most iconic makeups

190
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,572
are based on novels,
comic books

191
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,674
and... even video games.

192
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,978
Take a look at one of the most
anticipated games of the year...

193
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,713
<i>Dishonored.</i>

194
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,084
<i>Dishonored</i> is an immersive,
first-person action game

195
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:39,352
set in a steampunk Metropolis

196
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:42,756
where industry
and the supernatural collide.

197
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:46,392
The game is hyper stylized,
which is probably most evident

198
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,927
in the exaggerated
physical proportions

199
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,897
of its character classes.

200
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,066
[Contestants murmur]

201
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,267
This week's
spotlight challenge is

202
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,938
to create an original
and over-the-top version

203
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,439
of one of the game's characters

204
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,440
whose features have become
outrageously exaggerated

205
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,208
or distorted.

206
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,412
The game features many
classes of characters.

207
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,780
You will have four
to choose from.

208
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,515
The city watch.

209
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,685
They're a specialized guard unit
with sharp features.

210
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,920
The aristocrats.

211
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,754
They're very thin
and elongated.

212
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:17,821
The thugs.

213
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,289
With intimidating features

214
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:21,491
such as oversized,
broad shoulders.

215
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,326
And then we have the weepers.

216
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,795
They're very gaunt,

217
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:27,164
but their
most distinguishing feature is

218
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:31,301
that the plague actually makes
them bleed from the eyes.

219
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,636
All right, we have chosen
your names at random.

220
00:09:33,671 --> 00:09:36,439
Tommy, you're up first.

221
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:39,241
I picked the thug,
that brute of the underworld.

222
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,276
Oh, this will be great.

223
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,713
Rod, you're next.

224
00:09:50,453 --> 00:09:53,722
And Roy.

225
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,190
Now that you each have
your characters,

226
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:56,625
take some time here
to work on your designs.

227
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:57,960
Just so you know,

228
00:09:57,994 --> 00:09:59,828
Glenn is gonna be stopping by
in the lab

229
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,129
to help you with your concepts.

230
00:10:01,163 --> 00:10:02,764
Oh, boy.

231
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,765
I will see you soon.

232
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,332
- Thanks, girl.
- Bye.

233
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,001
Thank God I have immunity,

234
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:10,270
'cause... if you don't do
steampunk well,

235
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:12,573
Glenn is going to murder you.

236
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,949
I'm really not 100% sure
what I'm gonna do.

237
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:26,786
I just kind of
start drawing out long faces.

238
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,693
My concept is an aristocrat

239
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:36,162
who is going into his study,

240
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:38,196
when a hand grenade goes off,

241
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:40,899
and a display case shatters

242
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:42,467
and gets blown into his face.

243
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:46,071
My character is a cleric,
a holy priest.

244
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:48,240
So he's more educated
and more wise

245
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:51,877
and, that way,
a little bit more old.

246
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:53,878
And the concept for my thug
is that he's this engineer

247
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,381
whose bolting himself
back together

248
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:58,183
as he's creating weapons
for the underworld.

249
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,917
But, at the same time,
he's got to pay the bills,

250
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:03,421
so he's thugging on the side.

251
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,127
We get back to the lab,

252
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:14,331
pick our models
and get right to work.

253
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,233
I'm doing a guy.

254
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:20,771
I don't want
to spend any more time drawing.

255
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,074
I go right in
and start sculpting.

256
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,742
I want to take the features
of the aristocrat

257
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,311
and make it into a weeper,

258
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:31,481
as if this once was
a high-class citizen

259
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:35,518
who now is on the lowest
of the bottom of the barrel.

260
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:39,855
I don't want to rush
into just another fast sculpt,

261
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,357
because, in the last challenge,
he made a big deal about

262
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:44,293
always doing the same thing.

263
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,228
It was really disappointing,

264
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:50,098
because I've worked so hard
to change things up.

265
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:53,868
I'm shaken,
because I'm just not sure

266
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:56,238
what the judges are looking for.

267
00:11:56,272 --> 00:12:00,074
I know if I don't change it,
I'm in trouble.

268
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,042
Coming up...

269
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:04,478
I could not disagree
with you more.

270
00:12:04,513 --> 00:12:06,214
This is the worst thing
I've done on the show.

271
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,482
[Groans] It's just a disaster.

272
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,284
It no longer feels
like a human feature.

273
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,320
I think I could be on bottom.

274
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,188
I'm really shaken
by the last challenge,

275
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:23,292
because he said,
"you didn't change anything.

276
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,826
You just squared up the nose
and the cheeks."

277
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:27,795
So I'm now trying
to piece this puzzle together.

278
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:30,898
All the sculpts that I've done
had fabricated ears,

279
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:32,600
and maybe that's
the connection.

280
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,602
So instead of sculpting ears,

281
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:37,705
I am going to be using
the actor's real ears.

282
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,742
I want the judges
to know I'm listening to them.

283
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,282
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, how's it going?

284
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:49,750
Stopped by
to see what you're working on.

285
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:52,352
- How's it going?
- Hi.

286
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:54,854
Well, I have an aristocrat.

287
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,890
And I was seeing
all these male features

288
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:59,825
and having her
as someone more androgynous.

289
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:01,994
Work with bringing your
forehead back and up,

290
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:03,162
and the head back and out.

291
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,264
Figure out how
to get the game into that makeup

292
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:06,432
- and you'll be right on track.
- Okay.

293
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,867
I really want
to make my character look

294
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:12,838
like
an aristocrat-turned-weeper.

295
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:15,407
I could not disagree
with you more.

296
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:18,376
Starting off by
aligning yourself conceptually

297
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:20,445
with what two other people
are doing,

298
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,514
to me, is a little dangerous.

299
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,582
He, just straight up,
is just shooting me down.

300
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:26,651
You have a really cool
character class.

301
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:27,819
I would focus on that.

302
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:30,754
I totally respect
Glenn's opinion.

303
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:34,157
But I'm moving forward
in my own creative direction.

304
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:37,393
I'm gonna push myself,
and I'm gonna pull this off.

305
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:40,162
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

306
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:43,065
I am a little paranoid
about what I've heard from Ve.

307
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,434
I just wanted
to get your opinion

308
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:46,302
on doing an elongated head.

309
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:48,070
Yeah.
I think this is a great idea.

310
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,305
I love where this is going.

311
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,041
And I'd like to see someone work
with a makeup

312
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:53,408
where the eyes of the character

313
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:56,010
are not right where the eyes
of the performer are.

314
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,346
Show me what's happening.

315
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,947
Looks like you've got
some muttonchops going on.

316
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:00,215
I was thinking about something

317
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:01,583
that would give him
a little bit more character.

318
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:04,018
Cool hair pieces
are great opportunities

319
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:05,320
to the aesthetic
into the makeup.

320
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:07,055
- Concentrate on that makeup.
- That's--

321
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:09,290
- Let us really see
awesome sculpting,

322
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,826
playing with the proportions,
getting those scars in there.

323
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,927
- That's my plan, sir.
- Look forward to it.

324
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:15,062
All right.
Thank you.

325
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:16,397
Trying to stay away
with the--

326
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,332
the kind of sculpt I did
the last challenge,

327
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,933
which had a big jaw.

328
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,301
I mean, I have a thug so.

329
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:22,870
- That was last challenge?
- Yeah.

330
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,937
- This is completely different.
- Right.

331
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:25,472
So this is a good idea,

332
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:28,941
giving him a heavy brow,
thickening his jaw.

333
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:30,577
- Can't wait to see it.
- Thank you.

334
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,812
This leper that's still trying
to heal people--

335
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:34,514
that's very, very cool.

336
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:35,515
I like where this is going.

337
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,783
The one question I have is,

338
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,618
how are the proportions going
to be exaggerated?

339
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:40,787
That being a huge part
of the challenge.

340
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:43,389
I've already exaggerated
her jaw at least--

341
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,357
oh, my gosh--
an inch or so.

342
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:47,325
I'm trying to extend her nose.

343
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,227
That's what you've done
in your sketch.

344
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:51,397
Make sure that what's
happening here happens there,

345
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:53,198
- 'cause this is a cool idea.
- Okay.

346
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,934
Although the challenge is
about this amazing game,

347
00:14:55,968 --> 00:14:59,203
you should have human faces
and musculature laying

348
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,005
in front you all the time.

349
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,107
- Make those arms look real.
- Uh-huh.

350
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:04,542
Don't just throw it together
and go,

351
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:06,310
"oh, look, it's a proportion

are just God-awful.

all misshapen and look weird.

Perhaps some more base coat
with the airbrush

561
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,592

really good, dude.

All right, the judges would like
to speak with each of you

697
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,371
to learn more about your work.

698
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:35,609
Rod, please step up.

699
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:41,914
Could you start by telling us
about the concept?

700
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:43,448
He's an aristocrat.

701
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:44,983
He was going into his study

702
00:33:45,017 --> 00:33:46,784
when one
of his display cases exploded

703
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:48,953
and hit him in the face.

704
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:50,855
Did you have a particular
reference in mind

705
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:51,956
when you were sculpting?

706
00:33:51,991 --> 00:33:53,491
I went through
all the reference shots

707
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:54,826
from the game

708
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,227
and I just let that
influence me.

709
00:33:56,261 --> 00:33:57,829
It was delightful
when I saw him,

710
00:33:57,863 --> 00:33:59,663
because it's like nothing
you've done before.

711
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:01,364
Thank you.

712
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:02,633
Kind of reminded me of
my dad when he's upset with me.

713
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,668
He's just, "ugh!"

714
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:07,470
You know,
I really like the proportion.

715
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:10,240
But it just stops at the head
and becomes a bobble head.

716
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:12,943
So I assume the visibility
is through the nostrils,

717
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:14,344
- is that correct?
- Yes, it is.

718
00:34:14,378 --> 00:34:17,546
All those things were handled
beautifully in this makeup.

719
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,516
You picked what was important
within the challenge this week,

720
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,519
and came up with something
very successful.

721
00:34:23,553 --> 00:34:25,755
- Thank you.
- Rod, you can step back.

722
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:30,325
Thank you.

723
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,427
Tommy, you're up.

724
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:38,232
Hi, Tommy.
What's your concept here?

725
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:39,934
This is Tonka.

726
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,636
And he fabricates weapons
and stuff

727
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:43,271
for the local crime bosses.

728
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:44,605
What happened with the arms?

729
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,741
It looks like you got 'em
duct-taped on.

730
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:48,408
Well, I ran it in polyfoam,
and it was just really chunky,

731
00:34:48,442 --> 00:34:52,479
and it was just not gonna
go down well, so I just...

732
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:55,716
I really feel that you kind of
missed the boat here.

733
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,017
The popeye arms--

734
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:59,019
I understand what you
were going for,

735
00:34:59,054 --> 00:35:01,922
but nothing seems to have
been elevated or exaggerated,

736
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:04,123
in any way, in his face.

737
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:05,858
Your sculpting is poor.

738
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:07,459
The coloration is poor.

739
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:10,262
I'm very disappointed
in what you did this week.

740
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,799
I really don't see
very many elements of the game

741
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,200
or the other aspects
of the challenge.

742
00:35:14,234 --> 00:35:16,669
I would love
to have seen something

743
00:35:16,704 --> 00:35:18,537
with his jaw or his forehead.

744
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:19,771
His forehead
could have been massive

745
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:21,807
for the size of his face--

746
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:23,474
that would've been interesting.

747
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:25,210
Tommy, thank you.
If you'd please step back.

748
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:27,212
Thank you, guys.

749
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,120
Derek.

750
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:42,026
Let's start off
with your concept.

751
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,227
He's part of a gang of thugs.

752
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:45,129
The tattoos are signatures
of their look,

753
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:47,331
so people could tell
who they are.

754
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:48,398
His head is badass.

755
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:49,533
Thanks.

756
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,001
It's kind of
classic tough-look--

757
00:35:51,036 --> 00:35:53,636
which you're going for a thug,
so you've achieved that.

758
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,638
It feels very cohesive,
it's got a nice palate,

759
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:57,741
and it really does fit
within this world.

760
00:35:57,775 --> 00:35:59,242
Thank you.

761
00:35:59,276 --> 00:36:00,476
I do love the fact

762
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,245
that his nose
is all smashed in like that.

763
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,646
My father was a boxer,

764
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,714
and I remember seeing guys

765
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:06,750
that looked like this guy, so.
[Laughs]

766
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,316
You know what else I want
to say is

767
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:09,818
you did an ethnicity swap,
which is kind of a trip.

768
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:11,620
We went, "oh, yeah. Cool."

769
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:13,355
I love the aesthetic of it.

770
00:36:13,389 --> 00:36:14,757
- Good job.
- Thank you.

771
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:16,391
Derek, thank you very much.

772
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:19,094
You can step back.

773
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:20,495
Sarah, you're next.

774
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:30,071
Begin by explaining
your concept for us.

775
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,205
I have the aristocrat.

776
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,575
And so I decided
to enlarge the back of her head

777
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,745
and try
to angle out her features.

778
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,880
If feels like you're trying

779
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:40,748
to make the character fit
into the game.

780
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:44,117
However, there some striking
anatomical inaccuracies

781
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:45,552
in the sculpture.

782
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:48,656
You've lost the shape
of the human cranium in there,

783
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,824
and so now it doesn't look
disproportionate to me,

784
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:52,826
it looks malformed.

785
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,763
If her face was locked
into an expression

786
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,397
that said aristocrat--

787
00:36:57,431 --> 00:37:00,466
sort of one eyebrow
higher than the other,

788
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,101
maybe one eye really big
compared to the other,

789
00:37:02,135 --> 00:37:04,203
with the other squinting,
right?

790
00:37:04,237 --> 00:37:06,906
I think that would have said
aristocratic.

791
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,973
You've got a monocle.

792
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,275
It would be perfect

793
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,177
to have that monocle
baked into her look.

794
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:14,413
I can think
of a half a dozen things

795
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:17,148
that would've made this
an amazing-looking aristocrat.

796
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:19,150
You could've elaborated
on the lips.

797
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:21,453
You could've done
some crazy thing with the hair.

798
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:25,190
I feel that you've lost
the vision on this one.

799
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:26,825
Sarah, thank you.
Will you please step back.

800
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,659
Thanks.

801
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:34,598
All right, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

802
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,300
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

803
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:38,936
while they make
their decisions.

804
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,107
All right, judges, why don't we

805
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:45,876
start with
the top looks of the night?

806
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:47,477
Let's begin with Rod.
What are your thoughts?

807
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:48,778
- I like it a lot.
- Yeah.

808
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,547
Because of the proportion.

809
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:52,716
It's not that creative
as a head sculpt,

810
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,884
but he added pores,

811
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:55,819
and he added wrinkles that seem
to make sense.

812
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:58,521
I think he made a lot
of smart decisions this week.

813
00:37:58,556 --> 00:37:59,990
If he would have made the body
just a little bit bigger

814
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:01,157
it would have helped,

815
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,424
'cause I loved
the whole look of it.

816
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:03,625
All right let's move on
to Derek.

817
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,962
It fits the game perfectly.

818
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:08,464
He addressed all the elements
of that period,

819
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:10,166
as well as the fact
that he was supposed

820
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,968
to exaggerate
all those features.

821
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:13,102
So what do you think
about the arm?

822
00:38:13,136 --> 00:38:16,105
I think the arm is way too big!

823
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,639
It could have been half as big
and still have been gigantic.

824
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:22,077
All right, let's move on to
the looks you liked the least.

825
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:24,279
- Let's start with Tommy.
- Oy vey.

826
00:38:24,313 --> 00:38:26,214
I don't know what the hell

827
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:27,916
he was thinking about
this week.

828
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,385
He's not making smart choices.

829
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:33,587
Terrible job on anatomy that's
so abundantly available.

830
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:35,289
Just roll your sleeve up,
take a look.

831
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,824
It's hard not to look at
your arm while you're sculpting.

832
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:38,993
- Yeah.
- Actually, it's sort of

833
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,961
in the way, isn't it?
[Laughter]

834
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:42,796
And then duct-tape the whole
thing together, you know.

835
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,131
Let's move on to Sarah.

836
00:38:44,165 --> 00:38:45,832
- I'm bummed out about Sarah.
- Yeah.

837
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:47,601
Disappointing
performance from Sarah.

838
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:49,436
I think one of the worst.

839
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,772
She wanted pointy features.
I get it.

840
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:54,040
She didn't have the sculptural
skills to make that happen.

841
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:55,509
She didn't round things off.

842
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:56,710
She didn't put any skin texture
over them.

843
00:38:56,744 --> 00:38:57,744
No.

844
00:38:57,779 --> 00:38:59,112
There's nothing
organic-feeling.

845
00:38:59,146 --> 00:39:01,114
- Yeah.
- It does not feel <i>Dishonored.</i>

846
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:02,849
At all.

847
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:03,983
It certainly is not part
of this franchise.

848
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:05,051
All right, judges,

849
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,619
have you made
your decisions then?

850
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,053
Ve & Neville: - I think so.
- Yeah, we have.

851
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:09,588
Let's bring them back out.

852

00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:03,659
of the game's aesthetic

872
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,494
and the exaggerated-proportions
element of this challenge.

873
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,595
Well done.

874
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,063
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

875
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:11,633
I'm feeling great,
this is my second win.

876
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,134
Last time I won,
my brother went home,

877
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:14,335
so I didn't really get
to enjoy it.

878
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,371
But this time I'm definitely
enjoying it,

879
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:17,672
and I think my brother
would be proud.

880
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,408
- Derek, congratulations.
- Thank you.

881
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:21,742
You can head back
to the makeup room, please.

882
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:26,813
- See you guys.
- Thank you.

883
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:29,182
Rod, you are also safe.

884
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:31,417
Will you please head back
to the makeup room.

885
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:36,355
Unfortunately, that means

886
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,357
you guys are
on the bottom this week.

887
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,926
One of you will be eliminated.

888
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,462
Will you please step forward.

889
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:52,705
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about the bottom looks.

890
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:55,808
Tommy, you seem to have
really struggled this week.

891
00:40:55,842 --> 00:40:57,509
I think you spent a ton of time
on those hands,

892
00:40:57,543 --> 00:41:00,078
and it was very detrimental
to the rest of your makeup.

893
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:01,645
Sarah, you had some issues

894
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,514
with the structure
of your sculpture.

895
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,416
And it also seems that,
somewhere along the way,

896
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,120
you lost track of your vision.

897
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:10,454
So who's going home tonight?

898
00:41:10,488 --> 00:41:12,990
The person leaving
tonight is...

899
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:21,131
Tommy.

900
00:41:21,165 --> 00:41:23,567
We just couldn't look past
the fact that there was

901
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:26,303
no recognizable structure
to your sculpture.

902
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:28,038
We also felt the makeup

903
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:30,073
simply didn't meet the criteria
of this challenge.

904
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:32,508
It's been a hell of a ride.

905
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:33,876
I worked really hard
to get here,

906
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,378
and it's been a pleasure
to meet all three of you.

907
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:40,082
I hope to see you guys
again soon.

908
00:41:40,117 --> 00:41:41,384
Sarah, you are safe.

909
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:45,688
If you would please head back
to the makeup room.

910
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:50,225
Tommy, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

911
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,060
I'm really glad that we got
a chance to meet you,

912
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:55,196
and I think that your passion
is very obvious.

913
00:41:55,231 --> 00:41:57,165
All you need
to do is keep working on it.

914
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,634
Thank you.

915
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:00,369
Tommy, it's been great having
you here with us.

916
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:03,104
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

917
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:04,472
and pack up your kit.

918
00:42:04,506 --> 00:42:05,606
- Thank you, Tommy.
- See you, guys.

919
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:06,641
Good luck, Tommy.

920
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:08,509
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

921
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:14,715
[Whimpers]
Mr. Pietch.

922
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,817
I pushed the limits of what
I thought I could do every time.

923
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:18,586
- It was fun.
- Yeah.

924
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,987
And, in that respect,
I have no regrets.

925
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:22,355
I've learned more
than I ever thought I would,

926
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,957
just experimenting
and trying out other techniques.

927
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:26,875
I feel like I could probably do
anything right now.

928
