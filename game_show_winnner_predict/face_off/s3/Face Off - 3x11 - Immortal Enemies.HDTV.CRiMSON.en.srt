1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,792
Tonight, on part one of
the season finale of <i>Face Off.</i>

2
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,196
Only three artists remain.

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,199
And you, America,
will choose one to win it all.

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,467
Laura.

5
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:20,302
A lot of my work
has been theme parks.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,240
If I win,
I could start my career.

7
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:26,009
It's so well done,
it blows my mind.

8
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,343
Derek.

9
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:29,512
I cannot believe that
I've made it this far.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,516
I want to make
my mom and dad proud.

11
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:36,753
- He's a really good designer.
- Nicole.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,121
I was eliminated,
but I came back with a bang.

13
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,090
I have so much to prove.

14
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:42,692
I have to win this.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,227
I'm really proud of the fight
from her since she's come back.

16
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,329
- And later--
- What's up, guys?

17
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:50,066
There's something huge
that I have not told you yet.

18
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,434
This is freaking me out.

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,703
Fuck.

20
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:55,104
I feel like such an asshole.

21
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:57,460
Rod has to start
working faster.

22
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:01,526
Why am I gonna win her $100,000

23
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,427
when I should be
winning it for myself?

24
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:06,784
And then they'll battle it out
in an explosive final challenge.

25
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,787
This is the hardest thing
I will ever do.

26
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:11,889
I'm about to start crying.

27
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:13,390
It's the finale.
You know, it's gonna be huge.

28
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,026
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,198
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

30
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,834
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

31
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:26,336
in New York and Paris,

32
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:31,341
a new 2012 Toyota Prius V,
and $100,000.

33
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,944
And for the first time ever,
America, your voice

34
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,346
will be heard
in selecting the winner.

35
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:39,483
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

36

37
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:23,326
Am I missing any strands
in the back?

38
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,129
- Are any of the strands, like--
- Yeah.

39
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:26,812
- Damn it!
- Right in here.

40
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,975
It's a little odd in the house.

41
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,837
Everybody is gone except me
and Nicole and Derek.

42
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,605
I'm just getting ready
for the day,

43
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:37,440
and thinking about my husband.

44
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:39,276
I mean, this is easily
the longest I've been

45
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:41,679
without talking or seeing him.

46
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,614
So I'm walking downstairs,
and all of a sudden

47
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:47,384
there's a computer
that wasn't there before.

48
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:51,088
Oh, my God!
Hi, honey!

49
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:53,757
- Hey, honey.
- Hi.

50
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:58,428
Sorry. Sorry.
I just missed you.

51
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:01,165
Oh, my God! Mom!

52
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,532
Hi!

53
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,936
It's my mom.
My mom and my little sister.

54
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:08,605
- I made it!
- We are, like, beaming.

55
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:10,207
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

56
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,641
I haven't seen you in so long.

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,343
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

58
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,145
It's my wife.

59
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:16,646
I definitely think about her
all the time when I'm here.

60
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:17,981
I miss her.

61
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,583
I've been rooting for you
the entire time.

62
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,984
I could not be more proud.

63
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:23,553
Being without Carlo,
I've really had to dig deep

64
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,790
and find something
to keep focused.

65
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,291
One more challenge.

66
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,062
You've got this.
You are the one.

67
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:35,099
Back home I told mom,
"if I make it back on the show,

68
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,734
I'm gonna go to the end,
I'm gonna win it."

69
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,202
You know,
"I'm gonna do this."

70
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,037
And she's like, "I know.
I know you're gonna do it."

71
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,739
- Kisses.
- Love you, baby girl.

72
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,173
Bye!

73
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,242
Well, I love you. I gotta go.
And I'll see you soon.

74
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,078
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.

75
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:52,482
Getting to see her gives me
some inspiration to work harder.

76
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,389
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my God.

77
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,091
Walking into the lab today,

78
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,026
I immediately see,
like, a harvest.

79
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:06,997
There's tombstones and, like,
gargoyles and skulls.

80
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:08,531
Oh, it's Halloween.

81
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,135
Welcome to the finale.

82
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,570
Your final spotlight challenge

83
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:18,508
is inspired by one of
the oldest celebrated holidays,

84
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:19,542
Halloween.

85
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,078
- Yes!
- Yeah, buddy.

86
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:22,412
I think we're all
qualified for this one.

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,148
Yeah.

88
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:27,284
I'm really excited 'cause, like,
that's why I got into makeup,

89
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,253
you know, was because
of my love for Halloween.

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,290
Each of you will create
two original characters.

91
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:36,126
The first is a demon
determined to spread chaos

92
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:37,661
throughout the living world.

93
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:41,265
And the second is a good witch
who will hunt that demon down

94
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:43,433
and banish it back to hell.

95
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,603
Now your demons can be created
in any style that you like,

96
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:49,273
but your witches are elemental
protectors of the Earth.

97
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,674
Ooh.

98
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,342
So each one must be influenced

99
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,077
by one of the
four major elements.

100
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,612
Earth...

101
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,247
air...

102
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,049
fire...

103
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:00,851
and water.

104
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,920
We drew your names randomly.

105
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:06,589
Laura, which element would
you like to inspire your witch?

106
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:09,759
My instincts are telling me
to go with earth.

107
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,729
- Nicole?
- I'm gonna go with water.

108
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:16,133
- And Derek?
- I'm gonna go with fire.

109
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:18,601
So some of the biggest names
in makeup history,

110
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:20,737
like Stan Winston
and Dick Smith,

111
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,307
they not only
excelled individually,

112
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,643
but they also knew
how to lead a great team.

113
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:30,013
- Guys, come on out!
- Oh-ho-ho.

114
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,248
Yeah, buddy!

115
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:36,553
- What's, up, guys?
- Hi.

116
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,257
So you will each get to choose
two of your former competitors

117
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,059
to join your team.

118
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:44,995
Nicole, you get to pick first.

119
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:48,065
Roy.

120
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:49,566
My man.

121
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,401
- Derek, your turn.
- My brother.

122
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,802
Aww.

123
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,171
Yeah!

124
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:57,040
- Laura.
- How's your arm feeling, Rod?

125
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,408
Yay!

126
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:01,811
My girl, Sarah.

127
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,946
Jason.

128
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:05,382
- All right.
- And Laura.

129
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,084
Since we worked
together before,

130
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:09,386
I'm gonna pick Tommy.

131
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,655
Whoa, don't hurt her back.

132
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:16,293
Alana, CC, we will definitely
see you at the finale.

133
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:17,627
Yes, you will.
Good luck to you guys.

134
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,496
- I love you all.
- Love you guys.

135
00:06:19,563 --> 00:06:20,864
- Bye.
- Love you.

136
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,176
There's something huge
that I have not told you yet.

137
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:28,745
Three days from now,
all of your creations

138
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,249
will take part in
a choreographed stunt routine.

139
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:33,850
- Oh, man.
- Oh, wow.

140
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,686
How in the hell
am I gonna make that happen?

141
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:39,222
I am scared and yes,
I'm losing color in my face,

142
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,623
'cause this is freaking me out.

143
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,659
Good luck, guys.
I will see you soon.

144
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:46,596
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

145
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:48,164
So we pick
our stunt performers.

146
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:49,432
There we go.

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,601
And we have ten hours
to work in the lab.

148
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:54,570
This is probably
the hardest thing

149
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,106
that I will ever have to do.

150
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:58,241
- Laura, here. This is yours.
- Yay! All right.

151
00:06:58,309 --> 00:07:03,046
If I win, that would make
a ginormous impact on my life.

152
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:06,016
- I could start my career.
- All right, guys.

153
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,285
I've got a frickin'
great idea for the demon.

154
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,153
When the time starts,
the best thing to do

155
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,854
is just get the sketching
out of the way

156
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,723
and try to get, like,
what I'm seeing in my head

157
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,325
somewhat out on paper.

158
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,461
- I'm thinking those swirly horns.
- Oh, like, the goat horns.

159
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,397
Yeah. But then having spikes.

160
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:22,532
I want the demon to have
a fish element,

161
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,002
but I also want to throw other
animal characteristics in there

162
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,870
because I feel like
that's what a demon is.

163
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:29,272
You still want
to maintain some of those

164
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,807
traditional witchy features
on her, though?

165
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,275
- Hmm, I don't think so.
- Okay.

166
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:33,910
I'm making a headpiece
for the witch,

167
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:36,446
and then I also want minimal
prosthetics on the face.

168
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:38,815
So I want her face
to be really soft and pretty

169
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:40,616
because it's a water creature.

170
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:43,820
This head piece is gonna
be really hard though.

171
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,122
Just so you also see some
of the stunt harnesses.

172
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,657
Oh, okay.

173
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:49,025
Is this definitely
what he's wearing?

174
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,328
We are going to have
to incorporate harnesses,

175
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:55,432
elbow pads, stunt equipment,
into our design.

176
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:57,000
As far as the demon
is concerned,

177
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,569
the only thing I was thinking
was abominous and grotesque

178
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:00,870
on one side.

179
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,139
It's a demon whose
whole point in life

180
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:04,640
is to pollute the Earth.

181
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,677
We're just gonna make the demon
the anti-nature.

182
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:09,412
You know, when
I'm thinking of her,

183
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,014
I'm thinking maybe
we make her all-white.

184
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,915
With the witch,
since she's supposed to be

185
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:16,152
the good character, I would
like to do a cherry blossom tree

186
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,222
or a birch white tree.

187
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,857
I'm thinking the witch
is gonna be, like,

188
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:23,493
cracking with lava in between.

189
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,596
My concept for my witch
is molten rock that starts

190
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:28,164
cooling down and cracking.

191
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,400
You want to do
any armor on the demon?

192
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,068
I don't even know
if I want to do horns.

193
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,337
My demon is
an underground creature,

194
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:36,739
almost albino-looking,
which entraps him

195
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,642
with multiple rock chains
fused to his bones.

196
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,644
All right, I think
I'm gonna start sculpting hers.

197
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:44,147
I'm gonna get some
clays and stuff.

198
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:46,282
For the first day,
I'm having Roy block out

199
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,950
the face of the demon,

200
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,086
and I'm working on
the witch's face.

201
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:54,424
And Sarah's working on
the arms and hands.

202
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,825
The stunt show
is gonna be awesome,

203
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:58,228
but it's gonna, like,
take away a lot of our design.

204
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:01,197
From here on out, it's gonna
be all soft, nothing rigid.

205
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:03,333
Safe, but durable.

206
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,535
And I also need to create
the best and the biggest

207
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:06,603
of anything I've ever done.

208
00:09:06,704 --> 00:09:10,368
How do you think I should do the forehead,
just trying to figure that out soon...

209
00:09:10,574 --> 00:09:12,008
Derek's giving me
a lot of freedom,

210
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,910
but I'm still checking in
with him every now and then.

211
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:16,246
I'll ask him to come over
and see how it looks.

212
00:09:16,313 --> 00:09:17,414
Oh, you don't have any idea?

213
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:18,948
You've got nothing?
No comment?

214
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,450
No comment.

215
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,053
So I asked you, and you come
and look at it, like, "um."

216
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,755
I thought you were gonna
give me some advice, and no.

217
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:35,998
I'd keep this all open because
she's gonna be moving a lot.

218
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,668
Tommy is moving
at this feverish pace.

219
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,503
Rod, on the other hand...

220
00:09:40,571 --> 00:09:43,039
- Do you want multiple eyes or--
- Yeah, we can do multiple eyes.

221
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:44,407
- I mean, I'm not sure.
- Yeah.

222
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,876
But no, no, no.
That isn't a suggestion from me.

223
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:48,744
It doesn't seem
as though he knows

224
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:50,449
in what direction to go.

225
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:53,322
Trying to do it on this
would be tricky.

226
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:54,393
Rod is checking in...

227
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,248
Do you have a preference
of how to go with this?

228
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:57,293
What are your thoughts?

229
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:58,693
I definitely want
to work with you on that.

230
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:00,136
A lot.

231
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:03,008
If you want to hop in there
and rough something out

232
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,310
and I'll go in and detail it?

233
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:05,578
Or if you want to do it
the other way around?

234
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,446
I'm just trying
to keep my mind focused

235
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,248
on what has to be done.

236
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:12,985
I have a lot at stake,
and I don't have time for this.

237
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:16,589
Coming up...

238
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:19,525
Shattered, gone.
I'm about to start crying.

239
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:22,228
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i> finale.

240
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:24,796
Whoo!

241
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:27,133
And stay tuned for details
on how to cast your vote

242
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,128
for our winner.

243
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,785
What are your thoughts?

244
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:34,319
Do you have a preference
of how to go with this?

245
00:10:34,388 --> 00:10:36,655
Rod doesn't seem
as though he knows

246
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,156
in what direction to go.

247
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,608
If you want to hop in there
and rough something out,

248
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:41,842
and I'll go in and detail it.

249
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,243
I'm feeling a lot of pressure

250
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,913
to make sure that
I deliver for Laura.

251
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,149
Well, I tell you what,
uh, you just keep sculpting.

252
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:51,018
Whenever you want me
to get to the detail,

253
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:53,153
I will do that.

254
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:57,525
We have to do two makeups,
a good witch and a demon.

255
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:59,860
Rod has to start
working faster,

256
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,662
or I don't see how
we're gonna be able

257
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,899
to do anything
worthy of a finale.

258
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,434
So this is
a test piece of coral.

259
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,636
That's awesome.

260
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:11,505
Seven minutes, everyone.

261
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:21,715
All right,
that's time, everybody.

262
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:23,951
- Let's go.
- All right.

263
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:26,587
I really would like
to get everything molded

264
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:27,855
and finished tomorrow.

265
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:29,289
I'm a little worried,
but I definitely

266
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:32,426
have a lot of confidence
in my team.

267
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:42,837
- Oh, wow.
- What?

268
00:11:42,904 --> 00:11:45,906
Walking into the lab today
is awesome,

269
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,508
there is a car there.

270
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,376
This is the Prius V
that's going to be

271
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:50,478
the prize for the winner.

272
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,179
Oh, it's leather.

273
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:54,615
- Get away from my car, come on.
- Definitely need a car.

274
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:56,316
Me and my wife
share one right now,

275
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:59,386
so it's kinda hard
to get to work.

276
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:00,955
Oh, my God, this is cool.

277
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:02,289
You know how many
makeup kits I can fit

278
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,757
in the back of this thing?

279
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:05,425
Look, there's a thing
for your phone.

280
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:06,627
It's called Bluetooth.

281
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,195
I don't know
what fancy stuff is.

282
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:11,231
I need a car that doesn't
constantly need checkups

283
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,801
and replacing
and rusted-out parts.

284
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:16,169
The whole prize package
would be an amazing new start

285
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,372
to a new life.

286
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay, team leaders,
you gotta win it first.

287
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,308
I'm sorry.

288
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:22,242
And to do that,
we gotta get to work.

289
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,045
Okay. I'm done.

290
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:31,018
See how fast it is
with wet clay?

291
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,653
Shut up.

292
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,989
Girls, you're both pretty.

293
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:37,625
We have 10 hours today,
and we pretty much have

294
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:40,561
all the major sculpts done,

295
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,229
so it's time to make the molds.

296
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:45,699
These actors are gonna
be running around, sweating,

297
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,434
so all my pieces
are gonna be foam.

298
00:12:47,502 --> 00:12:49,904
Foam is lighter and
a little bit more breathable.

299
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:52,740
Silicone doesn't breathe
at all.

300
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,714
Hey, Roy, can you do
a couple of those scales

301
00:13:00,782 --> 00:13:02,516
on the face so it ties in?

302
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:03,851
Yeah, do you--
where do you want 'em at?

303
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,020
Because I don't think
they're gonna match.

304
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:07,621
I want the demon
to be shrively and, like,

305
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,256
lots of wrinkles
and lots of texture,

306
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,091
and Roy seems frustrated.

307
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,693
I mean, I don't
do wrinkles like that,

308
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,227
'cause they don't
look as natural.

309
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,829
Oh, fuck.

310
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:19,533
It's, like, a lot of tension
is building between us.

311
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,542
Oh, look at that.

312
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,881
At the end of the day,
everyone is working well

313
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,749
and getting the molds done.

314
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:38,418
- Whoa. Here we go.
- All right, guys, that's time.

315
00:13:38,486 --> 00:13:40,888
Let's go.

316
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:43,724
We're in very good shape
for tomorrow.

317
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:52,132
Let's see what we got.

318
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,201
The third day,
we have a lot of molds.

319
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,971
I've lost track.
It's a busy day.

320
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:59,172
- But that's all fixable.
- That's all gonna be covered.

321
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,941
And the ear's
gonna be covered as well.

322
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:04,044
Being in the finale is crazy,
'cause I was sent home.

323
00:14:04,112 --> 00:14:07,982
To win would be the greatest
accomplishment of my life.

324
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:11,451
Let's get sculpting.

325
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,820
That looks good.

326
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:16,189
Since we have most
of the prosthetics complete,

327
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:18,258
we are gonna try and sculpt out

328
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:21,194
a back for the witch
and for the demon.

329
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,736
You think I should slab
all of them on this?

330
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:29,937
No.

331
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:31,605
You can feel the tension
right now.

332
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:33,073
I'm no longer a competitor.

333
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:35,042
Why am I gonna win her $100,000

334
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,844
when I should be
winning it for myself?

335
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,646
I just don't know
what I did to upset him,

336
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:42,516
but I'm hoping
that he looks past it.

337
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:47,888
Hey, everybody.

338
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,156
- Hey.
- Hi.

339
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,425
I've brought Oscar-winner,
Emmy-winner,

340
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,461
and my dad, Michael Westmore.

341
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:58,260
- How are you?
- We're gonna take a look around.

342
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,901
Michael Westmore
is an amazing makeup artist.

343
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:02,536
I mean, he's done
so many different things.

344
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:05,039
So this is cool.
This is the cowl.

345
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:06,506
- Wow.
- Oh, wow.

346
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:09,677
I want to paint it
copper or, like, gold.

347
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,411
You don't have a lot
of depth to work with,

348
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:13,681
so start with your
lighter colors and build up,

349
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,649
because if you go with too dark
a one to start,

350
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,751
there's no going back.

351
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:19,820
So here are the--
this is the demon.

352
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,956
Let's see.

353
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:24,191
Nice thin edges on it.

354
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,525
What are you going to do
to bring out

355
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:27,260
that there's something
going on underneath?

356
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:28,395
I really want it to be bright

357
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,831
and maybe some metallic makeup.

358
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,833
They also have
metallic press-on,

359
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:36,236
which we used on the borgs a lot
to metalize them.

360
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:38,005
Show us your witch.
Yeah, let's look.

361
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:40,874
Yeah, there were things I was
thinking about adding to it.

362
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,677
Maybe I can run this by you,
just kind of work them into some

363
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:47,014
of these crevices and give it
a little bit more dimension.

364
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:49,183
- What are they made out of?
- Uh, plastic.

365
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,185
Okay, that's fine.
That's flexible.

366
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:52,720
But you got
a lot of work to do.

367
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:57,457
So pre-paint as much as you
can pre-paint to prepare it.

368
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,760
So let's start with team Derek.

369
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,262
My main concern with him
was I really want to see

370
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,965
how he's gonna handle
the cracks in that head

371
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,233
so they don't disappear.

372
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,601
Right. So let's
move on to Nicole.

373
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,002
She has a great direction.

374
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,070
And you're happy
with the witch?

375
00:16:10,138 --> 00:16:11,371
That coral head was beautiful.

376
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,906
Yes. With the coral head,

377
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:14,474
the paint job is gonna
be very important,

378
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,710
or you're gonna look at it
and go, "what is it?"

379
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,113
Right. Let's move on
to team Laura.

380
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,049
Mm-hmm. The one character
I'm concerned with is her witch.

381
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,350
Really?

382
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,685
She's talking about
its vines and its tree,

383
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:29,056
and there's not enough texture
in her sculpting

384
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:30,690
to really sell that idea.

385
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,960
All right. Well, let's see
how this turns out tomorrow.

386
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:35,829
Yep.

387
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:37,464
Okay, everybody,
we're heading out.

388
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:39,466
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Thank you.

389
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:43,303
- Bye.
- Bye.

390
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,038
This is very difficult.

391
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,807
This is taking a lot longer
than I thought it would.

392
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,309
Try this one.

393
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:52,512
See if that,
like, does anything.

394
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,947
It's really hard right now
because me and Roy

395
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,215
have always been buds,

396
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,583
and there's just something
not right.

397
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,585
And I just don't know
how to deal with this.

398
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:01,421
It's hard to even look at her,
because I'm reminded that

399
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:04,691
the judges chose
her work over mine.

400
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,794
There's so much to do,
and there are so many decisions,

401
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,428
and the tension's building.

402
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:10,931
There's all the stress
of the finale.

403
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,200
I'm hurt that Roy
is upset with me.

404
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:16,736
I'm about to start crying,
'cause this is my last chance

405
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,773
to show that I have the skills
to be in the finale,

406
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,442
and I feel like I'm screwed.

407
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,406
The Prius V is awesome.
I've never seen a car like this.

408
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:30,667
Press the bottom and it starts.

409
00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:32,038
Oh, how cool is that?!

410
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,778
The system is really cool.

411
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:35,260
You can buy movies on it.

412
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:37,306
You can find restaurants
that are in the area.

413
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:38,714
What do you guys
want this to do?

414
00:17:38,828 --> 00:17:41,558
It's very spacious.
It's got leather sits.

415
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,788
This is a fancy car.

416
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:44,426
Oh, this is too cool.

417
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:45,500
Where do you guys wanna go?

418
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,583
Say "help" at any time
for additional instructions.

419
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:50,176
It's like the car
from the future.

420
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,871
- Fuel prices.
- Fuel prices.

421
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:55,418
I'm hoping this will
be my next car.

422
00:17:58,376 --> 00:17:59,462
Check this one.

423
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,881
See if, like, does anything.

424
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,416
I've always wanted
to work with Roy,

425
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,018
and we're working
together finally,

426
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,386
and then there's tension
and that sucks.

427
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,592
I love Nicole,
but every time I look at her,

428
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,762
I'm reminded that the judges
chose her work over mine.

429
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,899
But I have to be professional
and help Nicole win.

430
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,203
So I see Jason working on
the staff for their witch,

431
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,972
and Tommy working on one
for Laura and I'm thinking,

432
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,940
"you know,
we don't have a staff."

433
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:26,542
So I decided to make one.

434
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,610
I see this acrylic tubing
and I'm thinking,

435
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:30,612
if I can get that hot enough,
I can take it and bend it

436
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,949
and do, like, a little
water spray on the top,

437
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:35,284
make a really cool
staff out of it.

438
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:38,221
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

439
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:40,789
That's so cool!

440
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,192
This is amazing.
It's just gorgeous.

441
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,061
The tension with Roy
just kind of starts

442
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:46,295
to, like, disappear.

443
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:49,131
Hug me.
I'm so relieved.

444
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:53,035
Still working on her costume

445
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:54,570
and trying to figure out
his rigging.

446
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:58,341
It is the smallest detail that
makes the entire thing work.

447
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:02,444
The color schemes,
prosthetics, accents, and props.

448
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:03,812
These are all essential

449
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,782
to the overall look
of the character.

450
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:10,452
These teeth for the demon
are tricky.

451
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,256
Finally, we start
trying out feather quills,

452
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,992
and then we get some foam pieces
and put those in the back

453
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,726
and the feather quills
over the top,

454
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:20,629
and it looks awesome.

455
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:29,638
All right, that's it.

456
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:32,141
We have finished everything
that needs to be finished today.

457
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,512
It's all come together,
and it's a good feeling.

458
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,125
It's application day.

459
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:50,226
We have four hours in the lab

460
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:52,661
and we have one hour
at last looks.

461
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:54,663
I've never done
this many pieces.

462
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:57,433
It's kinda nerve-wracking,
but we gotta work through it

463
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,436
and get it all down
as fast as possible.

464
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,911
This is the best bald cap
I've laid since I've been here.

465
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:12,014
Everything is pretty much
working out on application day.

466
00:20:12,082 --> 00:20:14,216
Roy is painting the staff,
and it's just

467
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:15,751
looking cooler and cooler.

468
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:18,687
Sarah has got the cowl on
the witch and applying the face.

469
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,656
I feel like if we
just keep up the same pace,

470
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:23,792
I think we can pull this off.

471
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:27,629
I'm gonna be
heading up the witch.

472
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:30,499
Rod's heading up the demon,
and Tommy is gonna be

473
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,168
helping out wherever he can.

474
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:33,902
Oh, my gosh,
that's so gorgeous!

475
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,637
I like being the guy
that you have to depend on

476
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:37,173
when things get hot.

477
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,008
It's fun to play superhero.

478
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:45,348
Uh, Roy?

479
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:50,486
My foot hit Roy's totally
awesome plastic-formed staff.

480
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,421
The whole thing fell over
and the bulb fell off.

481
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:54,656
- Oh.
- I feel like such an asshole.

482
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:56,125
Tommy accidentally
knocked the staff over.

483
00:20:56,193 --> 00:20:58,060
Which it's my fault
because I left it in a place

484
00:20:58,128 --> 00:20:59,295
where it could be knocked over.

485
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,464
- How are you doing, Roy?
- Uh, not good.

486
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:04,467
The staff's gone.
Broke, shattered, gone.

487
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:06,635
You don't want something broken
on finale.

488
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,337
You have to let it go.

489
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:12,541
- Well, fuck.
- Oh, well, it was a nice idea.

490
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,114
- There.
- It's like birthing.

491
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:19,315
Yeah.

492
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:20,716
Black and then
maybe glowing here.

493
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:23,552
For the lava, I really want
fluorescent colors.

494
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,421
Uh, yellows and oranges.

495
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:28,190
But for the demon, I want
to work on the paint scheme

496
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:30,493
with my brother
and get it down.

497
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,727
Lighter paint,
lighter skin--

498
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:33,496
- however you
started with this.

499
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:35,464
- I went back and forth.
- So do that.

500
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:38,434
We have a lot to paint,
so I'm stressed out.

501
00:21:38,502 --> 00:21:41,904
Careful with
getting it on this.

502
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,874
Five minutes.

503
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:56,385
All right,
that's time, everybody.

504
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:57,920
I feel like we're behind
a little bit.

505
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:00,022
We definitely have a lot to do,

506
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,724
but this is my last chance
to impress the judges

507
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:06,128
and impress America.

508
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:14,636
As I walk into last looks,
it sets in, like,

509
00:22:14,704 --> 00:22:16,305
how big this is.

510
00:22:16,373 --> 00:22:17,406
Ooh.

511
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:18,774
So we're around the corner,

512
00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:21,277
and there are these
gorgeous makeup trailers.

513
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:22,578
And that's awesome.

514
00:22:22,645 --> 00:22:23,879
I'm, like, a real
makeup artist now.

515
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:26,915
- Come on in.
- Where's the other compressor?

516
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:28,551
So we only got an hour in here.

517
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:31,554
In the first, like, few minutes,
I kind of had, like, a moment.

518
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:32,854
Like, "oh, my God,
what am I doing?"

519
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:34,390
Like, "what do
I do first?"

520
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,326
Go ahead and set him down
and get his eyes and mouth done.

521
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:40,762
Roy is the voice
of reason right now.

522
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,432
So we have a lot
of painting detail work to do.

523
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,433
Pucker tight.

524
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,502
Tommy's laying down moss.

525
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,071
Rod still has to
apply all of the hair,

526
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:54,543
but the majority of the work
is all resting on my shoulders.

527
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:57,213
I've still gotta finish a lot
of the paint job on the witch,

528
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,515
but we have to get it done
and it's gonna get done.

529
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:03,219
All right, guys.
That's five minutes.

530
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:06,155
I don't like her eyes now.
I'm not a fan.

531
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:14,396
- It's time!
- Whoo!

532
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:16,565
I am so proud of these makeups

533
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,467
that are walking out
of this trailer today.

534
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:20,402
He looks frickin' awesome.

535
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,739
I couldn't have asked
for anything more.

536
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:25,608
I feel on top a little bit,

537
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:28,710
and it's just a good feeling.

538
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:31,480
I'm extremely proud
of my team, but you can tell

539
00:23:31,548 --> 00:23:34,583
everyone's nervous
because next is the stunt show,

540
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:38,654
which is completely
out of our hands.

541
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:39,955
Coming up...

542
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:41,857
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i> finale.

543
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,728
The stunt show
is freaking me out.

544
00:23:45,796 --> 00:23:47,697
My heart's pounding.
This is it.

545
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:49,932
You did a great job.

546
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,369
- The teeth are really cool.
- Thank you.

547
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,804
And stay tuned for details
on how to cast your vote

548
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,240
for our winner.

549
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:18,681
Please welcome your host,
McKenzie Westmore.

550
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,823
Thank you.

551
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,293
Good evening, everybody.
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i> finale.

552
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:38,068
Tonight, we're gonna
celebrate Halloween our own way.

553
00:24:38,135 --> 00:24:41,137
Our finalists' characters
will have to survive

554
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:44,174
an epic choreographed
fight sequence.

555
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:51,081
For their final
spotlight challenge,

556
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:53,183
we asked each
of our contestants

557
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,018
to create two original makeups.

558
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:58,654
The first is a demon
determined to spread chaos

559
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:00,190
throughout the living world.

560
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:03,193
The second is a good witch
who will hunt that demon down

561
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,862
and banish it back to hell.

562
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:09,032
So let me tell you
what's at stake tonight.

563
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,069
The winner of the <i>Face Off</i>
finale will have the opportunity

564
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:17,240
to become a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

565
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,676
in New York and Paris,

566
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:23,846
a 2012 Toyota Prius V,

567
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:26,749
and $100,000.

568
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:31,787
And for the first time
in <i>Face Off</i> history,

569
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:33,623
you, America,
will have the chance

570
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,758
to vote for
your favorite artist.

571
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,394
So stay tuned for details.

572
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:40,363
The winner will be announced
tomorrow night, live,

573
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:45,279
right here on SyFy.

574
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,151
So with that, I would like
to introduce you to our judges.

575
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:53,454
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

576
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,526
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

577
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,032
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

578
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,270
And rejoining our panel
this week,

579
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:13,674
creature designer and director,
Patrick Tatopoulos.

580
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:18,779
All right, well it is time
to get this started.

581
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:22,083
Tonight's first creations
are from Laura.

582
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,018
Her witch
was inspired by earth.

583
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:32,159
♪

584
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:56,283
My model just
starts using that staff,

585
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:59,886
and she is looking bad-ass.

586
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,912
Our demon comes out
and everybody loves it!

587
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,750
And when they come out
as a couple,

588
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:30,884
they definitely
look like they have

589
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:33,820
come from two different worlds.

590
00:27:58,746 --> 00:27:59,813
The witch comes out

591
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:01,582
and she's visually
just stunning.

592
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,419
I love that.

593
00:28:20,968 --> 00:28:22,736
The demon's colors
are all popping,

594
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:24,771
and he's got this great stance
that he does.

595
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,874
He's just striking.

596
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,510
I love that when they
stand next to each other,

597
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:31,745
they look like they're
from the same world.

598
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:33,113
He looks like
the evil creature.

599
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,515
She looks like
the good creature.

600
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,284
And they belong together.

601
00:28:58,172 --> 00:29:00,073
I'm loving the paint scheme
for my witch.

602
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:02,109
The color contrasts
are just popping more

603
00:29:02,176 --> 00:29:03,277
than I expected it to

604
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:05,145
and I'm really digging
the makeup.

605
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:08,882
It's looking really cool.

606
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:24,632
The pinks are popping

607
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:26,400
where the stone is imbedded
into his skin,

608
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:28,068
it shows that irritation.

609
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:29,169
I love it.

610
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:32,273
Seeing these two together,
it is awesome.

611
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,476
And the crowd loves it.
It's a cool feeling.

612
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:40,581
Well, that was
just the beginning.

613
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:42,849
Now it's time
to put them all to the test

614
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:46,153
in our spectacular stunt show.

615
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,892
The stunt show
is freaking me out,

616
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:53,472
'cause we're gonna get judged
on how well they're gonna

617
00:29:53,539 --> 00:29:56,174
hold up afterwards,
and that's wracking my nerves.

618
00:29:56,242 --> 00:29:57,976
I'm just--
my heart's pounding.

619
00:29:59,746 --> 00:30:01,747
Then all of a sudden,
I hear a motorcycle revving.

620
00:30:01,814 --> 00:30:05,312
This is it.

621
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:11,468
Well, that was
just the beginning.

622
00:30:13,536 --> 00:30:16,438
Now it's time to put them all
to the test in our

623
00:30:16,506 --> 00:30:16,832
spectacular stunt show.

624
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's check it out.

625
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,511
The stunt show
is freaking me out,

626
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,279
because there's gonna
be these stunt guys

627
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:34,350
crashing through windows
and jumping off balconies.

628
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:36,919
Then all of a sudden,
I hear, like,

629
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:38,454
a motorcycle revving.

630
00:30:38,522 --> 00:30:41,857
Oh, my God, this is it.

631
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,237
Okay.

632
00:32:05,108 --> 00:32:06,942
Awesome.

633
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:12,114
To our studio audience,
who have helped to make this

634
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,717
such an amazing night,
it is now time

635
00:32:14,785 --> 00:32:19,054
for our judges to speak
with our contestants in private.

636
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:20,690
Thank you all so much.
Have a good night.

637
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,268
So judges, what did you think
about what you saw here tonight?

638
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:34,804
I thought it was fabulous.

639
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:38,307
I love all the fantasy elements,
the witches and the demons.

640
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,375
It was bitchin'.

641
00:32:39,443 --> 00:32:40,710
Everyone did such a great job,

642
00:32:40,777 --> 00:32:42,110
and it really, really
is very impressive.

643
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:43,713
Yeah.

644
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,981
Well, the judges would like
to speak with each of you now

645
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,483
to learn more about your work.

646
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:50,586
Laura, you're up first.

647
00:32:55,024 --> 00:32:56,959
Could you tell us
about the concept?

648
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,127
The witch that I chose
was the earth witch,

649
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:02,498
so that we could do more
vines and textures with bark.

650
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,600
And the whole concept
with the demon was that

651
00:33:04,668 --> 00:33:06,669
he was gonna be anti-nature.

652
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:10,606
He's very toxic and has
started to disfigure and deform.

653
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:14,309
Addressing your witch,
I thought that it was

654
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:19,014
an absolutely
gorgeous execution.

655
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,716
It's not this traditional
idea of a witch.

656
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:22,752
But I thought that was
a brilliant decision,

657
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:25,488
when you're dealing
with elemental witches.

658
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:28,290
It was a stroke of genius
to approach it that way.

659
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:31,527
I can't say the same
for the toxic demon.

660
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,161
I was disappointed in the fact
that they felt like

661
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:35,698
they were from
different worlds.

662
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,833
What made you choose the colors

663
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,735
that you used on your witch?

664
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:42,337
I guess a cherry blossom tree
has white birch in it,

665
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:44,139
and I thought
"well, wouldn't that be cool

666
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:46,341
if it was white birch
over the entire thing."

667
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,576
And of course
white being more of

668
00:33:47,644 --> 00:33:50,145
a pure and hero kind of color.

669
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:51,447
We went with the white.

670
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:53,248
I loved the way
it all looked like roots

671
00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:55,418
crawling up her body
and all over her.

672
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:58,053
And as far as your
demon character goes,

673
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,555
I wasn't real hot on the color.

674
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,490
But I did love the witch.

675
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:03,959
Her profile
was really beautiful.

676
00:34:04,027 --> 00:34:06,595
There were some really nice
lines happening with that.

677
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:08,631
I'm gonna give you credit
for one thing.

678
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:10,265
Everybody who's supposed to--
planning to create

679
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,601
a character from earth
is gonna use earth tones,

680
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:14,136
and you swept
everything around.

681
00:34:14,203 --> 00:34:16,405
Just by doing this,
you took a bit of a challenge,

682
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:17,840
and I like what you've done.

683
00:34:17,908 --> 00:34:20,042
I think it was very creative.
It was very daring.

684
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:22,377
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.

685
00:34:22,446 --> 00:34:26,515
Thank you, Laura.
Would you please step back?

686
00:34:30,253 --> 00:34:35,136
Nicole.

687
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,564
Can you tell us your concept?

688
00:34:39,631 --> 00:34:41,933
My element
for the witch was water,

689
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:46,403
so I wanted to make her
be the protector of the sea.

690
00:34:46,472 --> 00:34:48,172
And this demon
has been sent from hell

691
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,374
to kill her
and to take over the world.

692
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,276
I wanted her
to be very light and airy,

693
00:34:52,344 --> 00:34:54,612
but still look like
she belonged from the ocean,

694
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,481
and him as well.

695
00:34:56,548 --> 00:34:59,517
Well, I think
you were very successful

696
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:01,218
because they do look like

697
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:03,955
they both come
from a water element.

698
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:07,124
And I especially like the teeth
that you put on your demon.

699
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,861
I haven't seen anything
like that in a while.

700
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:10,895
What did you make them out of?

701
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:13,430
- Feather quills.
- Nice.

702
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:15,199
They function so well together.

703
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:16,801
They really belong
to the same world.

704
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:19,236
The head of the water witch
has got different textures.

705
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:20,671
It's very layered.

706
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:22,239
And you've done
a lot of things like that

707
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:24,775
that create a very
rich-looking character.

708
00:35:24,843 --> 00:35:26,811
- So you did a great job.
- Thank you.

709
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:30,080
How exciting is it to have
your makeup doing wire work?

710
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:32,383
It was really, really elegant,
and that's why I wanted

711
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,985
a lot of that flowy fabric.

712
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:36,554
The outcome is great
for the witch.

713
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:39,490
Whereas the demon--
the horns I'm not so sure

714
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:41,458
that I agree that those work.

715
00:35:41,527 --> 00:35:43,761
Having ram's horns.

716
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:46,430
In terms of the demon,
it's a bit blocky.

717
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:51,268
The sculpt of the head suffers
from an acute angularity.

718
00:35:51,336 --> 00:35:53,004
That's not to say that
I didn't like the demon.

719
00:35:53,071 --> 00:35:55,940
The color break between
the face and the chest,

720
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,408
they're actually
very different colors,

721
00:35:57,475 --> 00:35:58,843
and I love that.

722
00:35:58,911 --> 00:36:00,377
Thank you so much.

723
00:36:00,445 --> 00:36:03,848
Nicole, thank you.
Would you please step back?

724
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,852
And Derek, please step forward.

725
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,575
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

726
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:15,343
So tell us about
the concept first, please.

727
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:17,245
My demon is a soul eater,

728
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:20,950
and he was imprisoned
underground by the fire witch,

729
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:23,819
with molten rock
infused into his bones.

730
00:36:23,887 --> 00:36:26,154
The thing I liked the most

731
00:36:26,222 --> 00:36:29,257
is how
her hot lava earthen energy

732
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:32,661
has been infused
into his flesh.

733
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:35,363
And the teeth are really cool.

734
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:37,332
The downside
is it drew attention

735
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,169
to the actor's mouth
behind the teeth.

736
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:43,371
Yeah, I think those two
sculptures are very beautiful.

737
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:44,740
Thank you.

738
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:46,842
But I also love the paint job
on the pink demon.

739
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,044
I usually have a tendency
to not like those two tones,

740
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:50,479
pink and reddish.

741
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:53,148
And I think it came out
really, really strong there.

742
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:54,516
There is a good reason
why you're here tonight.

743
00:36:54,584 --> 00:36:56,752
It's a great job
and I'm very impressed.

744
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,587
- Thank you.
- I really dug the paint job.

745
00:36:58,655 --> 00:37:00,522
- It's sickly and gross.
- Yeah.

746
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,224
And it looks like something
that's been underground

747
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:03,358
for a really long time

748
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:04,793
and hasn't seen
the light of day,

749
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,930
which evidently that's exactly
what was wrong with him.

750
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:10,198
And as far as your witch goes,

751
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,200
I really dug
the whole idea that

752
00:37:12,268 --> 00:37:15,037
she's completely parched
and her skin is breaking apart

753
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:17,106
and there's fire
coming from inside.

754
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:19,341
And I thought the concept
was really cool.

755
00:37:19,408 --> 00:37:21,810
Yeah, thank you.
I appreciate it.

756
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:25,614
Before you leave-- one thing
that I feel went unsaid,

757
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:26,882
I think your demon

758
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,818
is the strongest silhouette
in profile.

759
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:31,987
I think that the lines
that you achieve

760
00:37:32,055 --> 00:37:33,756
with the back of the head
and along the back

761
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:35,357
are absolutely gorgeous.

762
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:39,494
- Thank you.
- Derek, please step back.

763
00:37:42,132 --> 00:37:43,966
All right, well, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

764
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:46,168
If you'd please head back
to the makeup trailers

765
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:47,435
while they share their thoughts

766
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:49,304
with each other
and the viewers.

767
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:53,776
I'm hoping when the judges
look at tonight's work,

768
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:56,578
that they're not just
looking at tonight's work.

769
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:59,381
I hope that they're
looking at my body of work.

770
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:02,184
And I really hope that
this is the start

771
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:05,020
of a great career for me.

772
00:38:13,353 --> 00:38:14,686
We're all waiting
to see what happens.

773
00:38:14,754 --> 00:38:17,789
I'm really nervous,
but I'm also really hopeful.

774
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:19,858
Laura's makeup
looks really good.

775
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:21,193
Nicole's looks really good.

776
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:24,029
So it's anybody's game,
I think.

777
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:29,501
All right, let's talk about
each of our finalists' makeups.

778
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:31,203
Let's start with Nicole.

779
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:33,838
Now she chose water
for her witch's element.

780
00:38:33,907 --> 00:38:36,074
- She's the comeback kid.
- Yeah, she is.

781
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:41,246
She did such a cohesive job
with design and fabrication.

782
00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:43,248
It looked like it was done
by the same artist.

783
00:38:43,316 --> 00:38:45,918
I really loved the way
she colored everything.

784
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:48,086
It looked like it was glowing.

785
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:50,891
I loved the headpiece
that was all coral coming out.

786
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,493
That was really a cool idea.

787
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,594
Yeah.
All of that said,

788
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:57,531
I did have some huge problems
with the demon.

789
00:38:57,598 --> 00:38:59,500
The blockiness
of that sculpture.

790
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:01,068
Mm-hm.

791
00:39:01,136 --> 00:39:03,237
For me, she could have played
with the horn a little more.

792
00:39:03,304 --> 00:39:05,239
Just give them a more
aquatic look, if you may.

793
00:39:05,306 --> 00:39:06,407
Yeah.

794
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:07,807
She's done some amazing stuff

795
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,077
since she's come back as well.

796
00:39:10,145 --> 00:39:11,811
Since her resurrection,
she's just gotten better

797
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,247
and better and better.

798
00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:15,115
For me it is really,
really special.

799
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:17,551
And to see someone
that just basically

800
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:20,587
almost dropped the ball,
and to become

801
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:23,390
one of the very, very top
in the group is-- wow.

802
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:24,691
What do you think
of Derek's work?

803
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:26,326
He chose fire for his element.

804
00:39:26,394 --> 00:39:29,063
I think that the amount
of work that Derek and his team

805
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,131
accomplished
is quite impressive.

806
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,466
Yeah.

807
00:39:32,534 --> 00:39:33,567
They seem to have
worked well together.

808
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:35,102
The demon, for me, was cool.

809
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,938
I just thought it was really
a great idea that it was so pale

810
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,473
and looked like
it had been buried.

811
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:42,376
Yeah. Although I did
really enjoy the lines of it--

812
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,610
Absolutely.

813
00:39:43,678 --> 00:39:46,113
The face, I have
a huge problem with.

814
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:48,515
It's okay to have teeth
on the surface as a feature

815
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:51,751
of a creature, but that piece
should be solid and hard.

816
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:53,153
Yeah.

817
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,654
Looking back at Derek's
career with us, I mean,

818
00:39:54,722 --> 00:39:56,223
the <i>Dishonored</i> thug
was awesome.

819
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,324
Oh, yeah, with
the white dreads.

820
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:58,425
- Yeah.
- That was good.

821
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:01,595
He's a very good visual artist.

822
00:40:01,662 --> 00:40:04,931
And that leaves us with Laura.
She chose earth.

823
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,967
- The witch was fantastic.
- Yeah.

824
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:09,503
It was interesting that
she chose to use a charcoal

825
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:12,772
to do the coloring on the roots,
it was so terrific.

826
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,509
Oddly, conversely,
the demon was not.

827
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:18,845
Yes. In this final makeup,
I don't feel Laura's touch.

828
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:21,248
It doesn't feel
like her work to me.

829
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:24,218
You know, upon reflection
of Laura's previous makeups,

830
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:26,720
she's done some
really amazing things

831
00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:32,726
with regard to execution
and the grace of her sculpture.

832
00:40:32,793 --> 00:40:34,928
I think that she has
the best application skills

833
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:36,863
and the best sense of color.

834
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:40,501
She's perhaps the best
makeup artist on the show.

835
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:44,738
Derek is probably the best
at communicating his concepts

836
00:40:44,805 --> 00:40:46,806
because of his drawing skills.

837
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:49,943
And Nicole's just been able
to knock 'em out of the park.

838
00:40:50,011 --> 00:40:52,078
- Just pull things together.
- Yeah, she--

839
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:53,614
Create new energy.

840
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:56,082
Ultimately, we're gonna leave
it up to our audience tonight.

841
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:57,584
- Yes.
- Yeah. Phew!

842
00:40:57,652 --> 00:41:00,521
They've got a tough decision,
because I'm torn tonight.

843
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:01,988
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

844
00:41:02,056 --> 00:41:04,291
Well, it looks like America
has a tough decision

845
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:05,325
on their hands.

846
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:07,661
Let's bring 'em back out.

847
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:16,036
Okay, America, you've heard
what the judges have to say.

848
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:18,639
It is now up to you.

849
00:41:18,706 --> 00:41:20,674
Here's another look
at tonight's makeups,

850
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:24,178
along with details on how
you can vote for your favorite.
