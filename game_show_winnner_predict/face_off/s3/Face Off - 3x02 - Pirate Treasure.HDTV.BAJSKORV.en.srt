1
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:03,290
Previously, on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:05,793
12 talented makeup artists
arrived in Los Angeles,

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,561
and for their first challenge

4
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,314
created original
<i>Star Wars</i> aliens.

5
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:12,399
I'm geeking out.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,069
Rod's stellar creature
makeup took him to the top,

7
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:17,671
and Joe was
the first contestant to go home.

8
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,573
Now 11 artists remain.

9
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,775
Tonight, they'll take
to the high seas...

10
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,891
Oh, my God, I knew it!
I knew it was pirates!

11
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:26,152
Where the stakes are higher than ever.

12
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,366
This is a <i>Face Off</i> first.

13
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:31,235
You need to learn
to mold faster.

14
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:33,037
I don't know if I can do this.

15
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,271
Oh, shit.

16
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:35,456
The cowl is stuck.

17
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:37,758
Oh, God, this is trouble.

18
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:39,226
This is gonna look stupid.

19
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:40,661
This may put me in the bottom.

20
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:43,197
And on stage, they will lay
everything on the line.

21
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,665
Fuck.

22
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:46,467
I really, really, really
wanna win this challenge.

23
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:48,435
It took my breath away.

24
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:51,038
The thing's wretched.
It doesn't work at all.

25
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:52,673
I'm thinking,
"this is terrifying."

26
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:57,711
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

27
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,714
to be a guest lecturer
at Makeup For Ever's academies

28
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:03,050
in New York and Paris,

29
00:01:03,118 --> 00:01:05,285
a new 2012 Toyota Prius V,

30
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:07,738
and $100,000.

31
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:09,406
And for the first time ever,

32
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:11,525
America,
your voice will be heard

33
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,059
in selecting the winner.

34
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,863
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

36
00:01:58,773 --> 00:01:59,940
What's going on with the arm?

37
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:01,242
Uh, I overworked it.

38
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:02,709
I went to the doctor

39
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,428
and it turned out all
the tendons from all my fingers

40
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,480
are inflamed and crossed over.

41
00:02:06,548 --> 00:02:08,148
During the first challenge,

44
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:15,956
then I noticed something
terribly wrong with my wrist.

45
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:19,643
Do you feel like you can do
the next challenge okay?

46
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,863
It's gonna get worse.
The pain's gonna get worse.

47
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:25,549
So what do you do?

48
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:26,900
It's one of those choices--

49
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:30,154
either quit,
or just grin and bear it.

50
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm not quitting.

51
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:37,294
Uh, guys!

52
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,380
There's something down here
in the kitchen!

53
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:43,450
My eye catches a chest that
I had not seen there before.

54
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:45,252
"Good morning, artists.

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,954
I'm sending you on
a little trip today.

56
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,573
Before you head out,
open the box and pick one.

57
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:51,742
Make sure to bring it along.
You're gonna need it.

58
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,444
See you there,
McKenzie."

59
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,062
Oh, wow.

60
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:58,098
- Do it, do it.
- Do it? Do it?

61
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,766
All of us take a key.

62
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:01,185
And we're all trying
to match 'em up to one another.

63
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:02,736
And maybe
it's a team challenge.

64
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:03,704
Let's get ready.
Let's go.

65
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:04,838
- Yep.
- Okay.

66
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:05,839
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

67
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:07,274
We're all really excited,

68
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:09,009
and we have no idea
what's coming next.

69
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:14,548
I've never been on a train,
so...

70
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:15,683
It's pretty bad-ass
and it's fun.

71
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:19,687
I'm ready
for whatever's coming.

72
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:21,105
I'm bingo, bango,
ready to go-go.

73
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,940
We get off the train,

74
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:26,093
and we are in San Diego.

75
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,561
Ooh, look at the front
of that ship.

76
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,029
We're walking along this pier,

77
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,466
and I notice
this magnificent vessel.

78
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,977
Hi, guys.

79
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:45,680
Welcome to San Diego.

80
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:48,983
This is the <i>HMS Surprise.</i>

81
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,818
It's been used
in major Hollywood films

82
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,987
like <i>Master And Commander</i>
<i>The Far Side Of The World,</i>

83
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:55,323
also <i>The Pirates</i>
<i>Of The Caribbean</i> films.

84
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,758
This week's spotlight challenge

85
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:00,978
is to create an original
pirate character

86
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,397
who has become one
with the seas.

87
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:05,199
Oh, my God, I knew it!
I knew it was pirates!

88
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:08,069
So excited because
I love pirates so much.

89
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:10,338
I've wanted to do
a crazy pirate for so long.

90
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,541
This is also going to be
your first individual challenge.

91
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,176
A little scary.

92
00:04:15,243 --> 00:04:17,845
Onboard are all kinds
of treasure chests.

93
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:20,414
Inside each one is
a different inspiration

94
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:21,815
for your makeups.

95
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,751
Now did you all
bring your keys?

96
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:26,454
Each one of your keys
opens one of the chests.

97
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,089
When I call your name,

98
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,557
I want you to head up
onto the ship

99
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:31,859
and claim the scroll inside.

100
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:33,811
Nicole, you're up first.

101
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:35,663
Yeah, buddy!

102
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,642
"Ship in a bottle."

103
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:50,110
This is scaring me,

104
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,412
because how am I supposed to put
a heavy ship in a bottle

105
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:53,581
on my makeup?

106
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,232
Jason.

107
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,062
Cool.

108
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,333
Oh.

109
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,071
Derek.

110
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:43,097
Before I send you back to L.A.
to start your work,

111
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:45,883
I'm sure you've noticed
there's one extra chest here.

112
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,568
- You wanna know what's inside?
- Yeah.

113
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:48,602
Yes.

114
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,504
Oh, wow.

115
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:53,374
This is a <i>Face Off</i> first.

116
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,409
The winner of this spotlight
challenge

117
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:58,545
will receive a pirate's booty
of their own.

118
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:01,465
$5,000.

119
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:02,700
Oh, that's awesome.

120
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:06,687
There's a money prize,
which is incredibly exciting,

121
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:08,472
and terrifying,
and I immediately think

122
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,424
all right,
the pressure is incredibly on.

123
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,359
I want you to get
inspired with this challenge,

124
00:06:12,427 --> 00:06:15,429
so why don't you take some time
to just hang out, sketch?

125
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:18,399
And when you're done,
I want you to head back to L.A.,

126
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:21,085
pick your models,
and get started.

127
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:22,336
Good luck, everybody.

128
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:32,879
I do love pirates.

129
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,114
So this is a pretty
fantastic day for me.

130
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:36,083
I have kelp.

131
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:38,352
I came up with this whole idea
for this ship captain

132
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,255
whose ship has sank and
he's walking the ocean floor.

133
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:43,590
I really, really, really
wanna win this challenge.

134
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,413
I got crabs.

135
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:52,299
I wanna take all the high points
in my model's face

136
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:55,035
and accent them
with crab shells,

137
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,503
make them look
like they're hard.

138
00:06:56,554 --> 00:07:00,157
I'm hoping I have enough time
to do all this stuff.

139
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:01,492
I have a dagger.

140
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:04,044
So I start thinking
about my pirate

141
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,646
being an expert with daggers,

142
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:07,247
and she keeps them in her body.

143
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:09,216
So her daggers are
in her ribcage in the front,

144
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,368
and then also in her ribs
in the back.

145
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:12,753
Just doing this challenge
is great,

146
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:16,323
but having that extra $5,000--
that's extra incentive.

147
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:31,205
We all arrive back at the lab,

148
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,624
and now it's time
for us to choose our models.

149
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,343
In my head, I'm picturing
the old captain with a beard.

150
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,746
But I'm the last one
to pick my life cast

151
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:40,113
and I'm stuck with a girl.

152
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,015
So I have to do a gender swap.

153
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,751
It's gonna be a hard one
for me.

154
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,189
Immediately, I need
to start sculpting his face,

155
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:50,724
and I think, man,
that would be cute

156
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:53,410
to have a shell
on the guy's head

157
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:54,895
and his face as a creature

158
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:56,930
so we can still
incorporate the eyes

159
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:59,299
and have that creature
just coming out of the shell.

160
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,021
I wanna put hair in here.

161
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,355
You're making him look
so angry.

162
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,907
Yeah.

163
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:09,410
Derek and I wanna sit next
to each other just to have fun.

164
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:10,744
I love hanging out
with my brother.

165
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,397
He's like one
of my best friends.

166
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:14,581
I got barnacles.

167
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,767
I'm not a great sketcher,

168
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,669
so I jot down notes
of textures, textures,

169
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:21,989
and the design
of what it is that I wanna do.

170
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:23,657
I definitely
wanna challenge myself

171
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,858
and change it up
as much as I can.

172
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,496
Pirate is becoming one
with the sea.

173
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,899
So I wanted to have a seahorse

174
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:34,835
that's being born through him
into the sea.

175
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,220
I'm gonna have
to really be good

176
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,755
with my time management
and planning.

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,890
So I'm concerned.

178
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,311
My concept is
this pirate is lazy,

179
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:46,313
not doing what he's supposed
to be doing,

180
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:48,081
so the captain fused
this spyglass

181
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:49,483
to his face permanently.

182
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,151
So that's pretty much
all he's able to do

183
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,086
is look out in the ocean.

184
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,141
When I see jewels,
I'm kinda like okay,

185
00:08:57,225 --> 00:09:00,126
I could do whatever
I would like with this.

186
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:01,495
What are you doing?

187
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,380
Doing a pirate
that's infested with octopus.

188
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:06,133
My concept is a greedy,
jewel thief pirate.

189
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,734
He's got the treasure,

190
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:09,803
but the octopus
got him as well.

191
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,421
If I won the extra five grand,

192
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:14,208
I'd probably throw most of it
onto my student loans.

193
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:15,709
That's my biggest burden
right now.

194
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:18,145
It's what holds me back.

195
00:09:20,765 --> 00:09:24,368
The thing I keep going back to
is on the sidewalk outside

196
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:26,520
there are all these cracks.

197
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:27,988
And I'm thinking
about the sea urchin

198
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:30,357
just kind popping out
of this ball thing.

199
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:35,045
So I decide I'm gonna do
a chest piece of cracking,

200
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:39,750
so we'll see where it goes.

201
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,434
I'm gonna do this part

202
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:42,536
a different color
from that part.

203
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:43,787
Yeah, ah, yeah.

204
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:45,205
So this looks hard
and that looks soft.

205
00:09:45,273 --> 00:09:46,673
This is a lot of work.

206
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,292
It's the most work I've
ever taken on in my life,

207
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,794
single-handedly,
and I'm terrified.

208
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:56,984
I'm not too sure
what's going on with CC.

209
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,435
She seems lost.

210
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,189
Like she can't solidify
a concept.

211
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:04,208
I'm looking around the lab,
I'm seeing amazing things,

212
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:06,310
a lot of fabrication.

213
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:08,946
I'm still trying to figure out
a neat design.

214
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,330
How much time we got left?

215
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,299
2 hours, 51 minutes.

216
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:18,372
I'm a little nerve-wracked
at this point.

217
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:20,207
I'm trying to get
a game plan together.

218
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:22,622
I have to really pull
some tricks out of the bag

219
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,615
because I don't wanna
be going home.

220
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:26,913
Coming up...

221
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,348
I don't know if I can do this.

222
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,033
My mold is stuck.

223
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:31,384
This is trouble.

224
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:32,586
Tonight, for the first time,

225
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:35,389
we have a very big prize
on the line.

226
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:37,958
Great silhouette,
fantastic job.

227
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,927
You were a little
directionless here.

228
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,628
I'm worried
I'm going home tonight.

229
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:52,595
I'm trying to come up
with an original pirate.

230
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:54,013
Barnacles are tough

231
00:10:54,098 --> 00:10:55,648
because I don't know
a whole bunch about them.

232
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,784
It's not a crab or a shell--

233
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,819
something that is
a little more common.

234
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:02,172
So I'm starting to rough out
my sculpture

235
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:05,475
while trying to incorporate
the basic shape of the barnacle.

236
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:11,681
Ah! Damn it!

237
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,233
I'm trying to be careful

238
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:15,385
when I'm trying to use the tools
the way I normally use them,

239
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:16,553
and they're attacking me.

240
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:17,971
Where can I get a band-aid?

241
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:19,372
I'm bleeding like a maniac.

242
00:11:19,457 --> 00:11:21,574
I just don't wanna
take anymore time for bleeding.

243
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:23,193
Thank you.

244
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:25,027
I'm just like, why?
Why now?

245
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,498
It's gonna affect my sculpture
and my mold-making.

246
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,237
All right everybody, time's up.

247
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,939
Let's go home.

248
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:51,421
So, it's day two, and I pick up
where I left off yesterday.

249
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:54,274
The winner of this challenge
will win $5,000.

250
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,776
That just raised the stakes
for everybody.

251
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,344
Everybody wants to win
that booty.

252
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:04,000
Once my sculpture is finished,
it's time to make the mold.

253
00:12:04,068 --> 00:12:05,935
You do this by putting
a cement-like substance

254
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:07,704
on top of the sculpture.

255
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,105
Once it hardens,
you clean out the clay

256
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,341
and it fill it with foam
or silicone.

257
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:15,445
The foam or silicone eventually
becomes the prosthetic.

258
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:17,413
I chose to do the one piece

259
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,215
because I want to focus on
the detail that I wanna put

260
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:21,334
into the face.

261
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,036
And this mold is all I have.

262
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,739
I have to get it done right
the first time.

263
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:28,758
This is actually gonna be
a belt buckle

264
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:30,410
or a centerpiece
for my character.

265
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:31,861
He is a jewel thief,

266
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,997
and I'm tying the barnacles
in there

267
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,798
in the fact that
when he does these bad deeds

268
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:37,700
the barnacles start to grow
out of his skin.

269
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,669
So those are actually gonna be
in my face piece.

270
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,772
Hey, everybody!

271
00:12:42,823 --> 00:12:44,440
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

272
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,559
I have the amazing Ve
here with us today

273
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:47,944
to see how you're doing.

274
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:49,312
Of course it's gonna be Ve

275
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:50,580
because she's done
all the pirate movies.

276
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,114
You know,
<i>Pirates Of The Caribbean.</i>

277
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,651
She did amazing stuff with
each one of those characters.

278
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:56,286
Hi, CC.
How are you?

279
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:58,137
My inspiration was barnacles.

280
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:00,990
But he's all about his money
and finding jewels.

281
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,259
So right now,
I'm making him a belt piece

282
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:04,911
that's gonna have some
of the pieces on there that--

283
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:07,830
Wow. I was beginning to think
your inspiration was jewels.

284
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:08,915
Right, yeah.

285
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,936
Uh, hearing Ve say
that she thinks I have jewels

286
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,437
is a little nerve-wracking
because I feel like

287
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,689
I have to kinda change
my concept up again.

288
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:19,142
I'm going for like maybe
a steampunk type of look to it.

289
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,227
So he's got all the wiring going
in through his skin.

290
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:23,096
If you're doing steampunk,
you better do it right,

291
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,181
'cause Glenn'll really be
down your throat if you don't.

292
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:26,599
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:28,034
Here's my concept is, uh--

294
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:30,152
She actually carries her daggers
with her all the time

295
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:32,372
and has 'em in her ribcage
and in her back.

296
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:35,458
- Wow. She's bad-ass.
- Yeah.

297
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,542
Can't wait to see it.

298
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:38,077
- Hey, Nicole.
- Hello.

299
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:39,329
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

300
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,431
My inspiration piece
is a ship in a bottle.

301
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm thinking the captain
of a ship.

302
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,001
Then his ship blow up,

303
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:46,469
and now he's like been impaled

304
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:48,021
with pieces of wood
from the ship.

305
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,672
Are you doing a male
or a female?

306
00:13:49,723 --> 00:13:50,924
'Cause this is a female body.

307
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:53,009
It's a female body, but--

308
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:54,710
You're making a female
into a male.

309
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:56,179
Okay, I think the transition

310
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,780
is gonna be a detriment
to your makeup

311
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:00,483
as opposed to something
that's gonna make it better.

312
00:14:00,534 --> 00:14:02,585
Now I'm thinking,
should I change everything?

313
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:04,637
This may put me in the bottom
for trying to change a gender.

314
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,389
- Hi.
- How are you?

315
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,759
When Ve walks in, I think
everyone is pretty nervous.

316
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:11,060
You know,
the last time I saw her

317
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:12,362
I was on stage

318
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:13,579
and it wasn't such a good time.

319
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:15,531
- Holy smoke, that's cool!
- Wow.

320
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:16,666
- Thank you!
- Wow.

321
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,484
- Wow!
- I'm calling you for Halloween.

322
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,954
So, she has this chest piece
that's gonna go down here.

323
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:22,505
Oh, that's really bitchin'.

324
00:14:22,573 --> 00:14:26,576
And then the face piece goes
here and back into her hairline.

325
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,077
She's gonna be
slightly grotesque

326
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:29,578
within this beautiful costume,
isn't she?

327
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,813
Awesome.

328
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,717
Anything standing out to you?

329
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,619
Um, I liked Roy's
with the daggers.

330
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,288
I liked the idea that

331
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,922
they're stuck in the ribcage
and all that.

332
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:41,374
That was a really cool idea.

333
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,126
Sarah and the amazing costume.

334
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:45,678
Which isn't makeup, but
it's still an amazing costume.

335
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:46,929
So I think that might be
really cool

336
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,331
when it's all put together.

337
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:49,632
Nicole,
who had "ship in a bottle."

338
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,501
Yeah, and she's doing
the female as a male.

339
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:52,802
How did you feel about that?

340
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:54,236
If she's a real tiny woman,

341
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:57,206
I think it could be a detriment
to the whole picture.

342
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:59,075
Just have to scale it all down.

343
00:14:59,142 --> 00:15:01,711
All right, well, we'll see
how it turns out tomorrow.

344
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:04,347
- Yeah, can't wait.
- Thank you.

345
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:05,448
Okay, everybody,
we're heading out.

346
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:06,416
Good luck tomorrow.

347
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,651
Good luck, everybody.

348
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:12,905
What do you think I should lay
this up with? Just some shim?

349
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,958
I'm trying to do
a face and a cowl,

350
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:19,795
which is basically
a hood for a makeup.

351
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:22,298
Never applied more than five
prosthetics in my life,

352
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,866
so, this is a lot of work.

353
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,902
I'm running around the shop,

354
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:27,303
asking everybody
I know for advice,

355
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:29,639
because I'm the youngest person
in this competition.

356
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,541
Do you think I could start
the other half of this mold?

357
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:35,277
Oh, yeah, a long time ago.

358
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:40,650
I want my character to have
a coral skin structure,

359
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:42,719
and hands
turning into tentacles.

360
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:45,722
It's definitely gonna be a lot
of stuff I want to get done.

361
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:48,257
Ve said that she didn't like
that I was turning

362
00:15:48,308 --> 00:15:49,759
a girl into a guy.

363
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,395
I was feeling really good,
I was really liking my concept,

364
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:54,464
and now I'm just
really concerned.

365
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,631
It's like, maybe I did
the wrong thing.

366
00:15:55,699 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm at a loss right now.

367
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:58,101
I don't really know
what I'm gonna do.

368
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,736
I just wanna do a scary pirate.

369
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:03,539
Like, a dude, like, a--
You know?

370
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:10,880
So, the sea urchin has
this yellow gooey stuff in it,

371
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:14,850
and I want to have yellow gooey
stuff on my sea urchin.

372
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:16,836
So, my plan is to work out
with my model

373
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,871
squeezing the syringe
and letting it all ooze out.

374
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:20,022
If something gets stuck,

375
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,258
or it's the wrong consistency,

376
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,392
then it might splatter
on the judges,

377
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:25,828
and that terrifies me.

378
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,969
I have a lot
of work to finish up.

379
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:35,271
I need to get this cowl molded,

380
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:36,656
and I don't even
have my claw finished yet.

381
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,708
I'm running around the shop,
shaking like a leaf.

382
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,260
I'm like, "I don't know
if I can do this".

383
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:42,478
Alana, there's one hour left.

384
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,231
I just need
to get my beauty coat

385
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:47,550
onto my other half of my cowl.

386
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:49,185
All I want to do
is cry right now,

387
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:50,420
because this is
gonna be a disaster.

388
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:53,456
You need to learn
to mold faster.

389
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:57,510
Oh, shit.

390
00:16:57,594 --> 00:17:00,129
My molds are set.
I have to clean them out.

391
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,550
It seems impossible
with one hand.

392
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:07,537
My mold is stuck
to the positive of the head.

393
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:12,542
I grab a hammer, 'cause I know
I have to break the edge.

394
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:15,144
Time is ticking,
I'm going at this

395
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,647
as smoothly and as fast
as I can make myself go.

396
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:20,216
Ouch.

397
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:21,417
And the cowl
is just not giving.

398
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:24,921
It's feeling like,

399
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:27,890
oh, God, this is trouble.

400
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:40,157
The cowl is stuck
to the positive of the head.

401
00:17:40,242 --> 00:17:42,560
Okay...

402
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,745
You just want to do
all these things calmly.

403
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,131
If you get frazzled,
you will crack a mold,

404
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:51,285
and break it, and be without.

405
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,405
Thank God the positive releases
out of the negative,

406
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:58,092
and I start cleaning clay.

407
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:01,145
What am I looking for?
Um...

408
00:18:01,229 --> 00:18:04,431
Uh, I don't know what to do!

409
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,934
Everyone is really
stepping it up.

410
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:08,602
A lot of people
are fabricating stuff.

411
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,805
I've never fabricated
anything before,

412
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,774
but I'm thinking a mast
from the ship going through him.

413
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,976
I'm just gonna do everything
I can to figure it out.

414
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,562
This is gonna look stupid.
This is gonna, like...

415
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:22,433
If it's in somebody,
it's, like, wobbly. You know?

416
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,285
My problem
for the rest of the day

417
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:28,022
is trying to figure out how
this fabrication is gonna work.

418
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,857
I'm trying to get
my cowl finished

419
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,459
before the end of the day.

420
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:34,111
And time is just ticking
and running out.

421
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,964
I'm shaking like a leaf
at this point.

422
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,332
I'm like, I don't know if I'm

423
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,301
gonna be able
to do this in time.

424
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,586
Last mold of the day, we're
gonna pull it and clean it.

425
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,689
Are there any
wooden tools out here?

426
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,241
I'm trying to get
my cowl cleaned out,

427
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,409
and nothing
is going as planned.

428
00:18:48,476 --> 00:18:50,995
I have a hole in my mold.
Awesome.

429
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,114
This could go one of two ways.

430
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:54,915
And I just don't want it
to go that other way.

431
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,083
Oh, fuck!

432
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:57,618
You wanna go help Alana?

433
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,052
Needs to get her shit molded,
and she's got 20 minutes left.

434
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,237
- She outside?
- Yeah.

435
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:01,772
We're trying to clean
Alana's mold.

436
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:04,325
Alana's having some trouble
getting a mold finished up.

437
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,810
If I was in the same position,
I'd want someone to help me,

438
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,977
so, I'm gonna go help 'em.

439
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,729
This sucks.

440
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,998
We gotta get you
making faster molds, missy.

441
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:13,000
I know, dude, I really
thought that I was like,

442
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,735
hauling ass on my mold,
and then I looked up,

443
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,537
and it's like,
oh, okay, time's almost over.

444
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,521
I have angels all around,

445
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:19,306
and they are helping me.

446
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,876
All right, guys. I think
I gotta close my core up.

447
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,878
I'm just like,
looking up to the sky,

448
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,198
just thanking God
for all these amazing people.

449
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,387
Okay, guys, it's time!
Let's go.

450
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,357
At the end of the day,
I'm amazed that I have a cowl

451
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:37,691
and a chest piece done.

452
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:40,027
So, I am concerned.

453
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,531
How am I going to get
these pieces well-applied?

454
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:47,802
With one hand, and this.

455
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,780
Today is application day,

456
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:01,415
and we have four hours
in the shop

457
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,484
to apply our makeup,
start pre-painting,

458
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:05,553
working on our costume,

459
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,804
and then have an hour
for last looks.

460
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:09,073
I really want
to win that $5,000.

461
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,257
It would really
help out back home.

462
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,443
Me and the girlfriend
are struggling.

463
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:14,912
So, that money's
pretty important to me.

464
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:16,497
I'm feeling pretty nervous,

465
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:18,932
just because there's
a lot to do in four hours.

466
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,235
And there's never
enough time in the day.

467
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,507
Glad this me out okay.

468
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,014
Shoot, models are coming in.

469
00:20:34,082 --> 00:20:34,915
- I'm Jason.
- James.

470
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,033
Nice to meet you, James.

471
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:37,902
I just want to see if it fits.

472
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,937
Immediately,
I put on the headpiece.

473
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,305
I'm on a timeline here.

474
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:43,107
Gotta just start
busting stuff out.

475
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,926
Looks good, looks good,
looks good.

476
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,528
Let's see if this will fit you.

477
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:49,296
I have quite a bit to do.

478
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:50,514
I need to lay down my bald cap

479
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,950
and then get
my face appliance on my model,

480
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,719
blend the edges off,
and then start to paint it.

481
00:20:55,804 --> 00:20:59,456
I learned that sea urchins
eat kelp beds.

482
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,226
That's why your skirt
is kind of kelpy,

483
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,279
and the sea urchins are coming
through and eating you,

484
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,464
turning you into
this sea witch character.

485
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:09,450
It would be amazing to win this,
and to get this money.

486
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:12,670
I would probably take my
boyfriend out for a nice dinner.

487
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,521
He might deserve that.

488
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:17,558
You, my dear, look awesome.

489
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,843
I'm in a comfortable place.

490
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:20,827
I get the face on,
I get the chest on,

491
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:21,929
just like I planned to do,

492
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:24,331
and I go to put on the wig...

493
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,700
And it doesn't fit.

494
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:28,202
It doesn't fit at all.

495
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,338
I had hot glued all these
different plants into the hair,

496
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,923
and so it's all
tied and glued together,

497
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:34,908
and there's no untying it
and making it work.

498
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,543
Bring your hand down with me.

499
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,911
Crap.

500
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,647
So, I make the decision
to put a bald cap on this guy.

501
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:40,664
It would fix my problem.

502
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:41,999
Yeah, that'll be nice.

503
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,684
I'll just have to
lift the appliance.

504
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:47,855
It definitely takes
a giant chunk out of my day.

505
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,859
Fuck!

506
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:53,894
I just know naturally, I'm
a very scatterbrained person.

507
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,163
Who the fuck
would leave that on?

508
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,615
And I know I need
to slow down a little bit.

509
00:21:57,699 --> 00:22:00,034
Someone left
the soldering iron on.

510
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,318
Thank you.

511
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,354
Because the more time
I spend with Mr. Medic,

512
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,505
the more time I take away
from my application.

513
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:09,259
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

514
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:12,079
As I start painting my model,

515
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,131
the paint is starting
to dry really fast.

516
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:16,216
Starting to crack a lot.

517
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:17,885
I see his skin coming through,
so I know, like,

518
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:20,354
the only way to really cover it
and to get an even tone

519
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:24,257
is to darken his skin tone.

520
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,314
- A lot-- lotta work.
- And your chin back.

521
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,566
Application day
is a nightmare for me.

522
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,568
I lost a lot of time
realigning that wig.

523
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,904
At first I was thinking
I might win the $5,000,

524
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,172
and now I'm thinking
I'll be lucky to be safe.

525
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:42,793
We have four minutes left.

526
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,297
Yeah, buddy.

527
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:50,150
I rip my crab claw
out of the mold,

528
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:54,038
and it still
has flashing around it.

529
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,723
I don't have time to trim this.

530
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,624
I gotta worry about it
at last looks.

531
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:00,761
I have to finish my makeup,
get my model in her costume,

532
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:04,298
and trim this whole thing,
and make it work.

533
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,632
Guys, that's time.

534
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,553
I have a lot of work
to do in this last hour.

535
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,588
I gotta boogie, I gotta roll.

536
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:14,274
I'm borderline having a seizure
at how nervous I am.

537
00:23:14,342 --> 00:23:17,227
Coming up...

538
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,214
We have a very
big prize on the line.

539
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:23,017
You can't help but think it's
a kick-ass-looking character.

540
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:25,669
Honestly, you were a little
directionless here.

541
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:26,837
It was just wretched.

542
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:28,255
It took my breath away.

543
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,758
I can almost smell $5,000.

544
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:36,862
We have an hour for last looks.

545
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:38,197
I'm just hoping
mine stands out,

546
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,367
because everybody's doing
really big pieces.

547
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:43,953
I have so much
to do at last looks.

548
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:45,888
I don't have much
prosthetic-laying experience,

549
00:23:45,956 --> 00:23:48,490
and it's showing.

550
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:49,958
Ah, this is pulling
too much, okay.

551
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:56,365
It really is tough to
finish a piece with one hand.

552
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:00,536
That's one minute!

553
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:01,704
Put your hands out for me.

554
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:03,172
I have a finished product,

555
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:05,024
I don't know how the judges
are gonna feel about it,

556
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:08,410
but I'm very proud.

557
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:19,121
Time!

558
00:24:27,197 --> 00:24:30,565
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

559
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:33,935
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

560
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:36,005
First, say hello
to your judges.

561
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:38,874
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio Glenn Hetrick.

562
00:24:38,942 --> 00:24:40,426
Good evening.

563
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,477
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

564
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,264
Argh, mateys!

565
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:47,349
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

566
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,218
Hello, everyone.

567
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:50,419
- Hi.
- Hi.

568
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,304
This week,
your spotlight challenge

569
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,473
was to create
an original pirate

570
00:24:54,557 --> 00:24:56,758
who has become
one with the sea.

571
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,711
And tonight,
for the first time,

572
00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:01,563
we have a very
big prize on the line.

573
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:05,567
A pirate's booty of $5,000.

574
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:08,420
So, let's see what
you've all come up with.

575
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:10,472
First up is Rod.

576
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:34,446
At this point,
I'm looking at the silhouette,

577
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:37,666
and the shape is looking good.

578
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:53,816
My pirate walks out onstage,
and I think he's awesome.

579
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,250
He's pulling off
the whole character.

580
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:58,954
It looks great, I love it.

581
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:19,141
I think that I have
a really good chance

582
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:20,309
of being in the top looks
on this one.

583
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:23,345
I mean, I can almost
smell $5,000.

584
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:41,680
I feel like
my character is striking.

585
00:26:41,764 --> 00:26:44,399
It carries the emotions
that I put into it.

586
00:26:59,916 --> 00:27:01,550
I've never fabricated anything,

587
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:03,652
and I'm worried
about the mast right now,

588
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:04,953
just 'cause
the thing's bending.

589
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:07,589
This could possibly
put me in the bottom.

590
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:28,193
I do feel confident, I feel
proud of what I've accomplished.

591
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,013
Now whether or not the judges
will like it or not, you know,

592
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,581
is another story.

593
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:51,700
I'm pretty proud of my makeup.

594
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,035
I mean, there's
a couple of things

595
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:54,569
I would've maybe rather
have done different,

596
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:57,139
but it's pretty
cool-looking.

597
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:15,958
I'm feeling
pretty good about it,

598
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,326
but there's some
really strong pieces,

599
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:19,428
so... we'll see what happens.

600
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,480
I think he looks pretty gross.

601
00:28:38,548 --> 00:28:39,948
He had his finger
in his belly button.

602
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:43,185
He looks nasty. He looks
like I wanted him to look.

603
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:01,169
She looks amazing.

604
00:29:01,237 --> 00:29:04,372
She is a crab girl,
and she is one fierce bitch.

605
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,560
I question maybe
one or two of the things,

606
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:28,496
but 90% of it I'm happy with.

607
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:35,404
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

608
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:42,477
See that bottom of the nose,
and the lips sloughing off?

609
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:44,313
Oh, oh. I thought
that was actually lips.

610
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,300
Yeah, no,
this is the lips up there.

611
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:49,584
- This is all pretty cool.
- Yeah.

612
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:51,370
This idea.

613
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,821
It's a shame
it's not more of it.

614
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:55,757
Yeah.

615
00:29:55,808 --> 00:29:57,075
Looks like the mast
has gone a bit flaccid.

616
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:00,746
My mast totally bent
really bad.

617
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:05,050
I'm just thinking,
"I'm going home tonight."

618
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:08,720
We want to know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

619
00:30:08,805 --> 00:30:11,840
Tell us on Twitter,
using the #FaceOff.

620
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,507
Looks like the mast
has gone a bit flaccid.

621
00:30:17,726 --> 00:30:18,909
My mast totally, like, bent.

622
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:22,013
She needs a little Vi-arr-gra.

623
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,116
I'm really concerned
about going home tonight.

624
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,551
First thing that comes to mind

625
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,853
is the barnacles should
at least look like barnacles.

626
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,806
I don't see "barnacle"
in it anywhere.

627
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,791
What do we have coming through
the forehead there?

628
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:36,127
That's the sea urchin things
coming out.

629
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:38,579
Oh, God.

630
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:39,897
- Oh!
- Nice.

631
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,716
They loved
my little ooze trick,

632
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,886
so I'm really happy I did that.

633
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,888
The texture on the face
is lacking detail.

634
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,806
The inspiration was jewels.

635
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:52,894
And there they are.

636
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:57,281
You were gesticulating and
doing some cool stuff in here.

637
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:58,800
So, you're doing this?
Uh-huh.

638
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:00,718
Thanks.

639
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,574
The judges have scored
your creations.

640
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,059
Let's find out
what they thought.

641
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:10,611
Tommy.

642
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,930
Nicole.

643
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,966
Rod.

644
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,301
Derek.

645
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:20,004
And Alana.

646
00:31:20,072 --> 00:31:21,889
You are all safe.

647
00:31:21,974 --> 00:31:24,525
Oh!

648
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,277
Please head back
to the makeup room.

649
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:30,114
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you guys.

650
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,265
So, the rest of you
were the best

651
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,917
and the worst of the week.

652
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:35,486
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

653
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:37,822
to learn more about your work.

654
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:41,893
Eric, you're up.

655
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:47,698
Your inspiration is the...

656
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,967
- The spyglass looking out.
- Right?

657
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:51,519
It seems to me like you missed
a chance to do something

658
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:54,155
different and fun
with that whole scenario,

659
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:58,009
- Yeah.
- and you didn't do it.

660
00:31:58,076 --> 00:31:59,710
That being said,
I do like that side of his face

661
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:02,313
- with all that detail with it...
- Thank you.

662
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:03,664
Like, being fused in there.

663
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:04,532
Honestly, the thing
sticking out of his face

664
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:06,000
is just wretched.

665
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:09,220
I wish you would've
seen that and changed course.

666
00:32:09,288 --> 00:32:11,055
Looks like
a small chimney stack.

667
00:32:11,106 --> 00:32:12,924
Little bricks.

668
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:16,110
And I really didn't
like the eyeball.

669
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:18,079
It turned it, really,
into a cartoony effect.

670
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:20,398
I was kind of worried
about that happening,

671
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:22,033
but I like the paint job
that I did on it.

672
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,201
I was trying
to go for a steampunk

673
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:27,088
kind of aspect with the...

674
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:31,025
Told you to stay
away from that.

675
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:34,579
Eric, you can step back.

676
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:37,081
Fuck.

677
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:41,619
Roy, you're up next.

678
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:46,290
So, tell us a little bit
about what was the inspiration.

679
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:48,025
Scarlett was a captain who was

680
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,627
both beautiful
and deadly with a knife.

681
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:52,196
And after she spurned
the affections of Davy Jones,

682
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:53,664
he condemned her to the reef.

683
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:55,700
Great, well,
you know, the silhouette

684
00:32:55,767 --> 00:33:00,187
when she first came out was
one of the more profound ones.

685
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:03,441
You can't help but think it's
a kick-ass-looking character

686
00:33:03,492 --> 00:33:05,226
when you've got knives
in the back.

687
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,410
M'kay, thank you.

688
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:08,179
I think the greatest success

689
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:10,214
that you've achieved
in this makeup

690
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:12,483
is the fact that it's
very hard to figure out how

691
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,152
to integrate a dagger without
doing lame-ass knife hands.

692
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:16,420
You know, something like that.

693
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:18,489
You go, "what do I do
with this knife?"

694
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,174
Just a really cool image.

695
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,093
Not at all what
I would have gone for,

696
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,695
which is what makes me respect
and appreciate it even more.

697
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:26,480
Thank you very much.

698
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:27,898
I love all your
little clever things

699
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,750
making the sea urchins
out of the feathers up there.

700
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:31,235
What a clever idea.

701
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:33,087
You did a great job, Roy.

702
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:35,773
Roy, thank you very much.

703
00:33:38,243 --> 00:33:43,114
CC.

704
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:45,333
CC, could you start
by explaining

705
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:46,984
the concept behind your makeup?

706
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:49,353
My guy has been
cursed by a sea witch

707
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:50,855
for all of his evildoing.

708
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:54,725
I feel like you were
a little directionless here.

709
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:58,562
And I see that reflected
in the makeup, unfortunately.

710
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,649
I want to find out
why you chose

711
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:04,535
to alter his skin tone so much.

712
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,671
Initially, I was going
with more of a lighter paint,

713
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:08,506
but it started to do
some cracking on me,

714
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,692
so I just decided to go
with something a lot darker.

715
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:13,978
I don't think this was very
successful for you today, CC.

716
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:16,847
The growths on his face
don't feel like barnacles.

717
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:20,484
And you've made it
so symmetrical,

718
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:22,853
it feels more like
a face flute.

719
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:25,106
That's not a good thing.

720
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,259
CC, thank you very much.

721
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,596
Sarah, you're next.

722
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:36,033
Tell us a little bit
about the concept.

723
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:38,635
She's a pirate wench.

724
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:41,155
The boat capsized,
and then these urchins

725
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,574
have infested her
and are starting to come out.

726
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:46,794
There's this wonderful
rhythm of-- of form.

727
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,948
It keeps it dynamic,
and keeps your eye interested.

728
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:52,350
Thank you very much.

729
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:56,020
My favorite thing
about this is this haunted look

730
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:58,356
that comes from the color
palette that you chose.

731
00:34:58,407 --> 00:34:59,557
- Really, really cool color.
- Thank you.

732
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:01,642
- Really cool breakup.
- Thank you.

733
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:02,993
When we were
in the lab yesterday,

734
00:35:03,045 --> 00:35:04,145
it took my breath away.

735
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:05,713
And I thought, oh, my God,

736
00:35:05,797 --> 00:35:08,332
if the makeup
is as good as this costume,

737
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:11,352
it's gonna be amazing,
and you did not disappoint.

738
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:14,855
- Thank you very much.
- Sarah, thank you so much.

739
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,342
Jason, you're up.

740
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,747
Well, Jason,
can you please explain to me

741
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:26,634
what jewels has to do
with your pirate.

742
00:35:26,718 --> 00:35:28,119
He was going for the treasure,

743
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:31,288
but not without
getting attacked by octopus.

744
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:34,291
I'm kind of disappointed.

745
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:35,593
You could've done
so many other things.

746
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,163
You just didn't
embrace the jewel thing.

747
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:42,349
It doesn't look like
there's a huge amount

748
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:45,519
of character design
within that facial sculpture

749
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:49,740
to warrant having gone
through all of that effort.

750
00:35:49,808 --> 00:35:51,909
We've spent all of this time

751
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:53,677
creating a full-facial
prosthetic,

752
00:35:53,745 --> 00:35:56,079
and a chest and belly,

753
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,782
which accomplish,
for me, almost nothing.

754
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:00,618
I could've spent a little bit
more time sculpting the octopus,

755
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:05,539
but I really wanted to stay away
from being too terrifying.

756
00:36:05,624 --> 00:36:06,957
I wanted to make
a believable character.

757
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:09,527
I think that may be
right where you fell down.

758
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:11,912
And that's
in the conceptual stage.

759
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:13,363
Jason, thank you very much.

760
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:17,067
Thank you.

761
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,438
Laura.

762
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:24,208
Could you begin by telling us

763
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:25,926
about the concept
of your makeup?

764
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:28,712
The item I was given
was a shell.

765
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,115
And I decided that I would have

766
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:33,501
the model's face coming out
as the creature,

767
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:36,353
and the head be the shell.

768
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:38,389
It's got a really nice feel
head to toe.

769
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:43,394
It feels to me like you've
endeavored to tackle

770
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:46,430
a lot of different elements
you addressed head to toe,

771
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:48,966
which-- that's awesome.

772
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:50,484
I thought it was
a great silhouette.

773
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:52,436
The fact that you were able
to get that much definition

774
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:55,739
in this headdress piece
is really quite good.

775
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:58,209
- Fantastic job.
- Thank you.

776
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,844
I do like the coloring,
I like the way you painted it,

777
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:03,447
and I think you did
a successful makeup.

778
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:04,849
Thank you very much.
You can step back.

779
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:12,222
Okay, guys, the judges have
heard what you have to say.

780
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,574
Please head back
to the makeup room

781
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,326
while they make
their final decision.

782
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:22,917
All right, guys, so let's
start with the top looks.

783
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:27,304
Why don't we begin with Laura's
shell-inspired pirate?

784
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,958
I love her form,
I love her attention to detail.

785
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,076
Everything else I'm looking at,

786
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:34,645
we have human facial form

787
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:37,198
popping through
whatever they did underneath it.

788
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:38,482
Yeah, she tried
just a little bit harder

789
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:40,000
to do something different,

790
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:41,886
and that was a really
huge challenge, I mean, wow.

791
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:44,004
All right,
then let's move on to Sarah.

792
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:46,840
I love the profile
of that makeup,

793
00:37:46,925 --> 00:37:49,009
all of her choices
were really well-done,

794
00:37:49,094 --> 00:37:50,694
right down to the little goo
when we walked up,

795
00:37:50,762 --> 00:37:52,079
that was so cool.

796
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:54,665
It exudes confidence to me
that she was able to do

797
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:57,785
all that work,
and still manage to remember

798
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:00,037
to put one little
gag in there...

799
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:01,405
- Yeah.
- To push it over the top.

800
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:03,357
All right,
let's move on to Roy.

801
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,727
He addressed
a large part of the challenge.

802
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:08,796
Very simple,
very straightforward,

803
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,381
and then spent
the rest of his time

804
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,567
figuring out how to put those
daggers in in a way that works.

805
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:16,620
It was a beautiful color,
good execution. Impressive.

806
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,389
Why don't we talk
about some of the looks

807
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:20,391
you liked the least this week?

808
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,226
Why don't we start with Jason?

809
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:24,261
Jason's approach
was totally lackluster.

810
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:26,497
The whole thing was really bad.

811
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:28,198
And jewels.

812
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,967
- Where were the jewels?
- In his hand.

813
00:38:30,034 --> 00:38:31,835
This is BS,
this handful of jewels.

814
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:34,805
All right, let's move on to CC.

815
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:37,608
Everything she did she made
bad choices, unfortunately,

816
00:38:37,676 --> 00:38:39,326
and I don't even
know where to start.

817
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:41,612
Sculpturally, huge problems.

818
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,631
Application-wise,
huge problems.

819
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:45,215
Coloring, huge problems.

820
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:47,351
All right,
let's move on to Eric.

821
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:48,752
It might as well have been

822
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:51,088
a paper towel roll
glued to his eyeball.

823
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:53,457
Could not have been worse.
It came out too far.

824
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:55,025
- Yes.
- The eyeball looks fake.

825
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:57,061
He liked the paint job
on the eyeball, so he put it on.

826
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:59,129
- Ah, I heard that. Uh...
- Yeah.

827
00:38:59,197 --> 00:39:01,715
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

828
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,434
- Yup.
- I believe so.

829
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:07,271
Okay,
let's bring them back out.

830
00:39:12,344 --> 00:39:15,529
Glenn, why don't you tell us
about the top looks?

831
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:19,249
Laura, your character
had really interesting colors,

832
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:22,353
and you did a great job
embracing the challenge.

833
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,106
Sarah, your character
had an incredible silhouette.

834
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:28,659
The makeup and the wardrobe
was fantastic.

835
00:39:28,727 --> 00:39:31,829
And, Roy, you did something
very unexpected.

836
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:35,532
The daggers were incorporated
in a really cerebral way.

837
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,267
All right, then, Glenn,

838
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:39,203
who is the winner
of this challenge

839
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,538
and the $5,000 prize?

840
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:45,376
The winner
of this challenge is...

841
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:50,527
All right, then, Glenn,

842
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:54,165
who is the winner of this
challenge and the $5,000 prize?

843
00:39:54,232 --> 00:39:58,302
The winner
of this challenge is...

844
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:00,371
Sarah.

845
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,108
Thank you.

846
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:07,111
It was just awesome.

847
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:09,329
The spines that were
bursting from the skin,

848
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:11,615
the paint job--
Very, very complete character.

849
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:12,949
Well done.

850
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,284
It feels incredibly amazing

851
00:40:14,335 --> 00:40:16,286
to have my work recognized.

852
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:18,455
Plus I'm taking home $5,000.

853
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:19,640
Well done, Sarah.

854
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:22,125
Congratulations
on your $5,000 win.

855
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:23,477
Thank you very much.

856
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:24,828
You can head back
to the makeup room.

857
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:32,953
Laura and Roy,
you are also safe this week.

858
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:34,271
Please head back
to the makeup room.

859
00:40:34,322 --> 00:40:36,156
Thank you.

860
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,843
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

861
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:42,446
were our bottom looks
this week.

862
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:44,648
One of you
is going to be eliminated.

863
00:40:44,699 --> 00:40:45,916
If you please step forward.

864
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:54,408
All right, Glenn,
why don't you tell us

865
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:56,460
- about the bottom looks?
- Eric...

866
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:58,262
You had the opportunity

867
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:01,198
to do something
really cool with this concept.

868
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,766
And instead, we ended up

869
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,202
with a lame attempt
at a steampunk pirate.

870
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,138
CC, your lack
of a solid concept

871
00:41:08,206 --> 00:41:10,374
really compromised
your final product.

872
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:12,376
And, Jason,
the jewels seemed like they

873
00:41:12,443 --> 00:41:15,312
weren't really much of
a consideration in your makeup.

874
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,331
It was a dispassionate job.

875
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:22,319
So, who is going home tonight?

876
00:41:22,386 --> 00:41:25,455
The person
going home tonight is...

877
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,310
CC.

878
00:41:30,395 --> 00:41:32,529
Your sculpt didn't read
as barnacles.

879
00:41:32,597 --> 00:41:34,264
That was the big problem.

880
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:35,983
In the end,
we just think that you need

881
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:39,136
to work on your skill set
and your design work.

882
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:42,573
CC, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

883
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,808
The rest of you
are safe this week.

884
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:46,260
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room.

885
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:50,264
Sorry.

886
00:41:50,348 --> 00:41:52,749
I want to say
that what I see out of you

887
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:55,152
is the passionate
makeup artist.

888
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:57,888
Don't give up.
It's just the beginning.

889
00:41:57,956 --> 00:42:00,974
CC, it's been great
having you here with us.

890
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:02,559
Will you please head back
to the makeup room

891
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:03,861
and pack up your kit.

892
00:42:03,928 --> 00:42:05,829
Thank you, guys.

893
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,566
- Thank you, CC. Good luck.
- Good luck.

894
00:42:09,617 --> 00:42:11,585
So, I'm going home.

895
00:42:11,669 --> 00:42:13,236
No.

896
00:42:13,288 --> 00:42:17,024
I think the hardest part
about leaving now

897
00:42:17,108 --> 00:42:19,793
is I would love to show
more of my skills.

898
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:22,379
The future, I feel like,
for me, is bright.

899
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:24,409
I'm moving forward,
I'm gonna continue to push,

900
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:27,164
and show that I can
do amazing art.
