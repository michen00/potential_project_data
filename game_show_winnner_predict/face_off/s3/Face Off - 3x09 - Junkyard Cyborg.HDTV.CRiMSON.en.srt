00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:03,595
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,662 --> 00:00:06,263
The artists reimagined
classic Dr. Seuss characters.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,463
Oh, my God!
I'm excited.

4
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:10,266
Nicole's whimsical creation

5
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:11,404
brought her to victory,

6
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:13,242
and Alana was sent home.

7
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:17,382
Now, only five artists remain,

8
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,520
and tonight, the artists
draw one step closer

9
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:21,990
to the finale in their most
rugged challenge yet.

10
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:24,263
Welcome to the junkyard.

11
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:26,372
Yeah, I like this one.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,544
I love all of this!
I want it all.

13
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,279
Fuck.
My mold just starts cracking.

14
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:33,881
It's just broken pieces
of rock.

15
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:36,120
I'm not seeing happiness there.

16
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:39,930
All of a sudden, my model
just walks up and leaves.

17
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:41,253
Did that just happen?

18
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,069
On stage,
their work will be judged

19
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:46,941
by a Hollywood
producing legend.

20
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:49,043
I don't think you achieved
your objective.

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,213
It's a really strong concept.

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,716
I don't think you succeeded.

23
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,517
This could mean the end.

24
00:00:58,255 --> 00:00:59,555
In the end, only one

25
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:01,794
will win the opportunity
to be a guest lecturer

26
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,500
at Make Up Forever's
academies in New York and Paris,

27
00:01:05,568 --> 00:01:10,540
a new 2012 Toyota Prius V,
and $100,000.

28
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,775
And for the first time ever,
America,

29
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,577
your voice will be heard
in selecting the winner.

30
00:01:15,645 --> 00:01:18,350
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

31

32
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:00,392
How do you feel
about winning last night?

33
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,295
Uh, awesome.

34
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:03,930
It's a very, very surreal
feeling.

35
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:05,364
I was eliminated.

36
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:06,364
I was done.

37
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:07,899
I ruined my opportunity,

38
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,934
and I'm here in the final five?

39
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,802
It's, like, half the house
is gone now.

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,004
- It's more than half.
- Oh, my God, it is.

41
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:15,542
- We-- we started with 12.
- Yes.

42
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,578
That feels even better.

43
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,648
It does.

44
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:21,617
Last five.
Two more challenges

45
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:23,621
- till the finale, right?
- I suppose.

46
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,524
Alana gave me this scarf
last night...

47
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:26,659
- Oh, she did?
- When she left. Yeah.

48
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:28,027
- Oh.
- I'm gonna miss Alana.

49
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,230
She and I have become friends,
and it's just weird

50
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:32,031
that it's slowly
getting less and less.

51
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,533
The house is much quieter.

52
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:34,735
Alana couldn't
come up with nothing,

53
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,104
and that's what got her.

54
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:37,508
I'm afraid to have
another challenge like that

55
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,344
to where it's like,
"oh, my God, what do I do?"

56
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,080
I had a good feeling
that I would get this far,

57
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:42,181
but I think from here on out,

58
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,717
it's gonna be harder
for everybody.

59
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:45,252
The judges are gonna
get more critical,

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,356
and I don't know
how this is gonna end up.

61
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,025
I'd really like
to not be on bottom again.

62
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,861
I'm getting tired of it.

63
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,142
So we're
at our next spotlight challenge,

64
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,457
and we find
that it's a junkyard.

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,464
I'm really worried that
we have to do some kind

66
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:11,911
of fabrication challenge
or something really crazy

67
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:14,347
or-- I don't know
what to expect from this one.

68
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:16,180
- Good morning, guys.
- Good morning.

69
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:17,815
- What do you think?
- Confused.

70
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,580
- It smells.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:22,349
Welcome to the junkyard.

72
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:23,984
From <i>Terminator</i> to <i>Robocop,</i>

73
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:26,453
some of cinema's
most iconic characters

74
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:30,191
were born from the merging
of man and machine.

75
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,226
- Ooh.
- That's right.

76
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:35,329
This week's spotlight challenge
is to create

77
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:38,131
an original cyborg character.

78
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,500
- All right.
- Awesome.

79
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:40,901
- That's great.
- Oh, my gosh! That's cool.

80
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:42,868
- Yeah.
- I'm stoked.

81
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:46,070
I've loved <i>Terminator</i>
since I was little.

82
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,140
I mean, frickin' Sarah Connor
is my role model.

83
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,312
You must source items
from in and around the junkyard

84
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,281
and incorporate them
into your final makeups.

85
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:55,614
I like this one.

86
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,215
I'm really looking forward
to this one

87
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,585
'cause this is something that's
gonna be more up my alley.

88
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,855
There are shopping carts
for you to really help you

89
00:04:01,923 --> 00:04:03,524
get in there
and pull out some great stuff.

90
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:05,660
So go ahead, grab your carts,

91
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,262
fill it up
with whatever you need,

92
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,666
then head back to the lab
and get started.

93
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:12,236
Your time starts now.

94
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:18,207
We got 30 minutes,
so I just take off

95
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:19,473
and start exploring.

96
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,707
It's like a grocery store
for parts.

97
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,274
These are heavy.

98
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,174
I'm just trying to find, like,
cool things that inspire me.

99
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:27,076
Hmm.

100
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,783
I definitely don't
have a concept yet,

101
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:34,218
but there's a couple pieces
I really like,

102
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:35,851
and the rest is,
like, oh, you know,

103
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,251
we'll see what I can
put together.

104
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:39,183
I love all of this!

105
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,118
I want it all.

106
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:46,088
I see a middle console
for a car,

107
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:47,390
and the first thing
that pops in my head--

108
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:48,625
"that would be a great
spine piece.

109
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:51,630
I can build off
of that."

110
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:55,466
Cool.
I'm, like, really into this.

111
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,168
I know I need something big,
'cause I want

112
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:59,471
to do one big accent,
maybe on the arm or the leg,

113
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,508
and then the rest
is just, like, anything I think

114
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,410
that looks cool.

115
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:10,252
I don't really know a lot
about cyborgs, actually.

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,756
I did grow up Mennonite,
and my mother

117
00:05:12,824 --> 00:05:14,926
was very specific
about things we were allowed

118
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,659
to watch when we were younger
and growing up.

119
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:18,093
I've seen two
of the <i>Terminator</i> movies,

120
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:21,698
but that was a long time ago.

121
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:24,538
- I like these.
- Ah, let go!

122
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:26,841
All right, guys, it's time.

123
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,476
Let's go.

124
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,644
Time's up, and things
start falling into place,

125
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,112
so I'm excited just
to get back to the lab

126
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,548
and to start
putting everything together.

127
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,486
Whee!

128
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:43,230
We get back to the lab
for model selection,

129
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:45,800
and I already have in my mind
that I want somebody big

130
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,639
and somebody that's gonna
carry off my mechanics.

131
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:54,582
And the first thing
I do is sketch out

132
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,419
the general idea for my cyborg.

133
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:03,590
My concept
is a post-apocalyptic soldier.

134
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:06,494
He's juiced himself up
to fight the war.

135
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,663
I actually start
getting a little nervous

136
00:06:08,731 --> 00:06:11,901
because this
is a little too predictable.

137
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,400
There are a few parts in here
that I'm planning

138
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:17,036
on cutting up
and maybe vacuum forming.

139
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:19,006
I need to probably think it out

140
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,875
more thoroughly in my concept.

141
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:25,010
I think about 90%
of what I got at the junkyard's

142
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:26,712
gonna be incorporated
in some way or another.

143
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,149
My concept
is C.O.R.E.,

144
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:33,288
which is a Cybernetic Organic
Regeneration Accelerator,

145
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:34,922
and it was developed
for the military

146
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,554
as a medical device.

147
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:39,387
And unfortunately, instead
of regenerating the tissue,

148
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:41,724
it actually
reanimates the tissue.

149
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,226
So that turns my character
into a zombie.

150
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:45,793
I started making the arm
and leg extensions,

151
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:47,629
and I decided to vacuum form it

152
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,465
because these things
weigh 20, 30 pounds each,

153
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:51,567
so there's no way that my actor

154
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:52,670
can carry those
on his shoulders.

155
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,207
It ain't gonna happen,

156
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:55,341
so the only way to do it
is to take it

157
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,242
and vacuum form it.

158
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:02,350
I don't know what almost
any of this stuff is.

159
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,457
I'm a little nervous
'cause people

160
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,796
are sculpting
and making things already,

161
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,633
but I don't really
have a concept.

162
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,947
I'm sculpting
one facial prosthetic.

163
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:21,983
I don't want
to do a typical cyborg.

164
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:24,985
I kind of want my concept
to be a future soldier

165
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:28,189
that has been injured in battle
and badly burned

166
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:30,827
and needs cyborg parts
to survive.

167
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:33,033
I really love
this weird-looking thing

168
00:07:33,101 --> 00:07:34,402
with the cables
coming out of it.

169
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,671
I think I'm gonna work it
into the chest

170
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,474
and have this kind
of on top of that.

171
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,086
- That looks cool.
- Thanks, girl.

172
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,821
I think that your character
and my character

173
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,491
are gonna want to date.

174
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,059
- 'Cause they're rusty?
- 'Cause they're sexy together.

175
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,794
- They're sexy?
- I want her to be

176
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:56,797
basically this,
like, cyborg princess

177
00:07:56,864 --> 00:07:59,865
from another planet,
elegant and tough.

178
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:01,966
I have a mechanism on her eye

179
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,336
which has all different types
of plugs

180
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:06,606
so, like, she can
hook herself up

181
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,375
and, like, through her eye,
like, have different types

182
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:10,276
of, like, way of seeing.

183
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:14,178
At this point,
I just start sculpting.

184
00:08:14,246 --> 00:08:15,715
Well, everybody's
going really big,

185
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:17,617
so I'm trying
to go a little smaller.

186
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:19,554
Yeah, but it doesn't matter
what you do.

187
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,189
It's just if you do it, like...

188
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:22,589
- If you do it well.
- Do it well.

189
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:24,525
Yeah.

190
00:08:31,865 --> 00:08:34,000
At the junkyard,
I found this tubing,

191
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,270
and it looks pretty cool,

192
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:38,810
and even though I'm
second-guessing my concept,

193
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:44,019
I want to incorporate this
in the facial sculpt somehow,

194
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,753
and I think,
"well, it would be cool

195
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:48,921
if I had the tubing coming
from under the neck

196
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:51,723
and then wrapping around
and coming down the side."

197
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,796
So my face
is pretty much done...

198
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:59,831
and it's coming down
to the wire.

199
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:00,997
If I want to get this out,

200
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:03,832
I need
to get my face molded asap.

201
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,489
I'm sculpting the face,
but I still keep

202
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,923
latching on to wires.

203
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,959
It's just not a big concept,

204
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,294
and I'm having a lot of trouble

205
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,664
coming up with something else.

206
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,934
This is another challenge
that Sarah doesn't know

207
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,170
what she's gonna make.

208
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:30,974
I have some pieces
on the neck that I like

209
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:32,911
with these wires coming in
and out of her.

210
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:34,810
I don't know
what the hell the wires are for.

211
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,913
I just can't figure out
what to do.

212
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,583
And I don't like any
of the pieces I have, really,

213
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:40,352
except for my wire, either.

214
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,656
I'm nervous
because it's really down

215
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:45,459
to the, "make one mistake,
you're going home."

216
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:49,663
Coming up...

217
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:51,633
My mold just starts cracking.

218
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,932
It's not my favorite.

219
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:56,132
Dang, you could put her

220
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,969
in front of a camera right now.

221
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:02,937
This is another challenge
that Sarah doesn't know

222
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:05,506
what she's gonna make.

223
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,610
For this challenge, we are
supposed to take inspiration

224
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:09,780
and physical pieces
from the junkyard

225
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:11,782
and create a cyborg,

226
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,919
and I just can't figure out
what to do.

227
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:15,722
I don't know, and I don't
like any of the pieces

228
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,423
I have, really,
except for my wire, either.

229
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,222
- Just keep working on it.
- Yeah, I'm going to.

230
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,690
I really like my wires,

231
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,590
so I decide she
was in the military

232
00:10:30,657 --> 00:10:32,625
in a coma
for a really long time,

233
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,194
and then the military
decided they were gonna start

234
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:35,796
testing on her,
and she doesn't know

235
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:38,631
what's going on, so she's kind
of ripping the wires apart.

236
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:43,768
I have to get this mold
cleaned out today

237
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:46,839
and get it ready to run
in foam,

238
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:48,374
to let the clay sit overnight.

239
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:51,080
It's gonna harden,
and it's gonna be so much harder

240
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:52,916
to try to clean it out
the next morning,

241
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:54,184
so it's kind of crucial.

242
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:57,023
15 minutes, guys.

243
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,829
Now, I'm scared.

244
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:02,596
So I'm outside,
working as fast as I can

245
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,029
to get this cleaned out.

246
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:08,167
If any clay is stuck in it,
it's gonna change the form

247
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,673
of the face
when it's casted in foam.

248
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,243
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

249
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,548
You could have clay stuck
in one of your edges,

250
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:16,017
and then you
have this big edge.

251
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:17,918
It's a very scary moment.

252
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:24,893
That's time, everybody.

253
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,496
I have it down
to the last second

254
00:11:26,564 --> 00:11:30,705
cleaning it out,
and got it in the last second.

255
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,641
I made it work.

256
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:45,459
So it's day two.

257
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:47,361
We've got ten hours
in the lab today,

258
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,196
which isn't really
that long of a time.

259
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:51,999
I still haven't figured out
how I'm gonna mount these arms.

260
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:54,336
I'm not even sure how I'm gonna
mount the spine piece,

261
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:55,739
and then I got to thinking,

262
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:58,307
"gee, I wish I had
some football shoulder pads."

263
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,742
That's one thing that my dad
always told me

264
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,445
is, like, you know,
if you don't have what you need,

265
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,920
but you got stuff
to make it, make it.

266
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,259
So I find the heaviest plastic
that I can,

267
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,295
and I can actually
take it and use screws

268
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,695
and bolts and rivets.

269
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,499
That way, it slips
on almost like a jacket.

270
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:18,906
At the beginning
of the second day,

271
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:21,442
I'm very nervous
because at this point,

272
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:24,210
I still don't like my concept,

273
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:27,646
so maybe I should try something
a little bit different.

274
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,147
- You startin' over?
- No, no.

275
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,682
I'm just, uh,
doing a new concept.

276
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,250
I'm thinking <i>Metropolis.</i>

277
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,954
I'm thinking 1900s movie,

278
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,653
it's still kind of
in the future,

279
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,951
but it's a dark future,

280
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,319
and it's almost
like the new form of tattoo.

281
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,752
You know, instead
of getting tattoos,

282
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,586
they're getting robot arms
attached to themselves.

283
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:55,331
But yeah,
I should be molding right now,

284
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,066
and I've still got a lot to do.

285
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:59,537
You should
be molding right now?

286
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,174
Ha, ha. That's funny.

287
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:02,409
Hey, Laura.

288
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:05,442
- Yes?
- Do I look any smarter?

289
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:06,977
Mm, nope.

290
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,279
Damn.

291
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:09,816
Oh, I had it on backwards.
That's why.

292
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:14,150
Hey, guys.
I am here with Glenn.

293
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:16,154
We're gonna do a walk-through
and see how you're doing.

294
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:18,458
I'm excited to see
what Glenn has to say.

295
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,692
I'm a little worried.

296
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:20,993
This is my sketch.

297
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,162
So she's gonna be,
like, a cyborg princess.

298
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,496
There's, like, a war going on,

299
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,532
and she just rips the front
of her dress off

300
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,337
and puts on her, like, war gear,
and she goes out to battle.

301
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,976
Let me ask you.
Where is this coming from?

302
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,379
I thought,
like, a robot under-skull.

303
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,345
- It wouldn't be very round...
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,212
And so I wanted
to show some of the structure

305
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,914
underneath that's more pointy.

306
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,916
I'm liking the direction
it's going in a lot.

307
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:44,116
- Very cool.
- Cool, thank you.

308
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:45,584
What are you pulling from?
What are your sources

309
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:46,986
of reference in your mind?

310
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,189
- Um...
- <i>Star Trek,</i> is it--

311
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:49,659
- That's the problem.

312
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:51,061
Well, I don't
have a lot of references

313
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:52,595
in my head for this.

314
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:56,366
I've only seen, uh, I think,
two <i>Terminator</i> movies.

315
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:58,269
You want to get that off

316
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,805
and figure out the fundamental
form of that piece.

317
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,506
- Okay.
- Don't just come in

318
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,641
with this flat thing
with wires glued to it...

319
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:05,742
- Okay, okay.
- And you're running

320
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,910
- out of time.
- I know. I agree.

321
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:09,846
My concept
is a zombie-type cyborg

322
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,848
with exposed brain
with the probes coming down

323
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,383
from the top into the brain.

324
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:18,059
I'm actually
thinking arms like this.

325
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:22,331
So that would then-- you get
that extra-- that really weird

326
00:14:22,398 --> 00:14:23,765
tentacle movement
out of the hands.

327
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,967
Okay.

328
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,770
I'm not seeing happiness there.

329
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,873
It looks like, you know,
the box robot

330
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,907
that you can be in third grade,
covered in aluminum foil.

331
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:33,408
That's what that looks
like to me,

332
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:36,711
and it's a shame because that
is working out so well.

333
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,680
I encourage you to figure out
makeup applications.

334
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:41,647
Get that zombie aspect across.

335
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,916
Okay.

336
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,652
Let's see
what you got goin' here.

337
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,488
Well, that's what
I had going...

338
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:48,087
And then I was like,
"oh, that might

339
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:51,155
be something
that we've done before," so...

340
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,557
So you're not
doing the post-apocalyptic?

341
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:55,525
No, changing it
into a more modern <i>Metropolis.</i>

342
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:57,958
This guy keeps
souping himself up

343
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:00,695
just like you would a car
or a house.

344
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,098
Well, I like this idea
that you're doing something

345
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:04,600
different from everyone else,
and it can work.

346
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:06,569
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd have to see it.

347
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:08,003
Glenn seems a little unsure.

348
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:11,406
I just don't know
what else I'm gonna go with.

349
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:12,777
Wow, tell us
what you got going on here.

350
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:15,078
He's pretty much a human
that was badly burned,

351
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,480
and the military kind
of put all these pieces on him

352
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:18,714
to keep him alive.

353
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:20,048
This is a very,
very strong design.

354
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:21,517
- Yeah.
- It's really a matter

355
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:23,651
of how you execute this.
Will there be a light here?

356
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,851
I don't want to
just 'cause I don't think

357
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:27,983
it will be easy for him to see
because of the glare.

358
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,750
- Mm-hmm.
- It would be cool.

359
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:31,352
It really would.
I would definitely

360
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,286
put that pop in there
if I were you.

361
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:33,554
Cool, cool.

362
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:36,056
Okay, so, Glenn,
how are you feeling?

363
00:15:36,123 --> 00:15:37,857
Very excited.
It looks like they

364
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:40,593
drew so much inspiration
from the junkyard,

365
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,363
and they did a great job
at honing in on things

366
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,197
that will bring a lot
of production value

367
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:46,902
to the makeups
that they're doing.

368
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,740
All right, is there anybody
that you are really

369
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:50,375
afraid for this week?

370
00:15:50,443 --> 00:15:52,309
I'm definitely
most worried about Sarah.

371
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:54,344
Just that where we're at
in their build right now,

372
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,381
she's got a long way to go

373
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:58,252
to get her ideas
working for her.

374
00:15:58,319 --> 00:15:59,751
Yeah, and anybody
that you think is really

375
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,085
coming out on top so far?

376
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:03,387
I'm really excited
about Nicole's idea.

377
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:05,421
It's a very fresh take
on the cyborg.

378
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:06,721
I'm also liking Derek's.

379
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:08,390
Right now,
he's in such good shape.

380
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,293
There's a bunch
of small decisions

381
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,093
that he has
to make the right call on

382
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:14,762
between now and stage,

383
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,565
and hopefully, he'll do it,
but that's exciting me, too.

384
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:20,666
All right, guys,
we're outta here,

385
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:21,968
but it's looking good.

386
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:23,805
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

387
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,242
I'm looking over,
and Roy is making

388
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,178
this gigantic fabrication.

389
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:38,985
So I realize, "oh, gosh,
I haven't gone big enough."

390
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:43,990
I decide
to make an engine backpack

391
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:47,026
that powers his arm,

392
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:50,629
and I'm not 100% educated
on engines and cars,

393
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:53,798
but it
is incredibly intimidating

394
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:56,602
when you see somebody
doing that well.

395
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:02,037
I've got my face molded.

396
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,241
The next step is to get it open

397
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:06,210
and clean out the clay,
but--

398
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:08,011
Fuck.

399
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,346
My mold just starts cracking.

400
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:16,949
Everywhere where I try
to pry it open, crack...

401
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:19,485
All around the whole mold.

402
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,186
I'm pretty worried.
If it just falls apart

403
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:26,654
and cracks, it's gonna
be just broken pieces of rock.

404
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,711
I'm trying to open my mold up,

405
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:36,947
and it just starts cracking.

406
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:41,487
Everywhere where I try
to pry it open, crack, crack.

407
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:45,856
I'm really worried
that this whole thing's

408
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:49,762
gonna crack open like an egg.

409
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,631
Fuck.

410
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,466
I finally get it open,
and there

411
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:55,300
are cracks in the mold.

412
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,168
It cracked everywhere.

413
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:58,904
I'm really worried
that the cracks

414
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:00,875
went all the way
through onto the face.

415
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:02,745
This is the important part,
so that didn't really crack

416
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:04,214
except for right here,

417
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:07,216
but it's just a thick part
on the ed-- outside.

418
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:08,952
It's gonna be like a mask
that's been put on him,

419
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,189
and it has a lot
of dents and scratches,

420
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,826
so I could incorporate that.

421
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:15,195
I'll make it work.

422
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,529
- Eh.
- What's wrong?

423
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,902
I'm trying
to figure out what I'm gonna do

424
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:19,103
with these breastplates,
if I'm gonna make 'em

425
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,004
out of foam,
or if I'm gonna make 'em

426
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:22,473
out of something else.

427
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,276
I'm messing around with all
the vacuum form plastic,

428
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:29,583
trying to melt it down,
trying to form it with my hands,

429
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,188
and it's not working.
So I decide

430
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:33,360
I'm gonna sculpt out
what I want the metal pieces

431
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:35,397
to look like in the clay.

432
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,033
I vacuum form that.

433
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,635
I see a little boob.

434
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,237
It's a boobie.

435
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,107
I like the way it turns out.
It's got a great shape to it.

436
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,910
So I'm glad I went
with the vacuum form route.

437
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,990
I just don't know
what anything is.

438
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:57,226
I feel weird using it.

439
00:18:57,293 --> 00:18:58,896
I'm obviously very behind,

440
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:02,266
and I still want
to do the chest piece.

441
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:04,902
So I've got
to get it sculpted, completed,

442
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,239
molded, and ready to go
by the end of the day.

443
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:09,508
That's a lot,
and then I still have

444
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:12,145
to attach all the wires
on application day.

445
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:13,445
- I like it.
- Okay, cool.

446
00:19:13,513 --> 00:19:15,883
I get my sculpt done.

447
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:17,852
I do the fastest mold ever,

448
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,986
keeping really close eye
on the time

449
00:19:20,054 --> 00:19:22,587
because I have
to really plan it down

450
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:23,622
to the minutes.

451
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,723
And now, to cleaning.

452
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,558
Got about ten minutes
left, Sarah.

453
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:33,127
All right, that's it.
Time's up.

454
00:19:33,194 --> 00:19:34,962
I know that mine's
really simple

455
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,164
compared to everybody else's,

456
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,837
but I'm happy
that-- that it's done.

457
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:54,787
So today is application day.

458
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,524
We have four hours
for application

459
00:19:57,592 --> 00:19:59,494
and then one hour
in last looks.

460
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:03,166
I'm still not 100% sure
on the concept,

461
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:07,539
so I have a lot of choices
to make today.

462
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:12,483
How are you?
Have a seat, my dear.

463
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:13,852
- How are you doing, man?
- Good, man.

464
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,053
This thing has,
like, two little hydraulics

465
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,320
that come from up here.

466
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,155
My idea is
to have two hydraulic pistons

467
00:20:18,222 --> 00:20:20,290
that go this part down
to the jaw,

468
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:21,625
that operate the jaw.

469
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:22,727
That's who you're gonna
be today.

470
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,630
Sweet.

471
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,469
Well, the first thing
I got to do

472
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,537
is make his lower part
look like a zombie.

473
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:31,704
I'm just kind of interested
to see what Roy's doin'.

474
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,741
I don't think I've ever
seen that in person.

475
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,744
So I'm taking clear wrap
and pros-aide.

476
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:37,446
Pros-aide
is a medical-grade adhesive.

477
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:39,049
You lay down a layer
of pros-aide,

478
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:41,219
you let that dry,
you put the wrap over it,

479
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,453
and you can paint it,
and it looks

480
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:44,355
just like wrinkled flesh.

481
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:50,794
My original concept
was a post-apocalyptic soldier,

482
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:54,432
and the second concept
is a guy in a suit.

483
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,635
So after hearing
from Glenn, I decide

484
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,468
to combine both the characters.

485
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:01,136
He's in a war, but he's not out

486
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:02,571
in some desert somewhere.

487
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,639
He's in the inner city,

488
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:07,110
and he's still
taking all of these parts

489
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:09,950
and putting them on
so that he can fight this war.

490
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:16,918
I need
to test out the chest piece

491
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:19,984
and immediately run
into my first problem.

492
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:21,384
Something's a little wonky
in that.

493
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:23,283
- Sorry.
- No, no, it's not you.

494
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,984
It doesn't fit her at all

495
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,619
because I
have a well-endowed model.

496
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,455
After a long time of trying
to figure out what to do...

497
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:34,159
Oh, this is not at all
going to work.

498
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,843
I do a little flattening,
moved the pieced down by 2 inches

499
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,163
and make everything
fit together.

500
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:43,031
Once I get
my model's prosthetics on,

501
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,764
I love the way the face sits.

502
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,831
I've got that bitch brow
that's going on,

503
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:48,869
that snooty,
like, "what's up?"

504
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:50,904
You know, like,
"I'm cute."

505
00:21:55,306 --> 00:21:56,506
What I'm going to do
is use a lot

506
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:58,275
of third degree for burns.

507
00:21:58,342 --> 00:22:00,443
Third degree is gel.

508
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:01,875
You put it on
wherever you want it.

509
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:03,808
After ten minutes,
it starts to set and harden,

510
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:05,610
and then I just start painting.

511
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,114
13 minutes.

512
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:12,640
Your name is badass today.

513
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:15,849
I think it's
turning out really cool.

514
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:20,287
I'm feeling
like I've got something solid,

515
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:22,154
and I actually
put some details into it

516
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:24,056
that I am pretty happy with.

517
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,298
That's time, everybody.

518
00:22:29,366 --> 00:22:30,965
There are five of us left.

519
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:32,833
At this point,
I think this is anybody's game.

520
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:43,208
At last looks, we have an hour,

521
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:44,810
and I got to pull
everything together.

522
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:46,078
You're in the very front.

523
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:47,045
Get the costume on him,
make sure everything

524
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,979
is set on that.

525
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:54,984
I was thinking there
was gonna be too much glare

526
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,484
to see out of it,
so I wasn't even gonna

527
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:59,419
do any lights, but Glenn
wants me to have lights,

528
00:22:59,486 --> 00:23:02,124
so I found LED lights
that are not as bright,

529
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:04,926
so I'm gonna incorporate that
into the makeup.

530
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:08,730
Are you doing okay?

531
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:10,599
Going at a really good pace,
and all of a sudden,

532
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:15,137
my model feels very faint,
and I'm worried.

533
00:23:15,204 --> 00:23:16,406
Water, please, for my model?

534
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:17,978
He's about to pass out.

535
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:19,580
Deep breaths.

536
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:20,982
He says,
"I just-- I just need to go."

537
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,922
He's got an emergency...

538
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,290
Oh, yeah, yeah.

539
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:28,190
And he just leaves.

540
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:33,965
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm very worried.

541
00:23:34,032 --> 00:23:37,801
It wouldn't be good to walk out
on stage without a model.

542
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:43,140
Coming up...

543
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,742
- That's a bummer.
- I start to panic.

544
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,044
I love this thing.
I think it is really awesome.

545
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:49,912
I think I did
the best job up there.

546
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,419
He's got an emergency.

547
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:58,755
All of a sudden,
my model feels very faint,

548
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:01,225
and he just leaves.

549
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:05,463
We got 15 minutes, guys.

550
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,270
I don't know what to do.
There's nothing I can do.

551
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:15,446
I made these hydraulic pistons

552
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,351
that operate the jaw.

553
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,860
I reached
to get the pistons out,

554
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,099
and they're not there.

555
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,302
Shit!

556
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,671
Oh, well, I guess
I can forget that now.

557
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:31,139
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.

558
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:33,105
My model does come back,
and everything's okay,

559
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,573
but I know I have
to blend the edges

560
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,277
and finish painting.

561
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:40,082
My heart is pounding
the entire time.

562
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,659
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

563
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:54,202
That's time, everybody.

564
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,837
I'm very nervous.

565
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:58,039
My cyborg
looks like a hodgepodge

566
00:24:58,107 --> 00:24:59,974
of different elements.

567
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:10,352
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

568
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,688
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

569
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:15,993
First, let's say hello
to your judges.

570
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,828
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

571
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,097
Glenn Hetrick...

572
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:20,565
- Good evening.
- Hi, Glenn.

573
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:23,134
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

574
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,206
- Evening, everybody.
- Hi.

575
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,706
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page...

576
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:29,107
- Hello.
- Hello.

577
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:30,810
And joining our panel
this week,

578
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:33,280
she is
an award-winning producer

579
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:36,416
with a resume filled
with Hollywood blockbusters,

580
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:39,186
including <i>The Incredible Hulk,</i>
<i>Aliens,</i>

581
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:41,088
and the <i>Terminator</i> franchise.

582
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:42,790
She's also
the executive producer

583
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:44,858
of <i>The Walking Dead,</i>
which won an Emmy

584
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:46,425
for outstanding
prosthetic makeup.

585
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:48,593
- Wow.
- Please give a warm welcome

586
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:49,760
to Gale Anne Hurd.

587
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:51,663
Whoo! Yeah.

588
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:53,299
Nice to meet you.

589
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,699
She has been responsible
for the <i>Terminator</i> movies.

590
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:59,233
If anybody knows cyborgs,
this is gonna be the girl.

591
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,934
Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

592
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:02,302
Thank you.
It's great to be here,

593
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,203
- and good luck.
- Thank you.

594
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,836
So this week,
your spotlight challenge

595
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:08,272
was to source items
from a junkyard

596
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:12,708
and incorporate them into
an original cyborg character.

597
00:26:12,776 --> 00:26:13,977
Let's see
what you've come up with.

598
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:24,885
♪

599
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:38,928
I know that it
isn't the best cyborg ever,

600
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:40,296
but I like my paint job.

601
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:43,366
That's the biggest thing I like
about this piece.

602
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:51,204
♪

603
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:00,913
I honestly think
I pulled this off better

604
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:02,614
than anybody else did tonight.

605
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:04,081
I don't normally say that,
but I think

606
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,714
I did the best job up there.

607
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:17,618
♪

608
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:29,301
it just looks awesome.

609
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,569
The lights and everything
look really cool.

610
00:27:31,637 --> 00:27:33,736
I really feel strongly
about my concept.

611
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:37,170
I'm hoping this
will be win number three.

612
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:45,013
♪

613
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,859
She struts out,
and her train is flowing.

614
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,260
She is stunning.

615
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:56,528
I am proud,

616
00:27:56,596 --> 00:28:00,529
and I feel like
I came back with a bang.

617
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:08,369
♪

618
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:16,544
I was struggling back and forth

619
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,478
between concepts
the entire time

620
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:22,249
because there's a million things
that I could have done,

621
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,850
but the fact
that I was able to even

622
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:27,057
put that out on stage
is something.

623
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,498
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look.

624
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:37,967
I'm not really sure
exactly what to think

625
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:39,602
when the judges go up
and do a close-up look.

626
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:42,270
I'm hoping that they'll
like my paint work.

627
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,471
This is all prosthetic.

628
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,840
Yeah, I mean,
you basically have

629
00:28:44,908 --> 00:28:47,675
two silver-painted foam pieces
with stuff glued to it.

630
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:49,642
I'm surprised that we're
not seeing the things

631
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,044
- go into skin.
- Right.

632
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,848
Like, why not come up here?

633
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,351
It just
terminates without really--

634
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:57,153
- Terminates, very funny.

635
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:04,061
Can you tip down so we can
see the top of your head?

636
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:07,162
So this is meant to be
the scalp pulled back, correct?

637
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,765
It's exposing the brain.

638
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,201
This is one of the few makeups

639
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:13,071
that I'm not stressing over
what they look at.

640
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:14,904
It's the best thing
that I've done.

641
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,174
This piece
is particularly interesting.

642
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:19,375
It has all of these on it.

643
00:29:19,443 --> 00:29:20,811
And I like this claw.

644
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:22,710
This line is gorgeous.

645
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:24,646
Yeah, this whole flow.

646
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,220
These are appliance pieces.

647
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:30,955
Yeah, it's blended around here,

648
00:29:31,022 --> 00:29:32,456
but she did a really good job

649
00:29:32,524 --> 00:29:34,190
'cause, look, it's got
to be blended up in here,

650
00:29:34,258 --> 00:29:35,725
and it's really seamless.

651
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:37,493
It really does look
like the cables

652
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:39,162
- are connected under the skin.
- Yeah, it's actually integrated

653
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:41,030
- into her skin.
- Yeah.

654
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:46,807
It's very different
from her concept.

655
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:47,875
I start to panic.

656
00:29:47,943 --> 00:29:50,577
I didn't create
a cohesive look.

657
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:52,579
It looks like the piece
of his head is missing here.

658
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:53,980
Mm-hmm.

659
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:56,851
To go home now
would be heartbreaking.

660
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,055
There are only
five contestants left.

661
00:30:02,122 --> 00:30:04,890
Tweet about your favorite
using #FaceOff.

662
00:30:11,618 --> 00:30:13,517
The judges go in
for a closer look,

663
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:14,884
and I'm
getting a little worried...

664
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:16,619
So this is all blended up
through here.

665
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,288
And this is a prosthetic here,

666
00:30:18,356 --> 00:30:20,658
and so is all this.

667
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:23,061
And I haven't given the judges
something complete,

668
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:25,462
so I'm just trying not to think
about it.

669
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,497
It looks like the piece
of his head is missing here.

670
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:28,701
- Mm-hmm.
- You see what I'm saying?

671
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:30,636
Yeah.

672
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:37,178
So, Gayle, how do you
feel our artists did tonight?

673
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:39,814
I have to admit I didn't know
what to expect,

674
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:44,155
and a lot of these here tonight
blew me away.

675
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:45,622
All right, well, the judges
would like to speak

676
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:48,092
with each of you
to learn more about your work.

677
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,895
Laura, let's start with you.

678
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,403
I'd like to start by asking

679
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,742
what is the reason
for the prosthetics

680
00:30:57,809 --> 00:30:59,545
on the human side of his face?

681
00:30:59,612 --> 00:31:00,980
Uh, it's kind
of like plastic surgery.

682
00:31:01,048 --> 00:31:02,550
So there's subdermal implants
of some sort.

683
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:03,652
- Yeah.
- Okay.

684
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,719
I have to be honest with you.

685
00:31:04,787 --> 00:31:06,954
I've come to expect more

686
00:31:07,022 --> 00:31:10,956
in terms
of unique approaches from you.

687
00:31:11,024 --> 00:31:12,692
You did some really cool pieces,

688
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,994
but it feels like what it is...

689
00:31:14,062 --> 00:31:16,462
Parts from a junkyard
smushed together

690
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:18,363
into a robot idea.

691
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:19,865
Sort of on a fence
about this one.

692
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:22,701
I'm definitely not
on the fence about this one.

693
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:25,607
It's not my favorite.

694
00:31:25,674 --> 00:31:27,507
It-- it feels like
it has too many concepts

695
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:30,709
that don't feel cohesive.

696
00:31:30,777 --> 00:31:32,876
He's got these implants
in his face.

697
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:35,746
There's a radar
of some sort on his forehead.

698
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:38,050
Do you mind turning around,
please, so I can see the back?

699
00:31:38,118 --> 00:31:40,354
What was it supposed to be?

700
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:42,858
It was supposed to be
the power source for the arm.

701
00:31:42,926 --> 00:31:45,060
It doesn't look that way.

702
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:47,730
This chest piece here,
what's the function of that?

703
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:49,697
He was injured,
and that was supposed to be

704
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:54,203
the best thing he could find
to heal that.

705
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:57,406
When we made <i>the Terminator,</i>
we probably spent three months

706
00:31:57,474 --> 00:31:59,206
coming up with the designs
for that.

707
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:01,576
I think you've come up
with very cool things,

708
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:05,012
but there is that lack
of cohesion.

709
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,815
Laura, thank you very much.
Will you please step back.

710
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:11,086
Roy, you're up next.

711
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:16,594
What exactly did you take
from this junkyard?

712
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:19,031
I took this console
in the back.

713
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:20,734
It's a middle console.

714
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:23,136
These are steering struts,

715
00:32:23,204 --> 00:32:24,438
and this here
is also from the junkyard,

716
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,675
and this was developed
for the military

717
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:28,412
to put on wounded soldiers
to help heal them.

718
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,253
What they didn't realize
is that instead of regenerating,

719
00:32:31,321 --> 00:32:32,754
it actually
reanimates the flesh.

720
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:34,289
He's basically a zombie now.

721
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:36,828
Okay, well, holy smoke,
you've done it again.

722
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:40,868
You've created
another big, fabricated bugger.

723
00:32:40,935 --> 00:32:44,769
The best part about it, though,
is you did a makeup on him,

724
00:32:44,836 --> 00:32:46,403
and you actually sculpted,

725
00:32:46,471 --> 00:32:48,506
and it looks pretty darn great,
I gotta say.

726
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:49,673
Thank you.

727
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,840
It is impressive.

728
00:32:50,908 --> 00:32:53,677
And the lights above his brain,

729
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:56,581
his exposed brain-- I wasn't sure
why his brain is exposed.

730
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:57,949
There was supposed
to be electrodes going to it,

731
00:32:58,016 --> 00:32:59,384
and that's what the light
was supposed to be for,

732
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:00,485
just to make it look cool.

733
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,019
That's an answer I can embrace,

734
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:03,787
because at the end of the day,
when we're doing design work,

735
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,321
it just has to look cool.

736
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:08,091
- Thank you.
- Unfortunately, once again,

737
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,331
so overly invested
in the fabrication

738
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:15,266
that I feel like you missed
a lot of other opportunities.

739
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:17,133
You're making mistakes
because you're trying

740
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,066
to do too much.

741
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,966
Roy, thank you very much.

742
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,705
Sarah, please step up.

743
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:33,177
All right, Sarah, there's
a silver chest plate piece.

744
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:35,145
What is that,
and how is it attached to her?

745
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:36,913
She was in the military,

746
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,317
and an accident happened,
and she was in a coma

747
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,086
for an extended amount of time,
and they decided

748
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:44,390
to start doing some testing
on mechanical-hybrid humans.

749
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,862
This chest piece
is supposed to be in line

750
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,463
with her collarbones.

751
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:51,965
However, when applying it
on her today,

752
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,399
I discovered
that it didn't fit,

753
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,867
so there had
to be some adjustments made.

754
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,503
Wow, that's a bummer.

755
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,105
You picked wires.

756
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,006
That doesn't even count
almost as something

757
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,174
from the junkyard.
That's just like--

758
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,840
that's part
of what I would have.

759
00:34:05,908 --> 00:34:08,275
The eyepiece, it doesn't look

760
00:34:08,343 --> 00:34:10,608
like there
is any kind of function

761
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:12,909
that I could possibly imagine
what that would be,

762
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:14,110
and I don't know
if you understand

763
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,911
what those things really are.

764
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,979
I-- everything I grabbed,
to be honest,

765
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,747
didn't know what anything was.

766
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:23,254
What organs have been replaced?

767
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:24,687
I don't know.

768
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:26,589
Okay.
You know, I think

769
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:29,827
that because
it's not fully realized,

770
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:33,327
um, I don't think you
achieved your objective.

771
00:34:33,395 --> 00:34:34,461
I think you did a great job

772
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:35,961
sculpting this piece
on her face.

773
00:34:36,029 --> 00:34:37,995
You know, when you get up close,
it looks really cool,

774
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:40,661
so I think you did accomplish
something very nice up there,

775
00:34:40,729 --> 00:34:43,032
but this, to me,
feels like it's just a bunch

776
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:44,702
of stuff sitting on top
of her body.

777
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,404
It's something that should
actually have been embedded

778
00:34:46,472 --> 00:34:50,003
in her chest, you know?

779
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:52,304
Sarah, thank you very much.
Will you please step back.

780
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,971
Nicole, please step forward.

781
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,448
How do you feel about this?

782
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:06,349
- I love it.
- You do?

783
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,748
I think it's,
like, the coolest thing

784
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:09,317
I've ever done.

785
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:11,254
That's very good, because
I have to agree with you.

786
00:35:11,321 --> 00:35:14,059
It's probably the coolest thing
you've done.

787
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:17,396
I'm continually--
since your rejoining us--

788
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:20,296
blown away by how much better
you are now

789
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:23,564
than you were
before you left the first time,

790
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:25,366
and I have to ask why that is.

791
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,736
I think that my mentality
when I first got here

792
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:29,838
was, like, "I just-- I just hope
I'm not the first one

793
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,440
to go home."
I think that I was,

794
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:32,842
in the beginning,
trying to do stuff

795
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,145
that I thought you guys
wanted to see.

796
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:37,146
Now, I'm doing what I would
like to see.

797
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:38,380
I love this thing.
I think it

798
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:40,013
is an absolutely
stellar marriage

799
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,014
of science fiction and fantasy.

800
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:43,283
Thank you.

801
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,485
I, too,
really love this makeup.

802
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:48,488
She is spectacular.
Dang, you could put her

803
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:49,789
in front of a camera right now

804
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,190
as far as I'm concerned.

805
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:53,924
I know I personally would like
to take both of you

806
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:56,594
to Comic-Con,
because I think the fans...

807
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:57,661
- Shut up.
- ...would have

808
00:35:57,729 --> 00:36:00,629
such a fantastic time,
and you...

809
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:01,798
- I've never been.
- You would

810
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,466
- be a stellar success.
- Ah.

811
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,166
That would be so much fun, yes.

812
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:06,566
Yes.

813
00:36:06,634 --> 00:36:08,068
Nicole, if you would
please step back.

814
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:09,869
Thank you.
Thank you.

815
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,843
Derek, you're up.

816
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:23,416
What is the point to the piece
in the middle of his chest,

817
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:24,917
other than it came
from the junkyard

818
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:27,019
- and it looks really cool?
- This is just power source.

819
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,486
He was a soldier in a war,

820
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:29,684
and he was injured and burned,

821
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,652
and they turned him
into a cyborg.

822
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,487
It's a really,
really strong concept.

823
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:38,087
I also feel that,
overall this week,

824
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,954
you've probably
made the most clever use

825
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:43,789
out of the found objects
from your junkyard pick.

826
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:46,291
The simplicity
of that extension cord

827
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:47,892
in the middle of his chest
becoming a harness

828
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,561
is really awesome.

829
00:36:49,629 --> 00:36:52,431
The fact that you
sculpted a hard-surface mask

830
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:55,902
and used it as your makeup
is a huge success.

831
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,304
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

832
00:36:57,372 --> 00:36:59,340
That really has a strong,
iconic look,

833
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:02,241
which is great,
'cause so many of us strive

834
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:04,846
to create looks
that could eventually

835
00:37:04,914 --> 00:37:07,149
not only end up in a film
but end up being a toy.

836
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:08,284
Thank you.

837
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,919
I think this is truly stunning,

838
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:13,191
and I could see it
in one of my films.

839
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:14,925
Thank you.

840
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:17,195
So well done.

841
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:19,161
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

842
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,264
Derek, thank you very much.
Please step back.

843
00:37:21,331 --> 00:37:24,401
Thanks.

844
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:26,801
Okay, the judges have heard
what you have to say.

845
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,170
Can you please head back
to the makeup room

846
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:30,106
while they make their decisions.

847
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,947
All right, guys, so let's talk
about the looks overall

848
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:39,217
and what you thought.
Why don't we start with Nicole.

849
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:42,154
It was elegant,
and it read cyborg to me.

850
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:44,488
It was real delicate
and real female-looking.

851
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,087
It didn't shout at you.

852
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,188
Everything
looked really beautiful.

853
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,355
I wanted
to write a story around it.

854
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:52,056
I mean, that's
how inspiring I think it was.

855
00:37:52,123 --> 00:37:55,628
Awesome.
I cannot express how impressed

856
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:57,963
I am with the way
she is fighting back

857
00:37:58,031 --> 00:37:59,999
since she's
gotten the second opportunity.

858
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:01,335
Yeah, she's got the hunger.

859
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:02,973
All right, let's move on
to Derek.

860
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,941
- What are your thoughts?
- He's a good designer

861
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:07,111
and a really good aesthetician

862
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:10,149
with regard to form development
and concept.

863
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:12,219
You could be shooting
this thing

864
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:14,286
in an indie film
as, like, a lead villain,

865
00:38:14,354 --> 00:38:15,420
and that's impressive.

866
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:17,489
I mean, even
on lower-budget films,

867
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:20,059
nobody does this stuff
in two days.

868
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:21,458
- No.
- All right, let's move on

869
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:22,491
to Roy.

870
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,861
Big ideas.

871
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,096
Once again, he did
the big hoopla.

872
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,430
I really hope he listens
to you on the next phase.

873
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:31,133
But I would argue that there
is an insidious wisdom

874
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:33,136
in to him continuing
to ignore me

875
00:38:33,203 --> 00:38:37,042
and make the same mistake
every week, and it's this...

876
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,145
He always manages
to end up safe or in the top

877
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:42,782
because the-- overall,
the silhouettes and the profiles

878
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:44,382
are too big and too strong.

879
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,715
Let's move on to Laura.

880
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:47,652
Oh, the green eyeball.

881
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,555
It was like a tech egg yolk.

882
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:51,891
And then there
was the backpack module.

883
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,628
To me it
just showcased my distaste

884
00:38:54,696 --> 00:38:57,598
for not thinking through
the function of something.

885
00:38:57,665 --> 00:39:00,564
Take your actor,
dip him in Elmer's glue

886
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,765
and then roll him
in junkyard stuff.

887
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,266
Stand him up,
and you got--

888
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,169
"junkyard guy"
is what it felt like to me.

889
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:07,370
All right, let's move
on to Sarah.

890
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:09,340
If you don't know
what a cyborg is

891
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:11,639
and you haven't seen a film
with a cyborg,

892
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:12,872
you're gonna be challenged.

893
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:14,340
She is crippled by the fact

894
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:16,810
that she has not seen
so many of the iconic films

895
00:39:16,877 --> 00:39:19,613
that have, like, paved the way
for mostly everything

896
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:21,715
that we do in science fiction.

897
00:39:21,783 --> 00:39:25,155
It was all about function
and utilitarian design,

898
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:27,157
and hers is completely
devoid of it.

899
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:30,262
Nothing on that
looks like it does anything.

900
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,300
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

901
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:33,535
- I think so.
- Yup.

902
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:35,336
Let's bring them back out,
then.

903
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,119
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

904
00:39:47,187 --> 00:39:49,788
Nicole, you made
some really interesting

905
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:51,257
design choices tonight
that could

906
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:53,294
have easily gone wrong,
but they didn't,

907
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:55,296
and we're really, really
impressed with your work.

908
00:39:55,364 --> 00:39:58,032
And Derek,
you were the most creative

909
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,501
with the use
of the junkyard parts,

910
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,770
and your character
had a great overall look.

911
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:04,039
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

912
00:40:04,107 --> 00:40:05,941
Tonight's winner is...

913
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:15,527
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

914
00:40:15,594 --> 00:40:17,428
Tonight's winner is...

915
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:22,769
Nicole.

916
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,113
Your character had a really
powerful silhouette,

917
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,318
and it was
extremely well executed.

918
00:40:31,386 --> 00:40:33,687
You trusted your instincts.
You have to do that more.

919
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:35,755
It really worked for you.

920
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:37,792
This is awesome.

921
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,028
I was eliminated,
and I've just won my second one.

922
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:43,064
I feel like I finally
proved myself.

923
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:45,403
- Nicole, congratulations.
- Thank you.

924
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,639
You can head back
to the makeup room.

925
00:40:46,706 --> 00:40:49,174
Good luck, guys.

926
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,444
Derek, you
are also safe this week.

927
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:52,679
Get back to the makeup room.
Thank you.

928
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,581
Thank you.

929
00:40:57,182 --> 00:40:58,181
Glenn, why don't you tell us

930
00:40:58,249 --> 00:41:01,351
about the bottom looks
this week.

931
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:03,854
Actually, this week,
we've decided

932
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,692
that there's
really one bottom look.

933
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:15,170
Sarah,

934
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:18,206
your inability
to settle on a design

935
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:20,842
or to make adjustments
really crippled you this week,

936
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,412
and the work just wasn't up
to the same level

937
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,947
as the rest of them.

938
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:26,548
I agree.

939
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:30,623
Roy, Laura,
you are both safe this week,

940
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,426
if you'll please head back
to the makeup room.

941
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:39,267
It's been a real pleasure
seeing your work.

942
00:41:39,335 --> 00:41:40,402
Thank you.

943
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:43,203
It's been an honor,

944
00:41:43,271 --> 00:41:45,607
and I very much appreciate
everything you've had to say.

945
00:41:45,674 --> 00:41:47,609
Thank you.

946
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:51,210
Sarah, it's been so great
having you here with us.

947
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:52,111
Please head back
to the makeup room

948
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,413
and pack up your kit.

949
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,481
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

950
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:56,217
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

951
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:59,220
I'm disappointed
I couldn't pull something out

952
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:01,021
that was as good
as everybody else's.

953
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,791
I wouldn't have traded it
for anything.

954
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:15,102
This has been an amazing ride,

955
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:17,906
and it's meant a lot for me
to be able to be here.

956
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,243
And it's not an easy road...

957
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,283
Not at all.

958
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:26,219
But I love doing this.
