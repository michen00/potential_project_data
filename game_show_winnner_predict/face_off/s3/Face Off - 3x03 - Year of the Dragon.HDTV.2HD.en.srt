00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,645
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:06,576
The artists competed for
a pirate treasure of their own.

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:09,407
$5,000.

4
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:10,975
Everybody wants to win
that booty.

5
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:13,843
Sarah's inventive sea urchin
pirate won her the prize.

6
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:15,983
- Oh, God.
- Ohh! - Nice.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,187
But CC fell short
and was sent home.

8
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:20,088
Now ten artists remain.

9
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,454
And tonight,

10
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,922
they'll face a challenge
like never before.

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,489
Oh.

12
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,791
If we don't get this mold out,
we'll be totally screwed.

13
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:29,159
There is no way that
this is gonna get done.

14
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:31,328
I do think I need
to prove myself.

15
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:32,764
What the fuck?

16
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,200
Something bad has happened.
There's a lot of blood.

17
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,770
On stage, the makeups
are put to an unexpected test

18
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:40,671
in an acrobatic dance routine.

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,406
It was quite stunning.

20
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:44,175
I see what you guys
were going for-- Huge mistake.

21
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:47,446
This could go horribly wrong.

22
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,916
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

23
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,752
to be a guest lecturer
at Make Up For Ever's academies

24
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:55,787
in New York and Paris,

25
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:58,656
a new 2012 Toyota Prius V,

26
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:01,225
and $100,000.

27
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,761
And for the first time ever,
America,

28
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:06,331
your voice will be heard
in selecting the winner.

29
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,933
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

31
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,414
I can't believe CC's gone.

32
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,082
It's a little weird that she
wasn't here this morning.

33
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,684
CC will definitely be missed.

34
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:58,287
There is going to be
an empty bed in our room

35
00:01:58,355 --> 00:01:59,822
and we're going
to have to look at it

36
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,024
every single day
and be reminded

37
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:05,194
that every challenge could be
the last challenge.

38
00:02:08,565 --> 00:02:09,933
At the end of the day,
they were right.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,500
I guess they could have done
more with the jewels.

40
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,611
Jason and I were both
in the bottom last challenge.

41
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,880
I do think I need
to prove myself.

44
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:38,729
and we have no idea
where we're going.

45
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:40,731
Oh, my goodness.

46
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:43,835
And then we see
this beautiful temple.

47
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:50,508
Welcome to the Thien Hau
temple in Chinatown.

48
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:53,945
People come here from all over
the country to celebrate

49
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:56,681
the Chinese new year
with firecrackers, music,

50
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:58,716
and my personal favorite,

51
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:02,320
the amazing Chinese dragon
and lion dancers.

52
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,095
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah!

53
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:16,134
- We got a show.
- Oh, sweet.

54
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:20,305
The dragon is cool.

55
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:23,975
But at this point, okay,
well, that's a giant puppet.

56
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:25,043
Like, what does that have
to do with anything

57
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:26,444
that we're gonna do?

58
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:37,054
All right, guys, so working
together in teams of two.

59
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:38,422
Yay.

60
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:40,023
Your spotlight challenge
is to create

61
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:41,491
a completely original take

62
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,494
on the traditional
Chinese new year dragon.

63
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:45,828
- Wow.
- Yes!

64
00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:48,197
I draw dragons all the time
for tattoos,

65
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:49,832
so I'm kind of excited.

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,234
Your creations will then be
put to the test

67
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:54,637
as the head
of the new year's dragon

68
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:57,206
while performing
in an acrobatic dance

69
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:58,674
on our reveal stage.

70
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:01,010
- Wow.
- Oh, yes.

71
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:02,779
This is not going to be easy.

72
00:04:02,846 --> 00:04:04,481
Once your actor
starts to sweat,

73
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:07,417
the makeup has a super high
chance of peeling off.

74
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:08,719
And we also want to give
your dragons

75
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:13,590
just a little extra
personal touch.

76
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:17,561
Chinese dragons are influenced
by various animals.

77
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:20,231
One may have the head of
a camel, the eyes of a wolf,

78
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,133
and the claws of an eagle.

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,437
So your dragons should
incorporate traits of each

80
00:04:25,504 --> 00:04:30,541
of the team members zodiac signs
into the final makeup.

81
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:32,810
All right, so your teams
have been randomly selected,

82
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,446
and they are...
Nicole and Rod.

83
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:36,581
Excellent.

84
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:38,149
Eric and Sarah.

85
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:39,551
Awesome.

86
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:41,052
I'm excited about working
with Sarah.

87
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,554
She won the last challenge.

88
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:45,323
With my sculpting skills
and her costuming skills,

89
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:47,258
I think we can
do something original.

90
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:48,993
Next team is Alana and Laura.

91
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:49,995
- Yeah, girl.
- Yeah.

92
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,330
Derek and Tommy.

93
00:04:51,397 --> 00:04:53,132
Awesome.

94
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,867
We were both in the bottom
the first time

95
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:56,902
and we both really
wanna win this time.

96
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,237
And I think we can do it.

97
00:04:58,304 --> 00:04:59,838
Jason and Roy.

98
00:04:59,906 --> 00:05:01,173
- Excellent.
- We got this.

99
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:03,308
Jason has fabricating
experience like I do.

100
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:04,776
We both work in the haunted
house industry

101
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:07,079
and so we think that
we can create something cool.

102
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:09,347
Now your sign is tied
to the year you were born

103
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:11,182
and we have
that information right here.

104
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,818
But before you head back
to the lab,

105
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,186
why don't go ahead
and take some photos

106
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,521
of this beautiful temple
for some inspiration

107
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,590
and get working
on your designs?

108
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:22,060
Good luck, everybody.

109
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:31,803
So we have a half an hour
to just look around the temple,

110
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,171
take some reference pictures,

111
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,307
do some sketching to come up
with our concept.

112
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,009
The design is important
because...

113
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:38,510
if you don't know
where you're going,

114
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,812
it's kind of hard to get there.

115
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,548
I'm gonna draw the bodies out

116
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:46,084
so you can get an idea
of where everything is.

117
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:47,385
Even though it's a boar face...

118
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:48,753
- Yeah, yeah.
- The dragon face...

119
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,889
We can give it that goofy,
monkey type of feel.

120
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:52,757
One of the things
we both key in on

121
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:56,594
is doing the boar tusks
and boar jaw with an underbite.

122
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:58,963
And then we wanna try and do
monkey fingers

123
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,932
and then definitely do
some hair laying

124
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,433
since they both have hair.

125
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,271
Yeah.

126
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,706
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:10,040
For our concept,
it's the face of a dragon

128
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,243
with a bull ring out
of a baboon nose.

129
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:14,812
We're just throwing elements
of both of our animals

130
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,147
back and forth
and making one cohesive piece.

131
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:20,617
That's awesome!

132
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:23,920
The first thing I see
is a Chinese warrior,

133
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:26,089
and he's got
this amazing headdress.

134
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:27,523
And there's
these poles coming out

135
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:29,091
with flags hanging from it.

136
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:34,663
- Perfect. I love that.
- Oh, it's amazing.

137
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,998
- Okay, good.
- That's good.

138
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,300
It's one thing to make
a really cool makeup,

139
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:38,701
but it has to be something

140
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:40,036
that can look really pretty
with movement.

141
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:41,370
I can't wait to start
sculpting it.

142
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:42,537
- Start with the camera.
- Just so much...

143
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:43,739
I know.
This is gonna be great.

144
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,540
Is gonna be there to play with.

145
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,616
The first thing we do
when we get to the lab

146
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:56,218
is pick our models
and get right to work.

147
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,323
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

148
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,129
After we get to the lab
from the temple,

149
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,664
I start working
on the sculpture for the face.

150
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,833
Jason decides that he wants
to do the scales.

151
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:15,470
We want to take a rabbit face
and give it snake skin

152
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,606
and then do like
these really long ears,

153
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,042
and then a chest piece
that's reptile.

154
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,788
I'm gonna start vacuum forming
scales for the back piece.

155
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:34,291
The vacuform's great
because it gives us a way

156
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,193
to make copies of things.

157
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:39,864
Scales, scales--
just vacuform after vacuform.

158
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:43,935
Then I have to sit down and cut
out over a hundred scales.

159
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,775
Alana has goat
as her zodiac sign,

160
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:51,944
and mine is a rat.

161
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:54,880
I think a rat
and a goat together

162
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:57,149
is gonna look freaking fierce.

163
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:58,684
This or that?
I'm more feeling this.

164
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:01,087
We could go very theatrical,

165
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,990
but everybody else might be
doing something like that.

166
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:07,459
So we decided to go more
realistic to stand out.

167
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,728
I haven't even started adding
any of the detail

168
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:12,365
but roughed out, I got dragon.

169
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:14,834
I love Chinese culture,

170
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,735
but it's not something
I bring to my aesthetic.

171
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:19,104
So this is a challenge
right off the bat for me.

172
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:21,206
I think it's gonna look
fucking badass.

173
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:22,708
I think it's already
looking sweet.

174
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,209
Me and Derek just click.

175
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:27,212
He's gonna do the face
and I'm gonna do the cowl.

176
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,348
Well, we're both working on such
a same wavelength,

177
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,116
this could be
a great partnership.

178
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:37,389
I love his lips
that you're making.

179
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:39,591
I wanna do the lip
on the top part the same way.

180
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,393
Oh, okay.

181
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:42,994
Our plan is for me to start
sculpting the face,

182
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:46,298
and then we had this arm design
that we wanna try to get done.

183
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,833
It's a scaly dragon arm
with monkey hands.

184
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:50,067
Dude, I am not digging
the scale thing.

185
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:51,469
I don't like these.

186
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:54,172
Right away, as we start doing
some of the sculpting,

187
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,140
certain things
that we have in our heads

188
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,743
just aren't laying out
on the clay correctly.

189
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,311
It just seems like
it's time consuming.

190
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,112
What if I start sculpting
a chest piece?

191
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,048
Sometimes, the best things
can come from

192
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:05,916
having to work on
something different,

193
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:08,619
but now we could be
falling very behind.

194
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:12,122
You can do it
while I fabricate the costume.

195
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,391
- You know what I'm thinking?
- What?

196
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:20,129
To have those snakes and
the rats underneath the skin.

197
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,964
My thoughts are I don't--

198
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:23,966
You're still
not vibing, are you?

199
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,468
I'm sculpting the face,

200
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:29,438
and Nicole wants
to have rat tails hanging down

201
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:31,440
and my mind jumped to
let's incorporate--

202
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:32,874
instead of them hanging down,

203
00:09:32,942 --> 00:09:34,443
let's incorporate it
into the design.

204
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,913
Wouldn't it be interesting
to have rats as cheeks?

205
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,887
In all the Chinese drawings
that you see,

206
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,323
the dragons have
the flares that come

207
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,557
and they're blowing
in the wind.

208
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,359
And I think
that would be really cool.

209
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:52,428
I really wanna do
these rat tail flares

210
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:54,730
and then rod sculpts
the rat tail in,

211
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,632
but he does a mustache.

212
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,835
And that's not at all what
I was talking about.

213
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,371
I just don't think
that he's wanting

214
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:03,172
to take any of my input
on this one.

215
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:09,612
We're all working very,
very hard,

216
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,813
when suddenly,
out of the blue...

217
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,049
What the fuck?

218
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:15,952
There's a scream.
Something bad has happened.

219
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,655
- Did you cut yourself?
- Oh, fuck!

220
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,224
Can I please have a medic?

221
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,825
Alana sliced her finger
really bad

222
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,427
and there's a lot of blood.

223
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:24,928
This really, really,
really hurts.

224
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,730
We have a face piece, a cowl,

225
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:29,366
and a hoof that need to be
sculpted today.

226
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:32,136
I could see in Laura's face
she's worried.

227
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:34,538
Hmm.

228
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,709
There's no way that this is
gonna get done.

229
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:42,212
Coming up...

230
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,580
If we don't get this mold out,

231
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:44,781
we'll be just totally screwed.

232
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:46,316
Shit.

233
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,550
I see what you guys
were going for.

234
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:48,852
I have a lot of problems
with it.

235
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,453
This could go horribly wrong.

236
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:55,592
Can I have please have a medic?

237
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,027
Something bad has happened.

238
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:59,229
This one really, really,
really hurts.

239
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:00,730
Alana sliced her finger
really bad

240
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,132
and there's a lot of blood.

241
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,500
Dude, if you gotta sew me up,
sew me up.

242
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:06,904
Let's go.

243
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:08,105
Are you serious?

244
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:12,043
Do you think
I really need stitches?

245
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,713
I feel terrible for Laura.

246
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,782
I'm leaving this girl
with a ton of work to do.

247
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,918
We have a face piece, a cowl,

248
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,554
and a hoof that need to be
sculpted today.

249
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:22,889
She needs to get stitches.

250
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:25,024
Yeah, go, go.

251
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:28,728
You know what, sometimes one
team member has to compensate

252
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,463
and that's okay.

253
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,131
So I just start
speed sculpting.

254
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,773
My brother Derek and I

255
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:42,408
obviously have
the same zodiac sign.

256
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:44,009
Of course I want to do
something different.

257
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,544
So I walk up
to my brother's sculpt

258
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,413
because I haven't gotten
a chance to see his design yet.

259
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,714
It's getting there.
It's getting there.

260
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:50,449
I really want to kick his ass.

261
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:51,450
What do you have, ram?

262
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:53,319
Boar and a monkey.

263
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,087
I'm gonna win definitely.

264
00:11:55,155 --> 00:11:56,789
I would think
it would be me but, uh...

265
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,259
I would, you know,
let you hang out with me

266
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,761
and share my glory.

267
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:04,130
That's all right.

268
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,066
Seven stitches.

269
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:09,869
Oh, my God, seven?

270
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:11,838
Oh, yeah!
This is looking great girl.

271
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:13,406
- Yeah.
- What do you want me to do?

272
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,874
Hmm.

273
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,275
We have an hour left

274
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:19,344
and I can't get this wet
and we use water clay.

275
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:20,846
How am I gonna work?

276
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,148
Do you want me to get those
bitches on the sander

277
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,383
so they're finished?

278
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,585
- Oh, yeah. Do it.
- Yeah.

279
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:29,488
At the very least I'm gonna go
make these horns for us.

280
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,695
Seven stitches.

281
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:38,029
- Really?
- Yup.

282
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:39,297
That girl's an accident
waiting to happen.

283
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,233
Waiting?

284
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:49,775
The first day, it's a little
hard to kind of grasp

285
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:52,144
a non-realistic makeup
and more theatrical.

286
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:54,146
It takes me a little bit longer
than I'd like

287
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:55,614
to get it roughed out.

288
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:58,250
Making this thing even
is such a pain.

289
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,818
We are about done with our
sculpts at the end of the day,

290
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:02,287
but we're not
where we wanna be.

291
00:13:02,354 --> 00:13:03,688
I think I'm gonna have
to work on this

292
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,890
a little bit more tomorrow.

293
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,892
All right, guys, time's up!

294
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
Time is up!

295
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:11,529
End of the day, we didn't get
our sculpts finished.

296
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:13,464
I think I'm behind schedule.

297
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:16,000
We have a long day tomorrow,
but I'm a little worried

298
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,869
I'm not gonna be able to get it
all done in time.

299
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,350
We have ten hours for day two.

300
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:33,486
Immediately we walk over
to our sculptures

301
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:35,288
and we start
finishing up the detail.

302
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,859
In the beginning,
me and Rod were kind of like...

303
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,126
on different paths.

304
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:42,828
Do you wanna incorporate
those ears?

305
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,730
- I like the ears.
- If there's time.

306
00:13:44,797 --> 00:13:46,698
I tell him, you know what,
let's sit at the same table,

307
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:49,067
and just kind of feel off
of each other's sculptures.

308
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:50,969
And that starts to work.

309
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:52,237
That's gonna look nice.

310
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,705
That's gonna look
freaking amazing.

311
00:13:53,773 --> 00:13:55,807
I wanna make sure that
the communication is there.

312
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,409
We're in a good groove.

313
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:59,444
It's the second day
of the challenge,

314
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:02,347
we still have a good amount
of fabrication left to do.

315
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,983
This is a ton of work.

316
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,019
Roy has to vacuform scales

317
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:10,889
and I have to sculpt
the chest piece, mold it.

318
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:14,026
This is taking a lot longer and
a lot more time and materials

319
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:15,394
than I thought
it was going to take.

320
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,870
The hoof is gonna
start becoming

321
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,671
priority in the molding process

322
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,173
because we need to start
casting those up...

323
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,241
- Casting those, mm-hmm.
- And slip right away.

324
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,578
All of our sculptures
are pretty much finished.

325
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:33,513
I really, really need
to start molding.

326
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,150
You make a mold

327
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:39,853
by putting a cement-like
substance onto your sculpture.

328
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,855
From there you can
pour in silicon or foam

329
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,191
which will eventually
become your prosthetic.

330
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,559
It's not like
it has to be pretty.

331
00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:47,261
It just has to be functional.

332
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,197
Hey, guys.

333
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,531
- Hey.
- Hey.

334
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,066
Here with Glenn to do
a little walk-through.

335
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:55,569
We're into the day and here
comes McKenzie with Glenn.

336
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:57,371
Glenn has such a good
poker face,

337
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,106
it is hard to read him.

338
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:00,641
You're working on the face,
you're working on the cowl

339
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,342
so that they match up?

340
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,944
The thing I'm worried about is
it's flaring pretty well

341
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:05,445
and I don't wanna flare that.

342
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,814
Instead of a singular,
hard line where they lay,

343
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:09,282
when I have to do this

344
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,817
I try to get
the line broken up...

345
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,386
So that where the two meld,

346
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:15,788
the eye doesn't go straight
to the fact

347
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,857
that there's this hard break
between the two.

348
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:19,625
We sculpted the face
of a rabbit

349
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:20,960
and give it scales
like a snake.

350
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:23,028
- So like a snabbit.
- Yes.

351
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,597
This is gonna be very
red and black.

352
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,366
And this is what the ears
are gonna look like

353
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,834
- when you're done?
- Yes, sir.

354
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:28,902
- I'm looking forward
to seeing it. - All right.

355
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:29,736
- Thanks.
- Good luck, guys.

356
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,971
Thanks, guys.

357
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,239
Concept-wise,

358
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,707
this is what we're kind
of going off of.

359
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:38,145
We fabricated these horns to
come up through the cowl here.

360
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,880
We're thinking
of making them shorter,

361
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:41,915
considering the actors
are rolling around.

362
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,118
You're putting a lot of trust
in the fact that

363
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:47,220
that little aperture and some
glue is gonna hold that on.

364
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,422
Explain this to me.
Your two animals were what?

365
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,725
A monkey and a ox.

366
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,494
One of the best ways to stand
out from everyone else

367
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:56,862
is to use
concepts and materials

368
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,531
that not everyone else
is using.

369
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:01,701
We can only look at so many
foam latex masks and hands.

370
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,036
Right.

371
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:04,137
So try to find other things
to integrate.

372
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,505
- Okay.
- It's a cool design.

373
00:16:05,573 --> 00:16:08,408
So, yeah, we're going
with more of the boar jaw,

374
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:10,010
face, nose.

375
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,646
Our colors are an orange,
a blue, and then gold accents

376
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:15,282
because we thought a lot
of people wouldn't do that.

377
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,850
Here's the thing.

378
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,785
When you're going with all these
stylized, theatrical concepts,

379
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,521
my concern for you
is what are you gonna do

380
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,222
to impress us
when we get up close?

381
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,124
Theatrical makeups are great
from far away.

382
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,425
Yeah.

383
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:27,726
But when you look at them
close up,

384
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:29,194
they're gonna be hard,
opaque colors

385
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:30,829
that fade into one another.

386
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,664
Try to find something else that
you can go in there and detail.

387
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:33,665
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

388
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,133
All right, thank you.

389
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:36,635
After hearing Glenn,

390
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,003
I'm wondering if we should be
doing it this way.

391
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:41,540
Sarah seems not as confident
as we were before.

392
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,175
So we're both trying
to figure out

393
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:44,644
if we're going
the right direction.

394
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,345
With everything
that you've seen today,

395
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:47,980
who's really thriving?

396
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,916
Design-wise, what Alana
and Laura have going on,

397
00:16:50,984 --> 00:16:54,387
if they can get it to where
it is on paper in real life,

398
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:56,556
I think they've got a strong
shot at taking it this week.

399
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:58,357
But with Derek and Tommy,

400
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,728
there's a lot of cool
Chinese dragon or Asian ideas.

401
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:03,763
I wish more of them were doing
something like that.

402
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,598
Who do you think is maybe
falling a little short,

403
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,067
at least
at this stage of the game?

404
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:10,037
My greatest concern is
definitely with Sarah and Eric.

405
00:17:10,105 --> 00:17:14,408
What I'm looking at color-wise,
conceptually, and sculpturally,

406
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:16,944
I don't see any-- a lot of it
changing or morphing

407
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:19,146
into something successful
in the next 24 hours.

408
00:17:19,214 --> 00:17:20,614
- Hmm.
- Hopefully I'm wrong.

409
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,016
Yeah.

410
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,818
All right, everybody.
We're heading out.

411
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:24,952
See you tomorrow, guys.

412
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,930
Sarah's molding the cowl piece,

413
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:39,733
and I don't know what Sarah's
molding skills are.

414
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,835
Oh, my God,
this is the fucking shittiest mold

415
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,203
I've ever fucking made.

416
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,138
This is fucking ridiculous.

417
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:47,574
What you did is--
Yeah, the weight pushed it down.

418
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:50,911
Because look at all this.
Like, all this is crap man.

419
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:52,445
I'm so sorry, Eric.

420
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:56,049
We're starting to open
the mold and it stuck.

421
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,319
It's a little nerve-wracking,
opening up a mold.

422
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,855
You just don't know if it's
gonna open easy or break

423
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:03,391
while trying to get it
pried open.

424
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,895
This part's cracking.
It's too thin.

425
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:08,997
Oh, I didn't make it
thick enough?

426
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,900
If we don't get this mold out,
we'll be just totally screwed.

427
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,468
Shit.

428
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,169
I am not letting you down.

429
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,750
Rod is so cute.

430
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:23,931
He runs circles
around all of us.

431
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:27,255
There is no time to waste
with Mr. Rod Maxwell.

432
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,857
He's fast, man.

433
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,697
I've not seen him walk,
I don't think, actually.

434
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:36,802
Being on the show is like
training for a marathon.

435
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,871
Something that would
typically take you a month to do,

436
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:40,927
you're asked to do in no time.

437
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:44,112
So, if it takes a little running,
I'm running to get there.

438
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:48,967
Oh, my God,
this is the fucking shittiest mold

439
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,168
I've ever fucking made.

440
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:51,870
I'm so sorry, Eric.

441
00:18:51,938 --> 00:18:54,439
If we don't get this mold out,
we'll be just totally screwed.

442
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,575
We're starting to open
the mold and it's stuck.

443
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,844
It's a little nerve-wracking,
opening up a mold.

444
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:00,612
You just don't know
if it's gonna break

445
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,016
while you're trying
to get it pried open.

446
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,352
Ugh!

447
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,521
Okay.

448
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,324
So we pull all that clay out
really fast and luckily...

449
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,826
You know, the stuff that needs
to be nice is gonna be nice.

450
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,594
Everything comes out perfect.

451
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:18,029
Uh, I'm gonna take
this outside.

452
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,097
Okay.

453
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,000
I know we have
a lot of work to do.

454
00:19:23,068 --> 00:19:24,469
So I'm thinking

455
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,170
instead of sculpting
and molding these hooves,

456
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:28,306
let's sculpt and vacuform them.

457
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,041
That way we'll be able
to bust them out super fast.

458
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,911
All right, ready.

459
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:35,913
It's like an easy bake oven
for crazy people.

460
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:37,081
I think this is gonna be good.

461
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:39,784
Yeah, let's do that.

462
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:48,326
Alana's got two hooves out.

463
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:52,264
However she definitely wants
this creature to have four legs.

464
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:56,468
Really, if I spend like 30
minutes on the hooves, finishing them,

465
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,070
while you're getting
the weight capped down

466
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,638
and prepping them all--

467
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:00,906
So you want me to do
the application

468
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:02,875
while you apply these?

469
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:04,810
I had to say,

470
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:07,146
"I don't think we're gonna have
enough time for those.

471
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:08,914
Let's concentrate
on something else."

472
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:11,084
I know, I just feel like
we have so much done

473
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:12,719
and we only have two pieces
to lay down tomorrow.

474
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:14,187
It's five hours.

475
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,823
It's just-- It's just
a risk, you know.

476
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,524
I don't think it is.
I just really don't--

477
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,792
All right.
Well...

478
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,093
My gut is telling me
to keep going.

479
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,595
If you wanna continue.

480
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:24,230
We got it, girl.
Don't worry.

481
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,309
There's a lot to do still,

482
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:37,944
so all I'm thinking
about is time.

483
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:39,479
How quickly can we do this?

484
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:40,780
Do you have a system going on,

485
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,249
or do you mind if I just
jump right in?

486
00:20:42,316 --> 00:20:43,717
Just jump in.

487
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,852
Rod has a very specific way
of how he likes to mold,

488
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,821
but I don't think it really
works for a time constraint.

489
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:51,690
You know, you could just like
dip the burlap and just slap it.

490
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:53,692
That's a way to do it.

491
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,495
Right now
there's no reason for panic.

492
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,330
Actually just take-- Just run
down there and back

493
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:00,098
just fast as you can.

494
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,434
We are doing the most work
out of any team

495
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:05,404
by trying to tackle
the entire costume.

496
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,005
This survives the roll,
I think we're good.

497
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:08,540
I think it will.

498
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:11,176
So we're hoping that that
gets us some brownie points.

499
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:12,978
No-- Ian, note to self...

500
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:16,148
No more scales
on projects ever again.

501
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:18,984
So...

502
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:20,619
I get all four hooves done.

503
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:23,188
They're all finished
by the end of the day.

504
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:25,591
But Laura only paints
two of them

505
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:28,193
and the other two
are just hanging out.

506
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:30,695
I'm not okay with that,
I'm not.

507
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:32,297
Going into application day,

508
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:35,200
if we're not on the same page
this is gonna be a disaster.

509
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:45,176
All right.
That's time, everybody.

510
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:48,512
Good job today.

511
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:04,228
It's application day, and
we have four hours in the lab

512
00:22:04,296 --> 00:22:05,896
to get everything done
on our model.

513
00:22:05,964 --> 00:22:08,398
And we still got a lot
of things to do.

514
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,867
Jason starts doing
the paint job.

515
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,836
And I see it and I'm not happy.

516
00:22:12,904 --> 00:22:15,438
There's all these
little black dots

517
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,774
like he has a bad case
of black acne.

518
00:22:17,842 --> 00:22:19,075
I'm thinking though, okay,
if we're on bottom,

519
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:20,677
hopefully it's
for the paint job.

520
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:21,911
Because I can honestly say,

521
00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:23,179
without throwing him him
under the bus,

522
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:24,380
I had nothing to do
with the paint job.

523
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:25,815
And so I decided not
to even touch it

524
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:28,083
and let that be
his cross to bear.

525
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,686
- Hi.
- Hey!

526
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:32,421
Good morning, girl.

527
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,859
Oh, no.

528
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:39,461
I'm laying down the cowl,

529
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:42,265
and as I'm putting it on,
our cowl rips in half.

530
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:43,766
- Did it rip?
- Mm-hmm.

531
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:45,434
It breaks.

532
00:22:45,502 --> 00:22:47,337
A big gaping hole in the back
of the head.

533
00:22:47,404 --> 00:22:49,105
Can you start working
on that patch?

534
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:50,606
I just feel like
if we don't patch it,

535
00:22:50,674 --> 00:22:52,842
it's just gonna keep ripping
throughout her dance.

536
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,577
It's just gonna
keep coming undone.

537
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:55,645
That's okay.

538
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:57,414
We're gonna cover it in hair

539
00:22:57,481 --> 00:23:00,283
and hopefully, it doesn't rip
during the dance.

540
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:04,921
What do you have as the flag?

541
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:06,522
The-the green--

542
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,791
The flowy green stuff that's--
that I made her fan out of.

543
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,159
Okay.

544
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:11,560
I'm going as fast as I can

545
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:13,361
and this is a lot to do
in this four hours.

546
00:23:13,429 --> 00:23:15,263
Are you seeing anything you
don't like?

547
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:16,932
No, that's good.
That's good.

548
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,300
- We'll keep-keep going.
- Okay.

549
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:19,802
We wanna make sure
that the wires

550
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:21,837
that are gonna hold the flags
are in place.

551
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:26,075
Haven't experimented
with this yet.

552
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:30,045
I say we should bring
some of this color up, though.

553
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:31,546
'Cause this is, like,
standing alone.

554
00:23:31,614 --> 00:23:33,915
Derek starts painting
the face piece

555
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:35,483
and I'm gonna focus
on painting the cowl.

556
00:23:35,551 --> 00:23:37,118
- Is this cool?
- Yup.

557
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:38,686
- Yeah? Really?
- Okay.

558
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:40,654
It's a huge risk to have
two different paint jobs

559
00:23:40,722 --> 00:23:42,589
on two different pieces
if they're coming together.

560
00:23:42,657 --> 00:23:45,592
You're just really counting on
each other to pull it together.

561
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,161
This could go horribly wrong.

562
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:49,930
- You like that color or no?
- I don't know.

563
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,032
The orange we have
is looking way too orange.

564
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,335
It's too bright and we wanted it
to be more dull and brown.

565
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:56,637
We're a little worried
about that.

566
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:58,305
So I'm just focusing
on the face,

567
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:00,774
trying to get the color down.

568
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:04,678
We got 20 minutes.

569
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,120
Is that gonna be too much
of a temperance for you or--

570
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:15,755
We all have our fabrication
that we're doing.

571
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:18,958
We're running out of time
to apply the facial appliance.

572
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,527
It is extremely risky to wait

573
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:22,328
till last looks to do
your appliance.

574
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:25,498
To me, a last look should be
just for touch-ups.

575
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:26,833
It's time, guys.
It's time.

576
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:28,635
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

577
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:31,137
But I don't have that option
right now.

578
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,705
Ooh!

579
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:35,908
I got so many things
that have to get done.

580
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,577
That last hour at last looks
is gonna kill me.

581
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,413
Coming up...

582
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,648
It's time to put your makeups
to the test

583
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,650
in an acrobatic performance.

584
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,685
- I'm freaking out.
- I don't see the dragon.

585
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,654
It's one of the strongest
collaborations

586
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,423
I've seen on this show.

587
00:24:56,907 --> 00:24:58,641
So we have one hour
for last looks

588
00:24:58,709 --> 00:25:00,777
and I'm running out of time.

589
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:03,981
We still need to put
on the face prosthetic.

590
00:25:05,717 --> 00:25:07,418
It is extremely risky to wait

591
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:08,853
till last looks
to do your appliance.

592
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,327
And that is gonna
be very wobbly.

593
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:16,429
I'm not getting too much

594
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:17,963
positive reinforcement
from Sarah,

595
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:19,865
so I'm thinking she's
not really feeling it.

596
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,567
So I'm not confident
with what I'm doing.

597
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,971
Okay, so this is
coming up back here.

598
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:27,607
We're both working together
to do details.

599
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:29,209
I'm like, "Nicole, go for it.

600
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,912
Do the makeup."

601
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,213
One minute, everybody.

602
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,121
Let's see how this
all comes together.

603
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:42,456
That's time.

604
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:51,965
We walk out on stage
and the whole place

605
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,334
has been decked out
with lanterns.

606
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:57,771
We have been transported
to a new world.

607
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,975
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

608
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:05,113
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

609
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:06,614
First, let's say hello
to your judges.

610
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:10,218
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

611
00:26:10,286 --> 00:26:11,920
- Hello.
- Hey.

612
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,456
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

613
00:26:14,524 --> 00:26:16,959
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

614
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:18,928
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

615
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,096
Hi, guys.

616
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:21,565
Hello.

617
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:24,067
This week your spotlight
challenge was to work in teams

618
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:25,501
to create an original take

619
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:28,505
on the traditional Chinese
new year's dragon.

620
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:31,007
We also told you that your
makeups would be tested here

621
00:26:31,075 --> 00:26:34,077
on our reveal stage
in an acrobatic performance.

622
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:36,412
But before we put them
to the test,

623
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,847
let's just see
what you've come up with.

624
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:40,383
First up is Alana and Laura.

625
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:06,578
That fact the ours does look
so different--

626
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:09,548
So much less Chinese
than everybody else--

627
00:27:09,615 --> 00:27:11,316
It could help or hinder us.

628
00:27:32,006 --> 00:27:35,041
I'm feeling pretty good.
I love those tassels on the end.

629
00:27:35,108 --> 00:27:37,109
Every time she moves,
those tassels are going.

630
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:59,365
We budgeted our time

631
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:01,634
and we executed it as well
as I think we could have.

632
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:03,904
I'm all smiles.
That guy looks awesome.

633
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:27,729
I'm not 100% on the paint job.

634
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:29,230
That's the one thing
I'm really worried about.

635
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:31,065
But everything else--
I love how the tusks look.

636
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:33,701
After we put the contacts in,
it looks pretty cool.

637
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:55,923
Overall, I really like it.

638
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:58,025
But I'm worried about
the paint job that Jason's done.

639
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,097
Okay, everybody.

640
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,567
It's time to put your makeups
to the test.

641
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:08,702
They've got this dance stage
set up and all of these

642
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:11,238
different dragons are like
circling around each other.

643
00:29:11,305 --> 00:29:12,939
Everybody's a little nervous.

644
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:14,774
I'm so excited to see them
dance and, like,

645
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:16,342
do all their crazy stuff
with this on,

646
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,177
and I'm really hoping
that nothing falls off.

647
00:30:15,968 --> 00:30:18,202
Awesome!

648
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,437
Wow!
Oh, my God!

649
00:30:20,505 --> 00:30:23,374
Once the music ended,
I was like "Whoo. Okay."

650
00:30:23,442 --> 00:30:26,010
And everything held up.
We did good.

651
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:33,150
Okay, let's see how well each
of your dragons held up.

652
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:35,720
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

653
00:30:37,189 --> 00:30:38,990
From far away,

654
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:41,826
it looks like our makeups held
up during the dance routine,

655
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:45,263
but we have a rip this big
in the back of our cowl.

656
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:49,734
I'm freaking out.

657
00:30:49,802 --> 00:30:51,802
Join the conversation
on Twitter.

658
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,704
Use #FaceOff to tell us

659
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:56,207
what you think
about tonight's designs.

660
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:00,452
We have a rip this big
in the back of our cowl.

661
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,820
I hope they don't see it.

662
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:07,525
The sculpt is a little haggard
but the forms are there.

663
00:31:13,032 --> 00:31:14,333
Oh, yeah.

664
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,500
There's like rats crawling up
the side of the...

665
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:17,402
- Ooh, shit.
- Feisty.

666
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,243
Yeah.

667
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,545
Actually in profile,
it's just badass.

668
00:31:26,612 --> 00:31:29,782
It's definitely dragony.

669
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,321
That's a good word,
interesting.

670
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:36,955
Yeah.
Interesting.

671
00:31:37,023 --> 00:31:38,724
The horns were something
I thought of last minute.

672
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:41,493
So it's something that I'm
a little worried about.

673
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,837
Yeah.

674
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,641
All right, well, the judges
would like to speak

675
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:57,476
with each of you to learn
more about your work.

676
00:31:57,544 --> 00:32:00,512
Rod and Nicole.

677
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:06,184
Glenn, why don't we start
with you?

678
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:09,020
Why don't you begin
by explaining to us

679
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,688
what the astrological
symbols were

680
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:12,457
that you had to integrate
into your dragon?

681
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:14,492
Snake and rat.

682
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,429
The characters got sculpted
into the muscle structure.

683
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:20,531
I liked that right away when I
saw the sculpture that you had,

684
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,934
like, rats and snakes
on a dragon face.

685
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:25,702
I also would have to applaud

686
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,674
the fact that you added
these wavy flag banner things

687
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,376
to the top of the head.

688
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:33,445
It looks cool.
It breaks the form up.

689
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:35,180
It does give it an Asian flair,

690
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:38,017
and it shows you were thinking
about the movement.

691
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:41,354
Yours is the one that really
says "Chinese" to me.

692
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:43,990
I really think you did a great
job of integrating

693
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,493
your Chinese birth signs
into this makeup.

694
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:48,762
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

695
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,198
I'm torn with this one,
because I think you have

696
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:55,069
a really creative core concept,
but I don't see the dragon.

697
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:57,604
Thank you very much.
You can both step back.

698
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:04,545
Jason, Roy.

699
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:11,852
Guys, tell me
which astrological signs.

700
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,187
I mean, I can get the snake.

701
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:14,822
Your other one was the...

702
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:16,657
- A rabbit.
- Rabbit, right?

703
00:33:16,724 --> 00:33:18,792
And who did what
in this collaboration?

704
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,528
I sculpted the, uh,
face prosthetic

705
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,430
and made the cowl area here.

706
00:33:23,497 --> 00:33:26,265
And I sculpted
the chest and hands.

707
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,935
All in all, I'm pretty happy
with this physically.

708
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:31,705
I'm just not really happy with
this red and black paint job

709
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:34,608
on the snake-like face.

710
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:37,211
It's distracting to see
all those black spots in there.

711
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,147
I just thought it would
add more of a theatrical effect.

712
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:41,615
Okay.

713
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:43,083
Can you bare your chest for us?

714
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:45,786
- It's--
- That's cool.

715
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:50,090
That does so much more
than this costume piece.

716
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:52,193
Not having the chest out
was a huge mistake.

717
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,962
You know, when you do that
much work, you got to show it.

718
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,664
Also to me, this would have
been the easiest one

719
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:58,799
to turn into a dragon.

720
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:01,169
Really wish you would have
elongated the face

721
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:05,240
and brought the skull structure
closer to a dragon's.

722
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:06,775
Jason, Roy,
thank you very much.

723
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:09,111
You can step back.

724
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:13,281
Alana and Laura.

725
00:34:16,852 --> 00:34:20,088
Tell us about your birth signs
that influenced this.

726
00:34:20,155 --> 00:34:22,624
- Well, I am a rat.
- I'm a goat.

727
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:24,793
We kind of homogenized
the two together.

728
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,927
Who did what exactly?

729
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:27,663
I sculpted the face.

730
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,865
Alana did the horns, hands,

731
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:33,202
and headed up the paint scheme
for the face.

732
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,272
I really love the vibe
of this one.

733
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,276
I do like the fact that you've
got a little bit of muck,

734
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,711
adding a little bit
of weathering

735
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:44,280
helps to give it a little bit
more character as well.

736
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,482
What I see here
is very successful

737
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,017
in its persistence of vision.

738
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,319
It looks like a sketch.

739
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:50,754
I think that's awesome

740
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:51,955
when you can really stick
with a design

741
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,289
and see it all the way
to the end.

742
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,824
I'm really happy with this one.

743
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,192
Thank you.

744
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,493
Alana, Laura,
thank you so much.

745
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:58,828
You can head back.

746
00:34:58,896 --> 00:34:59,963
Thank you, guys.

747
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,065
Eric and Sarah.

748
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,338
Start off by reminding us

749
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,140
which birth symbols are
in your design.

750
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,274
I am the monkey.

751
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,942
And I have the boar.

752
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,844
I see what you guys
were going for.

753
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:18,448
I have a lot of problems
with it.

754
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,284
There's a lot of
unintentional asymmetry.

755
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,021
I love asymmetry
but it has to look to me

756
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,556
like it was put there
on purpose,

757
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,524
not because you couldn't
get things straight.

758
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,293
And I think there's a lot of
elements in this sculpt

759
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,228
that are pretty neat,

760
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,996
but if I would have
made those horns,

761
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,398
I would have just said
"oh, screw it.

762
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,200
This guy is not gonna
have horns."

763
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,535
'Cause that's just too nasty.

764
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,638
- Who did the horns?
- I-- At the last minute.

765
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,173
I painted them.

766
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,342
Did you really think that that
was gonna fly, those horns?

767
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,176
I didn't get a chance
to double look at them.

768
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,812
'Cause we were rushing to get it
over here, so--

769
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,714
- But you made them.
You had to have looked at them.

770
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:52,417
Who did most of
the painting on the face?

771
00:35:52,485 --> 00:35:53,985
Eric did most of it,

772
00:35:54,053 --> 00:35:55,954
and I did some of
the blue work and things

773
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:57,289
and he finished detailing it

774
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:59,258
while I continued
working on costume stuff.

775
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,793
It is actually the details
that I have a problem with

776
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,428
and the lack thereof.

777
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:06,364
We've got really blocky,
solid color

778
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,666
on a blocky, solid sculpture.

779
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:10,869
- Yeah.
- And that spells trouble for me.

780
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:13,171
Thank you both.
You can step back.

781
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,614
All right.
Derek, Tommy.

782
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,786
Okay, guys.

783
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,488
What were your
astrological critters?

784
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:29,956
- I'm an ox.
- I'm a monkey.

785
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,491
Who did what in this makeup?

786
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,293
This is Derek's baby
from the beginning

787
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,661
and I just totally
jumped onboard

788
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:35,995
so I designed the costume.

789
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,230
I followed his lead.

790
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,631
Let's talk about the head.

791
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,099
Face and cowl--
Two separate people?

792
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,035
Yes.
I sculpted the face...

793
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,503
And from here back--

794
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,140
And painted it and he painted
and sculpted the cowl.

795
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,675
I think it's one of
the strongest collaborations

796
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:51,443
I've seen on this show.

797
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:53,011
There is no disparate
difference

798
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,079
between what you did
and what you did.

799
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:56,114
You worked really well
as a team.

800
00:36:56,182 --> 00:36:57,549
Thank you.

801
00:36:57,617 --> 00:36:59,951
I love the color combinations
that you did on this.

802
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:01,386
It was quite stunning
when he first came out

803
00:37:01,454 --> 00:37:03,188
and the lights came on.

804
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,457
I also feel that it has
a Japanese aesthetic as well.

805
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,992
And I don't know
if that's intentional.

806
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,294
I'm a tattoo artist
and a lot of stuff I draw

807
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,762
- is Japanese-style.
- That's awesome.

808
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,464
That seems to me like it's
transcending what it is

809
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,600
that we asked you to do.

810
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:16,668
I'm pretty thrilled
with this thing.

811
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,869
Thanks.

812
00:37:17,937 --> 00:37:18,770
Derek and Tommy,
thank you so much.

813
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:19,904
You can step back.

814
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,373
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

815
00:37:24,343 --> 00:37:26,711
All right, well, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

816
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,213
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

817
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,949
while they make
their decisions.

818
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,154
All right, judges, let's talk
about the top looks.

819
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:38,056
Let's start
with Rod and Nicole.

820
00:37:38,124 --> 00:37:40,292
- What are your thoughts there?
- They did everything right.

821
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,161
They had the little
flag-type things, the fan.

822
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:45,931
They were really successful in
getting aspects of the Chinese

823
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:48,067
traditional new year's dragon.

824
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,835
It's my favorite
from the standpoint of

825
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:51,770
it's a cool concept.

826
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:54,040
Alana and Laura,
what are your thoughts there?

827
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,608
That's probably my favorite.

828
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:58,044
You know, I could see this thing
in a pretty cool indie film.

829
00:37:58,112 --> 00:38:00,279
- It's definitely a cool makeup.
- It is.

830
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,715
There's just nothing about
a Chinese dragon there.

831
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,550
All right.
Derek and Tommy.

832
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:08,120
I love that splash of color
using a mandrill's snout.

833
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:10,889
Yeah.
The costume was so spectacular.

834
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,259
When he moved,
it was very flamboyant.

835
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,161
The question that we have
to answer amongst ourselves is

836
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:19,864
which is more important to us
in this week's challenge--

837
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,532
The team that came up
with something

838
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,669
that more closely echoed
a traditional dragon design,

839
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,303
or the team that came up with

840
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,239
a more successful
and complete makeup?

841
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,807
- Yeah.
- Tough one.

842
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,843
Why don't we talk about
some of the looks

843
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,712
you liked least this week.
Jason and Roy.

844
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:39,716
If they would have painted it
green and not chosen that red...

845
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:40,984
Yes.

846
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,519
That would have been a dragon.

847
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,120
- The red was a horrible choice.
- And the dalmatian spots...

848
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,221
- Yeah, that--
- Did not help.

849
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,556
Yeah.

850
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:47,857
A lot of bad choices
within the challenge.

851
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:49,125
Yeah.

852
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:50,359
An easy save
would have been the color.

853
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:52,828
Let's move on
to Sarah and Eric then.

854
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,263
The horns were unacceptable.

855
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,631
How could you not know
how bad they were?

856
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,967
I would have just not
put the bloody things on.

857
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,102
At least if they would have done
a cool paint job

858
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,838
and done the hair darker
so it wasn't bright orange,

859
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:05,374
it could have been made
to look really, really cool.

860
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,343
Great, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

861
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,644
I think we have.

862
00:39:08,712 --> 00:39:10,246
Let's bring them back out.

863
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,991
Okay, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

864
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,060
This week, there's only
one team that we felt

865
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,495
actually met the criteria
of the challenge.

866
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:36,205
The top team tonight is...

867
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:41,936
All right, Glenn,

868
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,605
so why don't you tell us
about the top teams tonight?

869
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,608
This week, there's only
one team that we felt

870
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,009
actually met the criteria
of the challenge.

871
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:53,948
The top team tonight is...

872
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:57,118
Tommy and Derek.

873
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:00,922
Congrats, bro.

874
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:04,758
Derek and Tommy,
congratulations.

875
00:40:04,826 --> 00:40:06,193
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

876
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:08,562
But as you know, we can only
have one winner tonight.

877
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,864
Glenn.

878
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:13,800
Our winner
of this evening is...

879
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,835
Derek.

880
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:17,304
Yay, Derek.

881
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:18,471
- Thank you.
- Good job, buddy.

882
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:21,307
Thank you.

883
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,943
Although you both did
a really good job,

884
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,379
we felt that your familiarity

885
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,615
with a specific Asian
design aesthetic

886
00:40:27,683 --> 00:40:29,818
is what allowed you guys to do

887
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,553
what we're asking for
in this challenge.

888
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:32,854
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

889
00:40:32,922 --> 00:40:35,123
Derek, congratulations.

890
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:37,259
You and Tommy can head back
to the makeup room.

891
00:40:37,327 --> 00:40:38,628
- See you, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

892
00:40:38,695 --> 00:40:41,764
- Thank you so much.
- See you, guys.

893
00:40:41,832 --> 00:40:43,199
It feels good to win,

894
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:45,100
but my brother's
still out there

895
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,703
and I'm kind of worried
for him.

896
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,138
All right, Glenn,

897
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:51,006
why don't you tell us
about the bottom looks?

898
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,041
We felt that there was one team

899
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:56,611
that really missed the mark
in trying to meet the parameters

900
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:00,148
of this week's challenge.

901
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:04,552
The bottom team is...

902
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:08,189
Eric and Sarah.

903
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,393
All right, so that means
the rest of you are safe tonight

904
00:41:11,461 --> 00:41:13,262
and can head back
to the makeup room.

905
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:20,069
Eric and Sarah,
step to the center.

906
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:37,718
All right, so Glenn,
who is leaving us tonight?

907
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:42,423
The person going home
this evening is...

908
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:47,094
Eric.

909
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:50,464
Ultimately, we felt that
it was your concept, sculpture,

910
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:54,502
and paint job that lead to
the failure of this makeup.

911
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:58,072
Eric, I'm sorry
but you have been eliminated.

912
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,974
Sarah, that means
you are safe this week.

913
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:03,044
Will you please head back
to the makeup room?

914
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:05,313
It's okay.

915
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,384
You know you're talented,
we know you're talented,

916
00:42:10,452 --> 00:42:12,353
so all the best of luck to you.

917
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,121
Thank you.

918
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:16,890
Eric, it has been great
having you here with us.

919
00:42:16,958 --> 00:42:20,060
Please head back to the makeup
room and pack up your kit.

920
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:21,361
Thanks, guys.

921
00:42:21,428 --> 00:42:22,395
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

922
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:25,031
- Take care.
- Good luck.

923
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:26,633
- I'm going home.
- Oh.

924
00:42:26,701 --> 00:42:30,737
- Oh, man.
- Yup.

925
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:33,139
The most disappointing thing
about going home right now

926
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:34,774
is not getting to show
my best work.

927
00:42:34,842 --> 00:42:38,344
I can't enjoy my win now.
That sucks.

928
00:42:38,412 --> 00:42:40,746
Last looks with Derek.
Last looks with Derek.

929
00:42:42,717 --> 00:42:44,451
I definitely don't think
this is the end for me.

930
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:46,653
<i>Face Off</i> has made me
more confident

931
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:48,655
because there's so many things
I did on this show

932
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:50,858
that I've never done before.

933
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:52,059
Derek just better step up

934
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:53,995
and keep going for me
and for us.
