00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:02,868
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:04,502
The artists scavenged
a junk yard

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,437
and assembled an army
of cyborgs.

4
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:07,538
- Awesome.
- All right!

5
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,506
I'm stoked.

6
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:11,843
Nicole's warrior princess
won her the top look

7
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,917
and Sarah was eliminated.

8
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:17,256
Now only four artists remain.

9
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,192
And tonight,
it's the last chance

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,696
for the artists
to make it to the finale,

11
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:22,869
in their most mysterious
challenge yet.

12
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:25,442
You'll be playing
the role of the detective.

13
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,378
- That's awesome.
- Cool.

14
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,483
I see slash marks,
claw marks, puncture wounds.

15
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:32,955
What the fuck?
This is a complete nightmare.

16
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:34,457
Shit.

17
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,226
I'm definitely going home,
and it's heartbreaking.

18
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,322
Did that just happen?

19
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:44,405
Onstage, emotions
run higher than ever before.

20
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:45,941
It just doesn't work.

21
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,418
The last person joining us
in the finale this season is...

22
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:53,222
I've made it this far,
I want to be in the finale.

23
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,530
In the end, only one
will win the opportunity

24
00:00:58,597 --> 00:00:59,964
to be a guest lecturer

25
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:03,100
at Make Up For Ever's academies
in New York and Paris,

26
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:08,340
a new 2012 Toyota Prius V,
and $100,000.

27
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:10,810
And for the first time ever,
America,

28
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:13,348
your voice will be heard
in selecting the winner.

29
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,553
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

31
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:58,205
- We're the last four standing.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:58,273 --> 00:01:59,907
We gotta step up our game,

33
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:01,640
and soon we'll be
the last three.

34
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,139
We know that there's
only three in the finale,

35
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,040
so everybody has to be
on their game.

36
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:07,441
You can't have a bad day now.

37
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:08,776
If you have a bad day,
you might as well go ahead

38
00:02:08,843 --> 00:02:10,245
and pack your bags.

39
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:11,946
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get ready to go.

40
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:13,245
All right,
I'll be down in a second.

41
00:02:13,313 --> 00:02:16,278
It's rough
getting started today.

42
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,580
There's that element
of pressure.

43
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:20,747
And I'm missing my husband.

44
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,179
I just want to make him proud.

45
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:23,679
And if it wasn't for him,

46
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:25,447
I wouldn't even have the courage
to be here right now.

47
00:02:25,514 --> 00:02:28,685
If I can get to the finale
at least, then I can say,

48
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:31,219
"I did the best I could."

49
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:42,799
We're in the woods,
and it just looks creepy.

50
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:47,072
We head up a hill,
and there's a police car there.

51
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,643
- It's the guy from <i>Grimm.</i>
- Oh, my God.

52
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,115
Welcome to Cedar Grove
in Griffith Park.

53
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:55,786
Now, I'd like to introduce
a very special guest.

54
00:02:55,854 --> 00:03:00,156
He has made hundreds of
television and film appearances,

55
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,994
on everything from <i>Prison Break</i>
to <i>My Name Is Earl,</i>

56
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:07,995
and is currently starring
on the hit NBC show <i>Grimm.</i>

57
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,133
Please give a warm welcome
to Silas Weir Mitchell.

58
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:13,702
- Hey, guys.
- Yeah!

59
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,502
Silas Weir Mitchell.
I recognize him right away

60
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,603
'cause me and my wife
watch <i>Grimm.</i>

61
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,968
It's one of our favorite shows.

62
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:19,903
<i>Grimm</i> follows
a homicide detective

63
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,173
who is descended
from an elite line

64
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,943
of criminal profilers
known as Grimms.

65
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:29,244
They're charged with keeping
balance between humanity

66
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,280
and the mythological creatures
of the world.

67
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,714
To do this,
they have a special ability

68
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:36,519
allowing them to see
the true physical appearance

69
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:40,127
of the creatures that lay behind
an otherwise human form.

70
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:44,600
So this week, you'll be playing
the role of the detective.

71
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:47,373
In these woods are four
different crime scenes,

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,308
each one with a victim.

73
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,177
Your spotlight challenge
this week

74
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,049
is to interpret
the clues at the scene

75
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:55,816
and create
the fantastical creature

76
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:58,052
that you think could've
committed the crime.

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,388
- Wow.
- Cool.

78
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:00,957
That's awesome.

79
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,628
I like the bloody and the gory
and the freaky, and all that.

80
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:05,062
So I think this
is totally up my alley.

81
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,433
Silas, you play a wolf-like
character named Monroe,

82
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,504
so you are intimately familiar
with the ins and outs

83
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:12,106
of the creatures of <i>grimm.</i>

84
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:13,840
What can you tell these guys
about them?

85
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,376
Just know that different
creatures will kill differently.

86
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:19,546
Like a person
who's a vilderman,

87
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:21,945
which is basically sort
of a caveman creature,

88
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,746
isn't gonna bite somebody.

89
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,079
They're gonna
beat them to death.

90
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,615
A blutbad might
rip your throat out.

91
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:29,482
A bee creature will sting you.

92
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,683
Just one prick,
and you're dead.

93
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,551
So you can see the reflection

94
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,187
of the type of creature
in the crime.

95
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,589
Fantastic.

96
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:38,025
- It's a dark world out there.
- I love it.

97
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:40,528
All right, guys.

98
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,229
So on my go, I want you
to rush into the woods

99
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,862
and claim your crime scene.

100
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,895
You will have 30 minutes
to study the evidence,

101
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:48,863
take photos, and sketch.

102
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,430
After that you can head back
to the lab,

103
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,931
choose your models,
and get started.

104
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:54,667
Now, before I send you off,

105
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:57,735
keep in mind that
this is your last chance

106
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:00,571
to impress our judges and earn
your way into the finale.

107
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,012
Good luck, guys,
because your time starts now.

108
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:08,947
We have to grab
our sketch books

109
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:10,982
and we have to go over
and find a crime scene.

110
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,818
And it's not ours
until we pick up

111
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,723
the number of the crime scene.

112
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,998
Oh, my God.

113
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,370
So I run to the crime scene
and I see a biker.

114
00:05:25,144 --> 00:05:28,046
I look at the victim, and I see
slash marks on his chest,

115
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:31,414
claw marks on his arm,
puncture wounds on his face.

116
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:32,882
I'm thinking immediately,

117
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,017
oh, this looks like
a werewolf attack.

118
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,155
I really want to do
the wolf character.

119
00:05:37,222 --> 00:05:40,926
So I claim this area, but then
I find a claw in the tire,

120
00:05:40,994 --> 00:05:45,002
and I see feathers.

121
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,638
Once I see the feathers,
I'm thinking, "oh, man.

122
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:49,104
"I don't want to do
another bird.

123
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:52,507
I want to try to do
something different."

124
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:54,709
Oh!

125
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:56,310
I walk over to the crime scene,

126
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:59,645
and there is someone who has
been killed by venom injection,

127
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:02,651
so I think,
"oh, no, snake. Pass."

128
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,991
And I go off
into another direction.

129
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:10,700
I stumble along a picnic,

130
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:13,139
the picnic
has just been scattered.

131
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,609
There's stepped-on food.

132
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:18,381
The victim's got giant claw
marks on her chest, on her leg,

133
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:21,518
on her arm, and underneath
her nails there's gray fur.

134
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:22,986
She had been battling
with this thing.

135
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:26,257
There is also a baby shoe
with blood on it,

136
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,991
so I'm thinking that whatever
this creature is,

137
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,560
obviously slashed her to death,
but where is the baby?

138
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:38,438
I grab the number, and after
I check out the crime scene,

139
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,510
I'm already thinking
it's a werewolf.

140
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:43,512
I'm having a really hard time
sketching this out,

141
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,414
trying to find something
that's different and unique

142
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,217
about this werewolf.

143
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:50,452
It's so hard to make one
that hasn't been done.

144
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,586
Nicole and Derek are able

145
00:06:55,653 --> 00:06:57,186
to get to
the other crime scenes,

146
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:58,621
and have already claimed them,

147
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,358
so I run to the crime scene
that Roy's looking at

148
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:03,561
and I grab the number
as quick as I can

149
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,133
because I definitely
don't want a snake.

150
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,466
Have they already
claimed the other two?

151
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,434
Whew!
Everything else is picked.

152
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,202
So now I have no choice.

153
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,041
That's not a good way
to start off.

154
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,283
I'm going
through the crime scene.

155
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,118
The most obvious trait
is the spider webs.

156
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,585
The victim has a bite mark
on her arm,

157
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,086
and she's had some sort
of allergic reaction

158
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:30,588
to some sort of venom.

159
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:33,257
She was also collecting samples
of what looks like pollen.

160
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,692
I thought, ooh,
wouldn't that be interesting?

161
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,663
She's stealing
this insect's food,

162
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,633
so maybe it doesn't have
to be a spider.

163
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,166
It can just be
an insect creature

164
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,802
that has spider attributes.

165
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:46,911
Because this is
the last challenge

166
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:48,580
before the final three,

167
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:51,784
I'm gonna have to do something
that people won't forget.

168
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:54,219
It's gonna have
a beetle-type head,

169
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,023
and then really long jaws
that come out.

170
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,996
I come to the crime scene.

171
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:03,330
I see he has, like,
these huge fang marks

172
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,332
all over his body.

173
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,599
And then over next to the tent

174
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,734
I see this giant egg
that's cracked open,

175
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:10,638
so I'm thinking
this is a snake.

176
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:14,040
My concept is that this camper
has come across this snake egg,

177
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,309
and the parent
has come looking for it.

178
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,678
So I'm gonna design
a snake creature.

179
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:20,815
I know I want the body
to be female shaped

180
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,086
but with scales,
sexy and tough.

181
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,454
So I'm thinking biker chick.

182
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,492
I look at the feathers
and the claw,

183
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,827
and the claw kind of looks
like a raptor claw.

184
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:36,597
Supposedly, you know, birds
have evolved from dinosaurs,

185
00:08:36,664 --> 00:08:37,865
and some of them
do have feathers.

186
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:41,073
So my concept is
a raptor-looking human,

187
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:44,012
and it has feathers
just like a bird.

188
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,681
I think of it as what
a raptor would look like

189
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:48,284
if it had evolved,
if it didn't die off.

190
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,487
After the 30 minutes of design,

191
00:08:52,555 --> 00:08:54,890
I'm not really sure
what direction I want to go in.

192
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,094
This is the last time to show

193
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,795
that I want to be
in the finale.

194
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:02,296
It's crucial
to make something great.

195
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,708
We get back to the lab,
and we have to pick our model.

196
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:17,139
Originally I was thinking
a wolf as a guy,

197
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,340
'cause, you know,
werewolves are usually men.

198
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,542
And then something
switches in my head,

199
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:22,877
and I'm like, you know what?
Do a girl.

200
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:24,479
Do a girl wolf.

201
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,684
Maybe in that way I can make
this unique and different.

202
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,390
We have six hours
in the lab today,

203
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,761
so I start working
on a sculpt for the face.

204
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:37,330
I want to get that
finished and molded

205
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:40,067
by the end of the day.

206
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:43,105
It's really hard to do a snout
and make it not look cartoony,

207
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:44,606
so I want to look
through the books

208
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,341
and see if I can find
different stuff

209
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:51,178
that's gonna help me
make my sculpture better.

210
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:52,947
So I've got
all these little scales

211
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:55,182
that I have to take
and put into the sculpture.

212
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,616
So I think if I take it

213
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:58,684
and stretch the fishnet
pantyhose over it,

214
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:00,951
I can get that scale pattern,
and it will be really quick.

215
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:08,116
It's super weird being
in the lab right now.

216
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:09,984
It's so quiet.
Creepy quiet.

217
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:12,821
We all feel the tension
of the finals.

218
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,229
Laura does not look very happy.

219
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:22,065
She's got her very serious
face going on,

220
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,135
so I know her brain
is going 100 miles an hour.

221
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:28,942
I would like to have the face
and the cowl sculpted and molded

222
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,478
so that I can run them
in foam today,

223
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,247
but something is--
something's going on.

224
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:36,116
Great.

225
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:39,083
All of a sudden,
I'm second-guessing my concept,

226
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:40,718
I'm thinking about my husband.

227
00:10:40,786 --> 00:10:45,688
I mean, I just, my mind
gets into a very... dark place.

228
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:48,489
So every five seconds,
I'm trying to shake it off,

229
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:51,762
trying to shake it off.

230
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,129
But every time I go back
to the sculpture,

231
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,497
it just doesn't seem
good enough.

232
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm definitely going home,

233
00:10:59,668 --> 00:11:01,434
and it's extremely
heartbreaking.

234
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:07,206
Coming up...

235
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,839
Trying to open this mold
is pissing me off.

236
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,907
What the fuck?
This is a nightmare.

237
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,475
I've gotta try to save
this makeup.

238
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,312
I made it this far,
and I want to be in the finale.

239
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,995
Something's going on.

240
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:29,632
All of a sudden,
I'm second-guessing my concept,

241
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,066
I'm thinking about my husband.

242
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:36,108
I mean, I just, my mind
gets into a very... dark place.

243
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:40,682
I know that my husband
would want me to do well,

244
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,753
and the only way
that I'm going to be able

245
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,423
to get my head in the game

246
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,259
is to try to block out
those thoughts.

247
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:52,695
So I decide, okay, let's
make lemons out of lemonade.

248
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:56,670
If I can get everything
sculpted by today,

249
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:57,871
I will mold them

250
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,406
at the beginning
of the day tomorrow

251
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:01,875
and still be
in good enough shape

252
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,911
to finish everything else
that I need to finish.

253
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,855
Just finishing up
some detail on my sculpture.

254
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:14,722
Now I'm just gonna
start molding,

255
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,422
and hopefully get it done today

256
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,891
so I can focus
on everything else tomorrow.

257
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,198
At this point
I'm up in the air.

258
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,766
I don't know
if I'm gonna make the mouth

259
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,737
go all the way up the cheek
or just keep it small.

260
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:30,406
I still have the shape of that
in the sculpt.

261
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:32,542
If I want to paint it
last minute, I can.

262
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:47,920
That's time, guys.

263
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:51,722
At the end of the day,
I'm frustrated.

264
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,558
I have a lot of work
tomorrow to do,

265
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,594
and I'm extremely nervous.

266
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:04,766
Good luck, everybody.

267
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:06,234
It's day two in the lab.

268
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:07,467
We got ten hours today,

269
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,868
and I got a lot of stuff
to get done.

270
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:12,336
I've gotta get my body sculpted
and molded and poured.

271
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,906
So I'm trying to figure out

272
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,575
what kind of scales
I want to put on it,

273
00:13:15,643 --> 00:13:17,277
and design
the middle section of it.

274
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:19,848
How'd yours come out?
Let me see.

275
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:21,449
Good.

276
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,285
My foam piece came out awesome.

277
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:25,154
So I go back
to sculpting the cowl.

278
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,825
I'm using a tool to make
little dots around the area

279
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,294
where the feathers are gonna be

280
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:32,429
so it doesn't look like
it's just glued onto the head.

281
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,428
I'm looking around
at all my pieces,

282
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:39,833
and they're not as bad
as I thought they were.

283
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:42,069
When you get into
the wrong frame of mind,

284
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:44,406
no matter what you do,
everything is bad.

285
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:45,808
Now that I'm coming in fresh,

286
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,710
I decide
I'm just gonna go ahead

287
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,880
with the original concept,
with the original sculp.

288
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:53,018
I've already done the work.
Let's bust this out.

289
00:13:57,688 --> 00:14:00,255
The chest is something
that's gonna sell the wolf.

290
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:03,559
The ribs are being compressed,
and this monster is coming out,

291
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:05,328
but then I still want
to keep it a girl.

292
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:06,730
I'm struggling with making sure

293
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,432
that this thing is going
to look right.

294
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:14,105
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

295
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,242
I brought a special guest
with me today

296
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,511
to help give you some tips.

297
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:20,746
He's worked on
some pretty big films,

298
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:22,983
like <i>Mission Impossible III,</i>
<i>Dawn Of The Dead.</i>

299
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:26,153
He won an Oscar
for JJ Abrams' <i>Star Trek.</i>

300
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:29,890
He also happens to be
the makeup designer for <i>Grimm.</i>

301
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,593
Please give a warm welcome
to Barney Burman.

302
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,763
Awesome.

303
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,636
Wow!
Oh, my God.

304
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,138
McKenzie walks in
with Barney Burman,

305
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:39,705
and I'm, like, freaking out.

306
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,206
I get teary-eyed.

307
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:42,407
Oh, my God,
this guy is awesome.

308
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:43,809
- You ready to do this?
- I am.

309
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:44,978
All right.
Let's get started.

310
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:46,180
- Good morning, Nicole.
- Hello.

311
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:47,382
- How are you?
- How's it going?

312
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,417
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

313
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:49,519
- Hi.
- Awesome to meet you.

314
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:51,087
Pleasure to meet you.

315
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:53,123
What did the clues lead you
to believe caused the crime?

316
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,427
I'm thinking it's, like,
a wolf-type creature.

317
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,428
I want to have fur coming
from, like, the elbows,

318
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,063
from, like, the calves.

319
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,568
And so she's not all the way
into the werewolf form yet.

320
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:03,572
That's good,
that's actually a lot more <i>Grimm</i>

321
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:06,508
is to have those elements
of human still showing through.

322
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:08,044
That makes me feel better.

323
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:11,583
I decided to go with more
of a raptor-human creature.

324
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,717
You've got this mouth
that extends back this way,

325
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,084
and you'll do that mostly
with coloring?

326
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:17,152
I do have the shape,
just to give it an effect.

327
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,423
But it's gonna be a smaller
mouth and shadows here.

328
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:21,694
Why not go ahead and create
that mouth back there?

329
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:23,096
But I'm kind of worried

330
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:24,464
that I didn't sculpt
more of a mouth there.

331
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,098
If you're going
with a paint job bold enough...

332
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,432
- Yeah, okay.
- You can compensate for that.

333
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,801
Cool.

334
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:31,005
I'm creating
a female reptile character.

335
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,407
Hmmm.

336
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:33,741
Looks like you're really
focusing on makeup,

337
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:34,940
to work of the face,
no fabrication.

338
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:36,175
I'm not doing
any fabrication at all.

339
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:37,710
I'm giving those judges
what they wanted.

340
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,079
I'm actually
using the combination

341
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,981
- of silicone and foam latex...
- Oh, cool.

342
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,382
'Cause I think that my pieces
would be too heavy

343
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,915
to do 'em
that thick in silicone.

344
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:45,686
Are you going to use the foam
latex as, like, a filler...

345
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:47,691
- Right.
- For the silicone piece?

346
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,160
So then I get the flexibility

347
00:15:49,227 --> 00:15:50,927
plus the translucency
of the silicone,

348
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:52,094
to make it look more snakelike.

349
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,861
It's an important element,

350
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:56,398
to focus in on the smaller
details sometimes,

351
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:57,634
rather than just the bigger,
broader picture.

352
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:58,835
Yeah.

353
00:15:58,902 --> 00:16:00,302
So I've kind of combined
the idea

354
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,237
of a spider, beetle,
bumblebee monster.

355
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,808
What are you thinking
about the color scheme on this?

356
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,109
Right now I have black going
into green going into purple,

357
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,381
with an iridescent kind of pearl
over the entire thing

358
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:13,853
to give kind of a beetle look.

359
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,221
I think if you get that sort
of shimmery quality to it

360
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:17,721
that's going to look
pretty cool.

361
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:19,923
With Barney helping me
to figure out the color scheme,

362
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:21,625
it's all starting
to fall into place.

363
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,427
- Thanks, Laura.
- Good luck.

364
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:25,727
So let's start with Nicole
and her wolf.

365
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:27,095
Seems a little basic,

366
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:29,597
but that is not always
necessarily a bad thing.

367
00:16:29,665 --> 00:16:32,067
When you get into laying hair
and the color scheme,

368
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:33,468
that can make up for a lot.

369
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:35,170
What do you think
about Derek and his raptor?

370
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:36,639
I'm personally just worried

371
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:39,575
that he might go a little muted
with the colors,

372
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:41,612
but I think
it's got good potential.

373
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,183
Let's move on then
to Roy and his snake.

374
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:47,288
The sculpt is looking
really interesting, really cool.

375
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,591
Last but not least, Laura.

376
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:50,058
I like what
she was talking about.

377
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:52,026
And I liked what little
I could see of her sculpt

378
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,863
peeking out from underneath
the mold process,

379
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,234
it looked like she's got
a good handle on it.

380
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,071
So is there anybody
at this stage,

381
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,241
from what you saw,
that you're just loving?

382
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,909
I'm really greatly
looking forward to seeing

383
00:17:03,977 --> 00:17:06,947
Roy's snake and Laura's bug.

384
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:09,951
Because Roy and Laura
both have a bold quality

385
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,220
in their sculpture
already going.

386
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:12,955
Derek and Nicole

387
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,557
are going to rely a little more
on the finishing work.

388
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,492
All right, well, I can't wait
to see how all this turns out.

389
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,294
- No, neither can I.
- Thank you for being here.

390
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:21,527
Thank you.

391
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,663
All right, guys.
We're heading out.

392
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:28,267
- Good luck tomorrow!
- Thank you.

393
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:34,983
Whatcha doing?

394
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,687
I'm pouring a body.

395
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,556
- Silicone?
- Uh-huh.

396
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,325
I'm gonna use silicone
'cause it's translucent.

397
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,194
And snakes-- they a little bit
of a translucency to 'em

398
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,629
'cause they shed their skin.

399
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,531
I've tried for two other
challenges to pour silicone,

400
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,401
and I've been having some issues
with it being too heavy.

401
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,803
So I'm trying to make the whole
thing as thin as possible.

402
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,572
Maybe this will give me the skin
that I need to make it work.

403
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:58,006
Okay, so...

404
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:07,381
The arm pieces I'm sculpting
are not too elaborate.

405
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:10,418
I kinda wanted to have an area
to push those feathers in

406
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:12,924
so it looks like
it's growing out.

407
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,365
Trying to open this mold
is a complete nightmare.

408
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,666
Fuck.

409
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,036
It's not working on the table.

410
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,774
I put it on the floor.
I'm trying different tools.

411
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:30,743
I try to step on it,
and I'm pulling on it.

412
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:33,279
That's not working.
It's just a little bitch.

413
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,780
I think it's all the clay
that I put in the chest area

414
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,314
that's locking up on the side.

415
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:40,783
I have a serious risk
of cracking this mold

416
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,284
or damaging something.

417
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,685
Really?
Like what the fuck?

418
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,550
Why isn't it pulling up?

419
00:18:45,618 --> 00:18:47,654
I cannot get it off
to save my life.

420
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:49,556
What is going on?

421
00:18:51,736 --> 00:18:55,126
We have a very different occupation
than the normal, every day person.

422
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:58,475
We have limbs and weird things
hanging around in our house.

423
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:02,783
I worked on this film, and I had
to make this guy with this brains out.

424
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:05,007
I kept the prop and I had it
sitting in my living room and

425
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,271
we had... the public that
came to the house...

426
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:10,811
looks in him and sees it and
just stops taking to my wife.

427
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:11,896
Oh, my God.

428
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,677
- And he's just staring at it...
- Freaked out.

429
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:17,120
And she's just like... it's okay,
it's not real, it's just a prop.

430
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:19,533
You never know what's gonna happen
living with a special effects artist.

431
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:21,074
Only in our world.

432
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,039
Trying to open this mold
is a complete nightmare.

433
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:31,144
What the fuck is going on?

434
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,711
I'm really freaking out
at this point.

435
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:35,582
I've got so much other stuff
I need to get done.

436
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,751
Why isn't it pulling up?
It's pissing me off.

437
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,319
I can't get it off.

438
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:43,055
I cannot get it off
to save my life.

439
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:45,059
Roy comes by,
and he starts helping me,

440
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:47,861
and then Laura comes over too.

441
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:49,463
- All right.
- Oh. There we go.

442
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,833
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

443
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,502
Release!

444
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:56,803
Okay.
It was just all this clay.

445
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,004
Finally, this thing comes off.

446
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,207
What a frickin' relief.

447
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:02,809
- Thanks, guys!
- You're welcome.

448
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:07,580
So I'm trying
to make spider webs,

449
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:09,182
and I'm not sure how to do it.

450
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,685
Let's hook it up back here
to the big air pressure,

451
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,120
and I'll show you
how to make a good web.

452
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,961
Turns out Roy
has this amazing technique.

453
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:19,231
So you stand back about right
here and shoot it that-a-way.

454
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,534
Oh, all that way, huh?
Okay.

455
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:22,602
He shows me how to do it.

456
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,302
- See?
- Yes.

457
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:26,035
A lot better, ain't it?

458
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:28,269
You just drizzle glue
over an air compressor

459
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:31,306
and blow that out,
and that makes a spider web.

460
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:32,604
I'm going spider web crazy now.

461
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,315
Everybody's makeup so far
looks pretty cool,

462
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:42,617
like the sculpts and designs.

463
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:44,152
I'm worried.

464
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:48,657
There's only three spots left,
and I want one of 'em.

465
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:49,993
At the end of the day two,

466
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:51,562
I've already started
pre-painting,

467
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,464
and everything's made.
And if I don't screw up,

468
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:56,969
I know that I'll at least be
going to the finals.

469
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:59,741
There's only five minutes left.

470
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:03,514
By the end of the day,
I'm worried

471
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:06,052
because I have a lot of work
set out for me tomorrow,

472
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,655
'cause there's
a lot of hair stuff

473
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:09,857
that I have to do on the model.

474
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:12,258
And I have a lot to do
in four hours tomorrow.

475
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:14,161
All right, that's it.
Time's up!

476
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,433
Let's go.

477
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,151
- I'm so tired.
- I know.

478
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:31,186
It's, like, crazy to be here.
Everything's different.

479
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:33,089
The house is different,
the shop's different.

480
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:35,061
I'm nervous.

481
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,563
I mean, it is what it is.

482
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,598
You go home, you go home.

483
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,934
At this point,
it could be anybody's game.

484
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:41,069
I know.

485
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:43,238
Oh, my God.
Tomorrow is the day.

486
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:45,172
Either we're gonna make it
or we're gonna go home.

487
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,423
It's application day.

488
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:57,758
We have four hours in the lab,

489
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:59,629
and one hour at last looks.

490
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:02,432
I get to the lab and I start
getting my foam pieces ready.

491
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:03,598
There's a lot of painting
I gotta do,

492
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,199
a lot of applications
I gotta do.

493
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:07,003
I'm definitely worried
about time.

494
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:08,772
Whenever you're
just sitting there,

495
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,572
four hours
can seem like four days.

496
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,438
But whenever you're under
that kind of pressure,

497
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:16,843
it seems like four minutes.

498
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,511
Hey!
Laura. Nice to meet you.

499
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:20,714
You're gonna be a werewolf.

500
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:22,919
Let's see
how this is gonna fit.

501
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:24,622
I really hope this fits you.

502
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,591
Let me just hold this up
and see.

503
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:28,127
First thing that I need
to start doing

504
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:29,929
is look at this chest piece
on my model,

505
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,298
and just kinda see
where it's gonna lay...

506
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:32,800
Oh.

507
00:22:32,868 --> 00:22:34,002
But it's not fitting
the way it's supposed to.

508
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,538
We could still tape 'em
a little bit,

509
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,273
maybe tape 'em together.

510
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:39,210
I planned on getting
this chest piece glued down

511
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:40,913
in, like, ten minutes,

512
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,616
so this is stressing me out
already.

513
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:45,951
Oh, probably should have
left your ears in.

514
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:48,321
Perfect.

515
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,356
Here comes the paint.

516
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:54,861
I didn't put a lot of texture
into the sculpture,

517
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:56,796
so this paint job
is not only crucial,

518
00:22:56,863 --> 00:22:57,963
but very involved.

519
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,464
You're gonna be colorful.

520
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:03,502
I think-- oh, man.
This is a lot of stuff to do.

521
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,171
I just gotta get it done now.

522
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:11,112
Just relax.

523
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,280
Me and Teisha
go in the bathroom

524
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,483
to fit this chest piece.

525
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:15,185
- Do you want me to hold it?
- Yeah.

526
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:17,551
I'm gonna do a little bit
of tape too.

527
00:23:17,618 --> 00:23:20,086
We're trying
so many different options,

528
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:21,488
but the tape is not working.

529
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:23,457
It's uncomfortable for her.

530
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:25,826
- It might pop off, huh?
- I think so.

531
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:26,927
All right.
Let me grab some saran wrap.

532
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:28,960
This turns into a nightmare.

533
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:31,795
Nothing's really working
until I get the cellophane.

534
00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:34,330
It took a lot longer than
I ever thought it would take.

535
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:36,400
We've gotta hurry.

536
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:38,638
Fucking shit.

537
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:39,975
Okay.

538
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:43,708
A lot is coming unglued.

539
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:46,011
I'm having some issues
with the chest piece.

540
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,315
I'm having a hard time
getting it glued down properly.

541
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:50,753
This is starting
to come loose too, dang it.

542
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:52,452
I'm not even gonna
try gluing it down

543
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,955
'cause I know
it's gonna be an issue.

544
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:57,629
But I think I can at least maybe
cover it up at last looks.

545
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:58,563
Okay.

546
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,267
Let me put your feathers on.

547
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:04,002
I start opening holes
in the prosthetic

548
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,772
and sliding the feathers in,
and it's taking a long time.

549
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,341
So once I start getting
to the back,

550
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,310
I figure out that I can just
pull off some of the feathers

551
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,475
and bend the quill a little bit
and glue 'em down.

552
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,443
I definitely don't want
these feathers to fall off.

553
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,480
No, I gotta put 'em
on your elbows still.

554
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:23,852
I hate this hair shit.

555
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,921
I decided to go with hair,

556
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:27,322
'cause I wanted
to do something different,

557
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,691
something with a little bit
of a human element.

558
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,628
I've glued the wig down
to the bald cap, so, you know,

559
00:24:31,696 --> 00:24:33,664
I gotta go with it,
but it just will not keep

560
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:34,999
the shape that
I want it to keep.

561
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:37,569
I think I'm gonna have
to cut in this snake part

562
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:38,970
and have the hair
come through it.

563
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:40,604
Time's running out.

564
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:41,873
So I'm thinking I can take it
and I can cut holes in it,

565
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:43,375
almost like a ear piercing.

566
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:46,381
I can also put the wig down
and keep it in a decent shape.

567
00:24:46,447 --> 00:24:48,846
15 minutes.

568
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:57,382
All right.
That's time, everybody.

569
00:24:57,448 --> 00:24:59,315
Can't forget this.

570
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:02,421
It's only hours away
from finding out

571
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:05,055
who the final three
are going to be,

572
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:07,022
and I'm worried
because I don't know

573
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,456
what the judges
are looking for.

574
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:11,924
I feel it's anybody's game.

575
00:25:11,992 --> 00:25:13,225
Coming up...

576
00:25:13,293 --> 00:25:14,659
I've gotta try
to save this makeup.

577
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:16,526
I've made it this far,
and I want to be in the finale.

578
00:25:16,594 --> 00:25:21,300
The last person joining us
in the finale this season is...

579
00:25:28,914 --> 00:25:31,349
The risk of going home
is back again,

580
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,851
and this is the last time
to show that I can do this.

581
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,053
So I unpack my kit

582
00:25:35,121 --> 00:25:37,457
and start adding blood
to the mouth.

583
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:39,361
Keep 'em open.

584
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:40,964
Steel toe, of course.

585
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:42,901
There's no way for me
to cut that open

586
00:25:42,969 --> 00:25:44,202
and shove the claw through,

587
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,605
so I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

588
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,844
The hair
looks like bad sex hair.

589
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:52,312
I gotta try to save it.

590
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,417
I've made it this far,
and I want to be in the finale.

591
00:25:54,484 --> 00:25:56,421
This just is not my day.
I can tell you.

592
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:58,958
You're right.
It's the other way.

593
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,793
First we need to do the arms.
Those are crucial.

594
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:03,731
It's just how I planned...
but not really.

595
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,800
Unfortunately
the gaff tape is black,

596
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:09,902
and the black's not sitting
so good with the white.

597
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,104
15 minutes.

598
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:13,941
It's not gonna look good.

599
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:17,645
The talons are one of the things
that I found on the crime scene,

600
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:19,113
so I think it needs it.

601
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:21,117
Let me see if I can
somehow put these things on.

602
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:22,818
I literally have
like one minute left.

603
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,320
It's worth a shot.

604
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:27,791
I have no time to lose my mind.

605
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:37,640
All right, guys!
That's time!

606
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,213
The claw doesn't
really look good.

607
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:41,481
I'm just really worried
right now.

608
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,982
I'm thinking
the judges might hate it.

609
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,561
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

610
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:57,766
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated,

611
00:26:57,834 --> 00:27:00,633
and three of you
will make it into our finale.

612
00:27:00,701 --> 00:27:03,604
First, say hello
to your judges.

613
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:06,175
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

614
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,475
Good evening.

615
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,811
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

616
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,580
Good evening, you fab four!

617
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,585
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

618
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:18,187
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

619
00:27:18,255 --> 00:27:20,157
And joining our panel
this week,

620
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,296
he's a writer and producer

621
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:24,599
who has worked
on incredible projects,

622
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,601
including <i>The Secret Circle</i>

623
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:29,702
and the supernatural thriller
<i>The Mothman Prophecies.</i>

624
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,272
But most importantly,

625
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,575
he's one of the producers
of <i>Grimm.</i>

626
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:38,410
Please give a warm welcome
to Richard Hatem.

627
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,984
It's great to be here.

628
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:46,385
He writes Grimm, and he thinks
about these characters,

629
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:48,120
knows them in depth,

630
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:50,992
and can really give insight
into the <i>Grimm</i> world.

631
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,626
Richard, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

632
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:54,626
Thank you for having me.
It's great to be here.

633
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:57,397
So guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

634
00:27:57,464 --> 00:28:00,765
was to interpret clues
from a crime scene

635
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:03,805
and then create
a <i>Grimm-</i>inspired creature

636
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:05,207
that might have committed
that crime.

637
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:07,710
First up is Laura's creation.

638
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,930
I'm loving it.

639
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,963
It reminds me
of a fly's movements.

640
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:31,532
It's very brightly colored.

641
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,534
You know, it's working onstage,

642
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,870
so I'm excited to see
what the judges have to say.

643
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,318
It could look better,

644
00:28:55,386 --> 00:28:56,585
but it's definitely
not a train wreck.

645
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:57,720
I'm looking at the judges

646
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:00,123
and they don't look
that impressed.

647
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:19,411
You can really
see the human there,

648
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,147
and then also you can
really see a creature there.

649
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:24,649
It makes it more <i>Grimm-</i>like,
and I like that.

650
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:43,974
I love it.
I love how it turned out.

651
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:46,308
I love the Mohawk look too,
with the feathers,

652
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:47,676
and the feathers
coming out of the elbows,

653
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,447
and the way
that my actor is moving

654
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:51,251
and, you know,
it just looks really cool.

655
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,221
Judges, why don't
you take a closer look?

656
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,457
Can you stand?

657
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,191
I really like
this webbing stuff.

658
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,360
Can you turn around for us?

659
00:30:10,428 --> 00:30:11,294
Oh!
Oh, okay.

660
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:15,062
It's kinda beautiful
at the same time

661
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,065
as being totally disgusting.

662
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:19,768
I get the general sense
that they're critiquing it

663
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:21,802
a little bit more than normal.

664
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,338
And maybe that's because
this is the final four

665
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,239
and they just
really want to be sure.

666
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:36,412
The hair is actually
coming through the ear.

667
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,276
- Why?
- I don't know.

668
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:40,210
I'm worried about the hair,

669
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:42,281
'cause that just
does not look good.

670
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,149
Looks like the sculpt
is pretty solid.

671
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,918
This is kind of a neat
treatment up in here

672
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:47,220
those little bumps
around there.

673
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:53,290
The shape is very weird to me.

674
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:54,690
It should carry up
to the clavicle

675
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:56,825
- and not end here.
- Yeah.

676
00:30:56,893 --> 00:30:58,728
Oh.

677
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,732
So... they, like,
pull on my ear.

678
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:10,607
They're noticing that it's
not sitting where it should.

679
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:12,808
I'm really bummed.

680
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:14,746
I'm just thinking that
this could be it for me.

681
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:20,314
Tell us who you think
should make it to the finale

682
00:31:20,382 --> 00:31:22,884
using #FaceOff on Twitter.

683
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:28,387
Look at how these ears
are just glued on the hair.

684
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:30,190
This is nerve-racking.

685
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:32,393
I can't go home.

686
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:33,895
I have so much left
I need to prove.

687
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:35,230
I like the color,

688
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:39,202
'cause it's almost
like a zombie werewolf.

689
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,574
You know, this looked,
from afar, a lot better

690
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:44,677
than I think it does up close.

691
00:31:44,745 --> 00:31:47,180
- I do like the mouth.
- I do too.

692
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,350
The only concern I have
is the feathers on the elbows,

693
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:51,019
and the missing claw.

694
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,289
But everything else,
I think, looks really good.

695
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:54,824
It's definitely gonna be
a tough decision.

696
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:55,926
Yeah, definitely.

697
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:58,062
All right, thank you.

698
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:04,070
So, Richard, what do
you think of tonight's work?

699
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:05,472
I'm really impressed.

700
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,642
All of these are showing
a lot of creativity,

701
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,311
and they're really
freaking me out.

702
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:13,349
Okay, well,
the judges would like

703
00:32:13,417 --> 00:32:14,718
to speak with each of you now

704
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:15,987
to learn more about your work.

705
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,524
Derek, you're up first.

706
00:32:22,864 --> 00:32:24,064
Derek,

707
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,667
give us the backstory
of your character.

708
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:29,906
My crime scene had a biker
who looked like he got jumped.

709
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:32,342
Then I found a claw
and feathers.

710
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,312
So I thought of what a raptor
would look like

711
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,314
if he evolved.

712
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:39,085
I was impressed
by real interesting choices

713
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:42,389
as far as breaking up
the colors.

714
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:44,659
But what I was most impressed
with is, for once,

715
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,796
you have not overworked
or overthought

716
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:48,164
a particular element

717
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,334
at a detriment
to a separate element.

718
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,369
So I think you did
a really good job

719
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,470
of balancing your time

720
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:54,239
and presenting
a complete makeup.

721
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:56,008
Thank you.

722
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:57,644
All in all, I think
you were really successful.

723
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:00,414
I'm disappointed that his back
doesn't have as much detail

724
00:33:00,482 --> 00:33:01,916
as the rest of him has.

725
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:05,154
What is the justification
for the raptor toenail?

726
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:07,591
I did that
'cause I just didn't have time

727
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:08,893
to sculpt a whole foot.

728
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:10,562
It's such a profound statement

729
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,499
- that it seems odd...
- Yeah.

730
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:14,934
How it comes out of the shoe.

731
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:17,638
Talking about that raptor claw,

732
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,174
that's an interesting
<i>Grimm</i> detail,

733
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:22,645
as something changes from
one manifestation to another.

734
00:33:22,713 --> 00:33:23,947
I just think
it's really clever.

735
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,415
- I really like that.
- Well, thank you.

736
00:33:25,483 --> 00:33:26,817
Derek, thank you very much.

737
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:28,720
Will you please step back?

738
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:34,228
Laura.

739
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:42,573
So Laura, tell us about
your concept for your creature.

740
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,977
My concept was that
he's human at the bottom,

741
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:49,348
and then he transforms
into an insect creature.

742
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,483
And the wings are coming out,

743
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,319
but it's, like,
mid-transformation.

744
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:54,055
This is where all
the spider webbing comes out of,

745
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:55,591
through that point.

746
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,359
So when we saw the victim

747
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:59,295
and there was a lot of spider
webbing all over the trees,

748
00:33:59,363 --> 00:34:00,497
that's where
it's jutting out of.

749
00:34:00,565 --> 00:34:02,199
It's a weird choice for me,

750
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:03,969
having those wings
coming out of the arms,

751
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:06,806
but I do like the idea
of the webbing and all of that.

752
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,208
- And that's really cool-looking.
- Thank you.

753
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:09,944
There's a lot of details

754
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:12,247
that you wouldn't think
would work together,

755
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:14,450
but they actually
work together really well.

756
00:34:14,517 --> 00:34:16,753
- So I like it a lot.
- Thank you.

757
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,390
What you did with the color
this week is very difficult,

758
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,126
because you've got
three going on.

759
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,162
That's horrifying.

760
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,331
I probably would've
fought against that

761
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:27,100
if I was asked to build it.

762
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:28,435
It's so well done
it blows my mind.

763
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,005
Thank you.

764
00:34:30,072 --> 00:34:32,808
- Laura, please step back.
- Great job.

765
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:39,484
Roy, you're next.

766
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,364
So Roy, you show up at
a camp site, and you see what?

767
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:51,668
I see a camper that is dead,

768
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:53,837
and he has several puncture
wounds on him.

769
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,873
And he's also found
a giant egg that has hatched.

770
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:57,676
And so I'm going
under the assumption

771
00:34:57,744 --> 00:35:00,480
that that was a baby
snake creature of some type,

772
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:03,951
and this is the mother
that's come to reclaim her baby.

773
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:09,793
The sculptural elements
of this are so good.

774
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,898
Your sensibility to line
and form is really fantastic,

775
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:16,869
and there's some general shapes
happening in the head

776
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:18,905
that are beautiful.

777
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:20,140
The placement of the fangs,

778
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,809
what's the reasoning
behind that?

779
00:35:21,877 --> 00:35:23,244
I wanted to do
something different,

780
00:35:23,312 --> 00:35:24,613
because I'd never
seen fangs coming out

781
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:26,449
from this part
of the cheek before.

782
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:28,485
And there's a reason why.

783
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:30,555
Because it just doesn't
make any sense.

784
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:33,091
Physiologically,
it doesn't work.

785
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,426
I'm really happy
that you gave us

786
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:35,728
a complete makeup
this week, Roy.

787
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:39,200
But I am a little disappointed
with this wig.

788
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,401
You didn't need
to put red hair on her

789
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:42,705
to let us know
that it was a woman.

790
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:44,708
The decision specifically

791
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:48,246
to pull the hair
through holes in the ear,

792
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:51,116
I am really at odds with it.

793
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:54,054
Even though you've given me
a lot to be proud of,

794
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:56,290
you've made
some finishing decisions

795
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:59,060
that have crippled you.

796
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:01,230
Roy, please step back.

797
00:36:04,302 --> 00:36:07,105
Nicole, you're up.

798
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:16,317
Obviously this is
a terrifying creature,

799
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:21,124
and yet at the same time,
there's a story behind her.

800
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:22,492
Can you tell us about that?

801
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,227
She's kind of transforming.

802
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,563
I was thinking that this
breastbone is popping out,

803
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,866
and then stretching the skin
so it's bursting out.

804
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:34,035
I love this creature.
It's really scary.

805
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:35,334
I really like the color,

806
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,268
because it almost looks
like a zombie werewolf.

807
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:39,070
I think it's a cool design.

808
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:41,339
I think that
the wardrobe decisions,

809
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,708
which I generally try
not to harp on

810
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:48,612
unless they're distracting
to me-- this week it is.

811
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,813
I gotta tell you,

812
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:52,649
I like the fact
that you paid attention

813
00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:54,918
that there was gray hair
at that crime scene

814
00:36:54,986 --> 00:36:56,252
and you decided
to do a gray wolf.

815
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,487
That's really cool.

816
00:36:57,554 --> 00:36:59,355
But I think your hair work
was very weak.

817
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:00,856
If you would have put
on less hair

818
00:37:00,924 --> 00:37:02,191
and a little bit shorter,

819
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:03,826
it would have been
a lot more effective.

820
00:37:03,894 --> 00:37:05,728
Okay.

821
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:08,530
- Nicole, please step back.
- Thank you.

822
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:13,468
All right, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

823
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:15,637
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

824
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:19,741
while they decide
who will move on to the finale.

825
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:23,244
Let's talk about
the looks tonight.

826
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:24,345
I think we like 'em all.

827
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:25,613
We do, yeah.

828
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:26,948
This is a toughie tonight,
guys.

829
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:29,017
- Oh, boy.
- Why don't we start with Derek?

830
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:31,486
I felt this was
the best balanced makeup

831
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:32,887
that he's presented so far.

832
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:35,222
I liked the paint job
that he did.

833
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:38,025
That sculptural thing of
the mouth going up to his ear,

834
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:40,494
it's very lizard-like,
very reptilian.

835
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,730
The overall effect
was fantastic.

836
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,899
And again--
scary, fierce, menacing.

837
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,467
That's the sort of thing
that we ask for.

838
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,636
All right,
let's move on to Laura's.

839
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:53,674
I love the color choices
she made in this creature.

840
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:56,676
One thing that she did so well,

841
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:59,279
she went so old school
on those little wings,

842
00:37:59,347 --> 00:38:01,715
with just wire
and plastic wrap.

843
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:02,983
Yep.

844
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,851
It was such
a great little detail.

845
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,720
Okay, let's move on
to Roy's creature.

846
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:10,490
It's a love-hate thing
for me,

847
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:12,358
'cause I just
so love the sculpt.

848
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:14,427
The placement of the fangs,
killing me.

849
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:16,696
But not nearly as bad
as that hair.

850
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:19,265
When asked not
to fabricate anything,

851
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,733
just do a makeup,

852
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,568
he still couldn't help himself

853
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,337
from covering up
what is otherwise a good makeup.

854
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:27,406
So I was really
disappointed in him.

855
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,408
Not in his makeup,
in his decision-making.

856
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,509
Yeah.

857
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:31,777
All right, and lastly,

858
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,812
let's discuss
Nicole's creature.

859
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,280
You talked about
the costume choice

860
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:36,815
- that you really didn't like...
- Yeah.

861
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:38,083
- And I really did like.
- Right.

862
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:39,451
It was intriguing.

863
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,787
One of the things I would like
to see her do, though,

864
00:38:41,854 --> 00:38:43,722
is be a little bit
more sophisticated

865
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,591
and subtle
with her sculptural choices.

866
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,159
I really like Nicole.

867
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:50,528
I think she's got
a great design aesthetic.

868
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:51,763
When she just lets herself go,

869
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,298
she comes up with
some really great stuff

870
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,800
without even realizing
how good it is most of the time.

871
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:57,802
Okay, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

872
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,103
- Yeah.
- I think so.

873
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,371
I believe we have.

874
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,174
Fantastic.
Let's bring them back out.

875
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:12,716
So Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge

876
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,752
and the first person
to make it into the finale?

877
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,654
This week's winner is...

878
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:27,372
So Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge

879
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,641
and the first person
to make it into the finale?

880
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,544
This week's winner is...

881
00:39:36,815 --> 00:39:38,883
Laura.

882
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,453
Congratulations.

883
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:44,455
Thank you!

884
00:39:44,523 --> 00:39:47,892
You took huge risks
this week between your big,

885
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,995
beetle-esque sculpture
and your intricate paint job.

886
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:52,563
Very impressive.

887
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:54,098
Thank you.

888
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,032
Thank you very much,
all of you.

889
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,333
I'm stoked.

890
00:39:56,401 --> 00:39:59,537
The fact that these judges
believed in me

891
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:02,006
and they want
to see more of my work,

892
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:04,108
it's incredibly validating.

893
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:06,477
So Glenn,
who is the next person

894
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:08,312
to make it into the finale?

895
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:11,115
The second person
going to the finale is...

896
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,854
Derek.

897
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,758
Thank you. Thank you.

898
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:23,593
Derek, this is probably
the most complete makeup

899
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:24,961
that we've seen from you,

900
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:27,631
and it's very obvious
that you have evolved

901
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:28,899
since the beginning
of our competition.

902
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:30,000
Thank you.

903
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:31,401
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

904
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:33,870
Derek, great job
on making it into the finale.

905
00:40:33,938 --> 00:40:35,305
Thank you.

906
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:38,007
I definitely cannot believe
I made it this far.

907
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:39,742
It's a good feeling.

908
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,245
Well, we have two artists left,

909
00:40:42,313 --> 00:40:44,514
and only one spot
in the finale.

910
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:47,450
Glenn, who gets the final spot?

911
00:40:47,518 --> 00:40:51,687
The last person joining us
in the finale this season is...

912
00:40:53,257 --> 00:40:55,024
I plan on being here
till the end,

913
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,592
and I want to be
the last person standing.

914
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,762
This is it.
I cannot go home again.

915
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,664
I can't!

916
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:05,467
Nicole.

917
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:06,936
Oh, my--

918
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:08,570
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

919
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:10,005
Wow.
It's so insane.

920
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:11,140
I just don't believe it.

921
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,307
Oh, my God!

922
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,176
Congrats.

923
00:41:14,244 --> 00:41:15,844
Oh, my God.

924
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:18,514
You clearly had
some great ideas tonight,

925
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:21,850
and there's a lot of promise
in your makeup.

926
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:23,418
We definitely think
you have more to show us.

927
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:25,454
Thank you so much.

928
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:27,055
It's incredible.

929
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:29,791
I went home
and I worked my butt off,

930
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:32,160
and I came back and made it
to the finale.

931
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:36,464
Now I have one last chance
to bring everything I got.

932
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:39,767
Oh, my God.

933
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:41,369
Roy, I'm sorry to say,

934
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:44,339
but that means
you will be leaving us tonight.

935
00:41:44,406 --> 00:41:45,807
Roy, it's been wonderful
for all of us

936
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:47,875
to have an opportunity
to see your work.

937
00:41:47,943 --> 00:41:50,144
You think big, and you're
willing to take chances.

938
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:52,113
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

939
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:57,318
Roy, it has truly been great
having you here with us.

940
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:58,920
I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

941
00:41:58,987 --> 00:42:00,521
Please head back
to the makeup room

942
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:02,289
and pack up your kit.

943
00:42:02,357 --> 00:42:04,692
- Thank you very much, guys.
- Thank you.

944
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,127
- Good luck, Roy.
- Good luck.

945
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:13,434
The three of you
have done an incredible job

946
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:15,135
to get this far.

947
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:16,937
There's only
one challenge standing

948
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:18,939
between you
and our grand prize.

949
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,508
Please head back
to the makeup room.

950
00:42:21,576 --> 00:42:22,743
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

951
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:32,252
I'm very surprised.

952
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,721
Getting this close
and not making it...

953
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:37,624
is the hardest part.

954
00:42:37,692 --> 00:42:40,493
- I'm shocked, honestly.
- I'm shocked.

955
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,295
I got to show what I can do.

956
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:45,398
I got to make stuff
that I could never make at home.

957
00:42:45,466 --> 00:42:49,635
I feel good about my time here.

958
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:51,137
I don't work for a living,
I get to play for a living,

959
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:52,939
and not many people
get to say that.

960
00:42:53,006 --> 00:42:54,207
So I'm definitely
gonna continue with makeup.
