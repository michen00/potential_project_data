Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:05,986
All right, Glenn,
who is moving forward?

3
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,088
Emily.

4
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:10,524
Darla.

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,859
Logan.

6
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:15,796
Congratulations.

7
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,098
But your night isn't over yet.

8
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,201
- Oh, no.
- We're raising the bar on you.

9
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:21,602
Ai-yi-yi.

10
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:23,571
We just went
through hell and back.

11
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:27,641
What are we doing?
Why are we still onstage?

12
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:28,943
Find out who wins...

13
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,811
- Oh, my God.
- ...right now.

14
00:00:30,846 --> 00:00:32,213
This is crazy.

15
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,381
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i> finale.

16
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:45,392
This season's finale is going
to be the most difficult one yet.

17
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:46,794
Oh, no.

18
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:49,430
You guys have these amazing
champions in your corner,

19
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:51,866
so we're raising
the bar on you.

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,534
In fact, it is so tough,

21
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,570
that we've brought back
the entire eliminated cast

22
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:57,571
to help you.

23
00:00:57,606 --> 00:00:59,473
- Seriously?
- What?

24
00:00:59,508 --> 00:01:01,008
Guys, come on out.

25
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:02,977
- What?
- Jamie.

26
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:04,845
Jamie.
Can I just go hug?

27
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,581
- That's a trip.
- Oh, my God.

28
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:08,883
I'm so happy to see Jamie.

29
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,652
I'm so happy to see
everyone onstage.

30
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,053
Before I tell you more,

31
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:15,456
why don't we get you guys
some new teammates.

32
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,057
Darla, you get first pick.

33
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:19,760
I pick Rob.

34
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:20,761
Emily, you're next.

35
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,264
Adam.

36
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,901
- Logan.
- Julian.

37
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:28,636
Anthony.

38
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,538
Jamie, come on down.

39
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:31,872
Ben.

40
00:01:31,907 --> 00:01:33,674
Stephanie.

41
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,376
Regina.
So cute.

42
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,710
Gregory.

43
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:37,778
Daniel.

44
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:40,047
Get over here,
you sculpting wizard.

45
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,649
Kelly, come on.

46
00:01:41,683 --> 00:01:42,650
Well...

47
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:44,885
Good seeing you, man.

48
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,453
Okay, you have your teams,

49
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:50,257
and you know the finale
is going to be really tough.

50
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:52,393
But I didn't tell you why.

51
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:55,963
It's because each team will be
creating four characters.

52
00:01:55,997 --> 00:01:57,765
Holy shit.

53
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,600
Wow.
Okay.

54
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:03,370
That is a massive amount of work
to do in a short period of time.

55
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:05,306
So it might be
a little difficult

56
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,307
to fall asleep tonight.

57
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:07,675
Okay.

58
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,643
That's all that I'm gonna
give you for now.

59
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:10,744
No.

60
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,179
That's not enough.

61
00:02:12,213 --> 00:02:14,548
I'll tell you everything else
tomorrow at the lab.

62
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,616
Have a good night.

63
00:02:30,832 --> 00:02:34,301
- Hi, Emily.
- Emily, my Em.

64
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:37,171
Oh, my God.

65
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:38,339
It's my mom.

66
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:39,773
I'm used to
talking to her every day.

67
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:41,609
It's the first time
I've ever been away from her

68
00:02:41,643 --> 00:02:42,610
and my family.

69
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:44,178
Are you eating well?

70
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:45,179
Yes.

71
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,847
Are you sleeping well?

72
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:48,983
Yes, I'm sleeping fine.

73
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:52,286
This whole competition
just has been about them

74
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
and me missing them,

75
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:54,822
and it's been hard.

76
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,390
It's weird,
'cause I can only see

77
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:57,391
this much of your face,

78
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:58,993
but that's okay.

79
00:02:59,027 --> 00:02:59,994
There it is.

80
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,030
It's my boyfriend, Alex.

81
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:05,332
And I am so excited to see him.

82
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:06,467
It means the world,

83
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,169
and it gives me that extra push
and motivation.

84
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,804
Oh, my gosh,
it's so great to see you.

85
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:11,805
I miss you.

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,307
I miss you so much,

87
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:15,242
and I can't wait to see you.

88
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:16,877
It's not home without you.

89
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:18,112
Are you leaking?

90
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,814
No.

91
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,616
My wife, Sarah,
is there on-screen,

92
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,018
and it's great to see her face.

93
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:25,452
I love this stuff.

94
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:26,687
I know it makes you happy.

95
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:28,322
I am so proud of you.

96
00:03:28,356 --> 00:03:30,691
For you to go this far
is amazing.

97
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,493
I can't wait to see
what you've done.

98
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:35,496
I've got the most incredibly
supportive wife in the world.

99
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,831
And I just want to show her
what I can do.

100
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:40,267
I miss you so much.

101
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,268
I'll see you real soon.

102
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:42,703
Just keep doing your thing,
though.

103
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:43,704
You got this.

104
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:44,838
Okay.

105
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:46,306
Bye, baby.

106
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:47,808
Bye.

107
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:49,343
All right, I love you guys.

108
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,011
We love you, we love you,
we love you.

109
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:52,312
All right, bye, guys.

110
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:55,315
To see them and see how happy
and supportive they are

111
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,251
and how proud they are of me
is just--

112
00:03:57,285 --> 00:04:00,087
it's the extra boost
that I need for this finale.

113
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:07,361
Ooh.

114
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:09,763
Oh, my God.

115
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:10,764
Cool.

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,032
So we walk into the lab,

117
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:14,301
and I notice they
put a red carpet down for me.

118
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,804
And I'm just--
I love it.

119
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:19,573
Ooh.

120
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:22,042
Ooh, fancy.

121
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:24,311
- Oh, God.
- Good morning, everybody.

122
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,446
Morning.

123
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,314
It's time to end the suspense.

124
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,286
Today's box office is dominated
by blockbuster franchises

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,987
that extend well
beyond the screen

126
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,356
into memorabilia,
amusement park rides,

127
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:37,558
and video games.

128
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:40,761
But what do the biggest of them
all have in common?

129
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:43,797
Films like
<i>Star Wars, The Avengers,</i>

130
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:45,733
and<i> Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

131
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,235
have an incredible team
of characters

132
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:51,472
who band together
to take on the bad guys,

133
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:55,209
and that is your
final Spotlight Challenge.

134
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,945
You're going to create a team
of four characters

135
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,014
that could star
in a new film franchise.

136
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,917
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh.

137
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:05,886
But before you
can create your characters,

138
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,388
your films are gonna
need a genre and a title.

139
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:09,823
So let's start with the genre.

140
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:11,024
- Emily.
- Oh, God.

141
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:12,726
Please choose one
of the three monitors.

142
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:15,229
- Two.
- All right.

143
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:16,563
What's behind number two?

144
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,000
Post-apocalyptic.

145
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,203
Logan.

146
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,305
Three.

147
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,406
Sci-fi.

148
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,941
- Okay.
- Yeah.

149
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:29,009
There you go.

150
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:30,010
And Darla.

151
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:31,545
I guess I'll take one.

152
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:34,381
Fantasy.

153
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:35,516
Yes.

154
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,550
That's awesome.

155
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,185
Okay, you've got your genres.

156
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:42,456
Now you'll each be coming up
with your own movie title.

157
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,324
You've got one minute to choose

158
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,360
up to ten words
from this board.

159
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:49,129
Now, you don't have to use
every word that you choose.

160
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:50,597
But when I call time,

161
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:53,801
you'll only have five minutes
to come to a consensus

162
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:56,370
with your teammates
on the new title.

163
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:58,672
Your minute starts now.

164
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:00,407
Paradise, reckoning.

165
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,508
- Destruction.
- Attack.

166
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:02,609
Warriors. Up, up.

167
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:03,944
My team's calling out words
at me.

168
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:05,112
- Fortress.
- Invaders.

169
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:06,413
Destroyers, attack.

170
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,015
You know, we can be
good guys too.

171
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,016
Oh, okay.

172
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:11,585
I grab what I think I need,

173
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:12,586
but it's frantic.

174
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,821
- Destiny and realm.
- Destiny.

175
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:14,822
Destiny.

176
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:15,823
I don't know where it is.

177
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:17,324
- Emily, grab empire.
- What?

178
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:18,959
- Empire.
- Ten seconds.

179
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:19,960
Empire.

180
00:06:19,994 --> 00:06:20,961
Oh!

181
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:21,962
Five, four, three

182
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,297
Galaxy, where's galaxy?

183
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,565
It's at the end.

184
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,133
- Time's up.
- Okay.

185
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,136
Oh, my God.

186
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,972
All right, gentlemen,
let's start with--

187
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:33,073
it doesn't need to be big.

188
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:34,608
Just take a word.

189
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,710
Nuclear paradise.
Nuclear reckoning.

190
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,712
When I ran up,
this is what I grabbed.

191
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,113
Ooh.

192
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:41,682
Cosmos warriors.

193
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:43,984
Journey to destruction.

194
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:46,820
Taking.
You said, "Taking Paradise."

195
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:48,088
Beyond the spirits of Eden,

196
00:06:48,122 --> 00:06:49,656
instead of gates.

197
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,191
There, that's it;
that's our winner.

198
00:06:51,226 --> 00:06:52,559
Okay, guys, your time is up.

199
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:54,061
I need your new film titles.

200
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,095
Darla.

201
00:06:57,832 --> 00:07:00,400
- Ooh.
- The Spirits of Eden.

202
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:01,835
Nice.

203
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,203
Emily.

204
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:05,105
Paradise Reckoning.

205
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,273
Okay.

206
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,942
And Logan.

207
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:09,943
The.

208
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:12,880
Fortress.

209
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:14,081
Very cool.

210
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:16,383
Well, these are
some truly unique titles,

211
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:19,586
and I can't wait to see
how your characters turn out.

212
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:21,054
And I know some other people

213
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:23,156
that are gonna be excited
to see them as well,

214
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:26,660
the ones who buy the tickets
to these huge blockbusters,

215
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:28,595
the public.

216
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:30,564
What?

217
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,633
We have invited people to a VIP,

218
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,734
after-hours experience

219
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:36,069
where your characters
will be on display

220
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:39,806
at Universal Studios
Hollywood theme park.

221
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:41,742
Oh, my God.

222
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,177
Yeah.

223
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,512
What?

224
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:46,780
They'll check out your work

225
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,382
and vote for their favorite.

226
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,417
And I'll share that result
with the judges

227
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,520
before they choose
this season's winner.

228
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:54,988
Oh, my God.

229
00:07:55,023 --> 00:07:57,124
All right, we'll
see you guys in a few days

230
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:58,158
at Universal Studios.

231
00:07:58,192 --> 00:07:59,192
Good luck.

232
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:03,697
Let's draw out
four silhouettes.

233
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,999
Do we want
to go animal or human?

234
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,134
Good question.

235
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:09,536
We need to start with
their origination.

236
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,606
What about they were all
science experiments in a lab,

237
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,141
and that's the same fortress.

238
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:15,409
- Yeah.
- Right.

239
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,010
Almost like the
island of Moreau.

240
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,445
I like that a lot.

241
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,580
The backstory is inspired
by<i> The Island of Dr. Moreau.</i>

242
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:22,849
They'll all be animals
that were tested on

243
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:24,284
and have evolved into

244
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,086
intelligent versions
of those animals.

245
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,522
I like the idea
of the lizard soldier.

246
00:08:28,556 --> 00:08:29,623
Okay.

247
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:32,459
The commander is going to be
an iguana

248
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:34,461
who's a big and imposing leader.

249
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:36,596
The second character
is going to be an armadillo.

250
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,231
They'll be the weapons expert.

251
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:41,268
Third, we have the mechanic
of the ship.

252
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,369
What's another animal?

253
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:46,873
One that doesn't care
for its own hygiene.

254
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:48,175
Okay.

255
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,610
I decide she's going to be
the mechanic skunk

256
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:53,113
that needs to quarantine herself
inside a cryo-tube

257
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:54,548
because she stinks.

258
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:57,851
And the last character will be
a hammerhead shark assassin.

259
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,753
And that's definitely
what we're gonna do here.

260
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:00,754
Okay.

261
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:02,456
So what are you thinking, girl?

262
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,690
All right.

263
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:05,592
I definitely want to
incorporate the elements.

264
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,428
The idea is that they
can control these elements.

265
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:12,065
The Spirits of Eden is a movie
about four elemental spirits

266
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,368
who band together
to fight off evil

267
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:17,004
after Adam and Eve
are cast out of the Garden.

268
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,939
So we have three girls
and one guy.

269
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,007
Yeah.

270
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,742
For air, like, the satyrs,

271
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:22,976
which are the ones with, like,

272
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:24,578
the ram horns and,
like, the bottom half's like

273
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:25,579
is, like, the hooves.

274
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:26,580
Right.

275
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,148
They play
that flute-type thing.

276
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:32,719
The air spirit is part faun
and part woodwind instrument.

277
00:09:32,754 --> 00:09:33,754
It would be interesting
to have...

278
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:35,322
Merman.

279
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:36,590
A merman.

280
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,425
'Cause they're gonna expect
a mermaid.

281
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,426
- Yeah.
- Okay.

282
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,627
For the water spirit,

283
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,129
I want to do a merman

284
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,865
and make him
very strong and rugged.

285
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:46,366
- For the fire one...
- Yes.

286
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:48,902
I'm wondering if it
would look cool to actually do,

287
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,837
like, sculpted flames.

288
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:54,474
The fire spirit
has a stone torso

289
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,843
with flames around her face.

290
00:09:56,878 --> 00:09:58,612
The costume would be the tree,

291
00:09:58,646 --> 00:09:59,746
and then the worm--

292
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,314
then you could actually
put her arm in the worm,

293
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:02,649
and you could actually
do her arm.

294
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:03,683
Oh, my God.

295
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:05,585
Our earth spirit
is going to be a worm

296
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,355
wrapped around
a trunk of a tree.

297
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:11,291
I'm really happy with the way
my team is working together,

298
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,827
and I'm really excited about the
direction that this is headed.

299
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,630
I can incorporate flowers
that she would push out,

300
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:19,132
and they would grow as the
judges came up and looked at it.

301
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,169
This is why I wanted him.

302
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:26,206
I want to have a metal
one, a glass one, a wood one,

303
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,507
and a leather.

304
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:28,742
Go, go, go.

305
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,646
Yeah, that one.

306
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,048
Paradise Reckoning
is a post-apocalyptic take

307
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,049
of The Wizard of Oz.

308
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,584
We're gonna need a lot of clay.

309
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,619
After a nuclear disaster,

310
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:42,322
four characters start mutating
from the radiation

311
00:10:42,356 --> 00:10:47,260
into the elements
that they were injured in.

312
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:49,663
I'm sculpting
the last character,

313
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,064
who was in a car accident.

314
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:54,234
He's got shards of glass
embedded into his chest.

315
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,570
Jamie is blocking out
the wood character,

316
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:58,438
who was in an explosion

317
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:01,241
where he flew into
a pile of pallets.

318
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:02,943
Adam's starting to
fabricate the armor

319
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,411
for the metal character,

320
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,780
who is a member
of the bomb squad.

321
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:10,150
And Regina and Kelly are working
on the leather character.

322
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:11,651
She is the assassin,

323
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:14,354
and she's using the leather
to patch and protect herself.

324
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,022
The sculpts that we're
getting done today

325
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:19,426
cannot be in the mold room
later than two hours.

326
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,560
Yep.

327
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:24,531
- Hey.
- Hey, Laura.

328
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,099
Ooh, already,
you're off and running.

329
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:27,100
Yep.

330
00:11:27,135 --> 00:11:29,202
- There he is.
- Hey, guys.

331
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:30,337
Rayce shows up,

332
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:32,372
and I start filling him in
on my concept.

333
00:11:32,406 --> 00:11:33,540
Yeah, I like it.

334
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:36,343
And I start sculpting
the hammerhead face.

335
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,545
I put Ben on the skunk face.

336
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,780
I put Gregory
on the armadillo face,

337
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,782
Julian on the lizard face,

338
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:45,085
and Alan on the lizard cowl.

339
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,687
Today's all about making sure
everybody is on the same page

340
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,489
with what the characters
are supposed to look like.

341
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:50,891
I want to see the character

342
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,327
that they would sculpt
anatomically first

343
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:56,329
and replace the flesh
with metal.

344
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:57,797
Cool.

345
00:11:57,832 --> 00:11:59,032
- Hi.
- Hello.

346
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,033
What's up?

347
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,201
So I have fantasy.

348
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:04,004
I heard, my favorite genre.

349
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:05,172
It's gonna be a worm.

350
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,406
But keeping the face beautiful

351
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,974
is what's gonna
make it attractive.

352
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:10,343
Attractive female face
on top of a worm body?

353
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:12,312
So we explain
our concept to Laura,

354
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:15,715
and her initial reaction
is not good.

355
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,384
- This is an attractive look?
- Yeah, yeah.

356
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:19,686
It'll be definitely--
I mean, not that.

357
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,321
But, I mean, it will be.

358
00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:24,958
As expected, Darla
is doing something beautiful.

359
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:26,526
But that worm,

360
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,695
I'm not sure that's
a very attractive character.

361
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:29,996
It's getting frustrating

362
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,699
because I thought the concept
was already nailed down.

363
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:34,000
You're always talking
about doing something

364
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:35,001
they've never seen before.

365
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,403
That's true.

366
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:38,171
That's definitely something
they've never seen before.

367
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:39,873
You know, like, I'm trying
to think outside the box.

368
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:41,641
This is not the challenge
to be wasting time,

369
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,443
and I'm getting scared.

370
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,804
There's so much work
going on with that worm.

371
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,672
It's the first day
of the finale challenge,

372
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,543
and Laura's concerned about some
of my decisions, conceptually.

373
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,212
She doesn't like the tree
with the worm idea

374
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,380
for the earth spirit.

375
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,282
You can put vines.

376
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,351
You can put, like,
wood textures.

377
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,787
You can put
all these wonderful things.

378
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,523
I was originally thinking
about doing sort of,

379
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,525
like, an earth goddess

380
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,960
and having vines
wrapping down her legs.

381
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,429
That would totally fit.

382
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,465
Thankfully, our concept
finally comes together.

383
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,768
It's a beautiful woman
wearing a tree trunk dress.

384
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,670
And the mushrooms
growing out of her

385
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,539
create a really nice silhouette.

386
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:28,973
- Is that mushrooms?
- Yeah.

387
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,109
It's those mushrooms
that grow sideways out of trees.

388
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,110
- Yeah.
- Cool.

389
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,711
- Yeah.
- I like this.

390
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,822
Wow.
Hello, everybody.

391
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,024
- Hey, Mr. Westmore.
- Hey.

392
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,926
- I have sci-fi.
- Mm-hmm.

393
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,929
And Alan and Julian are both
working on the ship's commander.

394
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,397
I would almost like to see,

395
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,033
in this little ridge that
you have going like that,

396
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,202
go on and bring it on down

397
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,471
'cause it just adds
another dimension to it.

398
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,739
It takes it away
from a human form.

399
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,675
This is going to be
an armadillo.

400
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,643
You know, an armadillo
has all the battle armor.

401
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,278
Don't cut yourself short here.

402
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,048
If your armor isn't going
to come this far forward,

403
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,749
you'd better take it
a little further back,

404
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,784
just to protect yourself.

405
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,018
Okay.

406
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,787
- This is your skunk here?
- This is the skunk.

407
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,956
Take your forehead up
and make this all one piece.

408
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,358
Otherwise, you'd have
to put on eyebrow blenders

409
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,426
to get rid of the eyebrows.

410
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,627
Absolutely.

411
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,229
Our genre's
post-apocalyptic.

412
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,697
Because there's radiation,

413
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,366
their accidents started
to fuse into them,

414
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,934
and then they started
to build armor.

415
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,037
This one had the wood started
to be infused into his chest.

416
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,273
What's important with
this is gonna be the paint job.

417
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,975
Keep the wood lighter
so it looks like

418
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,243
it's really a whole pileup

419
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,378
of the wood you have going on.

420
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:42,046
This is the metal character.

421
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,982
The suit saved his life,
so he doesn't take it off.

422
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,416
But he repairs it.

423
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,151
You could have a
burn on him or something

424
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,021
to be able to show
that a bomb went off.

425
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,089
Yeah.

426
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,824
So each of my characters
represents one

427
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,058
of the four elements.

428
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,426
Mm-hmm.

429
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,128
The first character
is the water element.

430
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,897
Being water,
it's flowing, and it's soft.

431
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,598
So you want to keep
the face soft

432
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,699
and not get so angular.

433
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,700
Okay.

434
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,735
This is the earth character,

435
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,036
which hasn't been started yet

436
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,437
'cause it took a while
to kind of hone in on.

437
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,639
Wow.
Very, very interesting.

438
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,973
But essentially,
it's going to be

439
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,575
a fabricated tree structure

440
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,944
coming up into
that mushroom growth.

441
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,680
You want to make sure you kind
of get these into the face,

442
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,149
as opposed
to just doing a pretty face

443
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,051
and having the rest--
it becomes a costume then.

444
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,185
Absolutely.

445
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,522
The last character
is our fire character.

446
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:28,593
The idea was sculpting blue
and white flames flowing up,

447
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,295
like, her neck
and into her face.

448
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,362
You're talking
about blue and white.

449
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,664
You're talking about
a gas fire.

450
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,198
I would get a little bit
of red in there.

451
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,367
This could be all red
that's behind her.

452
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,468
Okay.

453
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,070
Good luck to all three teams.

454
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,171
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

455
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,205
Thanks.

456
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,315
Keep leading these troops.

457
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,215
I like where you guys
are going.

458
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,216
Have fun.

459
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,484
See you, guys.

460
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,220
- See you.
- Bye, guys.

461
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,889
- Jamie.
- What's up?

462
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,191
Can you take this to mold?

463
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,827
I finish all the pieces
for the glass character.

464
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,130
But we're running out of time,
so I grab everyone,

465
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,565
and we're all working together

466
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,467
to mold everything
at the same time.

467
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,936
And we're ahead of schedule,
so I feel good.

468
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,776
That's time, everybody.

469
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,955
I should just
slow everyone down.

470
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,023
It's day two.

471
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,891
We have ten hours
in the lab today.

472
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,093
Do you want me
to finish this up

473
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,227
or jump on the cowl?

474
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,695
We got to pick up the pace
a little bit.

475
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,665
My plan today is to make
each of these sculpts cohesive.

476
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,134
So I'm gonna be incorporating
a metallic design

477
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,168
for the characters,

478
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,603
because each
of these characters,

479
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,739
at some point had
repeated tests done

480
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,240
on certain areas of their body.

481
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,875
So we have a lot to do.

482
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,910
I'm gonna start
on the hammerhead.

483
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:53,945
All right.

484
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,219
My team's finishing
their sculptures

485
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,687
while I start working on
the face

486
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,522
for the glass character.

487
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,624
The center of his face
is exposed

488
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:07,992
with the glass around it,

489
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,927
so I'm going to make
rubber glass,

490
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,631
which is a silicone material
that looks like glass.

491
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,168
Mix ratio is 3a 1b.

492
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,538
But I am awful at math.

493
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,073
I'm gonna go with 20 grams.

494
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,641
And if you mess up the ratios,

495
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,543
then you won't get
the end results.

496
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,345
No, what?
Two, four, six.

497
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,579
In school, it's like,

498
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,148
"Oh, you'll use this
in the real world."

499
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,183
No, we won't.

500
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,086
I'm so bad at all of this.

501
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,087
It's a mess.

502
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,689
Six, seven, eight, nine.

503
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,791
So 960 in total.

504
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,426
I need a calculator.

505
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,594
I hope I got the ratios right.

506
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,768
Stephanie is working on the
chest piece for the air spirit,

507
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,870
and it looks fantastic.

508
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,274
Rob has to fabricate
the entire tree trunk dress

509
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,575
for the earth spirit.

510
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,144
And Daniel is going to mold
the fire spirit torso

511
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,480
while Anthony
jumps on to the cowl

512
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,715
for the earth spirit.

513
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,917
I start sculpting the face
for the fire spirit,

514
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,353
and I'm a little worried
about the sculpted flames

515
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,955
not reading correctly.

516
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,692
But I'm confident that I can
really represent the fire

517
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,795
without trying
to go super literal.

518
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,263
Kind of, like,
building up the flames

519
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,665
so they're
a little more stylized.

520
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,699
Yeah.

521
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,203
Oh.

522
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,145
That's time, everybody.

523
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,021
It's day three of the finale,

524
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,857
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab today.

525
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,692
All right, plan of attack.

526
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,128
My team is hard at work
fabricating

527
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,763
and refining the sculpts.

528
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,065
And then I have to finish
a sculpt

529
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,100
on the fire spirit face,

530
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,937
which because of the flames
is gonna be really complicated.

531
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,913
So this is just a mess.

532
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,816
I'm working on the face
for the glass character.

533
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,718
But the glass is not sticking,

534
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,453
and it's eating up
a lot of time.

535
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,888
I'm feeling very, very nervous.

536
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,956
I have too much to do.

537
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,125
This is the most important part
of my character.

538
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,527
It has to be right.

539
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,328
What are you planning
on doing today yourself?

540
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,830
- Just the glass.
- Okay.

541
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,599
I'm getting really frustrated,
because we have a lot to do.

542
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,201
But I'm going to take my time

543
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,603
and make sure
this is done right.

544
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,373
Time is ticking down.

545
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,908
I'm feeling pretty good
at this point.

546
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,943
Everybody's trying
their hardest.

547
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,512
But there's a lot of fabrication
that still needs to be done.

548
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,149
I'm well into my day of painting
these cowls and face pieces,

549
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,819
and I decide to check
on Gregory's progress.

550
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,922
These are gonna have a buckle
here and a buckle here.

551
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,256
I like your innovation,

552
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,624
but I'm absolutely serious

553
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,127
when I say this type
of stuff does not matter.

554
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,496
I realize that he's not
prioritizing very well.

555
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,833
If we don't get this shit--
this thing solid

556
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,267
from an appearance standpoint,

557
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,737
the superficial shit, wearable,

558
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,738
I'm boned.

559
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,006
Now I'm really freaking out

560
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,942
because I thought
everything was under control.

561
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,010
But we're actually way behind.

562
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,178
This could be really bad.

563
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:21,792
I like your innovation,

564
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,160
but I'm absolutely serious

565
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:25,329
when I say this type
of stuff does not matter.

566
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:27,164
It's day three
of our finale challenge,

567
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,633
and the armadillo shell
is behind schedule.

568
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:33,137
It's cool, but we can
gaff tape this together.

569
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:35,406
And you would've saved yourself
whatever time it took you

570
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,907
to cut this and shape it
and put it on.

571
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:39,243
I explained very briefly
to Gregory what I need.

572
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:42,413
And I think he understands
what's on the line here,

573
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:43,714
especially for me.

574
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:47,785
My motto for<i> Face Off</i> has been
no time for hot glue,

575
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,386
only enough time for tape.

576
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,421
This is the finale,

577
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,790
and the pace
needs to be kept up.

578
00:20:52,824 --> 00:20:54,825
You can pull it just as tight
around her as you want.

579
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,994
But it's gonna be comfortable
because there's padding

580
00:20:57,028 --> 00:20:58,028
all the way around.

581
00:20:58,063 --> 00:20:59,396
Okay.

582
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:06,670
- Good luck.
- Bye, Laura.

583
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:08,139
- Have fun.
- Okay, thank you.

584
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:09,373
- See you, Logan.
- See you, bro.

585
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:10,806
You're kicking ass.
Just keep doing it.

586
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:11,489
Thanks, man.

587
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:16,680
The olive?

588
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:17,915
Huh.

589
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:19,283
It's getting
towards the end of the day,

590
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:21,819
and the shirt for the earth
spirit is coming together.

591
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:23,587
And the skirt
is more or less done.

592
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:25,923
Both of the staffs are finished.

593
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:27,558
And the face
for the fire spirit

594
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,493
has been molded
and cleaned out.

595
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,195
- Can you go grab some stencils?
- Yes.

596
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:32,229
Thank you.

597
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:41,238
Time, everyone.

598
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:44,575
Everything's coming
together really well.

599
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,377
I feel like I'm really
set up for application.

600
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:49,146
Luckily, I've got four
amazing artists to help me out.

601
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:57,722
Oh, my God. Here we go.

602
00:21:57,756 --> 00:21:58,789
Nice outfit.

603
00:22:01,727 --> 00:22:02,994
It's application day.

604
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:05,429
We have four hours in the lab,
one hour of Last Looks.

605
00:22:05,464 --> 00:22:06,797
Team Logan.

606
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:08,933
This is also our
last day of<i> Face Off.</i>

607
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:10,067
It's gonna be crazy.

608
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:11,402
How are you feeling?

609
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:14,905
My role today is to teach him
how to manage his team

610
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,041
and just make sure
that he's not forgetting

611
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:18,976
any important steps.

612
00:22:19,011 --> 00:22:22,279
So you know who's gonna
be applying what?

613
00:22:22,314 --> 00:22:23,714
- You got that all planned out?
- No.

614
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:27,351
Hello.

615
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:28,619
So you are the wood guy.

616
00:22:28,653 --> 00:22:30,021
We have a lot to do today.

617
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:33,357
But we have a strong team,
and we're ready to work.

618
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:34,592
I can't believe it's all over.

619
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,893
Like, this is it.

620
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:37,895
Right away, I start working
on the wood character,

621
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:41,465
applying the cowl and face.

622
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,335
Because the leather character
has a lot going on,

623
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,504
Regina and Kelly are gonna share
the responsibility

624
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:47,938
of applying these pieces.

625
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:49,707
Adam's working
on the metal character

626
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:52,576
while Jamie's applying the chest
for the glass character.

627
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:54,678
I don't know how
this is gonna work out.

628
00:22:57,449 --> 00:22:58,416
I'm born.

629
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,454
My team's working
on the earth, water,

630
00:23:03,488 --> 00:23:04,855
and wind spirits

631
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,259
while I start to apply
the fire spirit character

632
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:10,928
and paint
all the stone texture.

633
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:14,165
But I still need to make sure
that every single character

634
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:17,802
ends up as a fully-finished,
beautiful makeup.

635
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:19,103
Darla.

636
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:20,838
- Yeah, that's looking great.
- Okay.

637
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:24,208
Darla and Emily
both want this really bad.

638
00:23:24,242 --> 00:23:27,611
And they seem like they've
set themselves up for success.

639
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:32,716
Look out,
armadillo coming through.

640
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,718
Ben is on the skunk.

641
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:37,721
Julian moves on
to the iguana commander.

642
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:40,291
Alan finishes the fabrication
on the shell.

643
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:42,893
Gregory is working
on the hammerhead

644
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:45,396
while I'm focusing
on the armadillo face

645
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,264
plus bouncing around
between each character,

646
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:49,967
making sure
they're all on the same page.

647
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,502
Don't cut it off.

648
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:53,404
I'm starting to see
these things come together.

649
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:57,141
And I really feel like Logan
has got something special.

650
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:58,676
I feel like he could do this.

651
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,910
He could be the new champion.

652
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,153
I'm really out
of my comfort zone,

653
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:10,154
painting like this.

654
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:12,790
I look over at Adam's character,

655
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:14,358
and it's too pink.

656
00:24:14,392 --> 00:24:16,093
- What do you want to do?
- I want to change it.

657
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,128
- Entirely?
- Yeah.

658
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:19,063
I want it to be more rust color,

659
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:21,298
more reds, yellows, oranges.

660
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,201
So I go in,
and I start just micromanaging.

661
00:24:24,236 --> 00:24:25,936
I want them to be
in the flesh tone range.

662
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,938
But it's not supposed
to look like super skin tone.

663
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:29,039
Okay.

664
00:24:29,074 --> 00:24:30,508
Adam's not happy about that,

665
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,776
but I don't have time
to think about his feelings.

666
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:34,245
This is the finale.

667
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,580
Everything needs to be perfect.

668
00:24:36,615 --> 00:24:37,915
I'm losing my mind.

669
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:38,916
Oh, welcome.

670
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:39,984
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

671
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:47,057
Daniel!
Get me some more moss.

672
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:51,262
Hey, guys.

673
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:53,130
No.

674
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:54,832
You have one hour left.

675
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:56,800
This is Last Looks.

676
00:24:56,835 --> 00:24:58,369
- Oh, my God.
- Good luck, everybody.

677
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:03,841
To finish the fire character,

678
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:06,043
I go through and add
a little bit

679
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:08,913
of the Kryolan black eye shadow
along her hairline,

680
00:25:08,947 --> 00:25:13,150
just to give it depth
and really make it pop.

681
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:15,319
Jamie, I got to figure
something out for this,

682
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:16,520
'cause this is not working out.

683
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:17,688
I'm really nervous right now,

684
00:25:17,722 --> 00:25:19,056
because there's a lot
still to do.

685
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,391
We have a lot more to paint.

686
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:22,259
Put some fabric over it.

687
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:24,295
What kind of fabric?

688
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,530
Should I give him, like,
a vest or, like, a harness?

689
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:30,534
I just got to work
as fast as I can.

690
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,102
Are we gonna put the tail on?

691
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:34,338
The skunk tail
becomes a priority.

692
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:36,140
- It's just gonna hang loose.
- That's fine.

693
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:38,275
That's better than too heavy.

694
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,510
It's got me concerned.

695
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:42,346
I know it can't go on
at the weight it is.

696
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,048
We'll tuck the skunk tail
into her belt,

697
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:45,382
let it hang limp.

698
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:48,619
That will achieve
the silhouette.

699
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:50,821
15 minutes, everyone.

700
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:51,855
Oh, my gosh.

701
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,057
Pull.

702
00:25:57,495 --> 00:25:58,562
Oh, my God, Jamie.

703
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:04,501
That's time, everybody.

704
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:08,205
Hugs all around.

705
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,974
When Last Looks
is up, I'm nervous.

706
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:11,809
I didn't get a chance
to get everything painted

707
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:12,810
the way I wanted,

708
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:14,979
but I'm hoping for the best.

709
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:29,076
You are gonna be up here.

710
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,978
Step back a little bit.

711
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:32,079
Move forward.

712
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:43,657
Hey, everyone.

713
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:45,726
How you doing tonight?

714
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,995
Yeah.

715
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,431
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i> finale.

716
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:56,837
Okay, let's do this.

717
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:03,744
Whoo-hoo.

718
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:04,912
There's a lot of people.

719
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:09,450
This is cool.

720
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:14,121
So cool.

721
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:16,957
- Great.
- Wow.

722
00:27:19,058 --> 00:27:21,672
_

723
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:26,533
Oh, I didn't know they're here.

724
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:27,534
The judges are here.

725
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:29,837
- Wow.
- This is really cool.

726
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:31,238
That's really great.

727
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:35,175
It's silicone glued on
to a single piece of clear.

728
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,543
Those are Dorothy's shoes.

729
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:40,347
This is interesting

730
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:42,182
'cause they sculpted
what looks to be leather.

731
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:44,218
Like, it's almost
like somebody else's skin.

732
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,919
- Right.
- Cool.

733
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,720
_

734
00:27:47,722 --> 00:27:50,257
Well, that's actually
The Cowardly Lion.

735
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:52,292
It's definitely
a success in terms

736
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:54,428
of integrating
their fabricated pieces

737
00:27:54,462 --> 00:27:55,796
with the wardrobe.

738
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,098
It seems to have
an element of Mad Max.

739
00:27:58,132 --> 00:28:00,501
Yeah?

740
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:02,236
I don't understand
what we're looking at,

741
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,570
but it looks pretty cool.

742
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:03,263
The set looks amazing.

743
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:05,332
And then all the characters
look incredible.

744
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:07,067
And this is our work out there.

745
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:09,269
And now people
are reacting to it,

746
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:11,204
and it's really cool.

747
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:12,773
I can't believe
this is happening.

748
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:20,380
They look beautiful.

749
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:21,949
I love the
scrolling on the face.

750
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:23,617
It's great.

751
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:24,785
Oh.

752
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:27,654
- This chest piece is amazing.
- It really is.

753
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:29,556
And I love the
asymmetry of this.

754
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:32,426
Everything is
detailed and intricate.

755
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,227
Really pretty
little beauty makeup on,

756
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:35,829
which is real subtle.

757
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:37,064
It conveys the idea.

758
00:29:37,098 --> 00:29:38,599
I mean, it's so hard
to indicate flame.

759
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,767
- I mean, after all.
- It's pretty.

760
00:29:40,802 --> 00:29:45,172
I like how her lip color
even matches the green in her.

761
00:29:45,206 --> 00:29:46,173
Oh.

762
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:47,507
A lot of thought

763
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,276
must've gone into making
that flower thing happen.

764
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,677
But the thing is,

765
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:52,579
it's not as if they invested
all that time in this

766
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:53,880
and shortchanged the makeup.

767
00:29:53,915 --> 00:29:55,048
Do you like how they came out?

768
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,583
Yeah.
I'm so happy.

769
00:30:56,711 --> 00:30:58,211
I'm just so happy right now.

770
00:30:58,246 --> 00:30:59,946
These characters
have come to life.

771
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:04,084
And to see them in the scene
exactly how I imagined them,

772
00:31:04,118 --> 00:31:05,452
it's so incredible.

773
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,758
I love this.

774
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,360
It reminds me of one
of my things from Star Trek.

775
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:14,461
Oh, my gosh.

776
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:16,887
_

777
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Oh, God.

778
00:31:20,234 --> 00:31:21,968
I like that a lot,
especially the nose

779
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:22,969
and the face.

780
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:23,970
Cute.

781
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:25,138
- It is cute.
- Yeah.

782
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:26,907
All these tones
are so beautiful,

783
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:29,042
these browns
and taupe-y greens.

784
00:31:29,077 --> 00:31:30,110
It's really pretty.

785
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:31,478
Why does she have a tool belt?

786
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:32,946
Because she's actually
the mechanic too.

787
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,183
Oh.

788
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:38,852
They definitely have
a team theme going here.

789
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:42,255
I like the tuft of fur coming
out the bottom of the tail.

790
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,523
That's great.

791
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:44,991
And this is Commander Talon.

792
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:46,493
He's the leader of the group.

793
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:47,961
Wow, this is quite beautiful.

794
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:51,565
It has really nice details
happening on the side.

795
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:52,259
These characters
are incredible.

796
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:54,060
And I'm having a blast.

797
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:55,595
I see smiles from the audience.

798
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,197
And that's a win on its own.

799
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:06,173
I think this was definitely
my favorite

800
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:08,809
'cause I feel like
it's so much more intricate.

801
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,977
I like The Fortress. I
thought it was beautiful.

802
00:33:11,012 --> 00:33:12,679
It's got a great story to it.

803
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:14,014
Just really well done.

804
00:33:14,048 --> 00:33:16,049
My favorite movie
is Paradise Reckoning.

805
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,451
I kind of, like, related
to those characters a lot.

806
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:20,620
It's time for
the audience to leave,

807
00:33:20,655 --> 00:33:22,656
and I'm so scared.

808
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,424
$100,000, a car,

809
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:27,027
and everything else
is depending on this moment.

810
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:29,663
It's nerve-racking 'cause
now this is the moment of truth.

811
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,272
Tell us who made your favorite
new film franchise team tonight

812
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:41,341
on Twitter using #FaceOff

813
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:46,293
All right, judges,
so what do you think

814
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:48,061
of the new franchise film stars
you saw tonight?

815
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:49,996
I have personally
department headed

816
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:52,632
five mega-movie franchises.

817
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:53,767
And I got to tell you,

818
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:56,803
I think you guys
did an amazing job tonight.

819
00:33:56,838 --> 00:34:00,006
Really, really exceptional,
kids.

820
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:03,677
Nice work, everybody.

821
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:07,013
Okay, now, there is a lot on
the line tonight for you guys.

822
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:09,116
The winner will receive
a VIP trip

823
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,951
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

824
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:13,820
to one of their 85
international locations,

825
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:17,057
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

826
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:20,060
and $100,000.

827
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:21,228
All right, guys,

828
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:22,996
the judges would like to hear
from each of you

829
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,299
before choosing
this season's winner.

830
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:27,500
Logan, you're up first.

831
00:34:27,535 --> 00:34:28,535
Please step forward.

832
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,576
What's up?

833
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,447
Logan, tell us about your
sci-fi feature, The Fortress.

834
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:43,216
They were all,
at one point, lab experiments,

835
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,352
and they took over
the SS Moreau.

836
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:47,020
Now they travel
throughout the solar system,

837
00:34:47,054 --> 00:34:50,323
trying to stop other labs
from doing the same thing.

838
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:51,992
I think you guys
did a great job.

839
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:56,129
It's an extraordinarily
cohesive group.

840
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:59,799
You did it with the biomechanic,
cybernetic enhancements.

841
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,368
And I like the fact
that you went through

842
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:04,004
and personalized
each with that element.

843
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:06,339
I also love Mako's face.

844
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:10,043
The way that you worked those
subtle shapes over the eyes,

845
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:11,611
it just all works together.

846
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:12,746
Thank you very much.

847
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,913
I love your skunk character

848
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:16,149
because there's
some really subtle,

849
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:17,917
beautiful paint
on this character.

850
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:20,620
This could be a really fun movie
to watch.

851
00:35:20,654 --> 00:35:21,888
Maybe one day it will be.

852
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:23,523
You never know.

853
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:25,959
There's a few things
I want to compliment you on.

854
00:35:25,993 --> 00:35:29,262
One of them is creating
characters that actors

855
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:32,632
are gonna be inspired
to partake in.

856
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:35,435
And you've very much succeeded
in that area.

857
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,703
Thank you.

858
00:35:36,737 --> 00:35:38,304
Thank you very much, Logan.

859
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,706
All right, Emily, you're next.

860
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,816
Would you please tell
us about your characters

861
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,284
in Paradise Reckoning?

862
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:54,654
After a nuclear
conflict, the world was ending.

863
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:58,191
And it was split up into mutants
because of all the radiation.

864
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:02,862
So in this sterile world,
they find a pure human baby.

865
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:05,065
And the baby
brings them all together.

866
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,967
And it's a spin
on The Wizard of Oz.

867
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:09,669
Every single one
of these characters

868
00:36:09,703 --> 00:36:13,973
has an amazing paint job
on them.

869
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,842
I especially love
her bodice thing.

870
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:18,778
I actually thought it looked
like patchwork skin to me.

871
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:20,013
Very impressive.

872
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:21,848
- Good work, sweetie.
- Thank you.

873
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:25,685
This is so ambitious
and adventurous.

874
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,388
And as a movie franchise,
this group,

875
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:32,192
they feel very much
like they are associated,

876
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:34,527
from a creative standpoint.

877
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:36,863
I think that you
were very successful

878
00:36:36,897 --> 00:36:41,034
in creating a lot
of very intelligent pieces.

879
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:45,338
I also love Shard's
broken windshield on his chest.

880
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,141
It really looks exactly
like a broken windshield.

881
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,476
Thank you.

882
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,877
Thank you, Emily.

883
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:51,911
Darla, you're up.

884
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:05,358
- Hi, Darla.
- Hi.

885
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,361
Tell us about
The Spirits of Eden.

886
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,529
After Adam and Eve

887
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,464
were banished
from the Garden of Eden,

888
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:14,567
evil started to take over.

889
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:17,604
And so the four
raw elements--

890
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:19,372
earth, wind, fire,
and water--

891
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:22,675
had to band together
to fight off the evil.

892
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,513
I think that you absolutely
nailed the genre of fantasy.

893
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,414
Thank you.

894
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,183
One of the things
that we all noticed

895
00:37:30,217 --> 00:37:34,621
was the high-resolution
finesse of detail

896
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,189
on the earth element.

897
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:39,092
This is a beautiful,
beautiful lineup.

898
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,160
Thank you.

899
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:42,562
With your wind character,

900
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,097
the body piece is amazing.

901
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:47,000
It is probably my favorite piece
of wardrobe sculpture

902
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:48,234
I've seen on the show.

903
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:52,272
And the horns are a shape
that I have never seen.

904
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:56,009
The idea is that she
herself is a wind instrument.

905
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:58,278
- That makes it even better.
- Ooh, I got the chills.

906
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:02,582
I think you did an excellent
job with your characters.

907
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:04,651
You've created prosthetics
that blend right

908
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:06,853
into the middle of their faces.

909
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:08,388
You did such a great job.

910
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:09,956
Thank you all so much.

911
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,591
- Thank you, Darla.
- Thank you.

912
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,293
It's time for you all to head
backstage

913
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:14,827
while the judges decide

914
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:18,064
who will become
this season's champion.

915
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:21,935
All right, before we begin,
I should let you know

916
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,338
which team the public chose
as their favorite.

917
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,907
And that would be
Darla's characters

918
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,442
from The Spirits of Eden.

919
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,277
- Hmm.
- Awesome.

920
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,845
So you can take
that into consideration

921
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,781
when making
your final decision tonight.

922
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:35,815
Let's get into this.

923
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:37,250
Why don't we start with Logan?

924
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:41,888
They were playful
and cohesive as a team.

925
00:38:41,922 --> 00:38:43,056
I absolutely agree.

926
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,491
I mean, each one of them
had a unique character

927
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,493
that was immediately visible.

928
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:49,729
I love the hammerhead
shark character.

929
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,164
I think that was fantastic,

930
00:38:51,198 --> 00:38:53,566
particularly in terms
of hiding the eyes.

931
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:56,502
The iguana character
had amazing primary

932
00:38:56,537 --> 00:38:58,104
and sub form in the sculpture.

933
00:38:58,138 --> 00:38:59,973
I did love that paint job
on that skunk.

934
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,041
I thought it was really
beautifully done.

935
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,776
Okay, let's move on to Emily.

936
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,878
Just beautiful
control with paint.

937
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:08,281
She just picks out some
of the most beautiful palettes

938
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:09,282
to paint with.

939
00:39:09,316 --> 00:39:11,217
That wooden guy,
that was gorgeous.

940
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:14,954
I liked how realistic it was.

941
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,990
I think Emily
is loaded with raw talent.

942
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,425
Shard had that beautiful
chest piece,

943
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,662
which is all silicone
on a clear piece of plastic.

944
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:25,732
It immediately read
as a broken windshield.

945
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,400
All right,
that leaves us with Darla.

946
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:30,169
Well, she came out with four
beautifully-rendered makeups,

947
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,905
absolutely exquisite
on those women.

948
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,108
Blend right in the middle
of their faces.

949
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:37,076
Really beautifully done.

950
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:41,281
And the one that really
is a standout character

951
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:43,383
is the elemental wind.

952
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:48,321
The genius of doing the holes
in the horns

953
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:50,823
and the perforations
in the chest piece

954
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:54,327
as an indication of
some other acoustic element,

955
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,928
that's some high-level thinking.

956
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:57,697
Absolutely awe-inspiring.

957
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,066
All right,
judges, big decision.

958
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,268
Are you ready to crown
a new champion

959
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:04,637
and our first
two-time champion?

960
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:06,072
I think we are.

961
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,106
Let's do this.

962
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:12,045
All right, guys, one of you

963
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,947
is about to become
our new champion.

964
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:18,951
And one of our champion coaches

965
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:22,755
is about to become
our first two-time champion.

966
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,991
So good luck to all of you.

967
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:28,161
All right, Glenn,
tell us about tonight's makeups.

968
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:30,463
Logan, the fun factor
of your characters

969
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:34,267
really drove home the
team aspect of this challenge.

970
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:38,037
And the paint work on several
of them was exceptional.

971
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:41,741
Emily, you put on a really wild
display of creativity tonight,

972
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,409
and they all clearly
went together.

973
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:45,378
But each was also
distinctly different,

974
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:47,547
which is an impressive feat.

975
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:50,183
Darla, you gave us an array
of fantasy characters

976
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:52,185
that read superbly from afar.

977
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:55,988
But each of them also had
unique and gorgeous detail

978
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:57,323
when we got up close.

979
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:01,194
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner of<i> Face Off?</i>

980
00:41:01,228 --> 00:41:02,595
The winner of<i> Face Off</i> is...

981
00:41:14,052 --> 00:41:17,788
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner of<i> Face Off?</i>

982
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:19,490
The winner of<i> Face Off</i> is...

983
00:41:26,398 --> 00:41:27,365
Darla.

984
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:36,173
Congratulations, you
are the new<i> Face Off</i> champion.

985
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:42,580
This is--
this is crazy.

986
00:41:42,614 --> 00:41:44,148
That's like--
it's crazy.

987
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:46,283
I'm so excited,
and I'm so proud.

988
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:47,585
I'm so happy.

989
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:48,819
I can't really keep it together.

990
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:52,156
I'm very happy for Darla.

991
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,324
Of course, I'm bummed.

992
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:55,426
But I think it motivates me
to do better.

993
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,596
I've definitely
found my passion.

994
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,231
I'm proud of everything
that I've accomplished.

995
00:42:00,265 --> 00:42:02,833
This competition's definitely
given me the confidence

996
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:04,402
to just make stuff.

997
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,671
And, of course, that means
that huge congratulations

998
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:08,439
are in order to Laura as well.

999
00:42:08,473 --> 00:42:11,509
You are the first-ever repeat
champion of<i> Face Off.</i>

1000
00:42:11,543 --> 00:42:13,477
How about that?

1001
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:14,845
I'm very excited,

1002
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,548
because winning<i> Face Off</i>
is a life-changing experience,

1003
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:19,250
and I'm overwhelmed with pride

1004
00:42:19,284 --> 00:42:20,651
that I accomplished it twice.

1005
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:22,420
It's an exhilarating feeling,
and I'm glad.

1006
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:23,621
I'm so honored.

1007
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:25,156
Come on up here and celebrate.

1008
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,157
Come on, judges too.

1009
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:27,425
Come on.

1010
00:42:27,459 --> 00:42:30,127
Congratulations.
You're so good at this.

1011
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:31,462
Thank you.

1012
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:33,497
It was a great
experience for everybody.

1013
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:34,965
But it doesn't seem right,

1014
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,001
just one person winning this,

1015
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:39,370
when we all are so influential.

1016
00:42:39,404 --> 00:42:41,672
- You're still gonna cry?
- Yes.

1017
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:43,007
I'm so grateful to Laura.

1018
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,109
I've grown so much as an artist.

1019
00:42:45,143 --> 00:42:48,112
This has been a really crazy,
crazy ride,

1020
00:42:48,146 --> 00:42:50,181
and I can't wait to see
what's next.

1021
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:52,216
Thank you all at home
for watching us tonight.

1022
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,617
Join us again in July

1023
00:42:53,652 --> 00:42:55,820
for another exciting new season.

1024
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:56,854
Have a good night.
