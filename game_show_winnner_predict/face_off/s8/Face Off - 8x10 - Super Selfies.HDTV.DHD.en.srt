1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:02,416
She really is amazing.

2
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:03,417
That is not

3
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,286
this challenge.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,088
I'm really impressed.

5
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:08,789
Previously on<i> Face Off,</i>

6
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:12,226
Darla's alien beauty queen
earned her her first win.

7
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,794
But Kelly was eliminated,

8
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:16,697
leaving Team Anthony
with just one artist.

9
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,702
Now seven artists remain,

10
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:23,938
and tonight their skills
will be tested

11
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:25,473
unlike ever before.

12
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,674
This challenge might be

13
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,677
the most daunting
in<i> Face Off</i> history.

14
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:31,612
This is the hardest
thing I will ever do.

15
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:33,047
Oh, no.

16
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,216
Just kind of
get, like, a little frazzled

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,217
and a little frustrated.

18
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:37,218
Mm.

19
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:38,819
Toohm!

20
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:40,521
I am very happy with this.

21
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:41,856
In the end,

22
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,990
only one will win a VIP trip

23
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:44,792
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

24
00:00:44,826 --> 00:00:47,295
to one of their 85
international locations,

25
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:50,231
a brand new 2014 Fiat 500,

26
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,400
and $100,000.

27
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:55,770
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

29
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,611
Good morning.

30
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:38,746
- Hey.
- What's up?

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,014
Big winner.

32
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:41,115
What's up, loser?

33
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:43,484
Congrats, by the way.

34
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:44,485
Thank you.

35
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,786
Ben, how does it feel

36
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,222
to be the last man standing
on Team Anthony?

37
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:49,390
It sucks.

38
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:50,858
I feel like we had
a pretty good team.

39
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:52,860
Since I'm the only
one left on Team Anthony,

40
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:54,228
there's a lot of pressure,

41
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,697
so I got to put my best foot
forward even more so

42
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:58,766
because, being that
he's such a good coach,

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,534
I really don't want
to let him down.

44
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,482
We're in downtown
LA walking down the street.

45
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:16,183
I'm not familiar with LA,

46
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:17,852
so I have no idea
where we're going

47
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:19,286
or what we're gonna be doing.

48
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,226
We finally go
into this beautiful building,

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,762
but it's got this
haunted old feel to it.

50
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,363
I'm thinking lots of cool stuff

51
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,399
probably happened here.

52
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:32,500
Hey, guys.

53
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:33,667
Hey.

54
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:36,203
Welcome to
the Herald Examiner building.

55
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:38,072
Once home to one
of the nation's

56
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:40,241
most highly-circulated
newspapers,

57
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:42,009
it's now a popular
filming location

58
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:44,011
for movies like
<i>The Usual Suspects,</i>

59
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:47,048
<i>Collateral,</i>
and<i> Spider-Man 3.</i>

60
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,283
This week's spotlight
challenge delves

61
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:51,252
into a type of character
that has inspired

62
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:54,722
generations of children
and adults alike--

63
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:57,491
superheroes.

64
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:59,660
This is awesome for me

65
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:01,662
because in my younger
artistic days,

66
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:04,198
I used to attempt
to draw superheroes.

67
00:03:04,232 --> 00:03:05,766
So I'm really excited.

68
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:10,171
Now, for every Batman,
Spider-Man, and Superman,

69
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:11,372
there's a Bruce Wayne,

70
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:13,140
Peter Parker, and Clark Kent.

71
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:15,643
These alter egos
are seemingly regular guys

72
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:17,311
who transform into superheroes

73
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,647
when danger is lurking.

74
00:03:19,681 --> 00:03:21,749
So for this
spotlight challenge,

75
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:24,985
you will transform
a seemingly ordinary person

76
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,355
into an extraordinary
superhero character.

77
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,591
Of course,
there's just one thing.

78
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,126
Always.

79
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,028
Simply making
a superhero character

80
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:37,098
is way too straightforward.

81
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:40,234
This challenge might actually
be the most daunting

82
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:41,635
in<i> Face Off</i> history.

83
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,037
Ooh.

84
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:45,005
What more could we do?
What is it?

85
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,275
Because you are the alter egos
this week,

86
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,344
and you'll be transforming
yourselves

87
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:52,012
into superheroes.

88
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:53,881
Oh, my goodness.

89
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:56,884
This is gonna be
the hardest challenge

90
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,419
and the hardest thing
I will ever do.

91
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,054
Oh, my God.

92
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,726
Okay, is this excitement
across the board?

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,727
Yeah?

94
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,362
Yes.

95
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,064
Now I know it's very difficult

96
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:11,732
to apply make-up
to yourselves,

97
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:13,667
so you will have
make-up assistants

98
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,769
on application day
to help you apply

99
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:16,871
your prosthetics.

100
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:17,905
Nice.

101
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:19,673
All right, guys,
go ahead and get started

102
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,774
on your designs.

103
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,209
I can't wait
to see you guys onstage.

104
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:23,711
Bye.

105
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:30,484
We're going to be
applying makeup to ourselves.

106
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,052
No big deal.

107
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:34,288
No big deal at all.

108
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,524
My character has many elements

109
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:37,958
of my life incorporated
into it,

110
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:41,162
including a fascination
for dragons

111
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,963
and vigilante justice.

112
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:44,532
I'm envisioning a new character

113
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:45,833
in an older world.

114
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,234
I've named him Slayer.

115
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:48,869
This is a dragon-human hybrid.

116
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:50,304
He's an immortal assassin,

117
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:52,439
and he protects people
from corruption.

118
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:58,546
I'm very excited

119
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,948
and I'm not excited
at the same time.

120
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:03,617
I'm very introverted, and...

121
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,586
nature was always my outlet.

122
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,087
So for my alter ego,

123
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:09,089
I want to pull inspiration
from nature.

124
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:12,693
I want to do a mother
nature-inspired superhero,

125
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:13,861
who is a healer.

126
00:05:13,895 --> 00:05:15,863
This is gonna be

127
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:17,298
a cool makeup.

128
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:21,802
I have nothing solid yet.

129
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:24,538
I'm just throwing shapes
around and poses.

130
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:25,806
I'm drawing a blank.

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,841
What would I look like
if I was a superhero.

132
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:29,810
Superheroes
and super villains are cool,

133
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:32,179
but I don't know what
I'm gonna do for myself.

134
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:40,454
Growing up, I
was very quiet and shy

135
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,022
and kind of introverted.

136
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:44,892
So I start thinking
of ways that I can take

137
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,027
those aspects of me

138
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:49,129
and create the exact opposite.

139
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,565
I want to do more
of a guardian angel

140
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,033
type superhero.

141
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,935
She's elegant and beautiful.

142
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,705
And I want a very
powerful silhouette.

143
00:05:57,739 --> 00:05:59,106
So I'm excited to get back
to the lab

144
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,708
and start working on this.

145
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,088
We get back to the lab,

146
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,190
and we have five hours
on the clock to work today.

147
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:18,158
Can we see our ugly mugs?

148
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,335
_

149
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:24,252
_

150
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:28,636
To have a live cast
of myself is really weird.

151
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,371
I've got one at the house,

152
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,706
but for some reason, this one
looks like I'm a lot fatter,

153
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:34,608
which is un-superhero-ish.

154
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:36,910
But that's okay.
I'll go with it.

155
00:06:41,983 --> 00:06:43,517
Hey, guys!

156
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,818
Hello!

157
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:46,820
We got a birth-- a
birthday in the house, right?

158
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:48,255
So everybody get over here.

159
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,724
Aww, thanks, guys.

160
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,026
Thank you.

161
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,527
How many people can say

162
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,896
that they had their birthday
on<i> Face Off?</i>

163
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,300
I can.

164
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,101
This being my first birthday
away from home,

165
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:02,303
it means a lot to me.

166
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,804
Thank you, guys.

167
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:12,613
I'm thinking, um,
he was a military experiment.

168
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:13,814
Mm-hmm.

169
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:15,115
Instead of doing a superhero,

170
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,718
I'm actually going
for a villain.

171
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:20,387
I spent five years in the Marine
Corps as a helicopter mechanic.

172
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:24,558
So my concept is a super soldier
that was in a helicopter crash,

173
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:26,593
and the government
put him back together

174
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:28,662
to create this war machine.

175
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,130
This is kind of
like the RoboCop,

176
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:31,398
Terminator type line.

177
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,433
Yeah.

178
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:33,967
Ben is the last person
on my team.

179
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:37,471
So it gives me the opportunity
to give all my attention to him.

180
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:42,176
Maybe on the cowl,
sculpt the top of your cranium.

181
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:46,480
He's also my last chance
to get to the finale.

182
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,549
And I hope I can get him there.

183
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,485
He's kind of an anti-hero.

184
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,722
He's constantly fighting
the urge to do evil things.

185
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:55,923
Yes.

186
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,592
His name is Reckoning,
and he is an anti-hero

187
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:00,694
who is a human that has made
a deal with the devil

188
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:02,129
to take up his job.

189
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:03,831
And he wants to use his powers
for good,

190
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:05,699
but he's slowly
becoming a villain.

191
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:08,602
Instead of doing
the traditional, two-horn devil,

192
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:10,938
I decided to go
with almost like a crown shape.

193
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:12,473
So I'm really happy and excited

194
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:14,007
to see
how this is gonna turn out.

195
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:22,750
My hero,
he fights giant monsters, right?

196
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,451
But he has
no fucking experience.

197
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,086
He doesn't know
what he's doing,

198
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:29,056
so he's just destroying cities
as he's trying to help people.

199
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,758
I want my superhero
to be funny.

200
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,861
So he's a bumbling superhero
of Japan

201
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:35,896
who created these gloves.

202
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,898
But the gloves work in reverse

203
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,000
and actually amplify the person
wearing the gloves.

204
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:42,803
So he's able to grow
to immense sizes.

205
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,471
He tries to help people,

206
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:47,941
but he's just ruining the city
and millions of people's lives

207
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:49,209
at the same time.

208
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:51,979
And much like my life,
he is a fish out of water.

209
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:58,318
My mom's a wigmaker.

210
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:00,387
And she's showed me a lot
of the stuff that I know now.

211
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,489
So I'm gonna make sure
that I incorporate a wig

212
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:05,392
and make it the biggest wig
I have ever made,

213
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,027
because my mom is my superhero.

214
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:09,129
So the wig's for her.

215
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:10,631
And I start pulling
the hair back

216
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:13,534
and just rolling it so it
can get a more simple shape.

217
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,438
And then I use cheesecloth
and wrap it so I have something

218
00:09:17,472 --> 00:09:19,706
to glue the moss on.

219
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,075
Then I spray it black
and then start gluing moss.

220
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,778
It's huge.
And I love it.

221
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:34,021
What is the idea
behind the whole character?

222
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:35,456
Um, mostly taking, like,

223
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,257
a post-apocalyptic kind
of world.

224
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:38,659
I finally have a concept.

225
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,527
And it's a sort of anti-hero.

226
00:09:40,562 --> 00:09:41,628
Like, a part demon.

227
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:42,863
She protects humans.

228
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:45,532
And I'm planning
on doing it black and white

229
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,568
like she jumped
out of the comic book.

230
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:49,169
I work at haunted houses.

231
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:50,604
I scare people for a living.

232
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:53,974
So her superpower is basically
scaring them to death.

233
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,242
What does the face look like?

234
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:56,610
I don't know yet.

235
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:58,545
That's-- that's
what I'm trying to figure out.

236
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,780
- All righty.
- Um.

237
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:01,281
And I'm having trouble, like,

238
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,417
nailing down exactly what I
want the face to look like.

239
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,718
And I just kind of get, like,

240
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:06,420
a little frazzled
and a little frustrated.

241
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:07,955
Hmm.

242
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:10,390
Stephanie's losing a lot
of time by not moving ahead.

243
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,926
She needs to come up
with something very fast.

244
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:15,462
It's halfway through the day,

245
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:18,165
and I still haven't
started sculpting.

246
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,100
I really want to do well
on this challenge,

247
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:23,337
but I can't even think
of something to make.

248
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,638
I'm totally lost.

249
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:31,659
It looks like
a comic book character.

250
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:32,993
Yeah.

251
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,962
You just need to figure out
the perfect face.

252
00:10:34,996 --> 00:10:36,530
It's Day 1
of our Superhero Challenge.

253
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,931
And I finally have a concept,

254
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,967
but I'm having trouble
figuring out the face.

255
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:42,936
So maybe
a smaller, subtler piece.

256
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:45,339
That's what I was-- I was
thinking of just doing a brow.

257
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,640
Yeah. A brow's great.

258
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:48,976
Just make sure
your makeup looks flawless.

259
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,977
Yeah.

260
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,145
Laura's right.

261
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,379
No matter what I do,

262
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,114
I need to make sure
my makeup looks perfect.

263
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,490
I'm going to do a dome shell,

264
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,792
which is kind of like a helmet.

265
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:06,093
In the Marine Corps,

266
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,562
I did hydraulic sheet metal
fiberglass work.

267
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:11,899
So this is really an opportunity
to show some of my skills.

268
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,668
To make this helmet,
I sculpted out in wet clay

269
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:16,470
and then take it over
at the black floor machine.

270
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:17,571
That's cool.

271
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:18,706
And then I can go ahead

272
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,307
and start sculpting the cowl
around this

273
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,042
to make sure it fits.

274
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,212
We have mirrors
set up at our stations,

275
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:27,881
so I want to do a test makeup
because we are our models.

276
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,850
So might as well test it out.

277
00:11:29,884 --> 00:11:34,121
I'm using Kryolan aqua colors,
lavenders, and greens.

278
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:37,057
And I hate it.

279
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:39,860
So I go for my second option,
which is more natural tones.

280
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:41,729
I use a flesh-tone color,

281
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:43,564
and I like that one.

282
00:11:43,598 --> 00:11:45,099
It goes with the natural theme.

283
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,168
And I'm so happy
I decided to do this now.

284
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:57,811
One of the most iconic parts
of a superhero

285
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:59,413
is how their mask is shaped.

286
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:00,814
So I'm just going

287
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:02,783
for one that looks
like maybe a dragon would wear.

288
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,151
The biggest thing
with scales--

289
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:05,753
you want them to read
from far away,

290
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:07,621
even if they're subtle scales.

291
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:09,022
The objective is to subtly

292
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,392
suggest that he comes
from a world with dragons,

293
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,093
but he's still a human.

294
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:15,429
So I'm putting in scales,
but not too many scales.

295
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:18,432
There's a lot of freedom
with this particular design.

296
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:20,334
Because dragons didn't exist.

297
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,342
I'm throwing clay down.

298
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,610
I'm pushing it around.

299
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:30,944
I'm trying
to get a subtle shape.

300
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:32,646
I don't want
to do a superhero mask.

301
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,582
I'm going for a more organic,
demonic look.

302
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:39,086
I named her Doll Face because I
want her to be a pretty demon.

303
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,021
Did you figure
out your concept?

304
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:44,258
Yeah. Just worrying about
not doing enough on the face.

305
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:46,126
You just do an immaculate job.

306
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,494
Yeah.

307
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:50,130
Okay, just--
it's got to be perfect.

308
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,532
30 minutes, everybody.

309
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,575
That's time, everybody.

310
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:04,645
Okay, good enough.

311
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,314
By the end of Day 1,

312
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:08,749
I have enough clay

313
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:12,219
blocked out where I know
what I'm doing for Day 2.

314
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,154
I just got to take care
of my time management

315
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:16,557
better and finish it.

316
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,965
It's Day 2 of the
Superhero Challenge,

317
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,633
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab.

318
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,002
And I have quite a bit
to get done today.

319
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:31,371
Should I do some filigree work
on the helmet

320
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:34,074
or should I just do that on,
like, the portions--

321
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,142
Figure out the face first.

322
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:36,510
Okay.

323
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:38,879
The most important thing
is getting the face sculpt done.

324
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,380
And as I'm sculpting,

325
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:43,150
I start looking at the pictures
I took at the Herald building.

326
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,318
And I realize I can actually

327
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:48,889
trace some of the filigree
pattern from those pictures

328
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,458
and transfer it onto my sculpt.

329
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:55,595
So once I trace the filigree,
I press it against my sculpture,

330
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,432
and it transfers the lead
of the pencil onto to the clay.

331
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,468
So now I have an outline
to follow

332
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:04,271
as I'm placing the filigree.

333
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,608
That's cool.

334
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:10,377
I'm feeling
good about my sculpt,

335
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:12,846
so I go ahead
and start molding my face.

336
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,216
I finished the mold
really quick.

337
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,984
But I cannot use foam latex

338
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:19,486
because I'm allergic to it.

339
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,555
So I run in gelatin.

340
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,991
I let it sit to set up, and then
I'll come back later on.

341
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,998
Yesterday I blocked
out most of the cowl.

342
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,533
I still have to complete it,

343
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:36,203
and I need to get started
and complete the face.

344
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:37,571
Do you ever speed sculpt?

345
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:38,939
Not really.

346
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:40,974
Laura's concerned
about my time management.

347
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:41,975
Stand up.

348
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:43,310
So she gives me some tips

349
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,011
on how to do speed sculpting.

350
00:14:45,046 --> 00:14:47,447
I like using my fingers
and raking the whole thing.

351
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,750
Laura teaches me how to
get the forms in a faster pace.

352
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,920
There.
See how quick that was?

353
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,922
He does like to take his time,
which is a good thing,

354
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,224
but on this competition,

355
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:59,059
you can't afford
to take too much time.

356
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,360
I got to speed it up.

357
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:07,133
I want him to look scary
and be disgusting.

358
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,735
I want to show
the skeletal structure

359
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,136
underneath the respirator

360
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:11,738
because I think

361
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,940
that will really bring out
the villain aspect of things.

362
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:16,543
And when I open up
that respirator, it will give me

363
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:20,380
that little creepy factor
that really just sells nasty.

364
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:27,187
I've been thinking
about making wings for this guy.

365
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,388
Wings?

366
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:29,823
I'm going to create

367
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:32,125
some real badass wings
sticking up out of his back.

368
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,927
I've had
this decade-long pursuit

369
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,595
of becoming a military pilot.

370
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,697
I like flight,
and I think it's a cool element

371
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:39,165
to add to it.

372
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,235
And then I pick out some foam
and some steel bar.

373
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,638
And I run the bar
through the two pieces of foam.

374
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:45,872
I bend it to the shape I want.

375
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:47,207
What do you think
of that profile?

376
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:49,109
And then I gaff tape
it together.

377
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:50,510
100 miles an hour today.

378
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:52,245
I put two layers
of cheesecloth on.

379
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,613
One on one side,
one on the other,

380
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,015
and latex them together.

381
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,219
It gives an effect of skin
as opposed to raw materials.

382
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:02,489
Once I get latex on there, they
start to look like dragon wings.

383
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,759
Dude, that looks awesome.

384
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,508
Shit.

385
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,343
I go to open my face and...

386
00:16:23,377 --> 00:16:24,711
Shit.

387
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,479
And I can feel the tackiness
of the gelatin

388
00:16:26,514 --> 00:16:27,681
that's on the side of the mold,

389
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:28,715
and it's not setting.

390
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:30,450
Oh, no.

391
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:33,186
I pop it out. Then the edges
are just atrocious.

392
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,721
I can't use it.

393
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:37,090
I'm really nervous right now
because I don't have a face

394
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:39,292
for my makeup
and I don't know what to do.

395
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:40,760
This is not good.

396
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,673
Oh, no.

397
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,975
It's Day 2 of our Alter
Ego Superhero Challenge.

398
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,677
And I'm really nervous right now

399
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,612
because I don't have a face
for my makeup.

400
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,113
The edges are just atrocious.

401
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,782
But I'm not giving up.

402
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,750
I just need to get it
out of the mold.

403
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:59,586
So I'm powdering and peeling it.

404
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,355
My only option
is to run it in silicon.

405
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,958
But I don't really know
how to use it.

406
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:07,193
I'm not very comfortable
with it.

407
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:08,361
We'll see.

408
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,495
How did it turn out?

409
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,496
Not good.

410
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:11,898
Oh.

411
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:14,033
But I got to get
this ready for silicone.

412
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,072
I love the size of it.

413
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,840
The arm pieces
are important to my concept

414
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,275
because they're the accidental

415
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,410
reason my character
becomes a superhero.

416
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:26,079
So I see these buckets

417
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,514
and I think it would be kind of
funny to go really, really big

418
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,651
with these almost non-functional
cannon arms.

419
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:35,355
So I take these serving dishes
to use as a top for the bucket.

420
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,790
And I'm attaching tubing.

421
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:40,660
And then I vacuum form it.

422
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,795
And then I cut out the bottoms
of the buckets

423
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,930
so I can put them on my arms.

424
00:17:43,964 --> 00:17:45,164
They look cool.

425
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:49,335
They need to be painted,
but they're 90% done.

426
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,703
Toong!

427
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,273
I'm gonna get out of here.

428
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:54,274
All right.

429
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:55,275
All right.
Good luck.

430
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:56,276
- Cool, man.
- You got it.

431
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,310
Make sure you know exactly

432
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,745
where you're gonna
take this thing.

433
00:17:58,779 --> 00:17:59,746
Okay.

434
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,880
Leaving Day 2,

435
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,515
I think both Adam
and Logan are on track.

436
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,818
But I only have two artists
left on my team.

437
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,320
Bye, guys.
Have fun.

438
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:08,588
Losing one of them

439
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:11,124
could really hurt my chance
of going to the finale.

440
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,132
Along with the brow
that I'm doing,

441
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,634
I'm gonna be making a mask
that she holds in her hand

442
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:23,736
to help scare the other demons.

443
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,906
I start sculpting
a really fierce demon face.

444
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,742
I'm going with,
like, super-arched eyebrows,

445
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,077
and, like, a pointy nose,

446
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,412
and high cheekbones.

447
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,080
It's not totally refined,

448
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,582
but it looks good enough to be
a scary mask.

449
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,486
That's time, everybody.

450
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,922
I think everyone's
feeling a little bit nervous,

451
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,224
but also pretty excited
about tomorrow.

452
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,994
It's gonna be a stressful,
hectic day.

453
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:50,697
But in the end, we get
to be onstage as superheroes,

454
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,498
and that's a pretty cool thing.

455
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,308
Good luck, guys.

456
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:03,676
Hey, the models are here.

457
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:04,844
Holy shit.

458
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,212
It's application day today,

459
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,815
and we have four hours
in lab and one hour Last Looks.

460
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:10,783
And we are all really nervous.

461
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,218
Laura, look at the edges.

462
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:13,653
Good mornin'! I know.

463
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,321
I look at my
silicone appliance,

464
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:18,157
and the edges are stunning.

465
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,425
They're paper thin.

466
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,194
This is just a weight
off my shoulder.

467
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,328
I'm so happy.

468
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:23,896
That looks really good.

469
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,399
It's a little
bit strange 'cause

470
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:27,634
we're not waiting on the models.

471
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,902
We are the models.

472
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,404
Um, but we are gonna
be having assistance today.

473
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,405
Hello. Logan.

474
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,540
Nice to meet you.

475
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:34,574
Good to meet you too.

476
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,575
- Hi!
- Vance.

477
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,777
Hi.

478
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,111
- I'm Carey.
- Nice to meet you.

479
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,747
I have applied makeup
to myself before.

480
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:42,348
But it's not easy.

481
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:43,750
So it's really important

482
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:46,486
for me to get
the cowl completely pre-painted

483
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,121
before I even put it on.

484
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:55,862
It's just
this and a chin piece.

485
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:57,030
Okay.

486
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:58,498
And then the rest
of it is the suit,

487
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,999
which I'm trying
to throw together.

488
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:02,068
I know that I have
a lot more fabrication

489
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:03,236
than makeup application.

490
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,470
So the first thing I do

491
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,372
is pull the rest
of the costume together.

492
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:09,208
I want to make all
that look as good as it can be.

493
00:20:09,243 --> 00:20:11,244
So I start to do
some dry brushing.

494
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,379
Then I just
dress the entire costume.

495
00:20:13,414 --> 00:20:14,847
I just hope I've created
something

496
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:17,383
different enough that the judges
will be pleased with it.

497
00:20:17,418 --> 00:20:18,785
Hey, Logan, still look cheap?

498
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:20,386
No, it looks awesome.

499
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:26,326
I am not a fan of putting
prosthetics on my face.

500
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,560
So that's why I was like,

501
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,028
"I want to make a character

502
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:31,064
where I don't have
to put as much stuff on."

503
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,765
All I got to do
is put a brow piece on

504
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,935
and basically paint
everything in black and white.

505
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:39,806
I start from the nose
and then work my way out.

506
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,941
I just got to make sure that it
all lines up and it's not,

507
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,509
like, totally crooked.

508
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,545
Now I have to start
painting like crazy.

509
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:52,575
_

510
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:54,142
_

511
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:56,723
So it's time
for me to apply a bald cap.

512
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,624
Just kidding.

513
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,394
What I have to do now
is get these pieces painted

514
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,496
and get 'em ready
so that I can apply 'em.

515
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,432
If you're able to start
pre-painting the packs on this.

516
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,000
It's time to take the cowl

517
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:11,204
and really get that black,
leathery, metal work on it.

518
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:13,606
And it's looking great.

519
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,508
So once I get
these things applied,

520
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,343
I can just
worry about the wardrobe,

521
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,746
and I'll have an hour
left at Last Looks.

522
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,150
Cold.

523
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:25,585
Good painting's about layers,

524
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:28,354
not obvious, bold strokes.

525
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,690
Especially subtleties.

526
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:32,325
I'm finishing painting
the face.

527
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,693
And the color scheme today

528
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,695
is going to be very flesh-toned
and green.

529
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,530
It's a hybrid
of a dragon and a human,

530
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,366
so I want to incorporate
predominant colors from both.

531
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:41,367
See you later.

532
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:42,602
Yeah, bye.

533
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,837
The face goes on,
and from here on out,

534
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:47,607
I'm gonna be Slayer,
the Defender of Dragons.

535
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:56,883
Now, how do I go in
and make it more translucent?

536
00:21:56,917 --> 00:22:00,720
I probably would layer upon
layer of a very watered-down

537
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:04,690
translucent alcohol-based colors
on top of your flesh-tone.

538
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:07,393
I'm using alcohol colors
to make it more translucent

539
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:11,264
so we can really get
that looking realistic.

540
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,466
But I'm nervous about using
alcohol paints 'cause

541
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,301
I've only used
them for injuries.

542
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,969
I've done a lot
of things this challenge

543
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:18,604
that I have not done before.

544
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,973
I just hope it pays off
in the end.

545
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,809
One hour, everybody.

546
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,846
I want to make sure
that I have a graphic look.

547
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,714
That's why I'm going
for the whole

548
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,982
black-and-white color scheme.

549
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,685
But it's looking really muddy
and really gray.

550
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,353
Um...

551
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:37,356
I'm starting to look
like a blue, vampirey,

552
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:39,025
weird-- I don't know.

553
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,594
I'm just not liking
how it's all coming together.

554
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:43,596
And I'm trying
to do some flicking

555
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,164
just to break it up.

556
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,167
I'm looking totally different
than what I wanted.

557
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,769
15 minutes, everybody.

558
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,008
All right, that's it.

559
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,477
Time's up!

560
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:59,979
I'm really worried
because I'm looking vampirey.

561
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,948
I mean,
I only have one appliance.

562
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:05,751
There's really nothing else
to distract away from that.

563
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:08,020
Ugh. It's making me really,
really nervous.

564
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:16,174
It's game time, baby.
It's game time.

565
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,575
It's Last Looks,

566
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,444
and we have one hour
to finish our superheroes.

567
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:22,446
I'm really concerned
about finishing the face

568
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:24,448
and not having enough time

569
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:26,317
to finish this character
the way I want to.

570
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,920
Wow, I am not good at
airbrushing with my left hand.

571
00:23:31,189 --> 00:23:32,657
Are you kidding?

572
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:33,858
I really got to punch up

573
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,493
some of the highlights
just to make sure

574
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,428
that I have some sort
of, like, graphic look to me.

575
00:23:37,462 --> 00:23:40,598
But I could still end up
just looking really muddy.

576
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,001
30 minutes.

577
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,570
I can't even airbrush on myself.

578
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:47,772
I still have some painting
to do and some shading.

579
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:50,041
But I can't do it on myself.

580
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:51,342
Do you need it
around your eyes?

581
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:52,743
- Yeah.
- I'll do it.

582
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,579
We're all competing
to win this thing,

583
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,347
but everyone needs each other
at this point.

584
00:23:56,381 --> 00:23:57,848
Look up for me.

585
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:02,753
I'm trying to do modeling,

586
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:03,921
but I can't see.

587
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:05,389
I know that I've missed
some spots.

588
00:24:05,424 --> 00:24:07,191
So I ask Adam
to hit it for 15 seconds.

589
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:08,659
10 minutes, everybody.

590
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:14,565
That looks awesome, Ben.

591
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,233
Looking
at everyone else's character,

592
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,369
I realize I am not a superhero.

593
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:19,971
This is so stupid.

594
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,405
There's not much I can do.

595
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:27,944
All right, it's time.

596
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:28,945
Fuck.

597
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,248
I'm all right,
I'm all right, I'm all right.

598
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:32,817
I've never been this nervous.

599
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:35,019
I don't think
I look like a superhero.

600
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:38,255
Gosh, I just
want this to be over.

601
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,393
Good evening, judges.

602
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,661
How are you doing tonight?

603
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:44,895
- Great, thank you.
- Bitchin'.

604
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,364
Excellent.

605
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:48,733
And hello as well
to our champion coaches.

606
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:49,734
How are you guys doing?

607
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:50,768
Pretty good.

608
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,136
Peachy with a side of keen.

609
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,304
All right, well,

610
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:55,006
tonight's gonna be a lot of fun,
obviously.

611
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,240
This week the contestants'

612
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:58,175
Spotlight Challenge
was to create a superhero

613
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,644
using themselves

614
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:01,679
as the alter ego and inspiration
for its design.

615
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:03,648
And not only that,
they had to apply the makeup

616
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,349
to themselves as well.

617
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:06,784
And I think it's safe to say

618
00:25:06,818 --> 00:25:08,986
that this may be
the hardest challenge

619
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:10,855
that we've ever done
on this show.

620
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:12,156
For sure.

621
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,770
All right, are you guys

622
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:14,136
ready to see
what they've come up with?

623
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,200
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

624
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:17,160
- Can't wait.
- Okay, well, let's take a look.

625
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:18,824
_

626
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:21,232
All right, let's really
see what these guys can do.

627
00:25:46,392 --> 00:25:48,993
This is a very different
experience coming out onstage.

628
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,928
We have to act,
which is a blast.

629
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:52,397
I'm lovin' doing this.

630
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:54,547
_

631
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:55,811
_

632
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:19,023
The makeup alone may
not read as a superhero,

633
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:20,591
but the character as a whole,

634
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:22,794
I think that reads
as superhero enough.

635
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:24,629
This is just a lot of fun.

636
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:46,984
I knew it was gonna be hard,

637
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:49,353
but I'm just seeing Glenn
doing his eyebrow.

638
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,089
He is just so stone-faced
while I'm posing, and,

639
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:53,524
like, "Am I doing this right?"

640
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,159
Yeah, it's nerve-racking.

641
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:18,249
I have a
love-hate relationship

642
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:20,718
with this makeup 'cause
I really love the cowl,

643
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:23,788
but I'm not happy
with how the face turned out.

644
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:51,449
I've got this gun in my hands.

645
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:53,017
I've got these creepy eyes,

646
00:27:53,051 --> 00:27:54,719
and I've got
this skeleton face.

647
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:57,455
I definitely feel badass
right now.

648
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,680
So I'm onstage.

649
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:25,550
I'm like, "Okay,
I guess I'm a superhero."

650
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,885
I've never been this nervous
in my life.

651
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:29,656
_

652
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:50,908
I make sure to
put my cheesy grin on.

653
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:52,643
And I'm in heaven right now.

654
00:28:58,516 --> 00:29:00,618
This week
was such a tough challenge,

655
00:29:00,652 --> 00:29:02,987
but you guys did a great job.

656
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:07,925
Okay, before the judges
come to take a closer look,

657
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:11,395
I do have another huge surprise
for you.

658
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:12,696
Oh, no.

659
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:14,365
I wanted to have you
all out here together

660
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,901
before I introduce tonight's
very special guest judge.

661
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:20,037
He's a comic book industry
legend who has worked

662
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,806
on some of its most
popular and iconic titles

663
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:25,542
like Spider-Man
and The Incredible Hulk.

664
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:28,646
He's also one of the founders
of Image Comics and created one

665
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,183
of the most popular comic book
franchises of all time, Spawn.

666
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:38,022
Please give a big welcome
to Todd McFarlane.

667
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,490
Oh, man.

668
00:29:39,524 --> 00:29:40,891
Hey, McKenzie,
how are you today?

669
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:42,693
Good.
Great to have you here.

670
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:44,929
Oh, my God.
That's so awesome.

671
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,097
Todd McFarlane was
just a huge influence on me

672
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:48,966
when I started drawing as a kid.

673
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,801
It's really cool
to have him here.

674
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:53,437
Now, there is no one

675
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:56,674
more qualified than you
to be judging superheroes.

676
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,008
And I know that you
were watching backstage.

677
00:29:58,043 --> 00:29:59,310
Yes.

678
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,778
So are you ready to take
a closer look at these guys?

679
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:02,279
Yes, we will.

680
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:05,015
All right, judges,
you ready to do this?

681
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,584
This is a very difference
experience for closer looks.

682
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,620
I don't know if I'm supposed
to act in character

683
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:11,956
or if I'm supposed
to freeze and be just a statue.

684
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,957
I don't know.

685
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:13,991
Hi, Logan.

686
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:15,826
Hi.

687
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,328
You sure got a lot
done this week.

688
00:30:17,362 --> 00:30:20,097
Could you turn sideways
so we can see your wings?

689
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:21,665
These layers really help sell

690
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,934
these instead
of just being flat.

691
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:25,569
Can we get a grit right here?

692
00:30:25,603 --> 00:30:27,171
Yeah, there we go.

693
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:28,505
Give us a couple
of expressions.

694
00:30:28,506 --> 00:30:29,806
_

695
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:31,909
Yeah.

696
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:34,244
You look like you're kind
of diggin' this.

697
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,116
Did you have
fun this week, Julian?

698
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,317
Oh, yeah.

699
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,119
Can you give
us a furrowed brow?

700
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:43,420
That's some nice edges

701
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:45,322
for something
that you put on yourself.

702
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,792
I think the ears

703
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:49,760
could have been sculpted
much better though.

704
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:50,795
I'm sorry.

705
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,296
Let's see this mask.

706
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:53,865
Were you intending
on holding this up?

707
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:54,866
Is this your mask?

708
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,033
Yeah.

709
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:57,401
Okay. So let's see this.

710
00:30:57,436 --> 00:30:58,803
It wouldn't actually
fit my face.

711
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:00,371
Cool. Thank you.

712
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,405
Hi, Darla.

713
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,507
Hello.

714
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:04,075
I'm concerned about the paint.

715
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,142
It's starting to crack.

716
00:31:05,177 --> 00:31:06,944
Let's see a look of victory.

717
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:11,649
I'm trying to make as little
facial expression as possible.

718
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,251
Now give us a look of poison.

719
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,886
I could be in trouble.

720
00:31:19,591 --> 00:31:21,959
Tell us who made
your favorite superhero tonight

721
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:24,194
on Twitter using #FaceOff

722
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:29,508
I'm worried that if I
move around too much, the paint

723
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:30,776
is gonna start to crack.

724
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,711
Now give us a look of poison.

725
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:34,113
There you go.

726
00:31:34,147 --> 00:31:36,448
I just hope that
the rest of the makeup

727
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:38,016
is enough to keep me safe.

728
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:43,922
All right, Ben,
give us that big reveal.

729
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:47,092
So this is all stuff
that you built, right?

730
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,293
How about some expressions?

731
00:31:57,604 --> 00:32:00,072
You love that big hair,
don't you, girl?

732
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:02,641
All right, you got a couple
of looks for us, then?

733
00:32:04,844 --> 00:32:06,612
It's awkward.

734
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:08,847
I completely blank out.

735
00:32:08,882 --> 00:32:10,749
I'm digging
my hole deeper and deeper.

736
00:32:10,783 --> 00:32:12,584
Just made the willow weep,
I think.

737
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:14,920
Good evening.

738
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:16,655
You've just been waitin'
to use that hairdo

739
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:17,723
of yours, haven't you?

740
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:19,224
Maybe.

741
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,360
Let's see
what these things are.

742
00:32:21,394 --> 00:32:22,928
They're protonic plasma.

743
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,096
It's all very complicated.

744
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,364
You don't want
to hear about it.

745
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,433
Thank you.

746
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:35,040
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

747
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:36,842
so let's find out
what they thought.

748
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:38,143
Julian,

749
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:39,945
Darla,

750
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:41,480
Ben.

751
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:43,749
Congratulations
because you are all safe

752
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:46,018
and can head back
to the makeup room.

753
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,061
Shit.

754
00:32:56,095 --> 00:32:59,665
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

755
00:32:59,699 --> 00:33:01,700
And the judges would like
to speak with each of you

756
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,468
to find out
more about your work.

757
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:05,470
Logan, if you'd
please step out.

758
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:12,578
Logan, I can't wait
to hear the backstory,

759
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:14,980
but all in your superhero voice,
please.

760
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,782
My name is Slayer.

761
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,955
I hail from the time
dragons ruled,

762
00:33:22,989 --> 00:33:24,256
and I defended them.

763
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,491
Now I defend people.

764
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,326
That's my story.

765
00:33:30,463 --> 00:33:31,897
I'm very impressed

766
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:34,433
with your conceptual designs
and your technical work.

767
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:38,003
It's not something
I've seen before.

768
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:42,341
It encourages us to want to know
more about the backstory,

769
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,643
and its origin
is incredibly impressive.

770
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:46,011
Thank you very much.

771
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,379
I love this color palette,

772
00:33:47,414 --> 00:33:49,248
and it really gives it a lot
of life.

773
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:51,984
And I especially love
what you did with your wings.

774
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:54,920
It really takes your imagination
someplace, which is great.

775
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:56,588
I am very happy with this.

776
00:33:58,258 --> 00:34:01,126
Sculpturally speaking,
you've nailed it with the face.

777
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:03,595
You can see that you're able
to emote through it.

778
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,399
Yet you've somehow baked
in that expression,

779
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:09,802
and it's really
quite accomplished.

780
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:11,036
Thank you.

781
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:13,973
You've taken
what is traditional garb--

782
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:15,040
You've got a mask,

783
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:16,508
you've got a logo,

784
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:19,645
but you put it into a frame now
that isn't so obvious.

785
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,913
So I like the whole message

786
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:22,481
that you're bringing across
right now.

787
00:34:22,515 --> 00:34:24,116
Thank you very much.

788
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,384
Logan, please step back.

789
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,525
Emily, you're up next.

790
00:34:38,832 --> 00:34:40,165
Well, forest babe,

791
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,467
tell us all about yourself.

792
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,569
So I am nature's daughter.

793
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,170
So I heal animals,

794
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:49,441
and I just help bring the good
out of people.

795
00:34:49,476 --> 00:34:51,810
I got to say, I
love the paint job,

796
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:55,347
but I'm a little tired
of the big hairdos.

797
00:34:55,382 --> 00:34:56,782
I don't know what
to say, honey.

798
00:34:56,816 --> 00:34:59,651
I'm just very disappointed
that you repeated yourself.

799
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:01,020
Okay, thank you.

800
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:04,556
This is, for me, not
appropriate for this challenge.

801
00:35:04,591 --> 00:35:07,493
You look like a hedge
or a topiary.

802
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:08,961
At this point
in the competition,

803
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:10,963
without allowing
yourself to evolve,

804
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:13,899
you're going to be doomed.

805
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:15,734
Emily, thank you very much.

806
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,336
Please step back.

807
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,711
Adam, please step forward.

808
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,419
Tell us about your superhero
character.

809
00:35:33,453 --> 00:35:35,320
I am the Crimson Wave.

810
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,856
I stuck my arms in these things.
They didn't come off.

811
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:41,026
And I decided to throw a mask
on, move to Japan,

812
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:42,661
and save the city.

813
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:47,833
Makes a lot of sense
when he says it that way.

814
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:49,168
Yeah.

815
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:50,836
You've really done a great job

816
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,605
at creating
an overall superhero character.

817
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,643
It's good that this is comedic
because the proportions

818
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,612
are so insane.

819
00:36:00,647 --> 00:36:02,748
If I was 10 years
old, 11 years old,

820
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:03,916
I'd dig you to hell.

821
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,117
Of all the people up there,

822
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:06,718
you were the one
that was in character.

823
00:36:06,753 --> 00:36:09,955
And after doing comic books
for 25-plus years,

824
00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:11,523
I dig it.

825
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:14,560
What really counted
is you made sure that you

826
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:17,696
hit that one note this week
which was superhero.

827
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,934
And so many pieces of
your design say that so clearly.

828
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:23,535
And that's what I
love about the makeup.

829
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,570
Thank you.

830
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:26,472
Adam, you can step back.

831
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:31,410
Hey.

832
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:33,011
Good job.

833
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:34,279
Thanks, Dad.

834
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:36,148
All right,
let's talk to Stephanie.

835
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:45,657
Talk to us about how you got
to what is

836
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:46,925
in front of us right now.

837
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,527
My character is Doll Face,

838
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:51,830
and she is set
in a post-apocalyptic world.

839
00:36:51,865 --> 00:36:55,734
And she is trying to protect
all the remaining humans

840
00:36:55,768 --> 00:36:57,436
that are left on Earth.

841
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,405
One of the things that I
would have liked to have seen

842
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,074
is that when we asked you
to put the mask up,

843
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:03,342
you said it didn't fit.

844
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:06,512
And that's a bit
of a shame to me.

845
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:08,714
'Cause it would have been kind
of cool if you actually

846
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:11,216
had the reveal like Beauty
and the Beast, if you will.

847
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:12,951
For sure.

848
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:16,021
You have chances to explore
demons in other challenges.

849
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:19,158
So if you would have
done that extraordinarily well,

850
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:20,626
I could have gotten behind it.

851
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,361
But the forms are just--

852
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:24,396
they're too derivative.

853
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,198
The appliance that you have on

854
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:28,300
is very similar
to what I put on Kiefer.

855
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,569
Did you ever see the movie
<i>The Lost Boys?</i>

856
00:37:30,603 --> 00:37:32,004
Oh, yeah.

857
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:33,505
So it's a little bit repetitive

858
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,007
and boring for me to see it.

859
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,242
And not only that, I
think you did a really poor job

860
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:38,443
painting yourself.

861
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:42,014
You look like an old lady
with red eyes.

862
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:43,015
Stephanie, thank you.

863
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:44,416
If you'd please step back.

864
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:53,625
Okay, thank you, guys.

865
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,360
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

866
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:56,995
while the judges deliberate.

867
00:38:03,036 --> 00:38:06,004
All right, judges, let's start
with you favorite looks tonight.

868
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,773
How about Logan's work?

869
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,374
I love Logan's.

870
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:12,177
It just looked like he stepped
right out of another century.

871
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:14,546
Yeah, if you can
take him 2,000 years back

872
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:16,448
and 2,000 years in the future,

873
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:18,917
I could still figure out the
story that would make him work.

874
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:20,419
The detailing of the makeup

875
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:22,955
in addition to everything
else was pretty incredible.

876
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:24,556
All right,
let's move on to Adam.

877
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:26,491
Everything
about it was successful.

878
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:28,560
He literalized it
by making it a comedian.

879
00:38:28,595 --> 00:38:31,863
And that's what makes it also
really good as a superhero.

880
00:38:31,898 --> 00:38:33,999
If I could make an action
figure out of any of you,

881
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,634
he was the guy
that I'd want to bring home

882
00:38:35,668 --> 00:38:36,868
to my eight-year-old son.

883
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:38,237
He enjoyed it so much.

884
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:40,439
I forgot it was Adam
under there.

885
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:43,141
All right, let's move on
to the looks you like the least.

886
00:38:43,176 --> 00:38:44,943
Why don't we start with Emily?

887
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:46,778
Marge Simpson is Poison Ivy.

888
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:50,882
That absolutely absurd hedge
of a hairdo.

889
00:38:50,917 --> 00:38:53,018
There was nothing
that suggested that she

890
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:56,255
had any strength
as a superhero, as a woman.

891
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,523
She was a little bit
shy about who she was.

892
00:38:58,558 --> 00:39:01,493
She was still uncomfortable
in her skin even with the power.

893
00:39:01,527 --> 00:39:03,695
Okay, let's move
on to Stephanie.

894
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,997
The paint job sucked.

895
00:39:05,031 --> 00:39:06,732
That's what really ruined
this for me.

896
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:08,734
'Cause she looks
like a, you know, zombie.

897
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:10,535
It was a brow shape

898
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,239
that we've all seen a painful
amount of times at this point.

899
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:17,676
I don't think
it was a horrible makeup.

900
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,646
It's just that there was nothing
there but gray.

901
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,648
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

902
00:39:22,682 --> 00:39:23,849
We have.

903
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:25,117
Let's bring them back out.

904
00:39:33,493 --> 00:39:35,894
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

905
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:40,065
Logan, your character
certainly has a superhero vibe,

906
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:43,268
but what we really love is that
he also had a mysterious quality

907
00:39:43,303 --> 00:39:45,804
which made us want
to know more about him.

908
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,041
And Adam, the comedic nature
of your superhero suits

909
00:39:49,075 --> 00:39:50,809
your personality perfectly.

910
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:53,612
And your performance gave him
extra dimension in life.

911
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:54,946
All right,

912
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:56,848
so who is the winner
of tonight's challenge?

913
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:58,550
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

914
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:05,488
All right,

915
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:06,990
so who is the winner
of tonight's challenge?

916
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:09,092
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

917
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:14,030
Logan.

918
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,069
Your superhero
clicked in every level.

919
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:21,371
And you did astounding
technical work,

920
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:24,040
especially considering
you had to apply it on yourself.

921
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,442
Great job tonight, man.

922
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:26,443
Thank you very much.

923
00:40:26,477 --> 00:40:27,944
This is a cool moment.

924
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:30,280
Of all the makeups that I've
done in the competition so far,

925
00:40:30,314 --> 00:40:31,781
I'm most proud of this one.

926
00:40:31,816 --> 00:40:34,017
This is win number three for me
and I'm stoked about it.

927
00:40:34,051 --> 00:40:35,418
Thank to my coach, Rayce.

928
00:40:35,453 --> 00:40:37,153
Thank you.

929
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:39,756
All right, so Logan, you
and Adam along with the coaches

930
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,591
can all head backstage.

931
00:40:50,134 --> 00:40:53,403
All right, guys, that means that
you are on the bottom this week,

932
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:55,005
and one of you
will be going home.

933
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,773
Please step forward.

934
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:06,616
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom looks.

935
00:41:06,651 --> 00:41:09,185
Emily, the makeup part
of your character

936
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,720
is actually quite beautiful,

937
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:12,522
but there was
an overall disconnect

938
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:15,659
with the superhero aspect
of the challenge for us.

939
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:17,761
Stephanie, on another week,

940
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:19,729
this demon-like character
could have worked.

941
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:23,233
But we really didn't feel
like we see you in this makeup.

942
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,602
So who is going home tonight?

943
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:27,604
The person going home tonight
is...

944
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,843
Stephanie.

945
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,412
Yep.

946
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:37,247
The paint work
was pretty weak, but moreover,

947
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:39,883
we just didn't feel like you
were inspired by this challenge,

948
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,018
which showed
in the finished product.

949
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:43,019
I'm sorry.

950
00:41:43,054 --> 00:41:44,320
You know what?

951
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:45,855
I had a lot of fun
in this challenge.

952
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,323
It might not have shown,
but I did.

953
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:48,358
Stephanie, I'm sorry,

954
00:41:48,392 --> 00:41:49,626
but you have been eliminated.

955
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,361
That means Emily,

956
00:41:51,395 --> 00:41:53,630
you're safe this week and can
head back to the makeup room.

957
00:41:53,664 --> 00:41:54,831
Thank you.

958
00:41:54,865 --> 00:41:56,232
Bye, Stephanie.

959
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:02,639
Stephanie, it's been a
privilege to have you with us

960
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:04,574
and show us your talents.

961
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,276
It's in you, we've seen it.

962
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,478
And I'm looking forward
to seeing that in the future.

963
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:10,010
Thank you.

964
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:12,797
Stephanie, it's really been
great having you here with us.

965
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:14,715
If you'd please head backstage

966
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:15,699
and pack up your kit.

967
00:42:15,752 --> 00:42:17,668
Thank you so much, everyone.

968
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,086
Good luck.

969
00:42:19,138 --> 00:42:20,504
Well, I'm goin' home,

970
00:42:20,556 --> 00:42:21,889
and it blows.

971
00:42:21,924 --> 00:42:24,875
I wanted to win.
That's why I came here.

972
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:28,462
It's me.

973
00:42:28,498 --> 00:42:30,147
Aw.

974
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:33,784
But I feel really good that I
made it to the final seven.

975
00:42:33,786 --> 00:42:35,836
What I like about you
is you know what you want to do

976
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:37,338
and you're passionate.

977
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:39,774
Watching you grow
this whole competition

978
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:41,158
has been a privilege.

979
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:42,593
Thanks.

980
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:44,512
Even though I didn't make it
through all the way,

981
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:45,613
I think I did awesome.

982
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:47,631
I really impressed myself.

983
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:49,834
It's a bittersweet kind of end
for me.

984
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:52,286
Especially, like,
me looking like this.

985
00:42:54,056 --> 00:42:56,524
At least I'm goin' out lookin'
like a badass.
