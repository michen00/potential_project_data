1
00:00:00,526 --> 00:00:03,094
You've really done a great job.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,796
I'm just very disappointed.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,097
It's incredibly impressive.

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,699
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,600
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

6
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:12,970
Logan's self-applied superhero
slayed the competition.

7
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,274
And Team Laura finally lost
another member

8
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,875
when Stephanie was sent home.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,581
Now six artists remain.

10
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:25,683
And tonight there's
no more playing around

11
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:27,785
as the competition
gets very real.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,621
Nothing compares
to the imagination

13
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,622
of a child.

14
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,757
This can be very fun,

15
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,858
or it can be a total nightmare.

16
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:34,992
It's going awful.

17
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,527
The fur needs to get done here,
man.

18
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:37,829
Ben bit off more
than he can chew.

19
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:38,830
You okay?

20
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,865
It's getting worse.
It just sucks.

21
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:43,501
When Barney has nightmares,

22
00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:45,736
this is what it looks like.

23
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,439
In the end, only
one will win a VIP trip

24
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:49,841
from Kryolan Professional
Make-Up

25
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,543
to one of their 85 international
locations,

26
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:55,513
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

27
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:57,615
and $100,000.

28
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:00,985
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

30
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:41,559
This is a pretty low point
for me in the competition.

31
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:44,462
I'm away from my family,
and I miss them so much.

32
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,430
It's starting to take a toll.

33
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:49,200
Being on the bottom
doesn't feel good.

34
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,802
But to win--
because we've made it

35
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:54,071
to the final six,
which is really awesome.

36
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,807
At this point, half of us will
be competing in the finale.

37
00:01:56,842 --> 00:01:58,476
I just want to make it there
so bad.

38
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,877
Whatever challenge
comes up next,

39
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,579
I want to push myself.

40
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:04,215
If it's easy,
then it's not worth $100,000.

41
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,089
It's a nice day at the park.

42
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:13,958
This place is really cool.

43
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:16,827
It's a gorgeous day, and
there's kids running around

44
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:18,362
and a huge playground,

45
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:21,132
and we're not really sure
exactly what we're doing here,

46
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:24,702
but I don't think it's just to
go play on the swing set.

47
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,238
This is cool.

48
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,474
Welcome to Brookside Park
in Pasadena.

49
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,711
Every year, movie studios spend
millions of dollars

50
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:36,881
on Hollywood's top writers,
producers, and directors

51
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:39,383
to conjure mind-blowing
action sequences,

52
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,118
spectacular fantasy worlds,

53
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:42,320
and over-the-top characters

54
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:44,622
to entertain people
all over the globe.

55
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:46,691
Now, while these incredible
individuals

56
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,826
are some of
the world's most creative minds,

57
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,997
nothing compares
to the innocent originality

58
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:56,100
and raw imagination of a child.

59
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,502
- Oh, my God.
- I love it.

60
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,504
Hey, guys.
Come on over.

61
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,939
- Kids.
- Oh, my God.

62
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,176
Oh, man.

63
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,711
Come on in here.

64
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:07,912
There you go.

65
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:09,213
How are you guys doing?

66
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:10,381
Good!

67
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,616
You ready to have some fun
today?

68
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,217
Yes!

69
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,119
All right, so
as you may have guessed,

70
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,688
you'll be working
with these amazing kids today.

71
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:20,358
I love kids, but I
have no idea what's coming.

72
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:24,228
This can be very fun,
or it can be a total nightmare.

73
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:27,298
Sometimes, a child's
imagination can be so powerful

74
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,200
that they can see
and hear things

75
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:30,401
that you and I just can't.

76
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,737
So in this Spotlight Challenge,

77
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:36,374
you're going to work with one
of these creative visionaries

78
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,376
and bring their imaginary
friends to life

79
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,478
as a whimsical character.

80
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,746
Yes!

81
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,681
I am super excited about this.

82
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:45,683
Kids-- they don't have
boundaries.

83
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:47,551
This is creativity
at its rawest form.

84
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,220
Oh, my gosh.

85
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:51,055
Oh, and one more thing.

86
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:54,158
These guys are gonna be coming
to the reveal stage this week

87
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,961
to see how you've brought
their special friends to life.

88
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:58,496
So no pressure.

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,964
Oh, gosh.

90
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:01,232
Okay, kids, when I say "Go,"

91
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,933
I want you to run over
and pick a contestant.

92
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:03,934
You got it?

93
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:06,437
Yeah!

94
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,472
All right, go get a contestant!

95
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:11,776
How are you?

96
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,810
What's up?

97
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:14,078
- Adam.
- Lance.

98
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,479
- Why don't we go over there?
- Okay.

99
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,181
Let's go draw something.
You ready?

100
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,182
- Yeah.
- Come on, buddy.

101
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,483
Holy cow.

102
00:04:21,453 --> 00:04:22,420
We're both gonna draw it.

103
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:24,055
Oh.

104
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,657
Alexandra is an
adorable little blonde girl.

105
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,659
And I'm wanting to do
a monster.

106
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,494
So I'm looking at her
with hopeful eyes, like,

107
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:31,729
"What do you want,
Alexandra?"

108
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:33,764
My imaginary thing
is a mermaid.

109
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,999
A mermaid.

110
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:37,234
Shit.

111
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:39,770
Hm.

112
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:42,006
Of course.
Mermaid.

113
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,808
She has a pink tail.

114
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:46,377
Alexandra's mermaid
has a very pink tail

115
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,013
with scales
that are glowing hearts

116
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:51,649
and a heart-shaped bracelet.

117
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,519
That's, like, kind of pink.

118
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:57,355
Or there's a pink here...

119
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,223
I've never had the color pink
in my airbrush,

120
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,192
but when a little girl
asks you to do a mermaid,

121
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:03,094
you do a mermaid.

122
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:05,429
Oh, I know another
thing we can do to her--

123
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:06,831
her pet dolphin.

124
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:08,833
Do you know how many
days I have to do this?

125
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,868
- Nevermind.
- No pet dolphins.

126
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:12,203
Crazy.

127
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,040
- Its name's Lulu.
- Lulu?

128
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,174
I love that name.

129
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:20,745
It can be a bunny,
and it's super cute.

130
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,114
Maya is adorable.

131
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,982
I love everything about Maya.

132
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:26,717
She's my best friend.

133
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:29,754
My concept for
Maya's imaginary friend Lulu

134
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:34,024
is a stuffed animal
that helps inspire creativity.

135
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:35,426
I can't wait to start on this.

136
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,927
It's gonna be so much fun.

137
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,462
You're awesome, Maya.

138
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,030
Thanks.
You are too.

139
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:41,132
Thanks.

140
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:45,936
All right,
so he's got horns, right?

141
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,572
Yeah, he's kind of
like a giant alligator.

142
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,107
And he just has two legs,

143
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,976
and he breathes out fire,

144
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,878
and he has lasers
all over his eyes.

145
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,880
Also, it has wings,

146
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,314
like a dragon wings.

147
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,750
Lance has a long list
of everything he wants

148
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:00,751
in a monster,

149
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:02,620
but I know
I can't make everything.

150
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,323
And the monster's name is Laser

151
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,324
or Godzilla.

152
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,526
Or Godzilla.

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,195
Okay, so what if we spell it
like "La-zor."

154
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,630
Great.

155
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:16,967
I envision Lazor as
a creature responsible

156
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,102
for missing toys.

157
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:19,170
So for this character,

158
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,672
I'm going to fabricate
a lower jaw

159
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,374
coming from the model's chest

160
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:26,510
and then do a whole upper jaw
and a head.

161
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:28,979
This isn't
a heavy makeup character.

162
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,515
And it's gonna involve
a lot of suit fabrication,

163
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,584
so I'm worried about,
it may put me on the bottom.

164
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:35,453
You gonna be a designer
when you grow up?

165
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,788
I was more thinking of a model.

166
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,190
Oh, well, that's always--

167
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,191
A muscleman model.

168
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,525
That's cool.

169
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,161
So her head's,
like, a big real diamond.

170
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,396
Okay.

171
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,098
Because her skin,
it looks like sparkles.

172
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,633
And she lives underground.

173
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,168
Okay.

174
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,803
She has a purse that
she always takes with her.

175
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:54,872
- Her shoes are like high heels.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:58,776
Jordyn tells me a lot
of information very quickly,

177
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,612
so I just started writing a list
as fast as I can.

178
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:03,113
Now, you said
she has a diamond head.

179
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,748
Yeah.

180
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,251
Jordyn's imaginary
friend has curly hair,

181
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:08,385
black buttons for eyes,

182
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,920
wears a sparkly pink dress,

183
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,456
but the thing that's making me
the most nervous right now

184
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,692
is this sparkly blue
diamond face.

185
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,829
Diamonds are translucent,

186
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:20,764
and you can't make
a person see-through.

187
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,833
It looks like a diamond.

188
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:24,101
Nice and sparkly too.

189
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:25,903
Perfect.

190
00:07:25,937 --> 00:07:28,539
Ben, you have
to make it like me.

191
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,442
Look at mine.
See how mine are shaped?

192
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:34,178
Blayne has the biggest
imagination ever

193
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:36,714
and wants everything
on this creature.

194
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,516
How many heads does he have?

195
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,050
- Three.
- Three heads?

196
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,285
- Yep.
- Big heads?

197
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,820
The size of your head.

198
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:44,522
Oh, and one has horns.

199
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,591
He wants three heads,
wings on the head.

200
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:48,859
One of them has horns,

201
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,594
and the other one has one eye.

202
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,162
He wants it to have a tail,

203
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:53,597
no legs,

204
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:55,599
and walks around on its arms.

205
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,901
I have to kind of remind him

206
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,602
that I got to put a person
inside this thing.

207
00:07:58,637 --> 00:07:59,803
It has to fly!

208
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,038
Fly?

209
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:02,606
We have to see him walk out
on the stage.

210
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,607
Nope.

211
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:04,942
This is a tall order,

212
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,777
and I'm not sure
how I'm gonna get away with it.

213
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm not done.

214
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,352
Andrew is a wild kid.

215
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:18,556
He's doing backflips, and
I can't even keep up with him.

216
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,258
He's like a B-boy,
but he's half zombie.

217
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,060
The rest of the face is, like,
all ripped up.

218
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,528
Okay. Awesome.

219
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:25,896
I like where this is going.

220
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:26,964
What's B-boy?

221
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,632
It's like a type of dancing,
but...

222
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,633
Like break dancing?

223
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:30,701
Yeah, break dancing,

224
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,036
but they call it B-boying.

225
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,070
Okay.

226
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:35,072
Andrew's imaginary friend
B-boy Z

227
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,907
is half-zombie, half-human.

228
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:40,377
He wants him to be bloody,
with his heart exposed,

229
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:41,946
and have a mohawk.

230
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,781
I really dig
his imaginary friend.

231
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,782
That's my style.

232
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,783
Cool.

233
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,784
We done?

234
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,886
I think we're good.

235
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,187
Bye!

236
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:51,889
That was so much fun.

237
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:00,898
I love the energy from the park,

238
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,767
and ready to get into the lab
and try new things.

239
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:05,336
Can't wait to grab another wig.

240
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,171
I'm sure they're
gonna love that.

241
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:08,906
From what the judges
have said in the past,

242
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,374
I need to start
breaking up my makeups

243
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,042
so they don't look the same.

244
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:13,444
So I'm gonna use a wig.

245
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:14,912
I just have to get more subtle.

246
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:16,180
This is the one.

247
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:19,283
And I come up with the idea
to flock my rabbit.

248
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,285
This is all flocking?
Yes.

249
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,355
Flocking is basically
tiny bits of fabric.

250
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:26,357
I want to glue it on my pieces

251
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,192
so when you touch it,
it's velvet.

252
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,494
But before I start
sculpting anything,

253
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,130
I want to test out my idea.

254
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:36,433
So I grab just a random
foam latex prosthetic,

255
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,835
and I paint it with Pros-Aide,

256
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,404
I cover it with the flocking,
and then brush it away.

257
00:09:40,438 --> 00:09:42,239
And it has that velvet texture.

258
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:48,412
Hey, what's up?

259
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:49,413
Good afternoon, guys.

260
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:50,481
Hey.

261
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:51,882
Hey, it's getting quiet in here.

262
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:52,883
What kid did you get?

263
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:54,618
I got this kid named Andrew.

264
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,053
He wants B-boy Z.

265
00:09:56,087 --> 00:09:57,721
It stands for
B-boy Zombie.

266
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:00,124
But he wanted,
like,<i> Walking Dead</i> zombie.

267
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,226
I'm all for it, but...

268
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,560
Um...

269
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:05,529
I'm instantly worried.

270
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,298
Uh, let's see here.

271
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,167
The heartbeat is exposed
and bleeding?

272
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,402
That's what he was saying.

273
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,237
I love gory characters too,

274
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:17,541
but the challenge is to make
a kid-friendly character.

275
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:22,046
And if Julian comes out
with a realistic zombie,

276
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,982
he's guaranteed to go home.

277
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,988
I think this kid just wanted,

278
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,523
like, a break dancing zombie.

279
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:35,125
It's the first day of
the imaginary friend challenge,

280
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,895
and Laura is concerned
about my design.

281
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,097
It's your responsibility
as a designer

282
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:43,567
to take that concept
and expand on it.

283
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,402
It's coming across too gruesome.

284
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,937
This is pretty daunting.

285
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:49,606
I'm not used to doing
whimsical at all.

286
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:52,943
There was a challenge
just like this in Season 3

287
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:55,112
where we had kids come in.

288
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:56,880
And these kids
had so many ideas.

289
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:01,318
In Season 3, Rod ended up doing
exactly what the child wanted,

290
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:02,920
and he got kicked off for it.

291
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,055
And I don't want to see
the same thing happen to Julian.

292
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,924
We got to bring it
into a concept

293
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,826
that's fun to look at.

294
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,661
We decide to make some changes.

295
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,863
Instead of just
a plain hair mohawk,

296
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:15,065
we decide to go
with a bone mohawk.

297
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,367
Instead of splitting the zombie
straight down the middle,

298
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,069
make it asymmetrical.

299
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:20,938
But I'm a little worried
that this is straying

300
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,774
a little too far away
from what Andrew wants,

301
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,043
and I don't want
to disappoint him.

302
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,711
All right, let's do this.

303
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,479
Yeah, just go for it.

304
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:35,085
- How you doing, man?
- Good.

305
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,954
So he's got three heads, huh?

306
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,455
And he can move his heads
up and--

307
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,224
He can go like this
with his heads.

308
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:41,992
Ben is the
last person on my team,

309
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:43,694
and I can see Ben in the finale.

310
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:46,597
He's one of the best sculptors
in this competition.

311
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,498
So you have to sculpt
three different faces.

312
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,602
There's gonna be two heads
that are actually on the arms.

313
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:55,272
Then there's gonna be a big head
that sits over the model's head.

314
00:11:55,306 --> 00:11:58,976
And since Blayne wants
this character to have no legs,

315
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,178
I'm gonna have my model
on his knees.

316
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:02,546
Do you think
you can pull it off?

317
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,680
Yeah.

318
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:05,282
I am worried about Ben
on this challenge,

319
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:06,383
going this big.

320
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,119
I think this is
crazy enough to work.

321
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:11,388
This is a huge undertaking.

322
00:12:11,422 --> 00:12:12,623
I get it.

323
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:14,958
I know everything
that I'm risking here.

324
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:16,526
Rather than sculpting the head,

325
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,562
I decided
to fabricate the chest,

326
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:20,163
because the shape of the chest

327
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,566
is gonna dictate
the shape of the head.

328
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,401
So I decide to leave
all the sculpting

329
00:12:24,435 --> 00:12:25,669
and molding for day two.

330
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:28,805
So I start working on the body.

331
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,541
I create a simple chest harness.

332
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,844
From there, I grab foam padding,

333
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,513
and I start gluing
and pinching it

334
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:41,151
to actually build up the overall
silhouette of the character.

335
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:44,488
Once that's done,
I coat the foam in latex

336
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:47,991
so I can start adding paper
towels and more latex over it

337
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:50,761
and make all the pinch points
look like muscles under skin.

338
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,930
That's his lower jaw.

339
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:56,033
Yeah, the whole head
is gonna be a mouth.

340
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,601
Hi, everybody.

341
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:58,602
Hey!

342
00:12:58,636 --> 00:12:59,603
Hello.

343
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:00,938
Alexandra named it Bella.

344
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:02,606
It's a mermaid.

345
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,475
She wants coral reef
embedded in her skin,

346
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,444
which is difficult
to make beautiful.

347
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:09,112
This is coral,
what you're doing here?

348
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,247
Correct, yes.

349
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:11,915
I'm thinking of whether
you actually need

350
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,283
this right here in the center.

351
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:14,518
It's really not attractive.

352
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,286
Mr. Westmore
is absolutely right.

353
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,754
My model has a very pretty face,

354
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:21,291
and to sculpt something over it
is really just unnecessary.

355
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:22,693
Oh, Blayne even
did you a sketch.

356
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,461
You don't even have
to worry about anything.

357
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,929
That's right.

358
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:27,631
Now, how are you
going to paint your eyes?

359
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:28,732
I'll paint the detail over,

360
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,300
and then put a shine to it.

361
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:31,735
If you have a black iris,

362
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,270
put a dot of highlight into it,

363
00:13:33,304 --> 00:13:36,373
because I know judges
haven't really liked it.

364
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:37,841
So spend time

365
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,444
and really concentrate
on your eyeballs.

366
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:41,812
What did Andrew come up with?

367
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:45,048
He wanted
a zombie break-dancer.

368
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,250
He's a big fan of the scary,

369
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,719
but I'm also trying
to translate it

370
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:50,854
into more whimsical look.

371
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,189
The only way you're gonna get

372
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:53,557
any whimsical in here at all

373
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:56,026
is to really give
yourself a good smile...

374
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,027
Smile, mm-hmm.

375
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,028
...on your lower piece.

376
00:13:58,062 --> 00:13:59,062
I mean, if it's too--

377
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:00,664
The higher up
and the straighter it gets,

378
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,833
it's gonna be come more horror

379
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,835
than it is whimsical
or fantasy.

380
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:07,871
- This was her drawing.
- Oh, my gosh.

381
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,507
The character
has buttons for eyes.

382
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,342
And Laura had a great idea

383
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:14,011
of using glasses,

384
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:16,413
and then fabricating buttons.

385
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:18,315
Could be the rims
with the handle.

386
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:19,916
Oh, that would be cute.

387
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:21,251
That could be too, yeah.

388
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,920
Button eyes tend to be
a little creepy-looking,

389
00:14:23,955 --> 00:14:25,589
but Jordyn was pretty specific.

390
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:28,759
And so I don't want
to scrap it completely.

391
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,494
To make this
nice and whimsical,

392
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:31,661
those buttons need to be big.

393
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,363
Definitely.

394
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:35,298
But that's a good
idea on a stick like that.

395
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,333
Yeah.

396
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,667
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye!

397
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,078
That's time, everyone.

398
00:14:57,955 --> 00:15:00,257
So it's day two of our
imaginary friend challenge,

399
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,025
Got 9 1/2 hours
in the lab today,

400
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,927
and I've got a whole bunch
of stuff

401
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:04,928
that I got to get finished.

402
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,630
Ready to release your
inner child today?

403
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:08,198
I start working
on the main head.

404
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:09,433
I need to mold these bastards

405
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:11,802
within, like,
the first hour and a half.

406
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:13,170
I need to get
this thing finished

407
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,771
so that I can mold
all three of these

408
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:16,206
at the same time.

409
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,513
Her legs will be inside.

410
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,182
I see Logan's mermaid tail,

411
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,317
and it's really ugly.

412
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:29,319
Did you have to make it
really bulky right here

413
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:30,587
to make it work?

414
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,556
It's just this really weird,
blocky form

415
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,857
with duct tape around it.

416
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,692
It can't be that;
like, it just can't.

417
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,327
It's gonna look awful.

418
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:39,529
Rayce points out
that it's bulky,

419
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,198
which I completely agree with.

420
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,667
So I have to start over.

421
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,402
You can take that
and kind of twist it.

422
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:46,803
The new design for the tail

423
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:48,872
is a little bit more shapely
than the one I had before.

424
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,174
It's a combination
of cutting out foam,

425
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,810
cutting out strips
of armature wire

426
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:56,179
to create some structure
and some strength.

427
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:58,081
And it's starting
to come together.

428
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,950
Oh, they're hearts.

429
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:01,351
So cute.

430
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,592
I'm going to sculpt the cowl

431
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:12,295
and leave the big rabbit ears
tied back into the hair

432
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,731
so I can glue down a wig.

433
00:16:17,502 --> 00:16:19,402
Sculpting is just repetitive,

434
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,072
and it's-- now I'm stuck
in my own thoughts.

435
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,907
And I just start thinking
about my family.

436
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,776
These challenges are
getting really difficult.

437
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,078
Mm-hmm.

438
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,247
I really miss my family.

439
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,715
Mm.

440
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:34,451
I don't know; it just sucks.

441
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:36,853
I'm just--
I'm crying sculpting.

442
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:38,855
And it's getting worse.

443
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:44,327
You okay?

444
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:46,897
You need to take a minute?

445
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:49,300
_

446
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,034
It is really, really difficult.

447
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,440
I walk outside, and I don't
want to walk back in.

448
00:17:06,574 --> 00:17:08,551
_

449
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,031
It's day two in the lab,

450
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,068
and Emily is very much
missing her family,

451
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,504
so I'm worried for her.

452
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:23,141
_

453
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,767
_

454
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:26,820
_

455
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:27,748
_

456
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:28,841
_

457
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,050
This competition
is so important to me,

458
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,353
and I've worked so hard
to be here.

459
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,722
So I come back in,
and I'm ready

460
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,458
to put my full effort
into everything

461
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,527
and get out of this funk.

462
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,929
I cried it out.

463
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,697
I'm not gonna give up.

464
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,238
I finish the faces.

465
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:54,174
Gonna run them into the molder
as fast as possible

466
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,276
so I can start molding them
in Hydrocal.

467
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,279
Hydrocal sets up faster,
and the heads are huge,

468
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,648
so I'm gonna do them
at the same time.

469
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:03,082
And I've got three of them,

470
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:05,752
so this is quite a task
in and of itself.

471
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:06,753
What's up?

472
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:07,754
Just setting up.

473
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,255
Yeah, you're good, though.

474
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,524
Having Anthony's full
attention is really great.

475
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,859
We're gonna work
as hard as we can

476
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,462
to make sure that we both stay
here for as long as possible.

477
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,530
Get underneath
that chin a little bit.

478
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:18,998
Smooth that down a little bit.

479
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:25,672
Adios, guys.

480
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:26,739
Good luck.

481
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,377
After I get the mold done,

482
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:32,912
the rest of the day will be
figuring out

483
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,515
how to fabricate
this crystal collar piece.

484
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:39,586
I've never really done
fabrication before,

485
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,523
so I'm not really sure
exactly what I'm doing.

486
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:46,025
I start hot-gluing
the crystals,

487
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,328
and then I place cotton
and latex

488
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,597
so that it looks as though
the crystals

489
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,632
are coming out of her skin.

490
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,901
I'm just using all the advice
that Laura gave me,

491
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,669
and I'm figuring it out
as I go.

492
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:57,670
Looks good, Darla.

493
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,906
Thanks.

494
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,609
I love the teeth, love them.

495
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:04,110
I'm a little worried,

496
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,746
because there's still a lot
I have to fabricate and paint.

497
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,216
And I'm not going to get my head
until application day,

498
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:13,620
so I won't know if it really
fits until the last minute.

499
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:18,324
How many minutes does it say?

500
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,626
I think we're under ten,

501
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,693
but I can't read it.

502
00:19:20,728 --> 00:19:21,895
Seven, it's at seven.

503
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,496
Sure, that sounds about right.

504
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:30,403
All right, everybody,
that's time.

505
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,673
Now that I'm so close
to top five,

506
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:36,075
like, now I got
to really go for it,

507
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,378
and I'm trying to do that
on this challenge.

508
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:47,453
Oh, gosh, here we go.

509
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,889
It's application day,
and we have four hours to apply

510
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,658
and one hour Last Looks.

511
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,726
Ah, fuck.

512
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:55,461
And the first thing I see

513
00:19:55,496 --> 00:19:57,897
is a big chunk of my ear
just taken out.

514
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:00,300
Oh, no, my foam.

515
00:20:00,334 --> 00:20:01,568
You can fix this.

516
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:02,669
Yeah.

517
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,137
You just have
to glue it together,

518
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,738
and then you can
cotton in latex,

519
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,407
and then cavo.

520
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:08,575
I just have so much to do,

521
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:12,211
and this is just
taking time out to fix this.

522
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:14,747
It'll take maybe half and hour
more of your time.

523
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:15,748
Yeah.

524
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:17,750
But it's worth it.

525
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,289
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

526
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,706
_

527
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,126
You're a big-ass monster.

528
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,161
That's for sure.

529
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,000
Fuck.

530
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,101
Awesome.

531
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,703
- All right, ready for these?
- Yeah.

532
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:40,239
Today I have
to run the polyfoam heads,

533
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:43,076
and then I got to create
an entire foam suit,

534
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,510
and then cover it in fur.

535
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:48,047
There's just so much to do
that it's just mind-blowing.

536
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,849
What are you gonna do
about the wings?

537
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,821
_

538
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:53,953
If you want, lay them out

539
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:56,022
and tell your model
to glue them for you.

540
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,825
Ben's running around
multitasking like a madman.

541
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,627
The furnies get done
here, man, seriously.

542
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,128
Why-- You gonna sit in it?

543
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:03,363
What?

544
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:05,598
- I need somebody in it.
- I'll sit in it.

545
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,467
As a coach, I can't
do the work for him.

546
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,536
So his model helps him
fabricate things,

547
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:13,606
and I'll just be
in the suit all day.

548
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:15,675
You look good in this.

549
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,511
Why do I feel like a king?

550
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:23,549
As it sits right now,
it's very much

551
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,418
like this is a chest plate

552
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,854
that just happens to look
like a bottom jaw.

553
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,489
The only unique thing
about my design

554
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,291
is this giant mouth
opening and closing.

555
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,926
The closer you bring
this to his head,

556
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,695
maybe there's, like,
a little bit of batting

557
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,363
to kind of pull this up
on the back.

558
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:40,199
If that doesn't work,
my concept is shit.

559
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:46,839
This is gonna be
a weird piece to apply.

560
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,708
The appliance
covers her entire face,

561
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,443
but then there's a big hole
in the center,

562
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,445
so there's definitely some edges
around the mouth

563
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,213
that I'm gonna have
to worry about.

564
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:57,517
There's only six of us left,
so one little mistake

565
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:59,485
could end up putting you
on the bottom.

566
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:02,388
Awesome.

567
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,724
I'm amazed at how
well this lined up right here.

568
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,193
Yeah, that's great.

569
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:10,763
I'm a little torn about which
way to go with the paint job,

570
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,032
but I decide to go
more realistic,

571
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:16,936
just because the sculpt
is already so cartoony.

572
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,839
If I go with more of
the bright purples and reds

573
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:22,041
that Andrew was asking for,

574
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:25,078
it may not read as a zombie.

575
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:26,245
30 minutes, guys.

576
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,048
30 minutes, Ben.

577
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:39,258
This is the biggest
thing that I've ever created,

578
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:41,594
and I'm not even sure
how this thing's gonna turn out.

579
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:43,096
Do you want one of these wigs?

580
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,664
Yeah, just throw
them both in there.

581
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,666
Ben is going into Last Looks

582
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,468
with a week's worth of work

583
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:50,002
that he has to complete
in an hour.

584
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,504
That's time, everybody!

585
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,940
He definitely bit off more than
he can chew on this challenge.

586
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:56,976
And I didn't quite see a way
to rein it back in.

587
00:22:57,978 --> 00:22:59,278
Is that sweat?

588
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:00,580
Yeah.

589
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:02,281
I don't think I've ever been
this terrified

590
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:03,382
in this competition.

591
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,138
This is weird.
Never been on this side.

592
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:13,940
Trying to get you situated.

593
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:15,975
My model has absolutely
nothing on him,

594
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:18,010
so I need to start
buttoning everything up.

595
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:20,846
I'm using hot glue guns,
safety pins,

596
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:23,115
everything I can to start
gluing this fun fur down.

597
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,087
I grab some Kryolan
colored hair spray

598
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:31,357
and start blending the colors
and painting some polka dots.

599
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:34,961
It makes the fun fur
look appropriate, not so solid.

600
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:39,699
Makeup, makeup.

601
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:41,934
I am not terribly experienced
with beauty makeup.

602
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:44,103
Like, if you put
something, like, right here,

603
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:46,205
it gives it, like,
a different effect.

604
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,540
I'm getting advice
from my model,

605
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:49,675
and it seems to be working.

606
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,511
I still have to zombify
B-boy Z's hands.

607
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:56,482
So I rush to get everything
glued down and painted

608
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:57,683
as fast as I can.

609
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:59,218
Ten minutes, everybody.

610
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:09,462
It's time!

611
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:15,067
This thing is not finished,

612
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:17,303
and I'm afraid
this could end badly

613
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:19,205
for both me and Anthony.

614
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:30,182
Oh, my gosh.
They're so cute.

615
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:32,551
Welcome back
to the reveal stage.

616
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:33,652
You remember these guys.

617
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:34,987
Oh, yeah.

618
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:37,023
Are you guys excited
to see your imaginary friends?

619
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:38,357
Yeah!

620
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:39,658
Me too!

621
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:42,094
But before we see them,
I want you guys

622
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:44,397
to all go stand with the artist
that you worked with.

623
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:46,799
Come on, Maya.

624
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,567
How are you doing?

625
00:24:48,602 --> 00:24:49,568
Hi!

626
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,404
- How are you?
- Good.

627
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:55,541
All right, guys,
before we see your creations,

628
00:24:55,575 --> 00:24:57,510
let's say hello to our judges.

629
00:24:57,544 --> 00:24:59,879
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

630
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:00,880
Glenn Hetrick.

631
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:01,881
Good evening, guys.

632
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:03,015
- Good evening.
- Hello.

633
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,284
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

634
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:06,719
Hi, everybody.

635
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:08,187
Hello.

636
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:10,890
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

637
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:11,891
Hi, kids.

638
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,325
Hi!

639
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,494
Okay, this week
your Spotlight Challenge

640
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:17,430
was to work with these
adorable kids

641
00:25:17,464 --> 00:25:19,865
and help bring their
imaginary friends to life,

642
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,834
so let's take a look
at your creations.

643
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,069
You ready?

644
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:24,336
Ready.

645
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:46,926
It's not the
cleanest makeup I've done,

646
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,594
so I don't think I'm on top,

647
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:50,396
but I'm thinking
I'm in a good place

648
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,064
for the sheer fact
that the kids

649
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,766
are enjoying the character
so much.

650
00:26:12,786 --> 00:26:14,920
Jordyn's eyes just light up,

651
00:26:14,955 --> 00:26:16,622
and I'm really happy
with the character.

652
00:26:16,656 --> 00:26:19,325
I think she looks beautiful,
and she does sparkle.

653
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,026
It's amazing.

654
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:42,114
I wish I had more
time for this makeup,

655
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:44,183
'cause I know I could have
done a lot more with it,

656
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:45,718
but I am happy with it.

657
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:48,921
And I really, really,
really hope Maya likes it.

658
00:26:57,464 --> 00:26:58,931
- Looks good.
- Yeah?

659
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,209
He's like a monster.

660
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:11,744
It's funny, right?

661
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,448
I'm not happy with it,

662
00:27:16,483 --> 00:27:19,218
but Blayne's really excited
to have the three heads.

663
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:21,854
I did a lot of work
within these last two days.

664
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:23,722
Hopefully that'll be
the thing that saves me.

665
00:27:40,774 --> 00:27:42,641
I think Alexandra's
really liking it,

666
00:27:42,676 --> 00:27:46,312
but for me,
this could either be a winner

667
00:27:46,346 --> 00:27:48,414
or an absolute disaster.

668
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:07,233
I know the judges
aren't always fans of fun fur,

669
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:09,501
but that's the foundation
of my character.

670
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:12,438
And I'm just praying
that he doesn't faint on stage

671
00:28:12,472 --> 00:28:14,540
and horrify a bunch of kids.

672
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:23,249
So what do you guys think?

673
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:24,250
Did they do a good job?

674
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:25,618
Yeah!

675
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:27,453
All right,
well, thank you, kids,

676
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:28,654
for coming to see us tonight.

677
00:28:28,688 --> 00:28:30,689
Go ahead and say good-bye
to your artists.

678
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:31,991
Give me a hug.

679
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:34,893
Bye, guys.

680
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,733
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look

681
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:42,434
at the imaginary friends?

682
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:51,944
I'm confused.

683
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:53,579
Can you turn that way for me?

684
00:28:53,613 --> 00:28:55,914
I'd just like to see this side.

685
00:28:55,949 --> 00:28:57,983
He's got a great profile.

686
00:28:58,018 --> 00:29:02,388
It seems really... pointless,
for lack of a better word.

687
00:29:04,024 --> 00:29:05,524
Nice bling.

688
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:07,559
You can tell
that this is Darla's work,

689
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:10,529
because she does this thing
with these bone lines.

690
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:12,931
I think this is cool,
the way she did that treatment

691
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,134
where she had all the crystals
coming out of her.

692
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,302
This is a tough challenge.

693
00:29:16,336 --> 00:29:17,603
It is.

694
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:21,440
If you imagine this
on a Saturday morning

695
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:22,741
sort of variety show,

696
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:24,076
I think it works really well.

697
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,344
This would have been
a good week

698
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:27,613
for her to do one of her
really fabulous big hairdos

699
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:28,947
with the ears up in it.

700
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:31,508
_

701
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:33,152
I'm very nervous,

702
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:35,454
because I love this character,

703
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:38,157
but all these makeups on stage
are awesome,

704
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,225
and I have no idea
where I stand.

705
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:46,231
Tell us who made your favorite
imaginary friend

706
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,901
tonight on Twitter
using hashtag #FaceOff

707
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,438
This would have been
a good week

708
00:29:54,472 --> 00:29:56,673
for her to do one of her
really fabulous big hairdos

709
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,275
with the ears up in it.

710
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:00,444
She challenged herself
to find a different shape.

711
00:30:00,478 --> 00:30:03,447
I actually love
that the ears sweep back.

712
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:06,273
_

713
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:07,484
I'm very nervous,

714
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,586
because I have no idea
where I stand.

715
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,788
I'm scared.

716
00:30:12,757 --> 00:30:14,491
Well, hello.

717
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,794
Who do we talk to?

718
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,896
I do love the palette of this.

719
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,699
The biggest problem is
the one-dimensional paint job.

720
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:25,235
It looks like he didn't
finish painting the eyes.

721
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:32,943
I love all the shapes.

722
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,478
It's really quite incredible.

723
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:36,980
I think that the colors
are simplified

724
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:38,449
to make it say,
"little kid."

725
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,117
And these shapes
are so gorgeous.

726
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:44,655
Mm-hmm.

727
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,094
I don't think this is sculpted.

728
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:52,296
Does that look sculpted?

729
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,831
That's sculpted, but this is

730
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:55,265
something fabricated with latex.

731
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,667
It's really good.

732
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,502
Look at the color in there.

733
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:00,137
In two days?

734
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:03,140
This is a crazy amount
of work to have done.

735
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,680
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

736
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:11,548
Let's find out
what they thought.

737
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,850
Emily.

738
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,519
Logan.

739
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:19,523
Congratulations,
because you are safe this week

740
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:21,492
and can head
back to the makeup room.

741
00:31:21,493 --> 00:31:22,633
Thanks.

742
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:28,866
All right, that means
the rest of you

743
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,767
were the best and the worst
this week.

744
00:31:30,802 --> 00:31:32,636
And the judges
would like to speak with you

745
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,137
to find out more
about your work.

746
00:31:34,172 --> 00:31:36,306
Darla, you're up.

747
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:41,411
Hello.

748
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:44,515
Why don't you
start off by telling us

749
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,284
how your child informed
your decisions in creating this.

750
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:48,619
Her imaginary friend

751
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:51,121
has a sparkly blue diamond face

752
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:53,357
and black buttons for eyes.

753
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:57,427
I wanted to incorporate
as much of what Jordyn wanted.

754
00:31:57,462 --> 00:32:00,998
And this is the first time
I've really fabricated anything.

755
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:03,467
So I'm really happy with it.

756
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,068
I'm happy with it too.

757
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:09,673
I really like your integration
of the diamond concept.

758
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:12,576
You really got the vibe
of this challenge

759
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,412
and did a great job
putting your skills to use

760
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:17,047
and coming up with something
that fit.

761
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,181
Thank you so much.

762
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:19,816
That was a really clever way

763
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:22,185
to create the button effect
with those glasses.

764
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,988
I love the crushed stones
that you put on her chest,

765
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:27,558
intermingled with your crystals
jutting out.

766
00:32:27,592 --> 00:32:29,426
And when she's done
with all of her diamonds,

767
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,328
she can bring them
on over to my house,

768
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:33,764
and I'd be very
happy about that.

769
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:35,732
The fabrication is great.

770
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:38,835
The implicit collar
with these crystalline forms

771
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,836
is beautiful.

772
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:41,004
It frames her nice.

773
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,239
And the wig is a great choice
to go with,

774
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:43,473
because it keeps her beautiful.

775
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:44,708
Very solid character.

776
00:32:44,742 --> 00:32:45,809
Thank you.

777
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:47,778
Darla, please step back.

778
00:32:47,812 --> 00:32:48,879
Thank you.

779
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,719
Ben, please step to the center.

780
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:02,893
Would you please tell us
what Blayne asked you for

781
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,828
when he described his friend?

782
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:07,931
Blayne asked
for a flying character

783
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:12,669
with three heads,
no legs, and a tail.

784
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:17,040
I tried to go
as cartoonish as possible.

785
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:20,043
I think you certainly
got that part down.

786
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:22,846
Unfortunately,
I think your main head

787
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,982
is very one-dimensional.

788
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:27,851
I'm really disappointed,

789
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:29,886
because his eyes
are not finished.

790
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:32,022
His paint job's not finished.

791
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:34,558
It's lackluster this week.

792
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:38,562
Where you may have gone wrong
is actually trying to do

793
00:33:38,596 --> 00:33:41,064
exactly what
the client specified.

794
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:46,036
This ends up being three very
simple carnival masks on limbs,

795
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,604
and nothing more.

796
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,040
You simply took on
too much work.

797
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:52,943
By the time you've sculpted
and molded three heads,

798
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:56,380
there's very little time
to concentrate on the quality.

799
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:59,483
Ben, if you'd please step down.

800
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,892
Adam, please step forward.

801
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,502
So tell us how Lance motivated
this character for you.

802
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:22,372
Lance wanted wings, six arms,
two horns, giant monster.

803
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:23,840
He wanted to name it Godzilla,

804
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,276
but I explained what copyright
infringement was, so...

805
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:30,914
So his name is Lazor.

806
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:33,116
He's a junkyard monster
that eats toys.

807
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:36,086
And as he eats more,
he grows larger and larger.

808
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,489
This was a very smart
direction to take it.

809
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:42,592
Using head movement
to get this giant animation

810
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:45,429
was very successful.

811
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:49,633
When Barney has nightmares,
this is what it looks like.

812
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:52,402
It's a very difficult thing
to utilize your skills

813
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:54,104
and give us all the things
we're looking for

814
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:56,373
while trying to make it
look childlike.

815
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:59,142
And you did that so wonderfully
and to such great effect.

816
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:00,277
Thank you.

817
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:02,012
The paint on the chest,

818
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:04,815
all the translucent colors,
so well done.

819
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:06,983
I love the
different-sized teeth.

820
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:08,685
It's really imaginative.

821
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,820
Great job, honey.

822
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,455
Thank you so much.

823
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:13,190
Adam, you can step back.

824
00:35:18,563 --> 00:35:20,163
Julian, you're up.

825
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,172
Tell us how Andrew's ideas

826
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:30,907
helped you create
this character.

827
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:34,144
Andrew wanted me
to make a realistic zombie

828
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:35,912
with half of his face gone,

829
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:37,047
and with a mohawk,

830
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:38,749
and kind of
a hip-hop B-boy.

831
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:41,284
So I had to come
to a happy medium

832
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:44,554
by making this kid-friendly
as well as scary.

833
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:46,656
I'm not terribly thrilled
with this.

834
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,294
It lives in this space
between zombie makeup

835
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,929
and then trying
to make it kid-like.

836
00:35:52,964 --> 00:35:54,164
And it didn't go far enough,

837
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:57,000
so it just ends up
in this design purgatory,

838
00:35:57,034 --> 00:36:00,270
sculpturally
and with the color.

839
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:02,339
I don't believe you did
a good paint job on it.

840
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:04,741
There's not enough delineation
between the sides.

841
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:07,544
It's very murky where you
actually sculpted skin.

842
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:08,979
I know he wanted a zombie,

843
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:11,648
but this doesn't even look
like a zombie to me.

844
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:14,284
There's just some odd
shape choices

845
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:16,520
that don't seem to have
really much purpose,

846
00:36:16,554 --> 00:36:18,221
even just artistically.

847
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:20,924
I just find it confusing
as a concept.

848
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:23,560
Julian, thank you very much.

849
00:36:23,594 --> 00:36:24,594
Please step back.

850
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:25,595
Thanks.

851
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,930
Thank you, guys.

852
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:33,770
Coaches, do you have anything
to say to the judges

853
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:35,305
before they make
their decisions?

854
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,207
Yeah, you know,
Ben's shown you guys

855
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:38,608
some really incredible makeups

856
00:36:38,643 --> 00:36:40,710
with really strong subtleties.

857
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,046
So knowing what he's capable of

858
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,216
would hopefully pass him
on to the next one.

859
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,651
I'm gonna speak out for Julian.

860
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:50,420
I think he went outside his
comfort zone a lot this week.

861
00:36:50,454 --> 00:36:53,056
He did a good job understanding
what the kid wanted

862
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,624
while taking in the notes
that you guys

863
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,259
have been giving him
week after week.

864
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:58,829
And he still has
a lot more to show.

865
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:00,230
Well, thank you, guys.

866
00:37:00,264 --> 00:37:01,665
Please head back
to the makeup room

867
00:37:01,699 --> 00:37:03,033
while the judges deliberate.

868
00:37:08,372 --> 00:37:09,573
All right, judges, let's start

869
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:10,974
with your favorite
looks tonight.

870
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:12,609
Why don't we start
with Darla's work?

871
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:14,177
I think she did
a really great job

872
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:16,046
in translating
what Jordyn asked her to do.

873
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,882
I mean, she had the beautiful
crushed stones on the chest.

874
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,951
The whole thing felt
like it really belonged

875
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:22,853
in a child's film
or a child's video game.

876
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,387
Oh, definitely.

877
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,690
That's really what they're
trying to do in this challenge,

878
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,758
is please the kid
but also please the judges.

879
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,493
And that's so difficult.

880
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:33,196
She's got a
real gift at simple form,

881
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:34,831
plainer shapes.

882
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,099
It's kind of fascinating.

883
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:37,534
All right, let's move on
to Adam.

884
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:38,702
It was really clever,

885
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:40,470
and the paint job was awesome.

886
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:42,505
The head movement
was my favorite thing.

887
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,506
It's very simple.

888
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:44,875
It worked so well.

889
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:47,844
He basically did everything
one man could possibly do

890
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:49,446
within the time that he had.

891
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,248
Adam seemed to really sum up

892
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,483
the overall vision
of a kid character.

893
00:37:53,517 --> 00:37:56,419
It felt like
a full-size, walking toy.

894
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:57,988
Okay, judges, let's move on

895
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:00,924
to our least favorite makeups
this week.

896
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,425
Why don't we start with Ben?

897
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,494
Ben, for the
best reason possible,

898
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:05,962
failed badly.

899
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:08,932
He wanted to please the kid
and to do every single thing,

900
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:11,201
but that literal translation
of every detail

901
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:12,969
is exactly what shot him
in the foot.

902
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:15,005
The design of the yellow head

903
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,074
is so retro,
but not in a good way.

904
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:21,611
The surface of the sculpt
is asymmetric; it's rough.

905
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:23,046
I just don't think he had
enough time

906
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,447
to paint them properly.

907
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:26,917
Let's move on to Julian.

908
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,184
The bone mohawk...

909
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:31,254
These forms are so arbitrary
on his chin,

910
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:32,689
on the back of the neck.

911
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:33,924
I didn't get it.

912
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,258
That is not a zombie.

913
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:37,627
There's nothing about that head
that says zombie to me.

914
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:40,830
It just looks like
a dilapidated mohawk skull.

915
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,465
It never got to childlike.

916
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,368
It just got to basic
and rough and rudimentary.

917
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,304
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

918
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:48,538
Yes, we have.

919
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:50,240
Okay, let's bring them back out.

920
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:02,953
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

921
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:06,389
Darla, we liked the sort of
fantasy path that you took,

922
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:08,191
and we thought that you did
a great job

923
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,260
capturing your child's
imaginary friend

924
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:11,728
in a very graceful way.

925
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:14,264
And Adam, you found a way

926
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,199
to embrace your client's
various wishes

927
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:18,401
but still delivered
a really fun,

928
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:21,104
satisfying,
and cohesive character.

929
00:39:21,138 --> 00:39:23,239
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

930
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:25,342
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

931
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:33,566
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

932
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:35,468
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

933
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:40,006
Adam.

934
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:45,511
You managed to find a way

935
00:39:45,546 --> 00:39:48,514
to deliver on every front
for this challenge.

936
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,515
Job well done.

937
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,217
Thank you so much.

938
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:53,152
I finally won
my first Spotlight Challenge.

939
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:54,287
It feels good.

940
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:56,055
And this is a good way
to enter the top five.

941
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,724
Adam, congratulations.

942
00:39:57,758 --> 00:39:58,891
Thank you.

943
00:39:58,926 --> 00:40:00,893
So, Anthony, because
your last team member

944
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:02,629
is on the bottom tonight,

945
00:40:02,663 --> 00:40:04,964
you could be eliminated as well.

946
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:07,834
So you're gonna stay here
with Ben and Julian.

947
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:10,270
The rest of you can head
back to the makeup room.

948
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:21,347
Ben and Julian,
please step forward.

949
00:40:27,354 --> 00:40:29,622
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

950
00:40:29,657 --> 00:40:32,825
Ben, we appreciate that you
wanted to stay true

951
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,093
to your child's vision,

952
00:40:34,128 --> 00:40:36,229
but you really needed
to streamline those ideas

953
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,598
into something
that you could complete.

954
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:41,434
And Julian,
though the B-boy angle made him

955
00:40:41,468 --> 00:40:42,869
really fun and playful,

956
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:44,871
your attempt
to identify a concept

957
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:48,408
within your child's ideas
fell rather flat.

958
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:50,310
So who is going home tonight?

959
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:52,478
The person going home tonight
is...

960
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,617
Ben.

961
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:00,386
We know how capable you are,

962
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:02,588
but we just didn't
see it this week.

963
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:04,023
Your sculpting and paintwork

964
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:06,959
were both poor and unfinished.

965
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:10,430
Ben, I'm sorry, but that means
you have been eliminated.

966
00:41:10,464 --> 00:41:12,498
Julian, you're safe this week

967
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:14,467
and can head back
to the makeup room.

968
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:21,908
Anthony, I'm so sorry,

969
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:23,776
but Ben was
your last team member,

970
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:26,145
which means you, too,
have been eliminated.

971
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,715
I just want to thank you for
joining us again this season.

972
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:30,016
It's always awesome

973
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,784
to see everything
that you have to offer.

974
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:33,753
Once again,
you did a great job.

975
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:34,921
Thank you so much.

976
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:36,723
Just excited to get a chance
to work with Ben

977
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:38,224
and the other members
of my team.

978
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:41,627
Ben, I think you know that
I'm a huge fan of your talents.

979
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:43,830
You've done some wonderful
things here.

980
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:45,765
I think you're
an amazing artist.

981
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:47,233
You're gonna do just fine, man.

982
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:48,668
Thanks.

983
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:51,971
It's been great having you both
here with us this season.

984
00:41:52,005 --> 00:41:54,140
But if you'd please
head back to the makeup room.

985
00:41:54,174 --> 00:41:55,208
Thank you both.

986
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:57,276
- Thanks, guys.
- Bye.

987
00:41:57,311 --> 00:41:59,312
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

988
00:41:59,346 --> 00:42:00,913
Aw, buddy.

989
00:42:00,948 --> 00:42:02,815
- Sorry, dude.
- It's all right.

990
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,083
I gave it my best shot.

991
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:06,119
I probably went a little bigger
than I should have.

992
00:42:09,456 --> 00:42:10,757
It's me.

993
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,425
Aw, brother.

994
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:13,426
And him.

995
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,427
And me.

996
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:15,995
I'm most bummed not for myself,

997
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,063
but mainly for Ben.

998
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:18,831
He had it in him
to go all the way.

999
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:20,066
You know,
I had a hell of a run,

1000
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,103
going from former Marine,
working on helicopters.

1001
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:25,571
From here on out to the end,

1002
00:42:25,606 --> 00:42:28,841
you know, I know from experience
that it's only gonna get harder.

1003
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:31,878
As long as each person
takes something with them

1004
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:33,312
that they've learned from me,

1005
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:34,847
then I have done my job.

1006
00:42:34,882 --> 00:42:37,884
I'm glad to have learned
a lot from you, actually.

1007
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:40,086
Likewise.

1008
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,187
Yeah, man.

1009
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:42,889
Good run.

1010
00:42:42,923 --> 00:42:44,791
Coach Anthony is the greatest,

1011
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:48,728
and he knew how to push me
in the right direction.

1012
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:50,863
This experience has been crazy.

1013
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:52,331
It's meant a lot to me.

1014
00:42:52,366 --> 00:42:55,367
I put myself out there;
I stuck to my guns.

1015
00:42:55,368 --> 00:42:56,896
I'm just gonna keep doing it.
