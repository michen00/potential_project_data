1
00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:03,134
- Oh, my God.
- This is insane.

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,908
This season,
<i>Face Off</i> has a whole new twist.

3
00:00:09,942 --> 00:00:13,311
Three champions have returned to
coach their own team of artists.

4
00:00:13,345 --> 00:00:15,246
- So let's get moving.
- It's insane.

5
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:18,783
They'll steer their new
proteges toward the finale.

6
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,586
Things are about to get real.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,922
But with a season
full of demanding challenges...

8
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:27,592
I have a big announcement
to make.

9
00:00:27,626 --> 00:00:28,927
I am freaking out.

10
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:31,196
It is complete pandemonium.

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,465
...and a judging panel
filled with the industry's

12
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,667
- brightest stars...
- I think it's so cool.

13
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:39,771
...coming out on top will be
tougher than ever before.

14
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:41,473
What the heck
is happening right now?

15
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:43,942
This competition is nuts.

16
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,343
In the end, only one

17
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,979
will win a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

18
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:51,015
to one of their 85
international locations,

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,918
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

20
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,688
and $100,000.

21
00:00:56,722 --> 00:01:00,091
Find out
how it all begins right now.

22
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,160
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

23
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:05,130

25
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,172
We're in the middle
of downtown LA,

26
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:51,275
and we have no idea
what to expect.

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,877
All of a sudden
these doors open.

28
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:55,079
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:56,114
Wow.

30
00:01:56,148 --> 00:01:58,950
This room is huge.

31
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:00,485
- Ah, man.
- This is insane.

32
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,919
I can't believe this.

33
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:04,989
There's supplies everywhere,
paint, airbrushes,

34
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:06,924
and Kryolan makeup.
It's crazy.

35
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,493
So much stuff to choose from.

36
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:10,761
I can't wait to get started.

37
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:11,896
Hello, everybody.

38
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,498
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

39
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,003
I look up,
and I see McKenzie Westmore

40
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,271
walking down the stairs,

41
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:23,975
and I'm like,
"Oh, my God. This is it."

42
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,612
Hey, guys.

43
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,147
Hi.

44
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:33,562
This season of <i>Face Off</i> is
going to be unlike any before,

45
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:37,900
because the competition
has completely changed.

46
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,504
This season
three former champions

47
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:46,208
will be investing in you guys by
becoming your personal coaches.

48
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:47,343
What?

49
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:50,880
Please welcome
your new champion coaches...

50
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:56,852
Oh, no way.

51
00:02:56,887 --> 00:03:00,022
Season two winner Rayce Bird.

52
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:06,195
Season four winner
Anthony Kosar.

53
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,935
And season three finalist

54
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,504
and season five winner
Laura Tyler.

55
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,211
This is mind-blowing.

56
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,280
I can't wait to work
with these coaches.

57
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:25,848
Deep breath.

58
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:27,283
So how are you guys doing?

59
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:28,350
- Good.
- Fantastic.

60
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,785
Glad to be back.

61
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,121
Well, this is very exciting
because you guys have a lot

62
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:35,457
of talent and expertise to share
with this season's contestants.

63
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:40,529
Now, you guys are not the only
ones competing this season.

64
00:03:40,564 --> 00:03:44,800
Our returning champions are also
competing but not against you.

65
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:47,336
They will be competing
against each other.

66
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,538
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry!

67
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,640
- Oh, wow.
- Oh.

68
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:53,809
All right, so here's
how this is going to work.

69
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:57,546
Each champion will choose
five of you to join their team.

70
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,015
If someone from their team
wins this season,

71
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,750
that coach wins, as well,

72
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:05,087
making them the first
two-time<i> Face Off</i> champion.

73
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,488
That's awesome.

74
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:10,092
However, if all of the members
of that team get eliminated,

75
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,027
then the coach
gets eliminated as well.

76
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:13,128
Aww.

77
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:14,330
So today's challenge

78
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,232
is critical because it will be
your only chance

79
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,034
to prove that you have
what it takes

80
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:22,538
to win before the coaches
handpick their teams.

81
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:26,208
So are you ready to make
a great first impression?

82
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:27,209
Yeah!

83
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:30,846
Whoo!

84
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,382
For your first
foundation challenge,

85
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:36,885
you'll each pay tribute
to our returning champions

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,121
by creating
a companion character

87
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:42,458
that complements
one of their most iconic

88
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:45,094
<i>Face Off</i> creations.

89
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:48,330
- Aw.
- Oh.

90
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,598
We have Rayce's cellist

91
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,900
from our Tim Burton-inspired
challenge...

92
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,169
Yeah.

93
00:04:54,204 --> 00:04:57,640
Anthony's
bioluminescent creature.

94
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,675
Lastly, we have Laura's
Mother Earth creation

95
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,579
from our Earth goddess
challenge.

96
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:05,848
Now, on my go, the monitor
placed at each section

97
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:09,284
will display the image
of one of these characters.

98
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,487
There can only be
five companion characters

99
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:13,856
for each
of our champion makeups.

100
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,992
You better be quick to make sure
that you get the one you want.

101
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:19,928
You have two hours
to complete this challenge.

102
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:25,401
Good luck,
'cause your time starts now.

103
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,005
Aah!

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,373
- I want you.
- How you doing?

105
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,641
- I'm Gregory.
- Nice to meet you, Gregory.

106
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:33,642
Augustine.

107
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:34,643
Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,245
All right.

109
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,282
I wish I had, like, three hands
and one fourth one to write.

110
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:42,084
This is Rayce's side,
I believe?

111
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:43,352
- Yeah.
- Okay.

112
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,486
I'm going to work
on your hair first

113
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:45,921
to get that out of the way.

114
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:47,523
My name is Emily Serpico.

115
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:50,259
I'm the youngest contestant ever
on<i> Face Off,</i> which is really,

116
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:51,627
really exciting.

117
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,062
I live with my parents,

118
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,930
and I'm going to
cosmetology school.

119
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:57,433
I may be underestimated
because I'm so young,

120
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:00,903
but I think people are gonna be
very surprised at what I can do.

121
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:03,872
Did you see what Emily
is doing with the hairdo?

122
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:05,274
It's like a hat.

123
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,475
- Oh, that's cool.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:07,976
So your story is,

125
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:11,980
you are a poet who's inspired
by Rayce's cellist.

126
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,348
Sweet.

127
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:15,517
Where are the prosthetics?

128
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:20,055
Ready to kick some ass.

129
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,357
I am so excited to be here.

130
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,626
I got Anthony's
bioluminescent character,

131
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:27,096
and I instantly
run toward the prosthetics.

132
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,465
Everybody's digging them up
like they're entrails,

133
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,600
just flying all over the place.

134
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,836
I find some pointy ears
and a brow piece,

135
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,238
and I just start rocking it.

136
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,360
_

137
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:39,541
I'm a trained artist,

138
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:41,243
but I've always loved monsters.

139
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:44,413
At 17 I started doing it
professionally, and I love it.

140
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,849
It's the best job in the world.

141
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:49,952
All right.

142
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,787
- See, we've got Mother Nature.
- Yeah.

143
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,388
- Now we want Father Time...
- Oh, sweet.

144
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:56,024
So your head is gonna be
like a grandfather clock

145
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:57,960
- grew into a tree.
- Okay.

146
00:06:57,994 --> 00:07:00,129
I have my own special effects
makeup shop,

147
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:02,331
and I've been working on indie
films for about eight years

148
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:03,665
in North Carolina.

149
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,101
Being on<i> Face Off</i>
is a phenomenal opportunity

150
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:08,170
for me to break
into bigger films

151
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,473
and major Hollywood
blockbusters.

152
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:15,450
I like the route Greg is going.
He's thinking outside the box.

153
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:17,819
I really hope Laura picks me
to be on her team.

154
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,621
So I went straight
towards Mother Earth,

155
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:21,990
and I'm fabricating
this foam grandfather clock

156
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,958
to impress her.

157
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:24,993
Yeah, that's good.

158
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,832
- You nervous?
- It's a lot of pressure, man.

159
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,202
My concept is the antithesis
to Rayce's cellist.

160
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,438
You're an angry techno DJ.

161
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:37,672
It's a risky plan,

162
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,941
but it's not unheard of
for companions to be

163
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,444
very different from each other.

164
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:44,145
He's going
to be very dark-featured

165
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,915
with a prism laser light show
coming out of his face.

166
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,717
- How long you been doing it?
- A year and a half.

167
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,352
I don't actually
do it professionally.

168
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,221
I've spent ten years in the Air
National Guard in California.

169
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,391
I come from three generations
of military fighter pilots,

170
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:58,493
but I've always had a passion
for the effects world,

171
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,663
and I really feel like I need
to give myself the opportunity

172
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,765
to pursue it and get paid
to do it.

173
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,600
This is a dream right now.

174
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,209
Got these, got this.
All right, cool.

175
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,477
I'll be right back.

176
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,379
I'm Stephanie, I'm 21 years old,

177
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,649
and I work on the creative crew
of a haunted house.

178
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:21,883
Eyelashes? Ooh.

179
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,219
When I'm there,
I only have an hour to get

180
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,854
30, 40 people done,

181
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,924
so it's really gotten me ready
to tackle this competition.

182
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,293
I'm making you
one of Mother Nature's babies.

183
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,962
Whatever you need to win,
do it.

184
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:40,732
_

185
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,572
_

186
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:45,145
I am a creative director
in advertising.

187
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:46,146
_

188
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:49,811
I started to do special effects
because of<i> Face Off,</i>

189
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,747
but I've only been doing it
for about eight months.

190
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,349
My concept for this character
is, like,

191
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:57,586
a young brother version of
the character that Anthony did.

192
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,220
Of course I'm nervous
and excited.

193
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,423
I'm everything
in the same package.

194
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,153
_

195
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:16,404
Uh, well,
it's matching Mother Earth,

196
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:20,141
so I figure that you should be
like a protector kind of thing.

197
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:21,276
I've been a makeup artist

198
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,179
for approximately ten years,
self-taught.

199
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:26,448
I'm also a prop maker
and suit actor,

200
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,251
and since I'm 6'5" I normally
get asked to play the monster

201
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:31,953
as well as do
the special effects.

202
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,557
This isn't made for you
so I've got to fit it to you.

203
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,859
There we go.

204
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,632
Ooh, all right.
I like that he went flesh tone.

205
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,367
It looks like a more human
version of yours.

206
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,735
Right.

207
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,937
My name is Julian.
I'm from Fremont, California.

208
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:50,772
My character is a distant cousin

209
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,008
of Anthony's
bioluminescent creature.

210
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,175
Close your eyes.

211
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,011
I went to cinema makeup school
in Los Angeles,

212
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,712
and then I was working
for about five years

213
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,581
before I moved back
to the Bay Area

214
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:02,350
to help my parents care
for my younger brother Brent.

215
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:06,154
He has a disease that affects
his speech and motor skills.

216
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,922
Winning Face Off would mean
being able

217
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,224
to help out my brother.

218
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,393
It would also mean being able
to move back to LA

219
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:13,561
for another shot at my career,

220
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:17,499
so I'm gonna be going
for all the way.

221
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,000
You guys are all doing great.

222
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,915
You got one hour left.

223
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,717
You're freaking me out now.

224
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:24,485
I've never had
to create a character

225
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,553
in this short amount of time,

226
00:10:25,588 --> 00:10:26,955
and I'm having a hell

227
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:29,624
of a time layering
on these laser lines.

228
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:31,559
Damn it.

229
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:36,097
I cannot get that paint
to stay down thick.

230
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:37,298
I start freaking out because I

231
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,700
know the coaches
are watching me.

232
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:41,002
This stuff's just
not cooperating with me at all.

233
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,838
There's no stopping.
There's no asking for help,

234
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:46,274
and I start thinking, "Am I
gonna be the only one out there

235
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,109
with nothing?"

236
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,289
We're in the middle of
our first foundation challenge.

237
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,090
Three champions
from previous seasons

238
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,959
are back to be our coaches.

239
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,828
We are creating a companion
for one of their makeups.

240
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,397
And I chose Rayce's cellist,

241
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,966
and my character is supposed
to have what resembles

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,936
the prism laser light show
coming out of his face,

243
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,538
but I cannot get
that paint to stay down.

244
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,440
I start freaking out,
because I know the coaches

245
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,108
are watching me.
Dammit.

246
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,111
And I'm desperately trying to
find something that will help.

247
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,747
I think it's interesting
that Logan went black.

248
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:23,783
Yeah, it's pretty dark
out of the gate.

249
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,286
Finally,
I apply silver metallic paints

250
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,788
that make the prosthetic pop,

251
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,157
and I think
that's a good attempt at making

252
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,626
it a little bit more dynamic.

253
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,063
Yeah, that's better.

254
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,398
Who'd Jamie end up getting?

255
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,466
Oh, Rayce's.

256
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,203
You're going to be a composer.

257
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:46,075
I'm a sci-fi fantasy chick.

258
00:11:46,076 --> 00:11:49,881
I grew up with<i> Star Wars</i>
on VHS and laser ***

259
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,944
I've been working
as a freelance makeup artist

260
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,212
for about three years.

261
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:55,348
There aren't many women
in the effects industry,

262
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,216
but we can keep up
with these boys,

263
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,784
and I'm here to prove that.

264
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,519
Blood, sweat, and tears,
I will give everything

265
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,058
I got to be the next
<i>Face Off</i> champion.

266
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:08,694
Oh, there's Ben.
He's got yours.

267
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,363
- I'm doing Anthony's water guy.
- Uh-huh.

268
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,932
I'm gonna turn
you into his princess.

269
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,368
So crazy,
I never thought I'd ever be here.

270
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,369
- Really?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,706
I served in Iraq
from 2006 to 2007.

272
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,342
I was a helicopter mechanic
in the Marine Corps.

273
00:12:23,377 --> 00:12:24,910
Growing up, I'd always sculpted,

274
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,612
and I wanted
to fine-tune my skills,

275
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,015
so when I got out of the Marines
I went to cinema makeup school.

276
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,983
A couple of my friends,
kind of gave me a hard time.

277
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,652
They thought that I was just
gonna be dressing hair

278
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:33,986
and doing fingernail polish,

279
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,655
but later when they saw
that I was making

280
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,491
monsters and creatures they
were pretty blown away by it.

281
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,192
Open up for me.

282
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:41,560
That don't look too bad.

283
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,330
Whoever thought that a big
burly guy could do makeup, huh?

284
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,582
_

285
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,835
Regina's doing
what I would have done.

286
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,871
Looks like she might be
putting on some ears?

287
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,341
I'm Regina.
I'm 23 from Chicago, Illinois.

288
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,310
I chose Laura's Mother Earth,

289
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,779
and my character's gonna
be her daughter.

290
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,448
I'm thinking "Woodland Nymph."

291
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,216
I'm fine artist trained.

292
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,719
I got into effects
four years ago.

293
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,554
One of my teachers
from makeup school

294
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,290
is Graham Schofield
from season six.

295
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,993
When he was on the show
he made it pretty far,

296
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:17,496
and I'm hoping
that I get to that point.

297
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,466
Yeah, we're gonna
do other things.

298
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,568
We're doing the fish guy,

299
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,538
and you're going
to be a lionfish.

300
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,739
I'm a concept designer

301
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,974
and art director
for the theme park industry.

302
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,044
I worked on rides
like<i> Transformers,</i> The Ride 3D.

303
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,612
Actually, I wanted to pull out

304
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,980
of theme parks
a number of years ago,

305
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,216
and then I saw that
Neville Page's first project

306
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,752
was designing aliens
on the<i> Men In Black</i> ride,

307
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:44,357
and I was like, "Okay,
I'm gonna stay on this path."

308
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,459
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make you into the wizard

309
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:48,894
that actually turned him
into the cello.

310
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,463
I'm rob.
I'm 41 years old.

311
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,997
I work as a collision technician

312
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,667
at my family's collision shop
in Monroe, Michigan.

313
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,036
Special effects
has been my favorite hobby

314
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,537
since I was nine years old,

315
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,207
but when my daughter was born
I took six years off.

316
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,942
She was born with two holes
in her heart

317
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,310
and down syndrome.

318
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,611
Today she's eight years old.

319
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,147
Her name's Riley.
Her holes in her heart are good.

320
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,816
One night when we were watching
<i>Face Off</i> she brought me up one

321
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:11,884
of my sculptures and said,

322
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,319
"Daddy, you need to do this."

323
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,987
It hit me, you know,
I was like, "Wow, you know,

324
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,055
she understands this."

325
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,090
So here I am.

326
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,629
I'm basically making a version
of Father Time

327
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,898
- to go with Mother Nature.
- Okay.

328
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,700
I fell in love
with makeup in ninth grade.

329
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,069
All throughout high school
I did proms, I did weddings.

330
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,104
I'd create creatures
around Halloween.

331
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,305
Now that I've been doing film

332
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,807
and television makeup
for two years,

333
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,542
I want to win<i> Face Off.</i>

334
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,877
I'm a very competitive person,

335
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,579
and I do not plan on going home.

336
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:45,484
So I'm turning you
into a dead ballerina

337
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,052
that dances to his music.

338
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,287
Love it.

339
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,222
Watching <i>Face Off</i>
really inspired me.

340
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,425
I knew that I wanted to get
into the film industry,

341
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,926
and I knew I loved makeup,

342
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,695
but because of<i> Face Off</i>
I decided to go to school

343
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,597
and learn the special effects
craft.

344
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,199
After I finished school,

345
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,034
I competed
in three different IMATs.

346
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,103
I took first place twice.

347
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:09,542
Time is running out and I'm
frantically blending edges,

348
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,478
but the piece is too big
and it's covering her hairline.

349
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,947
What am I gonna
do to cover this edge?

350
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,083
And then I
see this giant pink flower,

351
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,752
so I stick it on my model's head

352
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:22,421
and I think, "This is burnin'."

353
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,589
Ten minutes, guys.

354
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,691
You have ten minutes left.

355
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,526
Still time.

356
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,501
Time's up, brushes down.

357
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,408
Before I send the coaches
down to check out your work,

358
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,810
I do have another surprise
for you.

359
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,312
Of course.

360
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,915
Hot off the set of <i>The Hunger</i>
<i>Games, Mockingjay</i> films,

361
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,685
please welcome three time
Academy Award-winning makeup

362
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,158
artist and<i> Face Off</i>
series judge, Ve Neill.

363
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,627
- Hey, everybody!
- Hey, Ve!

364
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,530
She's the Aretha Franklin
of the effects world.

365
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,098
I thought I was excited before,

366
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,534
and now I'm ecstatic.

367
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,636
- Well, this is exciting.
- I know, isn't this great?

368
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,005
- I am so happy to be back.
- All right, well are you

369
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,040
ready to help these champs
go see some makeups?

370
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,942
- Yeah, let's go.
- Okay.

371
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,144
Hi, Rob.
Tell us about your character.

372
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,445
He was a dark wizard

373
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,347
that changed the person
to the cello.

374
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,449
Tell me about the choice
of that prosthetic.

375
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,685
I wanted to show the brokenness

376
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,755
of the relationship between
the girl and the cello itself.

377
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,523
I think you did
a really great job.

378
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,091
It really reads wizard to me.

379
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,793
- Very complete.
- Thank you.

380
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,196
This is the ballerina

381
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,865
that is dancing to the music
that is constantly playing.

382
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,967
Explain to me some
of the coloration you chose.

383
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,268
I saw the skirt.

384
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,837
That's why I went with the pinks

385
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,672
and the darker reds
for the shading.

386
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:50,209
You did a really nice blending
job on just a stock piece.

387
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,643
You've got it down pretty well.

388
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,278
Thanks so much.
Thank you.

389
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,853
So you were going off
of Anthony's character.

390
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,654
Yes, this is a monk lionfish.

391
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,990
You as an artist, how do you
see yourself in this character?

392
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,125
Conceptually this is very
much me.

393
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,894
I like a lot
of story in the character.

394
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,128
Those kind of apes can be risky,

395
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:11,630
'cause they can hide
some of the details.

396
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,432
Good job on making
the correct choices

397
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,367
- and put them in the right spots.
- Great job, Adam.

398
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,368
Thank you.

399
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,704
This is my lovely sea
sorceress.

400
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,706
I like that you put the stripes

401
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,641
like Anthony
had his blue stripes.

402
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,610
I like the way
you painted around the eyes

403
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,712
and the contacts that you chose,
as well as the pie.

404
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,647
It really makes her eyes
look really big.

405
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,482
Thank you.

406
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,591
So I wanted to make Mother
Nature's dad, Father Time.

407
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:41,860
He basically is a grumpy
old hermit.

408
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,962
So how many prosthetics
does he have on?

409
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:46,064
Four, he has a brow piece,
two jowls,

410
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,566
and then a neck piece.

411
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,735
Well, nice job, I think
he looks like an old man.

412
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,904
- Good job, Anthony.
- Thank you.

413
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,040
This is a version
of Father Time,

414
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,377
and I wanted to do
a grandfather clock up here.

415
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,745
We didn't really know
where you were going.

416
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,247
It was very unpredictable,
which I think was a good thing.

417
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,116
A good idea.

418
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,856
So what did you guys
think the makeups?

419
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,025
I think, overall, we were
really impressed with everything

420
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,694
you guys did, and I don't think
there's one person

421
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,330
that we don't think
can take this thing all the way.

422
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,499
- Yeah, great job guys.
- Ve?

423
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,267
Well, I think
there were some very creative

424
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,902
and innovative choices made

425
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:27,072
today, and I'm really
excited about this season.

426
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,541
All right, guys,
it's time to pick your teams.

427
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,110
Now, we chose this order
by random draw.

428
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,613
Laura, you're up first.

429
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,848
This was so hard.

430
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:39,151
This choice is so important.

431
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,920
If you don't have
a good framework to work off of,

432
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,255
then your house will fall.

433
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,291
My first pick is--

434
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,131
Laura, who is the first contestant

435
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,466
you'd like
to have join your team.

436
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,936
I picked this person because I
thought their application

437
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,037
was nearly flawless,

438
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,305
I loved their color choices,

439
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,740
and I felt like their character

440
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:04,176
really fit the parameters
of this challenge.

441
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,212
So I have to go with Darla.

442
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,315
I'm so excited,

443
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,784
not only to be
the first one chosen,

444
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,252
but to be chosen by Laura.

445
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,688
She's been
through two full seasons,

446
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,759
and I can't wait to hear
all that she has to offer.

447
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,360
- Good first choice.
- Rayce.

448
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,562
To me there's many things

449
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,597
that define success
in this competition.

450
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,333
Attention to detail is one
of those I'd like to push so,

451
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,599
Adam, you're on my team, man.

452
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,373
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

453
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,541
Anthony.

454
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:40,617
My first pick
would actually have been Adam.

455
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:42,785
There's something
about his visual storytelling.

456
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,787
But Rayce steals him
at the last second.

457
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:46,923
I really liked her application
of color

458
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:49,159
and the use
of the depth of color.

459
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:51,394
I choose Kelly.

460
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,267
Laura, your next pick.

461
00:19:57,301 --> 00:20:00,470
My next pick is someone
who had an amazing application,

462
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:04,207
so I'm gonna
have to pick Julian.

463
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:07,377
- Rayce.
- Please don't pick Anthony.

464
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:09,512
Nobody pick Anthony.
I really want to pick him next.

465
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:12,482
Anthony, you did a great job.
Get over here.

466
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:14,884
Aw, man.

467
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:16,853
Welcome to the team.

468
00:20:16,887 --> 00:20:19,756
- Anthony.
- Alan.

469
00:20:21,592 --> 00:20:22,659
Laura.

470
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:25,128
So far Laura's
picked Darla and Julian.

471
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,563
There's only a few spots left

472
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:29,098
and I really want to be
on her team.

473
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:30,800
Emily.

474
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:36,105
And there goes another person.

475
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,241
Rob.

476
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:41,344
Ben.

477
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:44,547
Laura.

478
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:46,449
Gregory.

479
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:47,750
Now that she's picked me,

480
00:20:47,785 --> 00:20:49,352
I'm definitely gonna
bring it for her,

481
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:52,622
because I want to show her that
I deserve a place on her team.

482
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:58,094
- Logan, get over here.
- All right.

483
00:20:58,128 --> 00:21:02,198
- Daniel.
- Yes!

484
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,499
Welcome.

485
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:06,736
I'm gonna
have to go with Stephanie.

486
00:21:09,106 --> 00:21:13,109
Regina, welcome to the team.

487
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:17,313
Jamie, come on.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

488
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:18,781
Yay!

489
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:26,055
Congratulations, everyone,
on your new teams.

490
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,558
I know it's been
quite an exciting day,

491
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:32,462
but before I send you off
to move into your new house,

492
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:37,634
there's just one more piece
of business to attend to.

493
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:40,937
The champions weren't the only
ones making picks today.

494
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:43,473
Ve has selected
her own favorites

495
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:46,809
and a winner for
today's foundation challenge.

496
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:48,111
That means one of you

497
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:51,714
will receive immunity in
the first spotlight challenge,

498
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:54,150
increasing not just
your odds of surviving

499
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:56,653
but your coach's as well.

500
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:58,955
Having immunity
for the first round

501
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:02,425
would especially be good,
because I won't be as panicked

502
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,428
because I know
I'm not going home first.

503
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:07,130
So this is the big moment, Ve.

504
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:09,032
Who created your favorite looks?

505
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,467
My first choice is Rob.

506
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:14,937
You did a really great job of
picking some unusual components

507
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:16,739
and making
a very cohesive character,

508
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,608
and I love the texture
in the makeup.

509
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:19,776
Thank you so much.

510
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,012
Darla, you did a beautiful
clean makeup.

511
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:26,649
I loved your backstory,
and she was just adorable.

512
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:27,817
Thank you.

513
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:30,620
Ve, who is the winner
of this challenge?

514
00:22:30,654 --> 00:22:35,425
The winner is...

515
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:38,027
Darla.

516
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:41,998
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

517
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:44,567
Darla,
you created the best companion

518
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:46,602
- for Rayce's cellist.
- Thank you so much.

519
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,137
Really, really wonderful
story, darling.

520
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:50,773
Thank you.
I am ecstatic to win immunity.

521
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:53,209
I'm feeling sheer joy
and excitement,

522
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:55,378
and a little bit
of shock, maybe, too.

523
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:57,146
Darla, congratulations.

524
00:22:57,181 --> 00:22:59,282
As the winner
of today's foundation challenge,

525
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:02,952
you have earned immunity in
the first spotlight challenge.

526
00:23:02,986 --> 00:23:05,188
- How's that feel?
- Awesome.

527
00:23:05,222 --> 00:23:07,390
Darla so deserved this win.

528
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:09,192
She made all the right
decisions.

529
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:11,661
Say good-bye
to your new coaches for now,

530
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:15,031
and I will see you soon for
your first spotlight challenge.

531
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:18,167
- Goodnight.
- Welcome to<i> Face Off!</i>

532
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,679
As soon
as we go through the gate

533
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,814
and I see the scale
of the house,

534
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:33,282
that's when it hits me.

535
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:36,552
I'm finally here,
and it feels really good.

536
00:23:36,587 --> 00:23:39,155
- Wow.
- Guys!

537
00:23:39,189 --> 00:23:41,457
I'm not believing
this is happening.

538
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:44,427
This house is just incredible.

539
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:46,863
- Aw, man.
- Oh, my God.

540
00:23:46,897 --> 00:23:50,099
There's these black-and-white
photographs of Anthony, Rayce's,

541
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:51,434
and Laura's work.

542
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:52,568
And that's another moment we're,

543
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,670
like, "We're here."

544
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,339
I have never lived in a place

545
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:58,408
- this nice.
- Ow!

546
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,543
I'm gonna call this home
for as long as I can be here,

547
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:01,911
and hopefully I'm here
a long time.

548
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:04,680
Season eight!

549
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:12,155
- It is hot.
- What is this?

550
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,857
This is crazy.

551
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,325
I think they're leaving us
here to die.

552
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,394
Today is
our first spotlight challenge,

553
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,196
and we are at Vasquez Rocks.

554
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,566
And this has been the place
for many, many, many movies,

555
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,669
and I don't know really
what to expect.

556
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:28,426
- What is that?
- Oh, my gosh.

557
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,871
We see all these
alien crash sites

558
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:32,402
and it is crazy.

559
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:36,044
- That's awesome.
- We round this corner

560
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:39,547
and then I see this
gorgeous flowing white ponytail.

561
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:40,782
No way.

562
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:43,217
Oh, my God.

563
00:24:43,252 --> 00:24:45,219
Holy shit, it's Rick Baker.

564
00:24:45,254 --> 00:24:47,555
Oh, I'm not gonna geek out.
Be cool.

565
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:53,911
- No way.
- It's Rick Baker.

566
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:55,980
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

567
00:24:56,014 --> 00:25:00,651
Rick Baker is "the" makeup
artist, so seeing him is just--

568
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:01,686
I'm speechless.

569
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,820
- That's awesome.
- No way.

570
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:04,555
- Is this real life?
- Oh, my goodness.

571
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,757
This is, like, my biggest idol.

572
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:07,792
I start shaking.

573
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:10,228
I actually get a tear in my eye.

574
00:25:11,296 --> 00:25:13,136
It gives me great pleasure

575
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,339
to introduce someone who
really needs no introduction.

576
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:17,941
Legendary makeup artist

577
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:22,145
and seven time Academy
Award-winner, Rick Baker.

578
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:30,553
It's an incredible honor to have
you here with us, is it not?

579
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:31,754
Yes!

580
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:33,423
You're gonna make me blush,
McKenzie.

581
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,658
That's my goal.

582
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:38,461
Now you have made
so many memorable makeups

583
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,396
across an incredibly diverse
range

584
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:43,466
of films like<i> American Werewolf</i>
<i>In London,</i>

585
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,902
<i>Men In Black</i> trilogy,
<i>Star Wars,</i>

586
00:25:45,936 --> 00:25:47,070
<i>Planet Of The Apes.</i>

587
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:48,571
I mean, just small stuff
we got going on here.

588
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,642
What are some
of your personal favorites?

589
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,944
I would say Harry
from <i>Harry And The Hendersons</i>

590
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,279
is one of my all-time favorites.

591
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:58,214
I'm pretty pleased
with that one.

592
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:01,384
All right, guys, let's talk
about where we are today.

593
00:26:01,418 --> 00:26:04,287
This is Double B Ranch
at Vasquez Rocks,

594
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:07,156
where countless
blockbuster films like

595
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,858
<i>Cowboys And Aliens, Iron Man,</i>

596
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:10,793
and<i> Transformers 2</i>
have been shot.

597
00:26:10,828 --> 00:26:12,161
Filmmakers come here

598
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,298
when they're looking
for an otherworldly landscape,

599
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:18,194
and that brings me to your first
spotlight challenge.

600
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:23,062
You'll work with your champion-lead
teams of five.

601
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,542
Select one of the unique
extraterrestrial crash sites

602
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:27,810
around you here,

603
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:30,880
and use the evidence
from the wreckage as inspiration

604
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:34,817
for two aliens that might have
emerged from that crash.

605
00:26:34,852 --> 00:26:36,786
Oh, my God.
I love aliens,

606
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,889
so I am so
excited for this challenge.

607
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:42,358
Why don't you go ahead
and stand with your teammates.

608
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,492
Winning team right here?

609
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:48,097
We got this.

610
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:50,066
All right, guys.
I have a big surprise for you.

611
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,136
Rick will be joining us
on the reveal stage,

612
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:59,442
but he's also going to consult
on your designs today.

613
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:02,678
I'm gonna start crying.

614
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:05,248
What are you gonna be looking
for in their final makeups?

615
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:07,250
The good thing
about doing an alien

616
00:27:07,284 --> 00:27:08,517
is that you can do anything,

617
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:09,719
but just because you can do
anything

618
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,120
doesn't mean that you should.

619
00:27:11,154 --> 00:27:14,223
I would like to see a nice
clean, well-thought out design

620
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,093
that I'd recognize as something
that's definitely alien.

621
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:18,427
You know, something
like Glenn Hetrick.

622
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,730
You know what I mean?

623
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,599
Oh, you went there.
Wow, okay.

624
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:25,935
All right, it's time
to get started, guys.

625
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:28,871
On my go I want
you to select a crash site

626
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:30,606
and begin working
on your concepts.

627
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:33,643
Rick will come by shortly
to collaborate with you.

628
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:35,778
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

629
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:37,676
All right, go.

630
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,818
- Oh, I got it.
- Get it, get it,

631
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:45,554
- get it, get it.
- You want this one?

632
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:46,856
Oh, my God.

633
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,357
I just touched it, it's gooey.

634
00:27:48,392 --> 00:27:51,761
Team Laura,
we got to the egg crash site.

635
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,062
It's organic,

636
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:56,032
so we can think about
natural lifelike creatures.

637
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:57,934
Very, very slimy.

638
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:58,935
There's gold right here.

639
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,336
What would they do with it?

640
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,139
Team Anthony picks the crash
site that has the aircraft

641
00:28:03,173 --> 00:28:04,573
that's all blown to pieces,

642
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:07,777
and there's guns, missiles,
gold.

643
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,745
It's just a big hodgepodge
of craziness.

644
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:12,315
This is the liquid they use to be
able to live in our atmosphere.

645
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:14,050
We could do an alien
in another alien world.

646
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,451
- I like that.
- Yeah.

647
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,788
Team Rayce picks the crash
site with the cryogenic pod

648
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,890
and alien crystals
coming out of the ground.

649
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:23,192
All right,
so let's get a little powwow

650
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:26,529
going for character design.

651
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:29,098
You guys want to do spines

652
00:28:29,132 --> 00:28:30,533
on the top
of the head, on the back?

653
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:32,101
It could be on the back
of the arm too.

654
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:34,804
Maybe we can make it look like
the big monster has four legs,

655
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,772
but then give the little monster
little--

656
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:38,641
- Hi, Rick.
- Hey!

657
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:43,512
My team just barely starts
sketching and I look over.

658
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:48,184
Rick Bakers sitting right next
to me and I'm just--

659
00:28:48,218 --> 00:28:49,752
What's your concept here?
What are you thinking?

660
00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:52,455
Since there's a drill,
they go from planet to planet

661
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:54,290
and just take
whatever they want to,

662
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:55,458
and we're thinking there's gonna

663
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:58,894
be a warrior
that protects a little alien.

664
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:01,697
So the little alien is the one
that controls the plane

665
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:03,466
and it's gonna wear a helmet
all the time,

666
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,801
and then the larger alien
is the protector.

667
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:07,103
When they get
out of the aircraft,

668
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:08,938
he's the one
that's gonna protect her.

669
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:11,007
My only worry,
and since it is <i>Face Off</i>

670
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,341
and it's supposed
to be about makeup,

671
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,577
if one of them is just a helmet,
I don't know.

672
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:17,913
It seems kind of like a cop out
if you don't see what's inside.

673
00:29:19,783 --> 00:29:21,951
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

674
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:23,185
What's going on here?

675
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,687
We are piecing together

676
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,356
a story from this alien
drunk driver-ing.

677
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,491
What do you think happened
here?

678
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,359
This is clearly
not a and-alone ship,

679
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,727
so it's a escape pod,

680
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:34,930
and then we have the mutilated
deer over there so--

681
00:29:34,965 --> 00:29:36,365
- Who did that?
- Well,

682
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,602
this is a predatory Cro Magnon
species relative to this planet.

683
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:41,837
So do you have some designs
for these things yet, or--

684
00:29:41,872 --> 00:29:44,807
For the Neanderthal style I
thought, "We are in the desert,"

685
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:45,908
so the most resilient thing

686
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:47,810
that popped in my head was
a king scorpion.

687
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,111
It's arachnid,

688
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:51,680
so it'll be a combination
of spider, scorpion,

689
00:29:51,715 --> 00:29:53,149
and grasshopper with,

690
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:55,751
like, a black outer shell,
and the tissue inside

691
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:57,720
is either pink or red.
I don't want to go purple.

692
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,221
I thought it was a little
too hokey.

693
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,557
Yeah, I don't know
that it's too hokey.

694
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,626
I like the idea
of a nice contrast like that.

695
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,127
Okay,

696
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:08,831
and then they've been working on
the higher intelligence alien.

697
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:11,667
We're going with an old,
aged wiser look,

698
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:13,102
and it's a water-based creature

699
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:15,204
that is capable
of interstellar travel

700
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:17,506
and that resembles
more traditional aliens.

701
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,208
Sounds like you guys
have some go ideas,

702
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:22,511
and I'm really curious
to see the final results.

703
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:30,519
So what are you thinking
happened here?

704
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:33,989
An alien transplanted
three eggs onto a desert.

705
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:36,859
As they landed,
two of 'em got out,

706
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:39,462
and the aliens
that came out of it are aquatic

707
00:30:39,496 --> 00:30:41,997
instead of desert creatures.

708
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,566
We're gonna
have one more developed.

709
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,601
So it's going to blend
into the surroundings,

710
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,536
and the youngest one
just hatched,

711
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:51,607
and the female's gonna
be more smooth and slimy.

712
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,176
We were also gonna
go with claws.

713
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:55,344
Mm-hmm.

714
00:30:55,378 --> 00:30:56,378
But we didn't want
to be too earthy.

715
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:57,980
"Too earthy"
meaning like earth--

716
00:30:58,014 --> 00:30:59,482
Earth creature, yeah.

717
00:30:59,516 --> 00:31:01,417
I get into this all the time
with Barry Sonnenfeld

718
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:02,852
when I'm doing the
<i>Men In Black</i> movies.

719
00:31:02,886 --> 00:31:04,420
He says, "You know,

720
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:06,589
do something that doesn't look
like it's from this planet."

721
00:31:06,623 --> 00:31:08,624
So I do something that doesn't
have eyes and a mouth,

722
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,659
and he goes, "I can't tell where
he's looking and how am I gonna

723
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:13,496
know when he's talking if he
doesn't have eyes or a mouth?"

724
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,431
You know,
so it's a delicate balance.

725
00:31:15,465 --> 00:31:17,299
Hearing Rick give us advice
about our makeup,

726
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,301
it's probably one
of the greatest moments

727
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,103
I can ever say,
like, happened to me.

728
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,272
'Cause I mean,
it is Rick Baker.

729
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:24,707
Okay, so we've got enough down.

730
00:31:24,741 --> 00:31:25,908
We've got enough pictures.

731
00:31:25,942 --> 00:31:27,443
Let's go to the lab
and get started on this.

732
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:30,646
Sounds good.

733
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,047
Hey, does anyone want to go
for a ride in the jeep?

734
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:43,492
Hey, guys!

735
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,228
We walk into the lab and it
hits me for the first time,

736
00:31:46,263 --> 00:31:47,763
"Oh, my gosh,
we're finally here."

737
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:48,831
Oh, my God.

738
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,334
This is the lab of my dreams.

739
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,371
There's an entire wall of
Kryolan Aqua Color,

740
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:57,773
amazing wigs,
and fabrication stuff

741
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:58,974
that I could never afford.

742
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:00,376
It's like Christmas over here.

743
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,579
I'm used to working
in my parents' garage--

744
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:04,914
half of a garage.

745
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:08,851
So this is just unbelievable.

746
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,887
So let's get moving.
Got to get some clay.

747
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:14,557
My team has a really solid
concept, I think,

748
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:16,926
but now we have to get sculpting
as soon as possible,

749
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,161
because we only have six
and a half hours in the lab

750
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:21,664
today.

751
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,901
The delegation is first order
of business.

752
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:28,037
I am sculpting the cowl
for the arachnid.

753
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,939
Regina's sculpting the face.

754
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:33,275
Rob volunteers for fabrication.

755
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,511
- So you want me to cover ears?
- Yeah.

756
00:32:35,545 --> 00:32:37,213
I'm gonna build it out here

757
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,948
and then carve
in more of the divots.

758
00:32:38,982 --> 00:32:41,550
As I'm working
on the face sculpt

759
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,752
for our higher intelligence
alien, I'm trying to do

760
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:46,589
these geometrically-shaped
mechanical gills over the mouth.

761
00:32:46,623 --> 00:32:48,924
Do you want
them to be the same size,

762
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:51,527
because it's saying "repetition"
and then in your mind

763
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:52,795
it's saying "mechanical."

764
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:55,431
Sculpting mechanical parts
is not easy.

765
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:57,199
Pinch that in a little bit.

766
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:59,235
I know
that Anthony just started,

767
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:02,638
but there's some fundamental
form language issues with it,

768
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:04,006
and I'm really worried
about that.

769
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,241
If you have different sizes,

770
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,142
there's more organic language
happening here.

771
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,878
Yeah.

772
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:11,513
So we're now calling it
like "The Older"

773
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:12,748
- and "The Younger."
- Okay.

774
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,049
Our concept

775
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:17,052
is that one of them
hatched earlier than the other

776
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:20,456
and has already started
adapting to its environment.

777
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,158
The things that we would really
like to accomplish today

778
00:33:23,193 --> 00:33:25,661
are both faces and both cowls,

779
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:28,831
as well as the back piece
for our older alien.

780
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:30,566
Luckily, that's five pieces

781
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,134
and we have five people
on our team.

782
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:35,938
Only concern, maybe that
these are getting a bit thick

783
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,107
and this might be a bit thick.

784
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,375
So this is the first time

785
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:42,077
we get to see
any of the artists sculpt.

786
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:44,580
And you might just want to make
the back the interesting part

787
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:45,881
and keep all of this smooth.

788
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:48,734
And I'm feeling
like I got a pretty strong team.

789
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,468
I'm gonna make you a--
Gonna make you a thing.

790
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:53,022
Uh, how are you guys
doing your ears?

791
00:33:53,056 --> 00:33:54,590
Oh, yeah.
We didn't talk about ears.

792
00:33:54,624 --> 00:33:55,958
With our concept,

793
00:33:55,992 --> 00:34:00,129
we have the big male brute
and our small female pilot.

794
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,031
Ooh, yeah, right there.

795
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:04,133
I'm sculpting the male face

796
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,336
while Daniel
is sculpting the cowl.

797
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,005
Alan is fabricating armor
for the suits.

798
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,675
Jamie is sculpting
the female face,

799
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:16,178
and Ben is blocking the cowl
for her.

800
00:34:16,212 --> 00:34:19,648
Can you see the glimmer
of sweat on my forehead?

801
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,718
Anything that's gonna be
humanoid is going to have

802
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:24,987
a similar muscle structure
as what our own is.

803
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,122
I definitely know
what the judges are looking for

804
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:29,024
and anatomy is always a key part
of it.

805
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:30,693
- Pull that out.
- Yeah.

806
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:33,929
They'll look like it's kind
of pulling in a little more.

807
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:35,531
- Yeah.
- Even though these are aliens,

808
00:34:35,565 --> 00:34:40,803
they have to still be based on
some kind of realistic anatomy.

809
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,673
Hi, everybody.

810
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,375
Hey, Mr. Westmore!

811
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,977
Mr. Westmore is a legend
in the effects industry.

812
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:50,746
He's an Oscar winner,
and if there's one thing

813
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,114
I've learned
from watching the show

814
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:54,717
is if he gives you advice,
you take it.

815
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:55,918
Let's see
what you have going here.

816
00:34:55,952 --> 00:34:57,419
Now what is this one
supposed to be?

817
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:58,854
This is the aquatic one.

818
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,890
What we're trying to do is
basically make horizontal gills

819
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:05,394
almost like a respirator
to give it this fishy vibe.

820
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:08,397
Mm-hmm.
It doesn't read that way though.

821
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:11,133
You're coming down here,
you've got lines here,

822
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:12,167
and these are straight.

823
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:13,435
- It's all over the place.
- Okay.

824
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,438
It's really gonna
look amateurish.

825
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:17,673
You have a big sculpting
background?

826
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:19,742
- Mm-hmm.
- You do? All right.

827
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:21,844
My heart drops into my stomach.

828
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,512
The fact that Mr. Westmore

829
00:35:23,546 --> 00:35:26,882
is questioning my sculpting
abilities-- that's scary.

830
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,150
It needs a lot more work.

831
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,685
It is the first challenge,

832
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:32,788
and I'm losing my mind.

833
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:40,070
You see what I mean here,
where you're coming down here?

834
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:41,672
- It's all over the place.
- Okay.

835
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,807
It's really gonna
look amateurish.

836
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,909
It's day
one of our alien challenge,

837
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,312
and Mr. Westmore
doesn't like my sculpture.

838
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,613
Do you have a big sculpting
background?

839
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,515
- Mm-hmm.
- You do? All right.

840
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,816
It needs a lot more work.

841
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,852
It's like,
"Where do I go from here?

842
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:55,919
What am I supposed to do?"

843
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:57,788
I don't--
I don't know.

844
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,922
I'm lost.

845
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,424
I know there's a lot more work
to do.

846
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,692
Yeah.

847
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,294
Just be careful
with the angular point to it.

848
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,395
It can still be angular,

849
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,463
but it needs a lot more work.

850
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,965
Now let's see the cowl there.

851
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,635
In my mind I'm going towards
this ancient sea reptile.

852
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,903
Mm-hmm.
All these little angles,

853
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,972
all these little things
you have in here, roll them.

854
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,042
Not just scars in the sculpture.

855
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,644
Otherwise it's just gonna look
like you took a tool

856
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,179
- and scratched through it.
- Right, right.

857
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,881
Good, let's see the other
pieces.

858
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,182
That's coming nice.

859
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,252
Just looking at it in profile
here as opposed to these

860
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,654
laying almost flat like this,

861
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,190
if you actually raise them up
a little bit

862
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,592
you would have
a more interesting profile.

863
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,194
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

864
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,197
We're thinking something
that has hatched

865
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,068
and is now trying to camouflage
itself to its new surroundings.

866
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:47,004
The skin is kind
of like the desert lizard.

867
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,672
You might texture
this a little bit more.

868
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,240
It's so nice and subtle,

869
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,776
I'm afraid that once this is
all painted it's not gonna read.

870
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,044
- Okay.
- This is the older one,

871
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,280
so he's going to be elongated

872
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,850
but also starting
to take on more human features.

873
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,951
I would try to put a little

874
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,053
- but more alien in the nose.
- Okay.

875
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,723
As opposed
to making it too human-looking

876
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:09,159
and then it makes it look like
it's a person with a mask on.

877
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:10,794
Okay, let's see your last head
there.

878
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,332
This one is the cowl
for the youngest,

879
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:19,303
and so it's a little bit less
defined as the older.

880
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,404
And you're doing that spine

881
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,306
that you have on the back
continuing?

882
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,540
- Yes.
- Good.

883
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,275
We've got two aliens.

884
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,845
There is the big
muscle-bound one,

885
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,582
and then there's the smaller
pilot of the aircraft.

886
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,617
Wow, very nice.

887
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,386
And then he's gonna be covered
here with a suit?

888
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,653
Yes, actually--

889
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,055
Is that what you're building
over there?

890
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,057
Yeah, I actually draped
the whole back end of the suit

891
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,493
so it actually accents nicely
and showoff

892
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,228
more of that muscle structure
and bone structure,

893
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,963
so you can see the whole back
of the head.

894
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,064
Good idea.
Good.

895
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,599
Let's go on to the next and see.

896
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,234
I wanted to kind
of get this down.

897
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,502
- Right.
- He's gonna be the one

898
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:54,171
taking the beating out there
in the battlefield.

899
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:55,606
Aggressive, very nice.

900
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,641
You know, one thing I think
would be an interesting thing

901
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,843
is make some separate lips here,

902
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,079
and use the same textures

903
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,349
you have here
to run right into the mouth.

904
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:06,950
Mm-hmm, awesome.

905
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:10,020
Are there any similarities
in your two cowls?

906
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,822
These were the similarities
right here.

907
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:15,893
Since he's the bigger creature
we went with her a softer form.

908
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,127
I would rethink the cowl

909
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,897
just to try to pull
a little bit more of that

910
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,199
into this or vice versa.

911
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,168
That makes sense.

912
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,369
Good-bye, everybody.

913
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,704
Good-bye!

914
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,341
All right,
let's talk about this fella.

915
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,044
I think what I should do
with this, in all honesty,

916
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,346
is cut all of this down,

917
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:38,615
do almost a flat nose

918
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,951
with nostrils--
slits, like right here.

919
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,119
Mr. Westmore's advice

920
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,087
just completely
changed my entire design.

921
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,089
I mean,
I'm back to the drawing board.

922
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,926
So I'm adding eyes
on either side of the face

923
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,295
and rounded shapes in the nose.

924
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,566
I'm hoping it's going
to make my makeup better.

925
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,301
Anthony's
starting over right now,

926
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,369
and I
think it's the right decision.

927
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:02,539
The face is the most
important part of the character,

928
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,441
and it needs to be right.

929
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,748
Make the details
a lot more subtle.

930
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,484
- Okay.
- All right, guys.

931
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,986
We got to head out,
so good luck.

932
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,055
I will be back tomorrow in
the beginning part of the day.

933
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,857
So if you can mold,

934
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,925
crystal clear, dulling spray,
and dust.

935
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,261
It's time for me
to leave my team on day one,

936
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,762
and I'm feeling pretty good,

937
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:28,465
but I'm hoping some of the molds
can get done so that tomorrow

938
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,834
we can get these characters
pre-painted.

939
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,036
Even though we're here to coach
and guide them,

940
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:36,573
ultimately they have to do
things for themselves.

941
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,609
We're out. Bye!

942
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,049
We're running out of time,

943
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,385
so as soon
as Jamie's done with the face

944
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,855
I take it into the mold room
and start molding it.

945
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,690
It's really important
to get this face out today,

946
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,327
because we want to be able
to have a foam latex piece

947
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,595
to put up against the cowl

948
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,265
and know exactly where that edge
line is so we know if we

949
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,934
need to bring the cowl forward
or push it back any further.

950
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,538
You know how it goes.

951
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,039
I would just get
this done and finished,

952
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,609
and then we can worry
about other stuff tomorrow.

953
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,579
Yeah. What I'm doing today
is a lot of fabrication.

954
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,614
I need to do a chest plate
for the arachnid,

955
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:19,716
and I still have to work
on our invading alien.

956
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,084
I have to work on weapons,

957
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,986
so I wanted to get as much done
as possible.

958
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,988
I'm gonna go on the arm
like this.

959
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,023
Awesome.

960
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,462
I just did them
like little pockets

961
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,197
and then, like,
tapered them down.

962
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,133
My face sculpt
is all blocked out.

963
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,402
I'm starting to go
into a little bit of detail.

964
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,271
We should definitely add,
like, the dryness--

965
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,306
the texture to it.

966
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,174
To, like,
at least the outer edges

967
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,642
- on this side I think.
- Yeah.

968
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,045
Darla's right next to me
working on the younger alien,

969
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,380
so I'm taking Laura's advice

970
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,716
and I'm looking back and forth
at both of them

971
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,786
and making sure they look like
they're from the same planet.

972
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,188
Hey, everybody,
it's 30 minutes!

973
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,500
So I have a couple more things
to do tomorrow.

974
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,703
That's time, everybody.

975
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,071
Wow.

976
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,472
It's the end of the day,

977
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,140
and I'm very happy

978
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,943
with the way that
the new sculpture is coming out,

979
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,912
but we have no molds done,

980
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,876
and Rob is still working
on the fabrication.

981
00:41:24,514 --> 00:41:26,448
So I'm really nervous
about tomorrow

982
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:28,517
because we still have a lot
of work to do.

983
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:29,852
There's only two days left,

984
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:32,254
and I don't know
how we're gonna get it done.

985
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:43,521
Uh-oh.

986
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:45,957
Hey, guys.

987
00:41:45,991 --> 00:41:48,493
Come on in and gather round.

988
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:50,295
Oh, my God.

989
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:51,296
Real monkeys!

990
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,530
There's monkeys!

991
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:54,199
It's crazy!

992
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:57,468
Wait, where's my sculpture?

993
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,805
I have another big surprise
for you.

994
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,074
There's a huge piece
of information

995
00:42:03,108 --> 00:42:04,542
that I didn't share
with you yesterday.

996
00:42:04,577 --> 00:42:06,377
Oh, no.

997
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:07,445
There's something happening,

998
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:08,479
and I don't know what it is,

999
00:42:08,514 --> 00:42:10,348
but things
are about to get real.

1000
00:42:10,382 --> 00:42:12,717
Even the coaches
don't know what's going on.

1001
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:14,152
This is completely crazy.

1002
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:18,187
Your spacecraft
didn't crash-land on Earth.

1003
00:42:18,188 --> 00:42:20,030
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

1004
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:23,061
It crash-landed on a planet
controlled by primates

1005
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:27,131
who are not happy
to see your alien invaders.

1006
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:30,935
So you'll each be choosing
one of these simians

1007
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:35,763
as inspiration
for a third character.

1008
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:38,124
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1009
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:40,278
We had a plan,

1010
00:42:40,312 --> 00:42:43,548
and now that's out the door.

1011
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:46,150
I can feel the nerves
radiating off of my team.

1012
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:47,861
This is already
a tough challenge,

1013
00:42:47,862 --> 00:42:50,071
and now it's gonna
get a little tougher.

1014
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:54,002
Everything changes,
and I'm freaking out.

1015
00:42:54,003 --> 00:42:56,058
This competition,
it's unbelievable.

1016
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:57,669
We're going to be in trouble.

1017
