1
00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:02,005
I think you hit it
out of the park.

2
00:00:02,039 --> 00:00:04,674
I don't feel this is
a very successful makeup.

3
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:07,110
You could not have
done a better job.

4
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:08,711
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:10,613
Stephanie and Kelly's
mechanical housewife

6
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:13,449
brought Stephanie her first win,

7
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:15,952
but Regina stumbled
and was the first on Team Rayce

8
00:00:15,986 --> 00:00:17,186
to be sent home.

9
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:23,760
Now 11 artists remain,

10
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:26,796
and tonight they'll dive
into the world of fantasy...

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,165
- Oh, my gosh.
- How much do we have?

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,833
- Not much time.
- Damn it, damn it, damn it.

13
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:32,235
I am worried for Kelly
on this one.

14
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:33,436
And witness the genius

15
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,271
of Hollywood's
greatest creature actor.

16
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:36,572
Hello.

17
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:39,275
This is amazing.
Doug Jones is one-of-a-kind.

18
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,911
This is something I would be
proud to wear myself on film.

19
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:43,346
In the end, only one

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,982
will win a VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

21
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:48,551
to one of their 85
international locations,

22
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:51,654
a brand new 2015 Fiat 500,

23
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,656
and $100,000.

24
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:57,593

00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:35,398
What do you guys want?

27
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:36,532
Bacon sounds delicious.

28
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,403
Two bottom looks in a row.

29
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:42,138
I'm frigging determined
at this point.

30
00:01:42,172 --> 00:01:44,707
I'm the only person
in the house, other than Adam,

31
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:47,410
who's had two bottom looks.

32
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,011
Yeah, that sucks.

33
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:51,547
I cannot afford
to be in bottom this week.

34
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:52,648
I'm sick of being on bottom.

35
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:53,883
I want to be on top again.

36
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:55,952
I need to show showcase
what I can do.

37
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:57,987
I have a lot
to prove at this point.

38
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,722
I'm just gonna
do what I want to do,

39
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:00,923
what I think is gonna look good.

40
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,692
I'm gonna make it to the finale.

41
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:13,136
- Yes!
- Look at that bridge.

42
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,237
Ooh, wonderful!

43
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:15,671
We're walking
down the LA River...

44
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:16,672
This is exciting.

45
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:17,940
...and all I can think is,

46
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:19,809
"So many movies have shot here."

47
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,043
It's amazing.

48
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:22,478
This place is awesome.

49
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:26,048
However, I actually have no clue
what we're gonna be doing.

50
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,218
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

51
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,053
It's here, underneath
these iconic bridges

52
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:32,355
at the LA River,

53
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,557
that the Terminator himself
hopped on his Harley

54
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:39,195
and outran a T-1000 in James
Cameron's classic chase scene

55
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,196
from<i> Terminator 2.</i>

56
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,531
Hell yeah.

57
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:44,100
We might also recognize it
from movies like <i>Grease,</i>

58
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:46,402
<i>Chinatown,</i> and<i> Escape From LA.</i>

59
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:47,770
Yeah.

60
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:50,373
Bridges are a functional
necessity of everyday life,

61
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,942
but they can also
be design marvels,

62
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:54,544
becoming beautiful testaments

63
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:56,913
to mankind's engineering
achievements.

64
00:02:56,947 --> 00:03:00,550
However, in the world
of fantasy and fairy tales,

65
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:04,554
they're also home to a classic
mythological character...

66
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,155
Oh, my gosh.

67
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,156
Trolls.

68
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:09,192
Yay!

69
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:11,761
Trolls!

70
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:14,630
I can't describe
how excited I am.

71
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:18,301
According to myth,
these oafish but devious trolls

72
00:03:18,335 --> 00:03:20,803
lurk underneath bridges,
devouring those

73
00:03:20,838 --> 00:03:22,738
who dare to pass.

74
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:25,141
So, your spotlight challenge

75
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:28,077
is to select one
of these incredible bridges

76
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,812
and create the troll
that lives beneath it.

77
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,381
Oh, that's awesome.

78
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,983
Knowing that it's
a troll challenge,

79
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:35,051
it, like, clicks in my mind.

80
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:37,320
"Okay, this is awesome.
I can do this."

81
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:39,322
I love all things fantasy.

82
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:42,525
The choices are the Golden
Gate Bridge in San Francisco,

83
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,393
Tower Bridge in London,

84
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:46,929
Corvin Castle Bridge
in Transylvania,

85
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:50,766
Dragon Bridge at the Monkey
Forest Sanctuary in Bali,

86
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:52,668
Helix Bridge in Singapore,

87
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,071
and Python Bridge in Amsterdam.

88
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:56,506
Adam, you're up first.

89
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,508
Select your bridge.

90
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,590
Now, before you start
working on your designs,

91
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,426
I've got a big surprise for you.

92
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:18,928
The character and the movement

93
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:21,664
of a troll is key
to how they express themselves,

94
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:22,899
and I really want to make sure

95
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,867
that your models
understand that,

96
00:04:24,902 --> 00:04:27,270
so on application day,

97
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:30,673
I'm bringing in a secret weapon
to help them out.

98
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:33,409
He happens to be
Hollywood's most sought-after

99
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,011
creature actor.

100
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:38,281
You've seen his incredible work
in<i> Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy,</i>

101
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:40,383
and<i> Fantastic Four</i>
<i>Rise Of The Silver Surfer.</i>

102
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,684
- Hellboy!
- You're kidding me.

103
00:04:41,718 --> 00:04:42,952
Doug Jones.

104
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:44,487
- Whoo!
- Oh!

105
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:46,556
That's going to be exciting
to have Doug Jones here.

106
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,225
He's behind all these amazing
characters and their movements.

107
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,660
I can't wait
to actually meet him

108
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:52,461
and hear what he has
to say to our models.

109
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:55,565
All right, it's time
to get started, guys.

110
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,767
Now, make sure you keep in mind

111
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:01,304
not only the architectural
design, but also the location

112
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:03,072
and cultural setting
of the bridge

113
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:04,874
when creating your trolls.

114
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:06,075
Good luck, guys.

115
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:07,109
See you!

116
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,455
I got the Helix Bridge
in Singapore.

117
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:21,190
Singapore used to be
a rain forest,

118
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:24,961
so my idea is that my troll
fell asleep in this rain forest,

119
00:05:24,995 --> 00:05:27,730
and wakes up
in this crazy modern society,

120
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:29,532
and he starts to genetically

121
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:32,602
modify himself to be able
to blend into the Helix Bridge.

122
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:39,008
I'm glad we finally
have a fantasy challenge.

123
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:41,310
I dig it.
That's my style.

124
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,980
Corvin Castle in Transylvania
was the inspiration

125
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:45,314
for Dracula's castle,

126
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,284
so I'm thinking that this troll
is a servant to Dracula.

127
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:49,885
He's going
to be very stone-colored,

128
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,221
matching the color
of the bridge itself.

129
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,526
I got the Corvin Castle Bridge.

130
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,562
My Transylvanian troll blends

131
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:02,031
into the willow trees
and attacks people

132
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:04,066
that Dracula doesn't approve of.

133
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,702
I'm gonna try and stick
with a gloomy, scary troll.

134
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:07,937
It's gonna be awesome.

135
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:11,707
The history
of the Dragon Bridge in Bali

136
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:14,610
is that the two statues
guarded the healing waters

137
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:15,745
that are beyond it,

138
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,580
so I decide that the troll

139
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:19,915
is camouflaged
by the trees and the moss,

140
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,351
and that he protects
the stone-like guardians.

141
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:27,857
I chose the Dragon Bridge
at the Monkey Sanctuary in Bali,

142
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:31,360
and my troll is a fallen warrior
that was given new life,

143
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:34,096
but his new life is the curse
of being a troll

144
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,197
and protecting the bridge.

145
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,667
The vines
create this hunched silhouette,

146
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,569
and the rest
of it will be brought to life

147
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,405
through costuming
and fabrications.

148
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,610
All right everybody,
let's go back to the lab.

149
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,884
Excited!

150
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:57,420
We get back to the lab,
and we pick our models,

151
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,121
and we have 5 1/2 hours
to work today.

152
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:04,593
Amsterdam originated
as a fishing village,

153
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,629
and so I'm making
a water-dwelling troll

154
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:09,031
who is tormenting the fishermen,

155
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:12,034
but I'm still not really
sold on anything right now,

156
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:13,869
so I have a lot
of work ahead of me.

157
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,342
Hi!

158
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:22,745
Come.

159
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,147
Rayce comes in, and he pulls
us together for a team meeting.

160
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:27,583
When it comes
to the conceptual stuff,

161
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:30,352
you guys have to think
where no one's thinking.

162
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:32,521
Reinvent trolls.

163
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:33,756
I want to make sure that no one

164
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,925
is doing
the traditional big nose.

165
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,860
If we've seen
those trolls before,

166
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:39,128
it's not gonna go well.

167
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:42,231
I have four people left,
and I really want to keep them,

168
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:43,566
so I'm really
pushing these guys.

169
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,700
- Okay?
- All right.

170
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:45,901
It's time to move, gentlemen.

171
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:47,103
All right.

172
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:48,604
Word up.

173
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:54,910
My bridge
is the Tower Bridge in London,

174
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,746
so I want to keep
the regal aspect of it.

175
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,980
My backstory is a prince

176
00:07:58,014 --> 00:07:59,482
that fell in love
with a princess,

177
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:02,118
but the king's not too happy
about their courtship,

178
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:03,886
so he turns him into the troll.

179
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,821
I'm really taking Rayce's
advice on this one,

180
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,991
and I'm not going with
the traditional large forehead.

181
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:10,493
I'm extending the back
of the head,

182
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:12,361
and I want to add horns
to the top.

183
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,497
So hopefully I can make
it stand out.

184
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:16,031
I'm really excited
about this piece.

185
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,775
I'm gonna
incorporate the cliff texture

186
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:30,579
into doing a
shoulder-chest-back, one piece.

187
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:34,083
My concept is a girl jumped
off the Golden Gate Bridge

188
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,284
during sunset.

189
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,553
Her body washed ashore
to the little island,

190
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:39,054
and became one of the rocks,

191
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,991
and she climbs up the bridge
during sunrise and sunset

192
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,225
to drag people down.

193
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,194
- Like, that kind of sunset...
- Yeah.

194
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,695
- ...fuse colors?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

195
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,265
Ooh, so more of a spritely
kind of character, I like it.

196
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,767
I want something
very lean, very feminine.

197
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,969
My coach, Laura,
is on board with it,

198
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,304
so I'm gonna run with that.

199
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,705
I think you're in a good place.

200
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:00,309
- Hi, everybody!
- Hello.

201
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:01,310
- Hi.
- Hey.

202
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:02,845
Hello.

203
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,747
I'm gonna troll over here
and see what you're doing.

204
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:05,948
So, what bridge did you get?

205
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:08,117
So, I have the Python Bridge
in Amsterdam.

206
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:09,385
During the summertime,

207
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,587
children will play on the bridge
and jump into the water.

208
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:13,322
It'll actually look
like a regular girl,

209
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:15,624
but when she turns around,
she's this hideous troll.

210
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,560
I've changed this probably
five times.

211
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:19,395
I think you've got
a great direction going.

212
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:21,197
You need more bulk,
though, in the face.

213
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,365
You need to bring up the fantasy
and the character in it.

214
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,533
Right.

215
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:27,136
My bridge
is the Tower Bridge in London,

216
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,840
and my troll is this mother
whose child died on the bridge,

217
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:34,443
so she will forever haunt
this bridge in revenge.

218
00:09:34,477 --> 00:09:36,645
Your technique
for your sculpture is great,

219
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,748
but I think you need to pull
a little bit more troll into it.

220
00:09:39,783 --> 00:09:41,750
Give her some more lower lip.

221
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,385
This could have
more weight to it.

222
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,820
It could even be
a little bulbous,

223
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:46,455
as opposed
to trying to make it narrow.

224
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:47,690
Awesome. Thank you so much.

225
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:49,391
I got the Golden Gate Bridge.

226
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:51,527
San Francisco burned
to the ground in the mid-1800s,

227
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:54,430
so I'm giving the toll
a burned look,

228
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:55,564
and he's wearing a mask

229
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:57,433
to worship the crows
of San Francisco.

230
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:58,901
I think your
sculpture looks great.

231
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,202
You can paint this,

232
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:03,172
and get black down into
those crevices and everything,

233
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:05,441
and then dry brush,
or with a sponge,

234
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,776
going over the top of it
and picking up highlights.

235
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,445
You want it to be
able to pop out.

236
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,579
Thanks very much.

237
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:13,082
I have the Python Bridge
in Amsterdam.

238
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:14,683
I would go
a little bit more traditional

239
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:16,285
with the troll nose.

240
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:17,853
- This is a fantasy character...
- Right.

241
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,889
...and so you can add
some depth to that.

242
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:20,890
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

243
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,091
All right.
Thank you so much.

244
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,792
I have the Dragon Bridge.

245
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:25,027
Oh, and you have it right here.

246
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,229
I just want to incorporate
a lot of the moss,

247
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,431
and a lot of the greenery
in there.

248
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:31,934
Don't cover it
with so much vegetation

249
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,302
that you can't see it at all.

250
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:35,304
When you apply it,
there should be some thought

251
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:38,240
of how this is, like,
the branches of the tree.

252
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,009
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.
- Thank you.

253
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:41,243
Bye, everybody.

254
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:42,278
- Bye.
- Bye.

255
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:43,646
See you under the bridge.

256
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:48,517
After Mr. Westmore leaves,
I start to bulk out the nose,

257
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:50,352
'cause that was one
of his first suggestions,

258
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:52,755
and I get kind of stuck.

259
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,890
This is totally throwing
me right now.

260
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,358
I talked to Laura about it...

261
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,060
Bring the nostrils in.

262
00:10:58,094 --> 00:10:59,762
I'm liking her ideas,

263
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:00,963
but at the same time,

264
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:03,599
I'm not seeing them
in my finished product,

265
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:05,467
so now I'm kind of at this wall.

266
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:06,828
_

267
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:07,836
_

268
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:09,138
I just hate it.

269
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:11,340
I can't figure this shit out.

270
00:11:11,374 --> 00:11:13,909
This could be the challenge
that puts me on the bottom

271
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,411
and sends me home.

272
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:16,412
I don't know.

273
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,257
It's day
one of the troll challenge,

274
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:28,126
and I'm at this wall.

275
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,962
I can't figure this shit out.

276
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,430
I just hate it.

277
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:35,367
I decided the best thing to do
is start blocking out the cowl.

278
00:11:37,036 --> 00:11:39,671
I've wasted five hours
of this challenge,

279
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:42,340
so I'm just really nervous,

280
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,908
and stressed, and frustrated.

281
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:47,812
I don't know how much texture
I'm thinking about.

282
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:49,814
If I can figure out
the shapes of the cowl,

283
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:51,983
then the face
might work itself out.

284
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:01,793
It's time
for us coaches to leave,

285
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:04,429
and I am most
worried about Darla.

286
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:07,365
I hope she's able to get
past this funk.

287
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,733
- Relax.
- Yeah.

288
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:11,302
- Tomorrow will be a better day.
- Exactly.

289
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:13,204
- Keep rolling on it.
- Thanks, man.

290
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,205
I appreciate it.

291
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,273
Great job today.

292
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:22,514
Logan, how much time
do we have left?

293
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:23,648
30 minutes.

294
00:12:23,683 --> 00:12:25,483
Rayce says not to do
what's expected,

295
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,952
so I'm making
one side very rocky,

296
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:30,321
but then what I'm having
is the rocks start to fade off

297
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:33,091
into these very smooth,
angular shapes,

298
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,330
because they have
such a modern society

299
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:37,533
that he's trying to fit in.

300
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,735
Hopefully the judges
are going to understand

301
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:40,769
what I'm trying to do.

302
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:43,872
That's time, everybody.

303
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:49,078
I just feel like
they're not gonna be able

304
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:50,646
to look at it and just get it.

305
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,949
I'm thinking, "Am I
doing something wrong?"

306
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:57,386
I am so nervous for tomorrow.

307
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,530
And so it begins.

308
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,066
So, it's day two
of our bridge troll challenge.

309
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:12,835
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

310
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:14,103
- Good morning!
- Hello.

311
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,042
There are a lot of trees
around the bridge,

312
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:23,011
so I want to incorporate the
wood texture into the sculpt.

313
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,281
I have done wood texture before.

314
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:29,585
It's really difficult, but I
can't play it safe anymore.

315
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,820
I like it a lot.

316
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:32,855
I like it too.

317
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,628
I want to try
to bring it back a little bit,

318
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,448
just so you have
a good edge there.

319
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,498
With only three people
left in the competition,

320
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:44,899
I really don't want
to go down to two.

321
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:48,303
Luckily, Ben, Kelly,
and Jamie are very talented,

322
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:50,605
so I'm confident in my team.

323
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,309
This is your
best sculpture yet.

324
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,311
Yeah, I'm really happy
with the forms

325
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:57,845
that are happening on this face.

326
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,547
I'm feeling better
about my sculpture.

327
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:00,848
It's a big risk

328
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:03,284
not going with, like,
the very traditional troll,

329
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,453
but I'm staying positive,
and I'm staying confident,

330
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:08,022
and I'm just going to keep going
and hope for the best.

331
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:14,362
Looking at the reference photo
of the Golden Gate,

332
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,700
there's a little island that has
more of a rocky style to it,

333
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:21,803
so I decided to use rock texture
on my sculpts.

334
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:24,872
It's definitely
gonna be different,

335
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,240
but I am happy with my sculpt,

336
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:27,809
so I'm gonna run
into the mold room

337
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,510
and start molding everything.

338
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:32,747
It's not my favorite,

339
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:34,115
but it's all right.

340
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,116
I'll get pieces done,

341
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,851
and I'll do a killer paint job,

342
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,152
and it'll be all fine.

343
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,688
I'm working hard
on these sculpts,

344
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:44,058
and I'm still not in love
with either one of them,

345
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,328
but at this point I know I don't
have time to change my mind.

346
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:49,464
I just need to get these
into the mold room

347
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,599
so that I have pieces
on application day.

348
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,876
Trolls usually
tend to be a nasty creature,

349
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,778
but I'm trying
to incorporate playfulness,

350
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:06,481
so I want her to have
a big beer-belly on her.

351
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:11,552
When I come in tomorrow,
I'll cut open the swimsuit

352
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,421
and expose some of the sculpt
that I've done.

353
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,357
Hopefully this complete change
will show the judges

354
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:18,192
that I'm able to create
something that's fun.

355
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,833
This is a very big cowl.

356
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,669
I'm extending the back
of the head a little bit,

357
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:30,471
and I want to add horns
to the top.

358
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:33,365
I'm a little worried
that it looks kind of alien-ish.

359
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,379
I'm not going
too troll on this one.

360
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:36,678
But it's kind of too late
to change my idea.

361
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:37,779
I've got to go with this.

362
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,380
I kind of
like the head shape, Rob.

363
00:15:39,415 --> 00:15:40,381
Yeah?

364
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,382
Rayce is liking the sculpt.

365
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:42,817
He kind of likes
the elongated head.

366
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:43,918
I'm going with his instinct,

367
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:45,319
and I'm rolling ahead with it.

368
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:47,488
Just keep cracking on it,
and keep watching that clock

369
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:49,557
to make sure you're getting
in there when you need to.

370
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,659
- Good luck!
- Yes, thank you.

371
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:53,194
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, guys.

372
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,405
I build the back piece
on a mannequin

373
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,707
for the character's silhouette,

374
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:07,842
and the first thing I do
is I grab a block of foam

375
00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:09,477
and begin to shape it
like a hump.

376
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:16,084
Because the troll lives
under the Dragon Bridge in Bali,

377
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:19,220
the back piece is going
to be consisted of large vines,

378
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:21,456
and hemp, and leaves,

379
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,623
and some snake textures,

380
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:25,193
so that it looks
like one cohesive design.

381
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,769
I took my face to open it,

382
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,738
and my mold doesn't go anywhere.

383
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:40,041
Oh my God, it's locked.

384
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:43,244
If this doesn't open up,
I don't have a face.

385
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,415
I leave it aside because I
don't want to think about it,

386
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:48,716
I want to work
on something else,

387
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,618
so I start to open
the chest mold...

388
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:53,488
If you can just
press down on that.

389
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:55,189
Logan helps me get it out.

390
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,125
Oh, shit.

391
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,594
Okay, you definitely
have a crack.

392
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:00,995
Great, it's cracking.

393
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:02,230
Oh my God.

394
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,767
I don't have time to fix this.

395
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:09,170
I don't think I'm gonna
have my molds done.

396
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:10,304
Shit.

397
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,373
I'm just feeling
so afraid right now,

398
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,209
because I won't have
any pieces tomorrow.

399
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,178
I don't know what to do.

400
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,244
It's day two of our
troll challenge.

401
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,579
My face mold's locked,

402
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,447
and my torso mold is cracked.

403
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:29,448
Shit.

404
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,584
This is such a train wreck.

405
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,487
I need to get the face out
no matter what.

406
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,589
Ben takes the chisel
and starts hammering it,

407
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:39,225
but it's still not opening up.

408
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,261
Finally, somehow, it pops open.

409
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,130
Thank you so much.

410
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,898
I feel so much better,

411
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,101
but now I don't have time
to fix my torso mold.

412
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,270
I take it to the pressure
washer, clean it out,

413
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:52,705
and put it back together,

414
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,874
but because the mold
is so beaten-up,

415
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,876
the foam latex
is gonna be a mess,

416
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,345
and trimming and patching
is gonna be very difficult

417
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,547
and time-consuming.

418
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,050
All right, everybody.
That's time.

419
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,486
I'm so flustered
and just disappointed.

420
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,489
Application day is a disaster.

421
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,700
It's application day.

422
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,468
We have four hours in the lab

423
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:25,571
and one hour for last looks.

424
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,374
Doug Jones is going to be
interacting with our models

425
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,677
to get them more
into this troll character,

426
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,378
and I can't wait.

427
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:33,913
- What's up, man?
- Bam!

428
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,048
Oh, gosh.

429
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,251
I look at my foam, and...

430
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,619
This is not good.

431
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:41,754
I've never seen foam this thick.

432
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:44,338
My edges are horrific.

433
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,107
Yeah.
It'll take a little time.

434
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:48,876
I have to make it work.

435
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,882
- Hi!
- It's so good to see you!

436
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,383
This is gonna be so much fun.

437
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,786
My confidence level
today is way up here.

438
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,788
This is really important
for me to show the judges

439
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:03,090
that I can not only sculpt,
but I can also paint too.

440
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:05,292
It's gonna be much better
to lay in your light colors

441
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:06,493
over the top.

442
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:08,662
I'm not doing
the traditional green troll.

443
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,030
I want to make it different.

444
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,332
Team Rayce getting
their paint on.

445
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,538
I want to incorporate
a lot of that tan look

446
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:19,173
that you see in the trees,
and the roots,

447
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,541
and the dark crevices,

448
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,776
and I want him to be able
to camouflage into the setting.

449
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,478
_

450
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,397
_

451
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:31,485
I blended the edges somewhat,

452
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,220
but it's taking forever.

453
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:35,656
Start painting
in the next half an hour.

454
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:39,927
I'm sweating bullets,
because I'm so far behind.

455
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,362
So I just start paining
as fast as I can.

456
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,101
Hello!

457
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,107
Hey, hey!

458
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,548
This is amazing.
Here he is, Doug Jones.

459
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:51,832
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

460
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:54,204
Can we just see what you're
all coming up with today.

461
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:55,338
He's one of a kind.

462
00:19:55,373 --> 00:19:58,074
He can bring a simple
character to life

463
00:19:58,109 --> 00:19:59,509
in just a matter of movements,

464
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,044
and now he's directing
our models

465
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,712
on how to become our trolls.

466
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:03,747
It's really an honor.

467
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:05,782
What happened here?
You poor thing.

468
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,851
He's a prince
that's been cursed.

469
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,887
The live-in stance
would be the regal posture,

470
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,890
but what's gonna sell the shame
might be in the head itself.

471
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,359
Like, if the head
hangs from time to time,

472
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,128
while you're keeping
the proud chest, you know?

473
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:19,729
Like you're walking
into the court room,

474
00:20:19,764 --> 00:20:21,131
but then you remember,
"Oh, right.

475
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,299
I'm a troll now."

476
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:25,301
I wouldn't rock so much.

477
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:27,504
Make your movement
very definite.

478
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:29,005
You know what I'm saying?
Right?

479
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,807
Argh!
That's what I'm talking about.

480
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,009
If this was a remnant
of my son that I lost,

481
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:34,978
it would be a clutch
and a love for this.

482
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:36,713
- That is so cool.
- That is awesome.

483
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:39,416
- Oh.
- Get fluid in the arms.

484
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,484
That's beautiful.
It's more tree-branchy.

485
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,020
It seems like that might even
be a more jittery motion.

486
00:20:44,055 --> 00:20:45,789
You know, when I did
<i>Pan's Labyrinth,</i> for instance,

487
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:46,923
the faun was part tree,

488
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,526
so there was a sort
of a ricketiness to him.

489
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,027
So you're gonna help sell this

490
00:20:51,062 --> 00:20:52,896
with that climbing
instinct, right?

491
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,464
Like, if you wanted
to come up like this,

492
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:57,227
and sort of use the air
as something to climb on...

493
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,803
- Oh, I like that!
- ...while you're facing us.

494
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,929
My model is practically
screaming.

495
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,899
She's so excited.

496
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,370
It's really nice
having his input.

497
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:05,906
See? Okay.
You knock 'em alive, okay?

498
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,408
There's many, many combinations
of posture we can do.

499
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,377
You can-- We have shoulders,
we have the back,

500
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,845
we have the lower back,
upper back,

501
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:14,080
we got the neck, neck, neck.

502
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:18,618
If you're coming out
with a reveal, give us a "Ugh."

503
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,487
You know what I mean? Ugh.

504
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:22,722
I would be proud
of this for sure, right?

505
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:25,292
Look at it,
look at us, show it off.

506
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,928
This way, this way, this way,
that way, that way, that way.

507
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:30,497
And then maybe
back down again, right?

508
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:31,565
Find the child in you,

509
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,833
'cause you want
to fit in with the kids.

510
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,134
One of these kind of things

511
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,169
is gonna help sell the whole--
Yeah, there you go.

512
00:21:36,204 --> 00:21:37,871
Sassy, sassy, playful, playful.

513
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,574
Whee, whee, whee!

514
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:42,142
All right everybody,
thank you so much.

515
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,543
- We'll see you soon.
- Thank you.

516
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:44,978
Okay, bye.

517
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,789
Your transitions
are looking good.

518
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:57,123
- You like it?
- Yeah.

519
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:59,092
I definitely want to be able
to show that my troll

520
00:21:59,126 --> 00:22:01,728
is changing
into this Helix Bridge,

521
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:04,264
so I'm using the dark
bluish-grey on the rock side,

522
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:06,166
and I'm using the lightish grey
on the metal side

523
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,835
to show that he
is genetically altering himself.

524
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,170
Look that way for me.

525
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,939
I take a step back
and look at my paint job,

526
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:15,175
and I see
the transition happening.

527
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,209
Sick.

528
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:23,350
For the paint, I want
to make it look like flesh

529
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:24,918
and match the model's skin.

530
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,686
My troll
is definitely different.

531
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,855
I'm not sure if I went
in the right direction or not,

532
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,957
but I like
what I've created so far.

533
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,666
Everybody, ten minutes!

534
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,368
At the end of the day,
I'm coming in

535
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,836
with my layer of pax--

536
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,739
definitely getting
some really sweet tones--

537
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:46,740
and then...

538
00:22:46,774 --> 00:22:48,675
It's looking kind of muddy.

539
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:49,743
Great.

540
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:52,245
All of the sweet
colors that I chose

541
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,149
bleed into one solid brown mess.

542
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,551
You don't know where
the costume ends and she starts.

543
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,320
Now I have to go
in a completely different

544
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:01,821
direction with my paint.

545
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:03,390
- How much do we have?
- Not much time.

546
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,524
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

547
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:05,992
I am worried for Kelly
on this one,

548
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,928
and I do not want to lose
another person this week.

549
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:10,330
She still has
a lot of work to do.

550
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:12,032
That's time, everybody.

551
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:15,602
Holy crap, I am going to have
to fix this hot mess

552
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:16,970
in last looks.

553
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,004
I'm screwed.

554
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:27,524
So it's last looks,

555
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,626
we have one hour left,

556
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,027
and I got to get
those contacts in,

557
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:31,462
and I have to
finish the paint job,

558
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:33,764
and it's definitely going
to be eating up my entire hour.

559
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:36,867
Open your eyes.

560
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:39,236
I have to finish
painting the face,

561
00:23:39,271 --> 00:23:40,771
finish painting the body,

562
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:44,475
and I'm just slopping
on color as fast as I can.

563
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:47,011
Moss everywhere!

564
00:23:47,045 --> 00:23:48,679
I'm grabbing moss

565
00:23:48,713 --> 00:23:51,048
and just throwing it on,
because without the moss,

566
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:53,684
he doesn't camouflage into the
setting of the Dragon Bridge.

567
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:55,152
Anything else I'm missing?

568
00:23:57,622 --> 00:23:59,456
I just want to dirty
up her arms,

569
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:01,292
and make her as nasty
as possible

570
00:24:01,326 --> 00:24:02,693
to change up my colors.

571
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:03,894
Ten minutes, everybody!

572
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:14,238
That's time, everybody!

573
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:18,342
I'm noticing that mine
looks like no one else's.

574
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:19,576
It's really starting to sink in

575
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,011
that I really
could be going home.

576
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:35,125
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

577
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,562
Now, as you know, one of you
will be going home tonight,

578
00:24:38,596 --> 00:24:40,197
but before we see
your creations,

579
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:41,899
let's say hello
to our series judges.

580
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:42,900
Glenn Hetrick.

581
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,501
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

582
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:45,803
Ve Neill.

583
00:24:45,837 --> 00:24:47,538
- Howdy.
- How are you?

584
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,540
- And Neville Page.
- Hello.

585
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:50,708
Hello.

586
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:53,844
And of course,
we have the very special guest

587
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:55,546
that I mentioned to you
a couple days ago.

588
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,948
He's a fantastically
talented actor

589
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:01,251
and one of Hollywood's
most in-demand creature actors.

590
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:03,887
Please welcome
the phenomenal Doug Jones.

591
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:06,156
Thank you. Hi.

592
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,727
That's a tough intro
to live up to, but thank you.

593
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:12,134
It's so great
to have you back on this show.

594
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,317
Thank you for being here.

595
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:14,924
Boy, it's great to be back.
Thank you for having me.

596
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,826
Now, how did your time
go with the models today?

597
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,694
Oh, goodness.
A great time with the models.

598
00:25:18,728 --> 00:25:20,196
It was really exciting to see

599
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,131
the love they have
for putting on these creatures

600
00:25:22,165 --> 00:25:23,699
to make your creations
come to life.

601
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,734
All right, well you
saw the makeups in progress...

602
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:26,869
I did, I did.

603
00:25:26,903 --> 00:25:28,237
So let's see
how they turned out.

604
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,628
Seeing Megan with
that backdrop makes it work.

605
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:54,363
I'm proud of what's onstage.

606
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:14,950
I'm definitely not happy
with how the face turned out,

607
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:16,752
so I'm just hoping for the best,

608
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:19,023
and we'll see
what the judges say.

609
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:40,322
He matches the culture
and the history of Singapore,

610
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:42,758
and that's what I set out to do,
and that's what I accomplished.

611
00:26:58,975 --> 00:26:59,941
It looks pretty cool.

612
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:01,243
The silhouette's there--

613
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:02,411
I'm happy with it.

614
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:21,963
It's a little bit rough,

615
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:24,299
but I did execute the vision.

616
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,702
I'm at least proud that I was
able to get this much work done.

617
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:46,121
Mine looks like no one else's.

618
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:48,023
I really thought
outside the box,

619
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,325
and I'm just hoping that the
judges are with me on this one.

620
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,910
I'm not 100% happy
with the sculpt,

621
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:11,046
but I'm really happy
with the paint job.

622
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,481
I think he's really
looking good.

623
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:33,590
Doug Jones brought my character
to a whole other level.

624
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,759
She looks creepy, crawly,

625
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:38,228
and I love it.

626
00:28:54,812 --> 00:28:56,313
I don't know where I stand,

627
00:28:56,347 --> 00:28:58,648
because mine doesn't look
anything like anybody else's.

628
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:00,717
I could either be on top,

629
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:01,918
or I could be on the bottom.

630
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,439
I feel like my model could be
moving a little bit more,

631
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:23,540
but I really like her.

632
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:25,575
I think she could be a top look.

633
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:45,112
I think it looks fantastic.

634
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:46,781
She sells it very well,

635
00:29:46,815 --> 00:29:49,383
and I'm totally sold
on my own character.

636
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:50,851
I'm sorry, I love it.

637
00:29:55,324 --> 00:29:57,491
Okay, judges,
it's time for a closer look.

638
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:05,633
There's these hard edges
that don't even, shape-wise,

639
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:08,002
go into the anatomy;
that's a big problem.

640
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:11,205
It's also not sculpted
literal enough to tell us

641
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:12,440
that it is rock.

642
00:30:12,474 --> 00:30:13,808
Yeah, I think you're right.

643
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:18,179
Can you turn to the side?

644
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,781
It's the round, spherical shape
that I struggle with,

645
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:23,484
and I'm not sure
how that communicates troll.

646
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,652
Yeah.

647
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:26,487
I have no idea what
the judges are thinking.

648
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:28,422
I know the sculpts
don't look good,

649
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:31,192
but I hope they
don't hate them too much,

650
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:32,426
because I don't want to go home.

651
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,498
Tell us who made your favorite
fantasy troll tonight

652
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:39,734
on Twitter, using #FaceOff.

653
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,901
I'm not sure
how that spherical shape

654
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:46,652
communicates troll.

655
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:48,648
I'm just not a fan of
the sculpts that I did,

656
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:50,480
and that makes me
a little bit worried.

657
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:53,015
My favorite part about
this whole makeup is the color.

658
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,984
- I agree.
- Good job selling it.

659
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,488
I just don't even understand
what's going on.

660
00:30:58,522 --> 00:30:59,856
It's morphing.

661
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,458
But there's no line
of demarcation with colors;

662
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,227
you can't tell
that it's morphing.

663
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:05,528
Yeah, it's pretty rough.

664
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,598
I think it's
a gorgeous sculpture.

665
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:10,833
It looks like a caricature
drawing to me.

666
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,201
From the boardwalk, yeah.

667
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:14,937
- Yeah, from the boardwalk.
- Totally, totally, yeah.

668
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:16,439
There's some really rough forms

669
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:18,441
covered by some
really good paint.

670
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:22,345
And that head shape
is not even remotely troll-like.

671
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:26,082
There's some
really beautiful color.

672
00:31:26,116 --> 00:31:28,451
Lovely job.

673
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,623
I love this hybrid of, like,
woodsy-barky-dragony together.

674
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:34,657
Love that chest.

675
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:35,725
It's beautiful.

676
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:38,561
To the right, please.

677
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:42,765
It doesn't seem appropriate
for a troll to me.

678
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,435
It's very bizarre
that this is so bright red.

679
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:46,803
Thank you.
It's great.

680
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:52,909
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

681
00:31:52,943 --> 00:31:54,706
Let's find out
what they thought.

682
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,808
Adam,

683
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,409
Darla,

684
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:00,545
Stephanie,

685
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,547
Logan,

686
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:05,383
Julian,

687
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:08,252
you are all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

688
00:32:08,287 --> 00:32:09,320
Nice work this week.

689
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:10,421
Thanks.

690
00:32:12,825 --> 00:32:13,825
Good job.

691
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:15,893
Now the rest of you

692
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:18,396
were the best
and the worst this week,

693
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,631
and the judges would like
to speak with each of you

694
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:21,799
to learn more about your work.

695
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:24,068
Kelly, could you please step up?

696
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:33,044
Explain how your bridge
inspired your design this week.

697
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,679
Her child
was working on the bridge,

698
00:32:34,713 --> 00:32:39,517
and he falls to his death,
and it drove her completely mad,

699
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:42,120
and so she's just
forever cursing this bridge.

700
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:44,355
I think you did
an astounding job.

701
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,224
Thank you.

702
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:49,427
You've made proficient use
of your model's features.

703
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:51,129
I really like
what you did this week.

704
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:52,530
Thank you so much.

705
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:53,831
It's very monotone,

706
00:32:53,866 --> 00:32:56,267
which is absolutely okay,
because she just seems

707
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,469
like she's become
at one with this bridge.

708
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,905
- Nice job.
- Thank you so much.

709
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,940
It doesn't feel troll-like,

710
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:07,078
but I do like how you've
completed this as a character.

711
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,280
- It's pretty solid.
- Thank you.

712
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:12,049
Nayeli, your performance
is absolutely perfect.

713
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:14,452
- Beautiful job, both of you.
- Thank you.

714
00:33:14,486 --> 00:33:16,020
Kelly,
if you'd please step back.

715
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,725
_

716
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:23,060
- Good job, Kelly.
- Thank you.

717
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:24,962
Anthony.

718
00:33:30,536 --> 00:33:33,571
Tell me how the Helix Bridge
inspired your character.

719
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:37,341
My character was a troll who
used to live in the rainforest,

720
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:41,012
but he fell asleep, and woke up
in this crazy modern society,

721
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:43,648
so he started to genetically
alter his features

722
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:45,383
in order to hide
under the new bridge.

723
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:48,453
This guy doesn't look like he
belongs with that bridge at all.

724
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:55,059
I couldn't figure out if he was
supposed to be metal or rock.

725
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:57,462
- I just don't get it.
- Okay.

726
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:59,964
This transition
is the biggest problem.

727
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,300
It's just all one grey
textural thing.

728
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,871
I see a little bit
of confusion in the sculpt,

729
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:09,273
and I think it's
because of a lack

730
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,409
of a clearly-identified
goal for yourself.

731
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:14,378
Anthony, please step down.

732
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:21,686
All right, let's talk to Ben.

733
00:34:27,426 --> 00:34:30,595
Tell us how your bridge
inspired this troll.

734
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:31,729
During the summertime,

735
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:33,564
kids will actually come
and play on the bridge.

736
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,066
She's a fun troll,

737
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,468
and I wanted to do something
a little more fun and whimsical.

738
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:40,071
Excellent, 'cause
that's why I love this.

739
00:34:40,105 --> 00:34:41,072
Thank you.

740
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:42,773
I really applaud

741
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:45,943
the courage to do something
that may not work.

742
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:47,879
Love it, and I love
how you're thinking.

743
00:34:47,913 --> 00:34:49,180
Thank you.

744
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,282
I love the whimsy,
I love the laughter of it all,

745
00:34:51,316 --> 00:34:52,717
and Alexandria,

746
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:55,553
you have brought such playful,
childlike attitude to this.

747
00:34:55,587 --> 00:34:58,656
As an actor, I would love
to work on film with you.

748
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,992
I think it's the best work
I've seen you do.

749
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:04,088
Super strong decisions
in terms of detail.

750
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:06,150
Everything on that face
is working for me.

751
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,259
Thank you.

752
00:35:07,294 --> 00:35:08,861
Ben, please step back.

753
00:35:13,934 --> 00:35:15,401
Emily, please come forward.

754
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,509
Talk to me
about the Golden Gate Bridge

755
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:25,244
influencing this troll.

756
00:35:25,278 --> 00:35:27,813
The story is that she
jumped off the bridge,

757
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:30,482
and her body washed ashore
to one of the little islands,

758
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:33,819
and she transformed
into that rock texture.

759
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:37,556
I would rather not see the
skin-to-prosthetic transitions,

760
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:39,258
but the paint job
I think is gorgeous.

761
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,260
Your choice of colors
and complimentary colors

762
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:42,895
is beautiful.

763
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:45,598
I get that you
took huge risks this week,

764
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:47,132
but they didn't pay off.

765
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:50,536
I'm bumping on the abrupt
transitions really hard.

766
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:53,906
This doesn't fit
into the troll thing for me.

767
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,374
It's a beautiful character,

768
00:35:55,408 --> 00:35:58,677
it's just not a beautiful
character for this challenge.

769
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:00,012
I agree.

770
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:01,614
Emily, you can head back.

771
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,254
Rob, please step up.

772
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:17,696
Please give us the backstory
to your bridge-inspired troll.

773
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:20,199
This is a prince that fell
in love with a princess,

774
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,235
but her father didn't like the
courtship that they were having,

775
00:36:23,269 --> 00:36:24,570
so he put a curse on him.

776
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:28,440
The underlying form
is extraordinarily flawed.

777
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,911
I actually love your paint job,

778
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:35,047
but unfortunately,
there's not a whole lot

779
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:37,850
happening here anatomically
to tell me it's a troll,

780
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:39,018
or more importantly,

781
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:43,822
to communicate
a successful makeup effect.

782
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:45,324
It looks like a pullover mask.

783
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:47,226
It's got too much
going on back here,

784
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,028
when it should've been
going on up here.

785
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:50,796
It just missed for me
this week, Rob.

786
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:51,797
Okay.

787
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:54,199
Rob, please step down.

788
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:00,572
_

789
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:01,840
Jamie, please come forward.

790
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:12,418
Tell us how the Dragon Bridge
in Bali inspired your character.

791
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:14,720
There are statues
of good and evil

792
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,588
that protect the bridge.

793
00:37:16,623 --> 00:37:19,391
This is actually the protector
of those guardians.

794
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:21,060
I think it's really well done.

795
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:25,064
Your paint job
is really beautiful.

796
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:26,465
Thank you.

797
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:29,068
I think that you've achieved
a plausible wood sculpt,

798
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:30,536
and that's not easy to do.

799
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,970
Thank you.

800
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:34,339
This is something I would be
proud to wear, myself, on film.

801
00:37:34,374 --> 00:37:36,642
The sculpt is
so incredibly detailed

802
00:37:36,676 --> 00:37:38,310
and gorgeous to look at.

803
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:39,812
You did a great job.
Beautiful.

804
00:37:39,846 --> 00:37:41,280
Thank you.

805
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:43,115
Jamie, please step back.

806
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:50,456
All right, coaches,
do you have anything

807
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,591
to say to the judges before
they make their decisions?

808
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,327
I apologize, guys--
Anthony and Rob.

809
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:58,030
I told my team the last thing
that I wanted them to do

810
00:37:58,064 --> 00:37:59,565
is go in the direction
of the big noses

811
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,900
and the big chins,
so I'm realizing now

812
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:03,469
that that was the wrong route.

813
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:06,772
A lot of those choices
were from my pushing.

814
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:07,773
Okay.

815
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,007
Please head back
to the makeup room

816
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,209
while the judges deliberate.

817
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:17,182
All right, judges,
why don't we talk

818
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,584
about your favorites this week?

819
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:20,519
- Let's start with Kelly.
- I love the pallet.

820
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:22,221
It had that real
washed-out look.

821
00:38:22,255 --> 00:38:23,489
It was fabulous.

822
00:38:23,523 --> 00:38:25,257
To pay that much
attention, head to toe,

823
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,391
I'm a big fan of hers.

824
00:38:26,426 --> 00:38:27,893
All right,
let's move on to Ben.

825
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:29,128
I loved the whimsy.

826
00:38:29,162 --> 00:38:30,829
I love that she wants
to fit in with the kids.

827
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:32,765
Creating those big,
fantastical proportions

828
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:35,467
and making them work
is extremely difficult.

829
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:36,802
Okay, what about Jamie?

830
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:40,506
She did an amazing job
bringing in the surroundings.

831
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,008
Beautiful paint job.
I loved the makeup.

832
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,944
Also the decision
to use a wood-carved sculpture.

833
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:48,046
Huge risk, great reward.

834
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,715
All right,
so let's move on to the makeups

835
00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:51,083
that didn't work for you.

836
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:52,551
Let's start with Anthony.

837
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:54,987
I think the paint job
is what was lacking for me.

838
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:56,455
If he would've
changed the color,

839
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:58,924
you would have realized it was
some sort of a transformation.

840
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,926
All right,
let's move on to Emily.

841
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,796
Hard ledges
that don't fit the anatomy,

842
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,131
and they have no blending edge
on them whatsoever.

843
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,834
There's no evidence
visually of troll.

844
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:09,935
- None.
- None.

845
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:12,004
All right,
let's move on to Rob.

846
00:39:12,038 --> 00:39:16,141
The thing I struggled the most
with was the overall form,

847
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:17,876
in side view in particular.

848
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:20,212
Rayce really did trip him up.

849
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:21,847
It looked too masky for me,

850
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:22,948
like it was slipped over,

851
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:24,983
and painted some dark eyes
on it, you know?

852
00:39:25,018 --> 00:39:26,852
All right judges,
have you made up your minds?

853
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,086
- We have.
- Okay.

854
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:29,121
Let's bring 'em back out.

855
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:40,299
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

856
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,967
Kelly,

857
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:44,169
I thought you did
a really convincing job

858
00:39:44,204 --> 00:39:45,804
with your painting,
and your character

859
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,607
as a whole was
creepy and compelling.

860
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:49,942
Ben,

861
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:51,376
what a bold choice,

862
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:54,046
to fully embrace the fantasy
aspect of this challenge

863
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,115
in such an exaggerated
and fun way.

864
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,483
And Jamie,

865
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:01,053
we love the wood texture
of your character.

866
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:04,089
We also thought you did a great
job embracing the culture

867
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:05,557
and the history of your bridge.

868
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:08,126
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

869
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:09,628
The winner
of this challenge is...

870
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,134
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

871
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,602
The winner
of this challenge is...

872
00:40:24,474 --> 00:40:25,474
Jamie.

873
00:40:27,743 --> 00:40:30,112
This was hands-down

874
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:31,379
your best work so far.

875
00:40:31,414 --> 00:40:33,315
Whatever you did
to find your focus

876
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,816
and put your best foot forward,

877
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:35,951
you must keep it up.

878
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:36,952
Okay.

879
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:38,253
To be on top and to win,

880
00:40:38,287 --> 00:40:39,788
it's a great feeling,

881
00:40:39,822 --> 00:40:41,423
but at the same time,
it's humbling,

882
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:42,924
because I need to work harder,

883
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,259
and keep that up.

884
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:46,661
There's just one more
congratulations that we owe,

885
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:48,497
and that is to you, Anthony.

886
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:51,967
All three of the top looks
tonight were from your team.

887
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:54,035
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

888
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,337
All right, Jamie.

889
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:56,471
You, Kelly, and Ben

890
00:40:56,506 --> 00:40:57,973
can all head back
to the makeup room,

891
00:40:58,007 --> 00:40:59,107
along with the coaches.

892
00:40:59,142 --> 00:41:00,375
Thanks, guys.

893
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,484
The rest of you
are on the bottom this week,

894
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:10,852
and one of you
will be going home.

895
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:13,188
Please step forward.

896
00:41:20,429 --> 00:41:22,831
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

897
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:24,866
Anthony, we thought
that there was some nice

898
00:41:24,901 --> 00:41:26,101
sculpting moments in your work,

899
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:28,136
but your vision
was not communicated

900
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:29,571
in the final character.

901
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:32,174
Emily, we appreciate
your creative thinking,

902
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,675
but this one got away from you,

903
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:35,877
and the troll aspect
of the challenge

904
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:37,512
was lost in the mix.

905
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:40,916
Rob, your paint choices
and your techniques were good,

906
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,718
but your makeup suffered
from anatomical flaws

907
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:46,054
that rendered it
more alien than troll.

908
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,756
So who is going home tonight?

909
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,925
The person going
home tonight is...

910
00:41:53,896 --> 00:41:55,096
Anthony.

911
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:59,131
Unfortunately, the visual
language of your character

912
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,884
was indiscernible as troll.

913
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,769
Anthony, I'm so sorry,

914
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:05,704
but you have been eliminated.

915
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,190
Emily and Rob,
you are both safe this week.

916
00:42:08,242 --> 00:42:09,909
You can head back
to the makeup room.

917
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,549
We've been so impressed
with your passion for makeup,

918
00:42:16,584 --> 00:42:18,167
and we understand
that you really

919
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:19,752
belong doing this for a living.

920
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,354
This is just the first
step on that journey.

921
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,790
It's just been an absolutely
amazing experience.

922
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,325
Thank you.

923
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,861
Anthony, it's really been
great having you here with us,

924
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,030
but if you would please head
back to the makeup room

925
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:32,798
and pack up your kit.

926
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,799
Thank you.

927
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,417
- Good luck.
- Good luck, babe.

928
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:38,654
This experience has been
absolutely life-changing for me.

929
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,841
It's me.

930
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:45,478
This is just the beginning,

931
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,146
and I've grown so much.

932
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:49,014
I'm now a better person,

933
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,517
and I'm more confident
in my abilities.

934
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,852
The world is open to me,

935
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:55,387
and I can't wait
for what's next.
