2
00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:02,621
This is insane.

3
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:03,923
An all-new season kicked off

4
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:05,758
with a shocking twist.

5
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:09,061
Please welcome
your new champion coaches.

6
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:11,146
I can't wait.

7
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:12,998
Deep breath.

8
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:16,735
The champion-led teams were
tasked with creating two aliens

9
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:17,853
for a movie legend...

10
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:20,840
Seven-time Academy Award winner
Rick Baker.

11
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:22,825
Yeah!

12
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:25,110
I'm ecstatic.

13
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:26,428
But that was only
the beginning.

14
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:28,414
Can you see the sweat
on my forehead?

15
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,381
It's all over the place.

16
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,649
- Okay.
- Needs a lot more work.

17
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:32,251
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:34,687
I have another big surprise
for you.

19
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:37,590
You'll be making
a third character.

20
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,758
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

21
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:41,360
Things are about to get real.

22
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:42,661
In the end, only one

23
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:45,164
will win a VIP trip
from Kryolan Professional Make-Up

24
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:48,300
to one of their 85
international locations,

25
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,936
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

26
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:53,939
and $100,000.

27

I have another big surprise
for you.

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,553
There's a huge piece
of information

32
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,289
that I didn't share
with you yesterday.

33
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:45,291
What now?

34
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:47,726
There's something going on,
and I don't know what it is,

35
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:49,028
but things
are about to get real.

36
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:52,197
Your spacecraft
didn't crash-land on Earth.

37
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,800
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

38
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:57,953
It crash-landed on a planet
controlled by primates

39
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:02,124
who are not happy
to see your alien invaders.

40
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,894
So you'll each be choosing
one of these simians

41
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:08,847
as inspiration for

42
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:09,949
a third character.

43
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,454
We had a plan,
and now that's out the door.

44
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:16,722
That's right.

45
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:19,024
You'll be making a tyrannical
primate ruler

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,759
who has no interest

47
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,561
in making your alien intruders
feel at home.

48
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:25,164
Keep in mind, Rick is the one

49
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,999
who created
those incredible makeups

50
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,767
<i>in Tim Burton's
Planet Of The Apes,</i>

51
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:31,003
and he won an Academy Award
for his work

52
00:02:31,038 --> 00:02:35,541
<i>in Harry And The Hendersons,
so this is not going to be easy.</i>

53
00:02:35,576 --> 00:02:37,710
And I want you guys
to have every opportunity

54
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:39,411
to impress Rick Baker,

55
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:44,466
so I'm going to give you
an extra day for this challenge.

56
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:46,251
Yes. Yes.

57
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:47,686
Oh, thank God.

58
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:51,340
We have this extra day to do
some type of monkey makeup.

59
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:53,292
This should be interesting.

60
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,194
Now that we have
all that nasty monkey business

61
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,429
out of the way,
let's pick your primates.

62
00:02:57,465 --> 00:03:01,633
Your options are
squirrel monkey, brown lemur,

63
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:05,120
white-faced capuchin, mandrill,

64
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:06,939
and we have the olive baboon.

65
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:08,874
Team Laura, you get first pick.

66
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:10,843
Yes.

67
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:11,944
That one's adorable.

68
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,412
That face
is really expressive too,

69
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,446
so I think we could do that.

70
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:15,731
I agree.

71
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:18,283
We're gonna pick
the squirrel monkey.

72
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,785
- Okay, Team Anthony?
- All right.

73
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,287
- We're gonna pick the mandrill.
- And Rayce?

74
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:26,125
We're going to go
with the white-faced capuchin.

75
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,360
All right, guys,
why don't you take some time

76
00:03:28,412 --> 00:03:30,362
to work on your new designs

77
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:33,582
while we have these amazing
monkeys right here in the lab?

78
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:35,467
- Good luck.
- Bye.

79
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:39,822
I like this profile.

80
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:41,206
- We're gonna make him a--
- Ruler.

81
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:42,875
- Tyrant.
- Like a tyrant.

82
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,209
That's what I was thinking,
like,

83
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,594
the scars
would come in to play at.

84
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,297
'Cause a tyrant
is not a pretty person.

85
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:51,984
Our original story
was two aliens from a cooler,

86
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,285
aquatic planet,

87
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,187
and one is older than the other.

88
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:56,405
And now, our monkey,

89
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,757
he's a tyrannical monkey
that hunts aliens

90
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:02,127
because they just drop a lot
of their cargo on his planet.

91
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,100
So, our team
chooses the mandrill monkey.

92
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:09,635
Oh, and his butt.

93
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,769
Let's give him a pink butt.

94
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,071
In our original idea,

95
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:13,906
the smaller alien is the pilot,

96
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,208
and the larger alien
is the protector.

97
00:04:16,243 --> 00:04:19,411
So our concept for the third
character is pretty basic.

98
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:20,646
He's gonna be the ruler

99
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:24,316
of this planet
that is strictly just a monkey.

100
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,485
He's not supposed
to be some hybrid.

101
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:31,356
Think you want to stay
with the tribal theme?

102
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:35,227
My team opts to go
with the white-faced capuchin.

103
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,696
This particular monkey
is 25 years old,

104
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:40,132
and she looks it,
so we're going to run with that.

105
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,417
I think we should tie them
together somehow, like,

106
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,969
the apes are the higher thing,

107
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:45,804
and then, the arachnid are--
are their slaves.

108
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,007
It's gonna be the warriors,
the beasts, the slaves?

109
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:50,008
I like that.

110
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,411
Our original concept was,

111
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:56,715
this higher intelligence
alien crashes on this planet

112
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,685
where arachnid
is the native species.

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,056
So our monkey is the ruler
of this planet,

114
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:06,358
and she's enslaved the arachnid.

115
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,594
And she's an old character.

116
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:10,729
She was born into royalty.

117
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:11,930
I'm liking this though.

118
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,432
This-- what you have here.

119
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:14,933
Okay,
then we can start working.

120
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:24,242
I think my team is very
excited about this twist.

121
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:27,212
Alan gets to step up
from the fabrication

122
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:29,414
and start doing
some more sculpting.

123
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,233
I'm trying to make sure
that I keep in line

124
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:32,234
with his nose like this.

125
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:33,352
Yeah, I agree.

126
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,153
I have a pretty good knowledge

127
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:36,738
of animal anatomy,
including monkeys,

128
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,256
but I know Rick Baker

129
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:40,559
is gonna look
at that face extra close.

130
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:42,744
I'm sure Rick Baker
will be looking for details.

131
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,966
First thing I need to do

132
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:51,002
is finish detailing
this alien warrior face.

133
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:52,587
These holes-- are they plugged?

134
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
- Or they go all the way back?
- They go all the way back.

135
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:56,641
You might want to put
a little bit of clay in there,

136
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:59,144
'cause otherwise, if the plaster
goes all the way through and--

137
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,113
- It might lock.
- It might lock, yeah.

138
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:03,915
I know that I should've been
finished and in the mold room

139
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:06,952
yesterday, so right now,
I am just thinking,

140
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:10,288
"I need to get that face done."

141
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:12,224
We have to,
like, bang these out

142
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:13,959
and get you guys
into the molding room.

143
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,495
I want my team
to continue with the aliens

144
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,464
as much as possible while
Gregory begins on the monkey.

145
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,967
- The monkey face.
- Yeah.

146
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:24,703
I have my own special effects
makeup shop in North Carolina,

147
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:27,739
and so I feel comfortable
taking a leadership role.

148
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:30,742
So I volunteered to sculpt
the face for the monkey.

149
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:33,145
I'm a little concerned
about having a squirrel monkey

150
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,398
and changing it into a menacing,
tyrannical leader,

151
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,950
because it's sculpting something
mean from something cute.

152
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:40,585
That can be a little difficult.

153
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:41,870
Sometimes, big works,

154
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:43,839
and then other times,
it can bite you in the anus.

155
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,929
I spent ten years
in the Air National Guard,

156
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,581
but I've always had a passion
for doing effects.

157
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,649
I feel like this is my chance
to prove myself,

158
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:57,169
so I volunteered
to sculpt the monkey face.

159
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:59,838
It's going to be the only
prosthetic on this character,

160
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,957
and it's Rick Baker
that is judging it.

161
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,875
This is a big responsibility.

162
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:05,477
We got lots to do.

163
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,845
Okay, Regina.

164
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:07,979
What's your goal?

165
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:10,148
Another half an hour?

166
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:12,067
I'm a little worried
about Regina right now,

167
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:14,953
because she's spending a lot
of time on the arachnid's face.

168
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:16,588
I think
the sculpt's looking great,

169
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,306
but it's just taking
a long time.

170
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,859
I just have to get her
moving a little bit quicker.

171
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:24,963
Hi, everybody.

172
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:26,198
- I'm back!
- Hello. - Hi.

173
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,834
This is our mandrill king,

174
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:31,403
and he's really an overlord
for this place.

175
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:32,838
What are you gonna do
with the fur?

176
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:36,374
We're gonna use
four-way stretch fabric fur,

177
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,444
so that way, it actually
moves real organically.

178
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,613
Are you gonna have
to hand lay anything?

179
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,315
- Certain bits.
- I would hand lay the edges.

180
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,883
And again,
your paint structure--

181
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,419
paint colors underneath, if you
break them up a little bit,

182
00:07:47,454 --> 00:07:49,254
that actually shows
through your hand laying.

183
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,388
Mm-hmm.

184
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,591
So for this creature,

185
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:54,993
we decided
to scrap the old idea.

186
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,261
Good idea.

187
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:57,846
Yesterday,
when Mr. Westmore came in,

188
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:01,233
he didn't like my face sculpture
for the high intelligence alien,

189
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:03,401
so I tore that off
and started over.

190
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:05,620
We're playing with more organic
shapes and everything.

191
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,072
Mm-hmm.
I think it's great.

192
00:08:07,107 --> 00:08:08,206
You've done a great job.

193
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,174
Let's see the next one.

194
00:08:09,226 --> 00:08:10,876
This is your little bit
of a twist?

195
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:12,210
Just started on the monkey.

196
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:13,311
She's aged.

197
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:14,946
She's stern.

198
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,364
In the face here too, you know,

199
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,650
you can give yourself
a little bit more power here.

200
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:21,937
Actually, just getting
possibly more of a muzzle,

201
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:22,954
less human.

202
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,023
- So bring it out further?
- Yeah.

203
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:26,808
We wanted to keep the pattern
of the fur,

204
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,894
'cause he does have such
a cute face.

205
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:29,961
We wanted to make, like,

206
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,897
the widow's peak
on the fur to, like,

207
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:34,499
help give him
more of a menacing look.

208
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:39,170
Are you actually gonna do
fur on the face too like this,

209
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:40,455
or are you gonna be painting?

210
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,874
I'm gonna ventilate
hair pieces for it.

211
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,009
How long will that take you?

212
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:45,560
Maybe like an hour an half,
two hours.

213
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:46,578
What?

214
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,612
Took me six hours to do

215
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,681
my first and last mustache.

216
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:52,150
Nobody ever wore it, thank God.

217
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:53,368
I'm gonna say good-bye.

218
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:54,986
Everything's really
looking great.

219
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:57,155
You've really stepped up.
Good luck.

220
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,757
- We'll see you later.
- Thank you.

221
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:06,698
I know that I need
to get this alien molded,

222
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:09,918
so I go back into the mold room,
and I get to work.

223
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:11,503
Are you just doing
the splash coat?

224
00:09:11,538 --> 00:09:12,504
Yeah.

225
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:14,122
I'm mixing a bunch of plaster,

226
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:16,841
but I'm rushing it,
so I made it a little too thick,

227
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,310
and it's almost setting.

228
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:21,613
I'm worried that I won't be able
to stick burlap into it,

229
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:25,050
which means when it's time
to open it, it's going to crack.

230
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:26,418
Are you putting burlap in it?

231
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,119
No, not yet,
'cause it's setting too fast.

232
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,704
It does--
That's not an option.

233
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:32,324
Kelly is making
some big mistakes right now,

234
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:34,626
so I can't really
be Mr. Nice Guy.

235
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,645
It needs three layers of burlap.

236
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:40,065
You don't have enough plaster
or bandage to even do the job.

237
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,801
If I mess up my mold,
then everything's ruined.

238
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,953
Start cutting burlap.
Or you don't have to.

239
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,071
I don't give a shit.

240
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:48,673
Don't be giving me attitude.

241
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:55,085
Are you putting burlap in it?

242
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,803
No, not yet,
'cause it's setting too fast.

243
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,088
It does--
That's not an option.

244
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,357
It's day two of our first
spotlight challenge.

245
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,061
I'm making my mold
for my alien warrior face,

246
00:10:05,097 --> 00:10:08,064
and I'm rushing it,
so I made it a little too thick.

247
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,166
Start cutting burlap.
Or you don't have to.

248
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,167
I don't give a shit.

249
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,252
I remind myself,

250
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,420
"It's still gonna work.

251
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:15,472
I just need to add
another coat."

252
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,507
Don't be giving me attitude.

253
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,409
It's gonna be okay, Kelly.
It's gonna be okay.

254
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,319
All right, guys, good luck.

255
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:31,187
Have fun.

256
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:32,555
It's time
for us coaches to leave.

257
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,057
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you, sir.

258
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,159
My biggest concern
is Gregory's facial sculpt

259
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:39,429
for the monkey, but overall,
I think they're in a good place.

260
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:43,249
- We'll see you, guys.
- Bye.

261
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:44,918
- Make sure it doesn't tip towards me.
- Oh, yeah.

262
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:47,120
My team is molding
four or five different pieces

263
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:48,938
for our two aliens.

264
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:51,074
I know that I'm a fast molder,

265
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,376
so even though I'm still
sculpting the monkey face,

266
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:54,944
I agree to take the lead.

267
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:03,419
Everybody's in the mold room
at the same time.

268
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:06,790
The clock is ticking,
and there's clay everywhere.

269
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,858
It's pandemonium.

270
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,693
Nobody wants to fall
behind schedule,

271
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,512
'cause it's Rick Baker.

272
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,769
- Hey, everybody, time's up.
- Whoo.

273
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,172
It's the end of the day,
and I'm a little worried.

274
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:23,339
All of our molds are done,

275
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,742
but I'm behind on the face
for the monkey,

276
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:28,111
and I know the face can either
make or break a makeup.

277
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,346
So I'm not feeling
really confident

278
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:31,614
at this particular time.

279
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,888
We are all exhausted,

280
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:40,623
and we come into the house,

281
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:42,625
and we just kind of collapse.

282
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,528
And then we hear a knock
at the door.

283
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:48,097
- Hello.
- Hey.

284
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,500
- How you guys doing?
- How are you guys?

285
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,702
We're just here to hang out.
A little barbecue.

286
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:54,370
All right.

287
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,423
How is it going?

288
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,329
I get to sit down,
hang out with my team,

289
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,415
and I'm getting to
know these guys now, you know.

290
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,439
And that's important.

291
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,577
There's a lot on the line,

292
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:06,916
but it's also like one of the best
opportunities of your life.

293
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:09,381
Me being a father of three,
I know you are a father,

294
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:12,162
you are a father,
I wonder how hard was it for you

295
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,263
to cope with being away
from your kids and your family.

296
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:16,456
You can use them as motivation,

297
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:18,061
"What would they want
to see me do right now?".

298
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,230
It's nice to sit down with
Rayce and talk about family,

299
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:21,931
because I know
he left his family behind.

300
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:25,635
I left my family behind.

301
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,303
Everything is flaming up
back there...

302
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,207
That's not a phrase
you hear every day.

303
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:34,844
It's really nice to hang out
with Laura outside of the lab

304
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,548
and get to know
more about her as well.

305
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,083
What's everybody's
favorite movie?

306
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:42,235
That's like you're choosing
your favorite children.

307
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:43,486
<i>-  The Thing.
-  The Thing?</i>

308
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,871
<i>-  Legend.
- That's-- Ah, Legend.</i>

309
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,873
That's one of the movies
that screwed me up as a kid.

310
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:47,874
I can't count--

311
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:50,076
Made me get into this field.

312
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:52,262
It's great, especially
in a competition like this,

313
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,963
to just get your mind
off of things--

314
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,332
just to kind of step away
from the stress a little bit

315
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:59,903
and try to come fresh
the next day.

316
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:12,348
Yeah.

317
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:14,017
Whoo-whoo!

318
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:15,535
Hi.

319
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,922
It's day three
of our alien-monkey challenge,

320
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:21,357
and we have ten hours
in the lab today.

321
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,259
So much.

322
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:27,196
What we've got to do is open
the molds for our two aliens,

323
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,198
clean them out,

324
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:32,001
finish the monkey,
all our fabrication--

325
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,036
there's a lot of work to do.

326
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:37,807
This is so awesome.

327
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:39,609
I run to my station,
look at the foam pieces...

328
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:40,693
Look at them edges.

329
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,512
"What edges?" I know.

330
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:43,579
The foam's looking good.

331
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,515
We're in a good spot,
and I know

332
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,417
that we can get
these two aliens

333
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,584
prepainted today.

334
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,653
So we're going with a taupe,
right?

335
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,756
Mm-hmm.

336
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:57,794
I'm actually
gonna make a whole suit.

337
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,962
Okay.

338
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,264
I still have so much
to do for the arachnid,

339
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,517
so I take L200 foam
and make plate armor to wear.

340
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,336
It's like the underbelly
of a scorpion.

341
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,403
It really looks good.

342
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,556
It's really coming
together nicely.

343
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:11,975
How much longer you think
you got on this guy?

344
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:13,493
Just a few little touch-ups
here and there.

345
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:15,211
I'm gonna look it over and make
sure everything's sealed up.

346
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:16,312
Thanks, Rob.

347
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:23,603
So, Alan and Daniel
cast Alan's hands in alginate

348
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,621
so we can use them
as a positive.

349
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,390
Okay.

350
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,492
We get them pulled
out of the alginate,

351
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:30,893
and I start sculpting hands

352
00:14:30,945 --> 00:14:33,496
that will be gloves
for this alien creature.

353
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:34,964
Here, let me give you a hand.

354
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:42,472
I volunteered to make
the crown for the monkey,

355
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:46,309
but I've never really
fabricated anything.

356
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:49,946
I start drawing out
my interpretation of this crown

357
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,048
onto the foam.

358
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,017
I get a dremel to the top of it

359
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:57,653
and start moving it around
and getting chunks out of it.

360
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,655
I'm ecstatic
about how this is turning out.

361
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:01,157
I'm stoked.

362
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,026
I like this.

363
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:11,034
There you go.

364
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,485
How's it going?

365
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,237
Ah, we doing good.

366
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:16,773
I look at Gregory's
facial sculpt for the monkey,

367
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,891
and it's look--

368
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:20,710
it needs, um...

369
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,061
a lot of work.

370
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:24,013
I feel like you lose
the monkey aspect of it

371
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,798
if you make it too mangled.

372
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,250
I wouldn't do anything
to the nose,

373
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:28,451
and if you're gonna do accents,

374
00:15:28,486 --> 00:15:31,721
just on the chin
and on the eye and--

375
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:32,972
You got to make sure

376
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:36,359
anatomy-wise the creature
looks like a monkey.

377
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,161
I'm extremely worried.

378
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,313
The face is so crucial.

379
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:43,332
It has to be just right.

380
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:45,701
Well, Laura does not like it,
and that's a bad feeling.

381
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,236
I don't want to go home
for this makeup,

382
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:48,704
but I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

383
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,207
You got to make sure

384
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:59,929
anatomy-wise that the creature
looks like a monkey.

385
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,948
It's day three
of the alien challenge,

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,884
and Laura says my face sculpt
doesn't look like a monkey.

387
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,604
Usually, wrinkles wouldn't
flow like that around eyes.

388
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:10,790
They typically go like that.

389
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:13,659
I'm just telling him how crucial
it is that the anatomy

390
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:16,195
is perfect, and I don't think
he's really getting it,

391
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:18,030
but I guess we'll have
to wait and see.

392
00:16:22,237 --> 00:16:23,903
It's almost time
for the coaches to leave,

393
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,238
so I meet with my team

394
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,906
to make sure
that we're all getting things

395
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:28,441
ready for application day.

396
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:30,776
Do whatever it takes so that
tomorrow we're just applying

397
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,245
and painting, okay?

398
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,779
And we know our colors
and everything.

399
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:35,214
If we do that,
then we'll be set.

400
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:36,782
Okay? You're doing awesome.

401
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:38,584
If my team can stay on schedule,

402
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,869
then I think
we're gonna be okay.

403
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,587
- Bye, guys. Have fun.
- Bye.

404
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:45,241
- Bye.
- Wow, it's bright out here.

405
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:46,926
So to prepare the hair
for the monkey,

406
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:50,396
I grab synthetic hair,
yak hair, scrap wig hair,

407
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:54,634
and then I just use the hackle
and start mixing.

408
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:57,837
I'm gonna ventilate hair pieces
for our character.

409
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:59,639
So you're gonna hand tie
each and every hair?

410
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:00,640
Yep.

411
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:01,807
- Or bunch of hairs?
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:04,677
Ventilating hair is
when you hand tie hair

413
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:06,195
into this piece of lace.

414
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,949
It's one of the most realistic
techniques to make hair.

415
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:11,117
This is so tedious.

416
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,594
***

417
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:19,759
We have ten minutes left,

418
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:23,829
and I still need
to open the hand molds.

419
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:26,766
The top comes off just fine,
and I start pulling clay.

420
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,356
_

421
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:31,672
_

422
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,607
And I notice there's no fingers
on them.

423
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:38,027
So now I've got two hands,
all missing fingers,

424
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,346
and we've only got
a couple minutes left.

425
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:42,377
I'm not running these things
in foam today.

426
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,740
I'm gonna have to jam them together
with *** epoxy and some sticks.

427
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:49,209
*** run polyfoam tomorrow.

428
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,502
Okay, that's time, guys!

429
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,752
This is one of the ***.

430
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:57,060
So, if I can't run it tomorrow,
I could go home before anyone.

431
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:58,362
*** see what I can create.

432
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,675
- Ooh, wow, that's pretty.
- It's application day.

433
00:18:09,711 --> 00:18:12,495
We have four hours in the lab,
one hour at last look.

434
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,414
We walk into the lab,
and I find my arachnid cowl,

435
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,565
and it's kind of rough.

436
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:18,784
That one's all jacked up.

437
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,904
I have no time for this,

438
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,858
but now have to fix this thing.

439
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:27,360
For the first challenge,

440
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:30,796
to have to experience
fixing a cowl like this--

441
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:32,999
Logan's going
to learn a lot right now.

442
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:42,575
First thing I have to do
is get these alien hands made.

443
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,844
I don't have time
to grind down the hands,

444
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:46,212
but I got to make them fit.

445
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:49,148
And I'm worried
that this isn't gonna work.

446
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:56,088
- Hello.
- Good morning.

447
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,690
Hi.

448
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,518
I'm Jamie.

449
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,112
The plan of attack
is that Darla and Emily

450
00:19:03,164 --> 00:19:05,314
are handling the younger alien,

451
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,201
Stephanie and Julian
are handling the older alien,

452
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:11,470
and Gregory
is handling the monkey.

453
00:19:11,506 --> 00:19:12,972
And then Emily
will apply the hair.

454
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:23,182
Daniel is putting on the cowl

455
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:25,851
while I'm taking the face
and blending that,

456
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:29,055
but I'm noticing
it doesn't fit the model properly.

457
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,057
I'm having a little issue
with the chin.

458
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:33,559
I don't think it's gonna fit,
because this is pretty high up.

459
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:36,545
I'm really frustrated, because
I'm spending so much time

460
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:37,947
trying to get it on my model.

461
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,865
- Seem good?
- Yeah.

462
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay.

463
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:42,968
You guys doing all right?

464
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:45,538
I'd give us a four
out of ten right now.

465
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,175
Having a lot of fixing to do
creates this insane pressure

466
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:50,976
for every one
of my team members,

467
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,011
but they got to move.

468
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:54,013
They got to get going.

469
00:19:54,048 --> 00:19:55,348
As important as this is,

470
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:57,249
it's not as important
as getting those faces on.

471
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:58,284
Can I have you help Anthony?

472
00:19:58,336 --> 00:19:59,702
And Adam,
can I have you help Logan?

473
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:00,953
No problem.

474
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:02,338
How long do you think
this'll take you guys?

475
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:03,422
Keep working
as I'm talking to you,

476
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,473
but I'm worried about time.

477
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,292
Check that seam around the head.

478
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:08,027
There's also this section
up here.

479
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:11,597
I like it.

480
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:14,133
My biggest concern
for my team for application day

481
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:15,267
is the paint job.

482
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:17,870
The goal is for it
to be so translucent

483
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:19,872
that it just layers up
really nice.

484
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:21,974
The painting is very important
in this competition.

485
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,010
Since the coaches won't be
with their teams in last looks,

486
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,279
I'm hoping to guide them
through the paint jobs

487
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:28,981
so that they can get
these things finished.

488
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:31,217
Keep it a little more cohesive
so it's-- if you look here.

489
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:33,169
You're gonna get
a nice breakup of color.

490
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:39,058
This could be, like, broken up
a little bit more. Here.

491
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:41,160
The pressure's on now,
because there's not much time

492
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:45,798
left on the clock, and I'm the
only one working on the monkey.

493
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,700
Painting is taking
a lot more time

494
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:49,985
than I thought it would.

495
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:51,437
This is stressing me out a lot,

496
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:53,222
because it's just--
it's a mess.

497
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:55,524
You do only have 44 minutes
though.

498
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,710
If you need to finish the face,

499
00:20:57,745 --> 00:20:59,078
I'll help you out a little bit.

500
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:00,963
You-- put your hand down.

501
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:04,583
There you go.

502
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:05,584
This is the brown.

503
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:07,503
This is the dark brown,
like the base.

504
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:09,221
And then
it goes up into this yellow.

505
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:11,257
Those are to set out
the basic shapes and forms.

506
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,292
I've been behind all morning
working on this cowl,

507
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:15,277
and then I realized
that we're actually caught up.

508
00:21:15,313 --> 00:21:16,729
Are we gonna
paint the eyeballs too?

509
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:17,780
Yes.

510
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:20,199
And I think
it looks pretty good.

511
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:25,938
15 minutes, everybody.

512
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:35,514
I spent
all morning making hands,

513
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,285
and they aren't looking good.

514
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:40,503
Time.

515
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,221
I'm potentially
the odd man out,

516
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:46,959
because I don't have anything
to really attach my name to.

517
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,294
So I might be going home
tonight.

518
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:55,684
Other side.

519
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,020
Okay.

520
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,055
The first thing we want to do
is attack those ears.

521
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,273
We have a hour at last looks.

522
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,775
It is crazy in here.

523
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,894
I'm trying to put
the final touches on this one.

524
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,912
Okay, Emily, you really
need to get on the hair work.

525
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:08,531
Just let them do the painting.

526
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,700
We have a lot to do.

527
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:13,969
I'm popping in teeth.
I'm popping in eyes.

528
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:15,137
Give me a snarl.

529
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:17,423
I realize
that I don't have time to do

530
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,543
what I originally
wanted to do with my paint job.

531
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:21,810
Teeth?

532
00:22:21,846 --> 00:22:23,479
Your plastic thing's
coming out of them.

533
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:24,547
- Really?
- In all honesty,

534
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,181
it's probably not gonna stick.

535
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:27,917
This creature
needs to have nasty fangs.

536
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:30,002
It don't need to have nice
pearly whites.

537
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:33,772
So we tell the model,
"Don't show your teeth."

538
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:38,627
You're almost done looking
like the coolest thing ever.

539
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:40,296
Ten minutes.

540
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:42,414
Wiggle your fingers
inside those little holes.

541
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:43,999
The hands aren't even
on the models yet.

542
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:45,167
They're ripping up the sides,

543
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:46,652
and they're not holding
in place.

544
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:48,070
You got bobby pins?

545
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:50,456
So I grab burlap rolls, and
I start wrapping them around.

546
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,841
Just trying to make sure
they look like hands

547
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,743
and not some messed up gloves.

548
00:22:57,548 --> 00:23:00,950
That's time, everyone.

549
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:03,385
Rick Baker
is gonna be like, "What on Earth

550
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:04,954
is on this guy's face?"

551
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,689
The monkey's
in a really bad position,

552
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:08,958
and the more and more I look at
it, it just looks like a mess.

553
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,992
I can't.

554
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:11,076
It's really disappointing,

555
00:23:11,112 --> 00:23:12,411
and I'm just thinking,

556
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:14,480
"This is what Rick Baker's
gonna remember me for."

557
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:31,347
<i>Welcome to
the Face Off reveal stage.</i>

558
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,917
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

559
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:36,885
But before we see
your creations,

560
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:39,521
let me introduce you
to our judges.

561
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:42,107
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

562
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,559
Mr. Glenn Hetrick.

563
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:45,394
- Good evening.
- Hey.

564
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:47,930
Three-time Academy Award
winning makeup artist

565
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:48,964
Ms. Ve Neill.

566
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,599
Hello again, everyone.

567
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:51,917
- Hey, Ve.
- Hey.

568
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:54,687
Creature and concept design
expert Neville Page.

569
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,505
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey, Neville.

570
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
And of course, we are
very lucky to have

571
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:03,646
seven-time Academy Award winning
makeup artist Rick Baker.

572
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:07,282
Hi, guys.

573
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:08,651
Rick Baker's my idol.

574
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,085
I still can't believe he's here.

575
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:11,870
This is just an experience
of a lifetime

576
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:14,523
that I would never think
I'd ever get in a million years.

577
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:16,258
All right, well, you ready
to take a look at some makeups?

578
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,794
- I'm ready.
- Okay, let's do this.

579
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:22,014
Your first spotlight challenge
was to create two aliens

580
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:25,834
that emerged from a unique
extraterrestrial crash site.

581
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,337
Then you had to create
a primate ruler of the planet

582
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:30,239
your aliens had crashed on.

583
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:32,641
Team Anthony, you're first.

584
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:37,346
When my team's characters
walk out on stage,

585
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:38,731
I really don't know
what to expect.

586
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,399
I'm just excited
to see what they were able

587
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:41,784
to pull together in my absence.

588
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:59,351
I'm really proud of my team.

589
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:01,103
The monkey looks very powerful
up there.

590
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,404
But at the same time, you know,

591
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,074
I do feel that there's
still more work to do.

592
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:17,286
I'm feeling kind of
disappointed

593
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,887
with our two aliens.

594
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:21,323
Now it's time to,
you know, pay the piper.

595
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,104
I'm really happy
with the mandrill,

596
00:25:35,106 --> 00:25:37,740
but I am not sure
about the other aliens.

597
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:39,057
So we'll see what happens.

598
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:59,161
I'm really proud of the team
right now,

599
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:00,629
and I'm really happy

600
00:26:00,664 --> 00:26:02,664
with the work
they did in that last hour.

601
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:18,046
Our pieces look like they
stepped out of another world.

602
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:19,348
They're fantastic.

603
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:20,716
We did have some setbacks,

604
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:22,484
but we pulled together
as a team,

605
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,685
and we made it happen.

606
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:39,284
I love the anatomy
of the monkey.

607
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:43,238
This definitely looks like
a regal, queen-like character.

608
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,593
I'm a little nervous, 'cause
I'm seeing a few things that,

609
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:07,362
in the past,
the judges have not liked.

610
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:09,431
But overall,
I'm still extremely proud.

611
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:24,847
My alien is definitely
what I wanted.

612
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:26,548
I'm looking at the judges,
and I'm like,

613
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:28,116
"It looks great, right?
Right?"

614
00:27:42,032 --> 00:27:45,167
I'm just at awe
at how real they look.

615
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:46,535
I love the aliens,

616
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,503
but I'm a little concerned
about the monkey.

617
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:55,077
All right, judges,
why don't you take

618
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,545
a closer look
at tonight's makeups.

619
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:05,587
Got some problems going on

620
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,089
with the mouth there,
don't they?

621
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:09,274
Can you do anything
with your brows at all?

622
00:28:09,326 --> 00:28:11,410
No.
Thank you.

623
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:18,350
They made a massive investment
in fabricating wardrobe

624
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:19,801
to the detriment of the sculpt.

625
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:22,471
I think that they should've
spent more time on his head.

626
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:24,373
I don't think this read well
from a distance.

627
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:27,009
- Yeah.
- This is beyond intense.

628
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:30,812
We've got Rick Baker, you know,
face-to-face with our aliens,

629
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,899
and I am not happy
with this paint job at all.

630
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,068
This paint looks very matte
compared to the other one.

631
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,252
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

632
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:38,487
I am freaking out.

633
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:43,368
This paint looks very matte

634
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:44,369
compared to the other one.

635
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:45,370
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

636
00:28:45,372 --> 00:28:47,171
This is beyond intense.

637
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:50,408
I am not happy
with this paint job at all,

638
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:52,643
and I am freaking out.

639
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:54,545
This is all pretty
great-looking.

640
00:28:54,581 --> 00:28:56,714
One thing that's really
that's really working on this

641
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,450
though is just
the general massing of the head.

642
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:01,352
Yeah, no,
I think the whole thing

643
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:04,188
works pretty well together.

644
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:06,491
Someone made an attempt
to address the entire character.

645
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:07,959
What happens
if you push your tongue

646
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,961
against your upper lip like,
"t-t-t-t-t"?

647
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:10,995
Yeah, that's cool.

648
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:12,263
Ew, creepy.

649
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:13,297
All right, thank you.

650
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:18,870
This looks like it's a mistake.

651
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,538
It looks like it's on crooked,
doesn't it?

652
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,673
- Yeah, definitely.
- Thank you.

653
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:30,048
- It's actually pretty darn cute.
- Yeah, I like this.

654
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,032
This is pretty great.

655
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:32,283
This all works really well,

656
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,052
considering it's all one piece.

657
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:36,220
Yeah.

658
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:38,790
Wow,
there is some super cool color

659
00:29:38,842 --> 00:29:42,393
going on that I did not see
from far away.

660
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:44,962
- Try to smile.
- That's even freakier.

661
00:29:44,964 --> 00:29:46,464
Yeah, it is.

662
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:49,834
Thank you.

663
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:52,186
Can you tilt your head
all the way down?

664
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:54,405
I like the transition.
I think it's pretty cool.

665
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:55,640
Mm-hmm.

666
00:29:55,675 --> 00:29:57,175
I've never seen that shape
before.

667
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,460
Yeah, and the forms
work better close up,

668
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:03,347
which is weird, you know?

669
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,149
He's beat up, this guy.

670
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:07,318
The lip is so deep in here

671
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,987
that the profile
doesn't feel like a primate.

672
00:30:10,023 --> 00:30:11,239
Okay, thank you.

673
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:18,596
Okay, the judges
have checked out your creations

674
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:22,033
but now would like to talk
to their top and bottom looks.

675
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:25,603
Logan, Regina, Rob, and Adam
from Team Rayce,

676
00:30:25,638 --> 00:30:27,171
we're gonna start with you.

677
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,379
Tell us your character's
backstory

678
00:30:35,415 --> 00:30:38,015
and how it fits into
your cryochamber crash scene.

679
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:39,951
This is the native creature.

680
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:43,054
We opted to go
with an insect-like alien.

681
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:45,022
Sort of like
the desert environment.

682
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:49,510
I think this is extremely
well-managed piece of work.

683
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:50,895
Thanks very much.

684
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:54,031
I'm thrilled that you chose
to predicate your design

685
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:55,466
on an insect.

686
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:58,402
I think that's very right
thinking in alien design, so...

687
00:30:58,438 --> 00:30:59,804
You guys
really brought it to life.

688
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,222
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

689
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:02,306
Who did what?

690
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:04,041
I sculpted
and painted the cowl.

691
00:31:04,077 --> 00:31:05,643
I sculpted the face.

692
00:31:05,678 --> 00:31:07,145
I developed
the overall concept.

693
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:08,779
I fabricated the arms,

694
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,615
chest piece, hands,
and then the weapon.

695
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,317
I think you did a great job
with your attention to detail.

696
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:14,519
You've put all these different

697
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:16,420
little paint schemes
up on the head.

698
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:18,089
You even have
those little hair things

699
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:19,290
coming out of his shoulder.

700
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:20,458
That is so cool.

701
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,093
- Thanks very much.
- Thank you so much.

702
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:23,661
I'm really impressed
with the sculpt.

703
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:26,264
There's some really beautiful
forms happening in it.

704
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,533
- It looks really confident.
- Thank you.

705
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:29,901
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

706
00:31:29,936 --> 00:31:32,303
It almost looks to me
as if the body blends

707
00:31:32,338 --> 00:31:33,771
with the costume
a little too much.

708
00:31:33,806 --> 00:31:36,040
I think if some of that earth
tone went down into the chest

709
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:38,176
a little bit,
it would pop a little bit more,

710
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:40,244
but overall, I'm very impressed
with what you did.

711
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,679
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

712
00:31:41,714 --> 00:31:43,347
- Awesome.
- Thank you very much.

713
00:31:43,383 --> 00:31:44,782
You can step back.

714
00:31:51,024 --> 00:31:53,691
Kelly, Daniel, Alan, and Ben

715
00:31:53,726 --> 00:31:55,459
from Team Anthony, you're up.

716
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:03,901
Would you please
describe your character

717
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:05,636
and how it fits
into your crash site?

718
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:09,507
Well, they come to mine gold
to power their ships.

719
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:12,643
They are more technologically
advanced and more militant.

720
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,245
I sculpted the face,

721
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,047
Daniel sculpted the cowl,

722
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:19,250
Alan did the armor,
and Ben did the hands.

723
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:20,685
I got to tell you guys,

724
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,722
I'm not really excited
about this character.

725
00:32:24,757 --> 00:32:27,992
I'm not real hot on the design
of him or the paint job.

726
00:32:28,027 --> 00:32:29,660
I don't think
that this is the character

727
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:34,498
that you say is a miner
or whatever he's supposed to be.

728
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:36,334
- Who made the hands?
- I made the hands.

729
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:39,470
I think I would've taken those
off and just painted the hands.

730
00:32:39,472 --> 00:32:41,439
I think they would've
been more functional,

731
00:32:41,474 --> 00:32:43,674
less distracting.

732
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,393
I do have a certain disdain

733
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:47,011
for the flatness
of this sculpture.

734
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:49,096
It doesn't make
anatomical sense.

735
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:53,167
There's also
a severe lack of detail.

736
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:54,168
Thank you, guys.

737
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:56,520
If you'd please step back.

738
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:03,694
All right, Stephanie,
Julian, and Gregory

739
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,297
from Team Laura, if you
please step forward.

740
00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:15,823
So tell us a little bit more
about this character

741
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:18,409
and how the crash site
inspired the design.

742
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:22,613
The creatures are used
to a very moist climate,

743
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:26,717
but since the ship dropped them
on this really dry desert sand,

744
00:33:26,753 --> 00:33:28,386
they're starting to crack some.

745
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:29,920
I sculpted the back.

746
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:31,756
I sculpted the cowl.

747
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,624
And then I sculpted the face

748
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,094
and painted the front
and top of the cowl.

749
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,465
I really like a lot
about this particular character.

750
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:44,101
There's some really beautiful
sculpture happening in the face.

751
00:33:44,153 --> 00:33:46,871
For me, when I see it
as a head-to-toe piece,

752
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:50,741
the face and the cowl and
the paint work are quite lovely.

753
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,076
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

754
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:53,544
I like the paint job

755
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:56,664
and the kind of abruptness of
the changes of the two colors.

756
00:33:56,716 --> 00:33:59,350
Overall, I think
these were very successful.

757
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:00,718
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

758
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:02,253
I think you did an amazing job,

759
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:04,605
and I love
that luminescent quality.

760
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,992
And it does really read
like an aquatic reptilian race,

761
00:34:08,044 --> 00:34:09,060
which is kind of neat.

762
00:34:09,095 --> 00:34:11,228
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

763
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:13,264
Thank you, guys.
You can head back.

764
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,970
All right,
Logan, Anthony, Regina,

765
00:34:20,006 --> 00:34:22,406
and Rob from Team Rayce,
if you'd please step forward.

766
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,216
Please tell us
about your simian character

767
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:33,384
that goes with this planet.

768
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,886
She is an empress.

769
00:34:35,922 --> 00:34:37,355
She looks weathered and tired,

770
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,258
but she's also supposed
to be strong and wise.

771
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,760
Who did what on this character?

772
00:34:42,762 --> 00:34:43,861
I sculpted the face.

773
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:46,163
I painted the face, the hands,

774
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,666
and fabricated the crown.

775
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:50,768
I dremeled down the teeth
and sculpted them,

776
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,603
and I also hand laid the hair.

777
00:34:52,638 --> 00:34:54,572
I sculpted the chest piece,
vacuformed it,

778
00:34:54,574 --> 00:34:56,474
and then L200--

779
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:58,743
the rest of the bottom
and the shoulder pieces.

780
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:02,146
Well, I think
she's pretty damn fabulous.

781
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:03,547
I even like the paint job.

782
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:04,999
She does look aged.

783
00:35:05,051 --> 00:35:06,917
She has frailty about her.

784
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:09,286
I think she's a beautiful
character, and congratulations.

785
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:12,106
- Thanks very much.
- I think this works very well.

786
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,491
I like the color choice.

787
00:35:13,526 --> 00:35:16,193
I like the dark hair
with the light streaks.

788
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:19,363
I also did that on Michael
Jackson's were-cat monster,

789
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:20,831
where I--
I'll do that very often,

790
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:23,334
have white highlights
to show off certain parts.

791
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:25,302
- I congratulate you.
- Huge honor. Thank you.

792
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:26,837
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

793
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,140
Little things, like the fact
that the tear duct

794
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:30,741
is sculpted into the prosthetic,

795
00:35:30,793 --> 00:35:32,326
allowing you to transition
into the eye

796
00:35:32,378 --> 00:35:34,278
without having to deal
with an edge right there--

797
00:35:34,313 --> 00:35:38,232
great choices combined
into a very successful makeup.

798
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:40,284
Thank you very much.

799
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:43,104
All right, you can step back.

800
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:49,827
All right, Gregory
and Emily from Team Laura,

801
00:35:49,862 --> 00:35:51,862
if you'd please
head to the circle.

802
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:59,069
Give me a background
on this character please.

803
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:00,871
He's a warrior--
like, a tyrant.

804
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:03,207
He has been
through many battles.

805
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,376
He's got battle scars
to show for it.

806
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:08,479
I sculpted the face
and painted the face.

807
00:36:08,514 --> 00:36:12,950
I ventilated the front
of the ape's wig,

808
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:14,485
and I laid the hair.

809
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,254
Unfortunately,
I feel that it is somewhat

810
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,924
conceptually inarticulate.

811
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:23,627
I think it's suffering pretty
severely, anatomically speaking.

812
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:27,548
None of it feels
like a monkey-man combination.

813
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,467
I think this looks
like a turtle in the muzzle.

814
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:32,636
It probably would've added to
him looking more like a warrior

815
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:35,306
if he had
more ferocious-looking teeth.

816
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,476
I'm afraid this makeup
doesn't work really well for me.

817
00:36:38,511 --> 00:36:41,712
That whole muzzle feature
feels completely wrong.

818
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:44,114
Around the mouth
on most primates,

819
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,083
it's kind of a continuous line.

820
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:48,486
It doesn't sink in
and kick back out.

821
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:51,622
That's my biggest beef
with this.

822
00:36:51,657 --> 00:36:53,557
Thank you both.
If you'd please step back.

823
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:01,248
All right,
if you'd please head back

824
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:03,684
to the makeup room
while the judges deliberate.

825
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,944
All right, judges, let's start
with some of your favorites,

826
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,680
which was Team Rayce's
arachnid alien.

827
00:37:16,716 --> 00:37:20,618
That was made by Logan,
Regina, Rob, and Adam.

828
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:22,853
I was really impressed
with the arachnid face.

829
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:25,856
They put so much energy into
all the little details on it.

830
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:28,492
It just worked in
that insect type of a character.

831
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,294
Yeah, I thought it was
nicely fabricated actually.

832
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:31,495
- It was really well done.
- All right.

833
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:33,297
Let's move on
to Laura's older alien.

834
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:36,367
It was made by Stephanie,
Julian, and Gregory.

835
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:37,401
Love the coloring.

836
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:39,403
I absolutely loved
the transition

837
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:40,604
between the front and the back.

838
00:37:40,656 --> 00:37:43,107
It looked sun-bleached
and weathered.

839
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:45,092
I haven't seen
that forehead shape before.

840
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,510
That, to me, is something.

841
00:37:46,546 --> 00:37:49,680
All right, let's move on
to Team Rayce's primate,

842
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:52,583
which was made by Logan, Regina,
Rob, and Anthony.

843
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,385
Yeah, I liked everything
about this makeup.

844
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,020
I thought it was
such a cohesive design.

845
00:37:56,022 --> 00:37:59,123
And those Aztec-like jewels
were an interesting touch.

846
00:37:59,158 --> 00:38:00,824
I think the sculpture of
that face

847
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,060
is so beautifully executed.

848
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:06,497
It read easily enough as simian,
but it still had

849
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:08,666
an alien characteristic
that made it unique,

850
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,434
and it stood out
from the other characters.

851
00:38:10,469 --> 00:38:12,236
All right, judges,
let's move on to the looks

852
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:13,837
that you weren't so crazy
about tonight.

853
00:38:13,873 --> 00:38:16,173
Team Anthony's male alien,

854
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:19,743
which was done by Kelly, Alan,
Daniel, and Ben.

855
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:22,079
It was just too complicated
visually.

856
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:23,480
None of it makes any sense.

857
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:25,983
It very much feels like someone
just kind of pushing clay around

858
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:26,984
and going, "Done."

859
00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:27,985
That was all Kelly.

860
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,453
What worked the least

861
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:31,956
were Ben's massive mitts
for hands.

862
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:34,441
I would rather see
a really good, clean makeup.

863
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:36,110
Don't add too much stuff to it.

864
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:37,561
And that's
exactly what they did.

865
00:38:37,597 --> 00:38:40,297
Al right, let's move on
to Team Laura's primate,

866
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:42,266
which was done
by Gregory and Emily.

867
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:43,751
For me,
that one just didn't work.

868
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:46,170
Sorry to say, I think
they made a lot of mistakes.

869
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:48,405
It's not a good facial
sculpture.

870
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:51,375
And Gregory was at the helm
of this makeup.

871
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,110
Yeah, he applied it
and painted it.

872
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:54,945
Okay, that's everyone.

873
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,246
Have you guys
made up your minds?

874
00:38:56,248 --> 00:38:57,965
- I think so.
- Mm-hmm.

875
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,083
Then let's crown a winner.

876
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:15,232
Glenn, why don't you tell us
which champion's team

877
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:16,400
came out on top tonight?

878
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:17,668
The top team tonight is...

879
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,199
Glenn, why don't you tell us
which champion's team

880
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,500
came out on top tonight?

881
00:39:28,535 --> 00:39:30,435
The top team tonight is...

882
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,641
Team Rayce.

883
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:38,410
Good job, guys.

884
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,579
Your team had two of
our favorite characters tonight,

885
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:43,348
both of which were
absolute standouts.

886
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:44,917
- Well done.
- Thank you.

887
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:45,918
Appreciate it, guys.

888
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:47,419
I'm more excited about the team.

889
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:48,904
There's more of a reward

890
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:51,206
knowing that all five
of these guys

891
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:52,708
are growing and getting better,

892
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:54,126
and they learned to bring it.

893
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,595
Congratulations, Team Rayce.

894
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,463
Nice way to kick off
the competition.

895
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,698
Thank you.

896
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,867
However, we can only have
one winner.

897
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:06,305
So, Glenn, who is the winner of
our first spotlight challenge?

898
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,675
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

899
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:13,845
Logan.

900
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,914
The sculpture
of the primate ruler is great,

901
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,383
but you were also responsible
for the cowl

902
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:19,751
on the arachnid alien,

903
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:21,653
and that's what pushed you
over the top tonight.

904
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:24,239
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

905
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,124
I'm very excited to win.

906
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,844
It feels great to have
Rick Baker compliment my work,

907
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:31,029
especially being self-taught.

908
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:32,497
I'm elated right now.

909
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:37,002
Unfortunately,
Kelly, Gregory, and Ben,

910
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:40,605
you are on the bottom, and
one of you will be eliminated.

911
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:42,274
The rest of you are safe

912
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:43,742
and you can head back
to the makeup room.

913
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,985
It's time for you guys
to step to the center circle.

914
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:04,012
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

915
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:06,565
Kelly, we definitely appreciate

916
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,234
how big you went
from a design standpoint,

917
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:12,704
but your flat-faced alien
just didn't work for us.

918
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,875
Gregory, your character
lacked specific primate anatomy,

919
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,645
and your paint job, particularly
on the muzzle, was very muddy.

920
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:24,816
Ben, while we appreciated
your work on the female cowl,

921
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:29,087
I'm afraid the hands for both
aliens ended up quite rough.

922
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,622
Who is going home tonight?

923
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,257
The person going home
tonight is...

924
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,914
Gregory.

925
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:42,667
Unfortunately, it seems that
none of the parts of your makeup

926
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,169
quite came together,

927
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:48,040
and we just weren't seeing the
concept in the final character.

928
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,808
Gregory, I'm so sorry,

929
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:51,643
but you have been eliminated.

930
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:55,247
That means, Kelly and Ben,
you are both safe this week

931
00:41:55,282 --> 00:41:56,948
and can head back
to the makeup room.

932
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,188
When I was 15 years old,
I went to the makeup union,

933
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:05,524
and a business rep with
the union told me to give up

934
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:07,826
and that I was never
gonna be a makeup artist.

935
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,394
So they were wrong.

936
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,596
So don't let this
discourage you.

937
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:12,798
Thank you, guys.

938
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,033
It's been great
having you here with us.

939
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:16,835
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

940
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,969
and pack up your kit.

941
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:19,104
Thank you.

942
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:20,305
- Good luck, Greg.
- Good luck.

943
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,306
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

944
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:22,457
Thank you.

945
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:24,609
This was a risk that I took,

946
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:27,946
and it did not pay off,
so I'm going home.

947
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:31,416
It's me, guys.

948
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:32,484
- Aw.
- What?

949
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:33,735
- Yeah.
- What?

950
00:42:33,787 --> 00:42:35,135
I have no regrets.

951
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,473
I'm happy that I was a part
of the competition.

952
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,120
My goal now is just to go back
to doing what I do.

953
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:43,024
I love special effects make-up.

954
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:44,171
I like teaching it.

955
00:42:44,172 --> 00:42:45,613
And I'm happy.
