1
00:00:01,866 --> 00:00:04,801
To win the money,
that would change my life.

2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:06,836
I don't want
to let myself down,

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:08,705
but I also don't want
to let Rayce down.

4
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:11,441
Falling short
would be devastating.

5
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:13,409
I'm hoping
that they call my name.

6
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:15,178
In a season of champions,

7
00:00:15,212 --> 00:00:16,913
four artists have excelled.

8
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:20,850
But which three will rise
and make it to the finale?

9
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:23,520
Make sure that you give this
your all.

10
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,388
I don't want this to end.

11
00:00:25,422 --> 00:00:27,991
If there were even an hour
I needed to work my hardest,

12
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:29,792
- it's right now.
- You're all I got left.

13
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:31,261
I wish we could keep everybody.

14
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:32,719
Shit!

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,292
Oh, my God.
This is not working.

16
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:36,499
Tonight, we'll know
who's in and who's out.

17
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:39,769
In the end, only one will win

18
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:42,272
a VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

19
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:45,041
to one of their 85
international locations,

20
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,077
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

21
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:51,414
and $100,000.

22
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,816
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

23
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:29,103

24
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,503
We head out this morning

25
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:50,273
and we end up at
an old West town.

26
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,078
- Horseshoes?
- Jail.

27
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,979
I see a picture
of Emily on there.

28
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:59,682
We're looking around,
and see the blacksmith's shop.

29
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:02,352
There's a bank that has
piles of gold.

30
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:07,123
And we see McKenzie has a
beautiful dress and high heels.

31
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:08,624
First of all,
why is she wearing this?

32
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,694
And second of all,
why are we in a western town?

33
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:15,932
- Good morning, guys.
- Good morning.

34
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,634
Welcome to Paramount Ranch's
Western Town.

35
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,237
These dusty streets
were a popular stomping ground

36
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,474
for jangling spurs
and stagecoaches

37
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:26,876
during the golden era
of Western filmmaking.

38
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,612
John Wayne, Bob Hope
and Kirk Douglas

39
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:32,382
used to ride horses
on this very trail.

40
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,884
- That's awesome.
- That is cool.

41
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:36,986
We're here today
because this year marks

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,189
the 50th anniversary
of the hit television series

43
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:41,657
<i>The Wild Wild West.</i>

44
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:45,228
This classic series took stock
characters of the old West

45
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:47,196
to a whole new level

46
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,599
by fusing them with
technological wizardry

47
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:52,168
that we've seen featured
in dozens of other films

48
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:53,569
and television shows,

49
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,939
like<i> Dr. Who, Hellboy</i>
and<i> Sherlock Holmes.</i>

50
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:58,408
Steampunk.

51
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:00,610
Cool. That's cool.

52
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,745
All right, so for
your spotlight challenge,

53
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,715
I want you to take things
a step further

54
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:09,218
by reimagining a classic
Western character

55
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:11,854
as a steampunk cyborg.

56
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,389
Oh, man.

57
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,591
I do really dig steampunk,

58
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,026
and I know this is
an opportunity

59
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,394
to fabricate something.

60
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:21,330
So I'm really excited.
This is a dream challenge.

61
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,866
Now, throughout this ranch
are the typical establishments

62
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,302
you'd expect to see
in the old West.

63
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,806
And each one represents
a classic Western character.

64
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,575
So if you pick the saloon,
you'll be making a barmaid.

65
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,911
The undertaker's parlor,
an undertaker.

66
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,813
The bank equals a bank robber.

67
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:38,881
The jail represents
the sheriff.

68
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,716
And the blacksmith
is exactly that.

69
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,485
A blacksmith.

70
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,588
Now, before you get started,
I know what you're thinking.

71
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:47,123
Steampunk is not easy,

72
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:50,460
because it's such a specific
and intricate space.

73
00:03:50,494 --> 00:03:52,228
Well, don't worry, guys.
I always have your back.

74
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:54,530
I'd like to introduce
a special guest

75
00:03:54,565 --> 00:03:58,134
who just so happens to know
all things steampunk.

76
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,836
Glenn, come on out.

77
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,571
That's awesome.

78
00:04:01,605 --> 00:04:03,005
Yeah.

79
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,207
It's Glenn, thank God,

80
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,476
because I know nothing
about steampunk

81
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,444
except for
there's lots of beards.

82
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,313
- Thanks for being here.
- Thank you for having me.

83
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:13,916
Every season, the artists are
terrified of doing steampunk,

84
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:15,251
because they know what I know.

85
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:18,020
Glenn is intimately familiar
with this world.

86
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,622
So I thought I'd have him
come out here today

87
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,858
to talk to you about where
people go wrong,

88
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,226
and how to get it right.

89
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,094
At the core of
the steampunk aesthetic

90
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:26,863
is a combination of two
elements,

91
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:29,265
a Victorian or Edwardian
fashion sense,

92
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,968
combined with antediluvian
technology.

93
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:33,503
What that means is,

94
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:36,339
technology from a previous
civilization

95
00:04:36,373 --> 00:04:37,640
that has been rediscovered

96
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,308
and is now powered with steam.

97
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:41,611
And exceedingly important

98
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:44,180
is making everything look
like it has a purpose.

99
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:48,117
Do not glue gears or rivet
brass plates

100
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,486
onto an area that doesn't
make any sense.

101
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,355
It must look like it works.

102
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,290
I'm not a fan of steampunk,

103
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:55,758
and I don't watch Westerns.

104
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,361
I get what cyborgs are,

105
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,263
but to then factor in
these other two elements?

106
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:02,798
This is going to be a rough one.

107
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,634
I'd go stake your claim

108
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:06,335
on one of the storefronts

109
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,070
by removing the ring of keys
out front,

110
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:09,639
and then get started
on your designs.

111
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:12,241
Remember, guys,
this is your last chance

112
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:14,744
to prove to the judges
that you deserve

113
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:16,312
to make it to the finale.

114
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:19,148
On my mark, get set, go.

115
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:24,487
Drinks.

116
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:27,823
My character's a barmaid.

117
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,992
She's going to be sexy,
but also hard core.

118
00:05:30,027 --> 00:05:33,429
Most important is to sell
the idea that she's a cyborg

119
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,798
underneath and over the top
of the flesh.

120
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,767
This is an opportunity
for me to fabricate

121
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:40,069
a mechanical arm that she could
serve drinks from,

122
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:42,605
with a tank on top
and some gauges on it

123
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,273
to tell you how much is left.

124
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:46,409
I want this to be the best
character I've made so far.

125
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:56,586
These are all genres that
I'm not very comfortable with.

126
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,721
I picked the keys
for the blacksmith,

127
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:01,457
and I have absolutely no idea
where to start

128
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,658
with this character.

129
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:03,926
It's really stressful,

130
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,761
because this is
the last challenge

131
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:07,096
before the finale.

132
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,332
And if I can't come up
with a design,

133
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:12,468
that could be it for me.
And I don't want to go home yet.

134
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,075
I got the steampunk
bank robber.

135
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:20,576
He's kind of an expert thief.

136
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:23,279
He's going to have a cyborg arm

137
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:25,848
that is also his weapon.

138
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:28,818
I know Glenn's going to be
looking for originality.

139
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:30,386
It's going to be really tough
to impress him,

140
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,421
so I want to make sure
I go all out.

141
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:36,359
I don't do robots.

142
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:37,660
I'm not familiar with them.

143
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:39,328
But reading about it,

144
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:40,696
the undertakers
make the coffins,

145
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,665
they dress the bodies,
they bury them.

146
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,866
Because it's a cyborg,

147
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,635
I want to break up
the human form,

148
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,536
and I'm going to go
with a coffin shape.

149
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:50,072
I want to be in this finale
so bad.

150
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:52,808
I cannot be the one
eliminated on this.

151
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,147
In the entire time

152
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:00,549
that we're sitting there
thinking about our characters,

153
00:07:00,584 --> 00:07:02,752
I don't come up with anything.

154
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:04,654
And that's really scary.

155
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:07,223
I just-- like, I have to focus
on this.

156
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,893
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

157
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:13,596
Let's go back to the lab,
everybody.

158
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:25,641
We have five hours in the lab
today-- first we pick our models.

159
00:07:27,244 --> 00:07:30,513
And then I go to my station
and start sculpting the chest.

160
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:35,985
I'm going to make a coffin chest
to break up the human form.

161
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,487
I'm not really too sure what
I'm going to do for the face.

162
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:40,489
I'm just going to focus
on this chest

163
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:41,691
and get him sculpted and molded

164
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:45,327
so I can run foam latex today.

165
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,732
Old West barmaids
are very voluptuous.

166
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,635
So my barmaid is going
to be well-endowed.

167
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,606
And I almost am taking her
into a caricature.

168
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,874
What you doing there, bud?

169
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,676
Uh, nothing.

170
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,178
Not over here doing anything.

171
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:05,314
I'm going to sculpt out
a full chest piece

172
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:08,451
that has some bajungs
that are about this big.

173
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:13,489
Other people seem like
they've got a direction,

174
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,157
and I still don't.

175
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,861
The first thing I do
is gather some materials

176
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:21,697
so that it gives me a few more
minutes to think about it.

177
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:25,701
But I really need
to get this nailed down.

178
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:27,403
Ooh, it's hot out.

179
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:28,938
I got a barmaid.

180
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:30,973
Okay.

181
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,843
My only concern
is the size of the hoots.

182
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:35,377
And with all the other
things to do,

183
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:40,449
is sculpting a nice set
of hoots, like, the way to go?

184
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:42,084
It really is ridiculous,
Rayce points out,

185
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,620
that it's just a waste of time.
So we scrap it.

186
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,146
_

187
00:08:46,723 --> 00:08:50,025
I think Logan definitely has
the ability to go to the finale.

188
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,094
He reminds me a lot of myself,

189
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,764
coming in with not
a lot of experience

190
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:59,068
and having to learn an insane
amount every challenge.

191
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:01,937
I may only have
one team member left,

192
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:04,974
but I'm happy I got Logan.

193
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:07,209
- Hey, what's going on?
- Well, I got a bank robber.

194
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:08,744
Yeah, that's exciting.

195
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,246
Laura and I start talking
about the concept,

196
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,315
and I start telling her
exactly what I want.

197
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,784
And because I don't know
how to draw,

198
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:17,186
she draws out
what I'm describing.

199
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,723
- Do you do much fabrication?
- No.

200
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:23,058
Julian's got
a lot of fabrication,

201
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:24,860
something that he's never
done before.

202
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:28,164
But if he leaves himself enough
time to do that fabrication,

203
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:29,799
I'm sure he can pull
something good off.

204
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:33,068
- All right, have fun with the L200.
- Well, yeah.

205
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:38,741
- So you got blacksmith.
- Blacksmith.

206
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:41,577
Trying to get myself
in some sort of direction.

207
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:45,714
At this point, I started coming
up with potential concept ideas.

208
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:49,084
He heaps the metal
somewhere inside of him.

209
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,753
Yeah!

210
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:52,988
I like the idea
of this blacksmith

211
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:55,424
who replaced his heart
with a forge.

212
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:59,295
And he has an iron jaw
embedded into his flesh.

213
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,297
I like that.
That makes a great silhouette.

214
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:02,698
- Okay.
- And it gives him

215
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,366
kind of a menacing look
as well.

216
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:06,902
It's kind of silly,
but it's something.

217
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,137
It's better than-- you know,

218
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,139
it's better than not having
a concept.

219
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:14,176
I work on the chest
for about 2 1/2 hours.

220
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:17,179
And I'm ready to mold.

221
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:19,815
I need to get
this chest out today,

222
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,550
because I need to pre-paint
and fabricate

223
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:23,385
on top of the foam tomorrow.

224
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,787
Hi, everybody.

225
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,522
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hi.

226
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,858
I chose the salon,
which is the barmaid.

227
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,427
All of these tubes will be
pumping steam into her

228
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:32,761
and her arm device.

229
00:10:32,796 --> 00:10:34,663
- How's your beauty makeup?
- I have not done much.

230
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:36,332
- Okay.
- And I do need to work on that.

231
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,666
This is the type of makeup

232
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,735
- that can't be subtle.
- Right.

233
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,537
She can have eyeliner.
You can use lashes.

234
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:44,173
You can have red lipstick
to really kind of bring it out.

235
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:46,008
- Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
- Good luck.

236
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:49,411
I want to fabricate his arm
into some type of weapon.

237
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:52,681
I want it maybe have something
that rotates like a gun barrel.

238
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:55,317
If you don't have time,
don't worry about it rotating.

239
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:59,088
Just selling the idea that
he has the ability to shoot,

240
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:00,756
it will sell your concept.

241
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,057
Thank you.

242
00:11:02,092 --> 00:11:03,726
So I have the blacksmith,

243
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,863
and the idea is that
he implanted a furnace

244
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,465
into his chest.

245
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,467
Even if you just did doors
and you put some LED lights

246
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,269
where you really
couldn't see into it.

247
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,070
You could just see
some glow out of it.

248
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:16,338
I'm going to let you
get back to work.

249
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:17,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

250
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:18,908
So I have the undertaker.

251
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:21,610
For the chest, I want to go
with a coffin shape.

252
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:23,512
I'm going to do a lot
of fabrication on the chest

253
00:11:23,546 --> 00:11:25,781
to have all the different
pipes and liquids.

254
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,249
Okay, now with the face,

255
00:11:27,284 --> 00:11:30,052
are you going to cyborg
a section of it?

256
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:33,656
I'm not too sure what I'm
going to do for the face yet.

257
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,990
This is what
the judges are going to look at.

258
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:37,993
And all the rest of this
is kind of like window dressing.

259
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,597
This is what's either going to
make you or break the challenge.

260
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:44,066
I wish we could keep everybody
that's here,

261
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,434
but someone's going
to have to go.

262
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:46,869
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck.

263
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:47,903
Well, good-bye, everybody,

264
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:50,506
and my best wishes
to all of you.

265
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,207
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

266
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,181
I'm super frustrated right now.

267
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:02,985
I'm, like, super
fucking frustrated.

268
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:04,920
Mr. Westmore wants me
to focus on the face,

269
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:06,555
but I don't know what to do.

270
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:09,625
I don't know anything
about cyborgs or steampunk.

271
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:10,826
This is a mess.

272
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,261
We're this close to the finale,

273
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,996
and I'm scared.

274
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,031
I don't want this to end.

275
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:25,384
I'm, like, super
fucking frustrated.

276
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:27,219
It's day one in the lab,
and this is the last challenge

277
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,587
before the finale.

278
00:12:28,621 --> 00:12:30,155
I have no idea what I'm going
to do with the face,

279
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,692
and I don't have much time
to make decisions,

280
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:37,329
because I need to get this chest
out or I will be screwed.

281
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,635
Try to stay away
from sharp edges.

282
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,038
My main goal with this sculpt
is to suggest beauty

283
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,140
on top of cyborg.

284
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:51,076
So I start sculpting in
mechanics.

285
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,911
I take pre-made pieces

286
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,247
and I impregnate
the clay with them.

287
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:57,482
That gives me the best effect

288
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,751
of mechanics beneath
beautiful surfaces.

289
00:12:59,786 --> 00:13:01,687
Almost there.
Almost there.

290
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,122
- See you tomorrow.
- Breathe, breathe.

291
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:06,325
- See you guys.
- Bye.

292
00:13:10,263 --> 00:13:13,198
A cyborg isn't a full robot.

293
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:16,401
It's a person
with robotic parts.

294
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:19,605
So I want to create
a metal dome

295
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,039
where half of it is metal plate

296
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:23,375
and the other half
is see-through glass,

297
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:25,711
so you can see all the gears
on the inside.

298
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:27,379
So I have this dome
that I'll be able to fit

299
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:30,082
into my cowl sculpt tomorrow.

300
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:37,189
Do you know the time?

301
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,890
56 minutes.

302
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:40,092
Shit.

303
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:42,194
I have an hour
to finish this mold,

304
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:44,229
and I'm still applying
UltraCal to it.

305
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:49,368
Finally, the mold is done.
But it still has to dry.

306
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:50,569
So I can't open it yet.

307
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:51,970
Why are you freaking out now?

308
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,139
Why do you have to get the chest
mold out right this second?

309
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:56,074
Because I have so much
to fabricate on it.

310
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:59,211
Because if not, then there's
really no point to it.

311
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:00,679
15 minutes, everybody.

312
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:02,447
I'm just going to go for it.

313
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:05,183
I'm going to open it.
But it's scalding hot,

314
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,518
because it's still curing.

315
00:14:06,552 --> 00:14:09,121
Uh...

316
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:12,224
Which means it could crack.
And I have minutes left.

317
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,328
I got it.
I got my mold done just in time.

318
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:19,665
I don't know how that happened,
but it did.

319
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:22,200
That's time.
Let's go home.

320
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:26,038
Tomorrow, I can focus
on the face and fabrication.

321
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:28,106
So I'm feeling a lot better.

322
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,149
And it begins.

323
00:14:37,183 --> 00:14:39,551
It's day two of
the steampunk challenge.

324
00:14:39,585 --> 00:14:40,919
We have 9 1/2 hours to work.

325
00:14:40,953 --> 00:14:43,422
That's awesome
that we all wore black.

326
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:46,625
Today I have to finish
the sculpt on the face,

327
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,293
sculpt the cowl out,

328
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,962
and I need to fabricate
this arm piece.

329
00:14:50,997 --> 00:14:52,331
I'm thinking about going

330
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:54,266
very scarred and wrinkled
on the face.

331
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,536
I just want it to look
like this unsavory character

332
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,171
that you wouldn't want
to run into.

333
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:01,039
And your eye flows with this.

334
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,674
And it's all over that.

335
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,043
Julian is working
on the bank robber,

336
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,579
and he's going to try his hand
at fabrication

337
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,147
for the first time ever.

338
00:15:09,182 --> 00:15:10,982
Hopefully you'll have enough
time at the end of the day

339
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:13,018
- to make this shoulder piece.
- Right.

340
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:19,057
Figure out what you're
gonna do with the face?

341
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,692
I'm thinking about doing
like a metal beard.

342
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:23,362
I slept on it last night and
I was thinking about the face.

343
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:26,965
The concept behind the beard
is that it has a respirator

344
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:28,667
attached to it.

345
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:31,903
So he doesn't breathe in
all the chemicals, or whatever.

346
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:33,205
Okay. Steam-powered mask?

347
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,174
- Yes.
- That will look cool.

348
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:39,945
I feel like if I incorporate
the metal mask,

349
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:42,514
it'll make it steampunk
and cyborg enough.

350
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:47,352
Get the goggles sculpted first,

351
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,521
and then worry about
the little details.

352
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,523
I spent a few hours
working on the face sculpt.

353
00:15:51,557 --> 00:15:55,327
I decide that instead of having
connected goggles,

354
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:59,364
I just want to have
two eye pieces that are embedded

355
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,500
into the skin
around the eye sockets.

356
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,135
Because it's that
sort of classic

357
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,771
steampunk aviator-style goggles.

358
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,806
And in order to sell
the steampunk aspect

359
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,008
of this challenge,
I really need to make sure

360
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,643
that these goggles
look steampunk.

361
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:14,012
- Looks good.
- Cool. Thank you.

362
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,550
Is this the fabrication table?

363
00:16:18,584 --> 00:16:19,751
My big challenge today

364
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:22,187
is fabricating the arm device
to completion.

365
00:16:22,221 --> 00:16:24,756
So I'm hard at work
fabricating this arm

366
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,926
using L200 foam, glues, tubing.

367
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,461
Whenever you're ready,
let me know.

368
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:32,230
I'll go in and I'll kind of show
you how to use that waxer.

369
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:33,999
Rayce shows me
this waxing tool,

370
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:35,267
which I've never used before.

371
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,169
And it actually does
a fantastic job

372
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:39,604
of melting away L200 foam.

373
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,873
So I can carve out
filigree out of foam.

374
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,976
It's great, and I just hope
the other contestants

375
00:16:45,011 --> 00:16:46,978
don't see me using it,
because it's perfect.

376
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,747
- You like messing with that?
- Yeah, it's cool.

377
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:50,782
It's very similar to tattooing.

378
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:58,590
Formaldehyde
and some kind of salt.

379
00:16:58,624 --> 00:16:59,958
Because my character's
a mortician,

380
00:16:59,992 --> 00:17:02,594
I want the embalming liquids
to be part of the makeup.

381
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:05,697
So I take clear hair gel
and mix it with acrylic paint,

382
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:07,899
and I paint it into the bottle

383
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:10,936
so it looks like
there is a liquid inside.

384
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,505
And I'm liking
the way it looks.

385
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:18,276
Are you gonna be able
to have enough time

386
00:17:18,311 --> 00:17:20,779
to fabricate this arm today?

387
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:22,147
I'm going to do my best.

388
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,082
I've roughly drawn out a shape.

389
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,952
Since I'm not familiar
with fabrication at all,

390
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:30,489
Laura draws out how I can get
the shape that I need.

391
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:31,990
So that's pretty helpful.

392
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,593
After Laura leaves,
I finish molding.

393
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:38,330
And then it's time
for fabrication.

394
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:40,131
I have to work on this arm now,

395
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,901
and it's just the bane
of my existence.

396
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,238
This is the challenge
before the finale,

397
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:47,873
so I need to make sure
that I'm showing how much

398
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:49,474
I want to be in the finale,

399
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,576
by really stepping out
of my comfort zone.

400
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:54,679
I'm just worried that maybe
I'm attempting to do

401
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,249
too much stuff
that I don't know how to do.

402
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:00,051
Fucking steampunk.

403
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:01,520
I'm using the hot glue gun

404
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:03,188
to try to glue
these pieces together.

405
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:04,956
But it's not holding
the right way.

406
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:07,559
I'm using the heat gun
to keep it in shape.

407
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:11,630
It's just a mess, just trying
to figure this stuff out.

408
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:13,131
Time is running out.

409
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:14,966
I don't even know
if what I'm doing

410
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,601
is right or wrong
at this point.

411
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,503
I'm screwed.

412
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:25,979
It's day two
of the steampunk challenge.

413
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,781
It's finally come down
to the fabrication.

414
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,717
And time is dwindling,
but I need to make sure

415
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,319
that this doesn't look cheesy.

416
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:34,854
So I'm going balls to the wall
trying to do something bigger

417
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:38,158
just to show how much I'm trying
to get into the finale.

418
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:40,760
I have to just keep going,
and hopefully I'll be able

419
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:43,063
to figure it out.

420
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,633
She's a barmaid.
She serves drinks.

421
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,402
So I'm fabricating tube
down through her finger

422
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:51,605
so she can dispense
whiskey into a glass.

423
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,673
I'm not sure exactly
how to make it work.

424
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,241
This is just
an engineering thing

425
00:18:55,276 --> 00:18:57,510
that I have to work on
application day.

426
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,882
- Ah!
- Darla, pull yourself together.

427
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:05,151
I know.
It's just one of those days.

428
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,327
That's time, everyone.

429
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,163
We're all stressed out.

430
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,766
Tomorrow's the last opportunity
to show the judges

431
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,701
that we're worthy
of the finale.

432
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,503
- Your arm looks awesome.
- Thank you.

433
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,739
I have to do a good,
clean application,

434
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:28,041
but I'll have all the parts
to do it.

435
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,952
We get back to the house,

436
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:40,720
and I think everyone
is a bit nervous at this point.

437
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:44,124
When we started we had so many
people in the house.

438
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,859
And then now it's just four.

439
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,727
There's so much
that has happened,

440
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:49,562
and it's unbelievable.

441
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:52,298
And I'm really excited
to just work my hardest

442
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,967
and make it to the finale.

443
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,369
It would be really hard
to get this close

444
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,304
and then not make it.

445
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,807
To have the opportunity
to win the money,

446
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:03,510
that would change my life
in so many ways.

447
00:20:03,544 --> 00:20:05,945
Tomorrow is going to be
a long day.

448
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,259
It's application day,

449
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,327
and we have four hours
to do this makeup.

450
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,498
I have to do the fastest
application as I possibly can,

451
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,167
- so I can spend the rest of the time on...
- Awesome!

452
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:29,936
- Painting and stuff.
- ...finishing this thing.

453
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:32,338
Logan got as far as he could
on the fabricated arm.

454
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:34,441
But is there going to be
enough time

455
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:36,609
to put it all together

456
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:38,912
and leave time for those
all-important details?

457
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,380
Well, I'm going
to do it in an hour,

458
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,382
and then spend the rest of the
three hours doing fabrication.

459
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:46,252
- Good morning.
- How's it going?

460
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,253
How are you?

461
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,688
I've got some stuff to do

462
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,790
before I'm gonna
be starting on you at all.

463
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:52,826
When the models arrive,
I'm not quite ready

464
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,227
to start application,

465
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:57,063
because I still have a fair
amount of fabrication to do.

466
00:20:57,098 --> 00:21:00,200
Once I get all the pieces
of the armor glued down,

467
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:02,102
I take it back
to the spray booth

468
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,238
and spray-paint
the whole thing black.

469
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:08,308
What are you staring at?

470
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:10,477
Just the symmetry
of the cheekbones.

471
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,679
The right side
of his prosthetic

472
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:15,115
looks really, really weird.

473
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,483
There's something
definitely off.

474
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:18,017
You make me nervous

475
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:20,620
when you stand there
staring quietly.

476
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,455
This one's
in the wrong spot, so...

477
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,524
With this character,
where she has to be beautiful,

478
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:26,526
you have to make sure
that these prosthetics

479
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,428
are wonderfully symmetrical.

480
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:30,163
That should be further down.

481
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:32,132
The whole thing
needs to go like this.

482
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,200
This side is crooked,
and he's absolutely right.

483
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:35,902
It's coming off.

484
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:39,005
But I'm in a frenzy, because
there's a lot of work to do.

485
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,207
- Come down a little bit.
- Yeah, that's better.

486
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:49,916
I apply the face to my model,

487
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,951
and my edges are kind of wonky.

488
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:53,753
And if I try to do
a realistic flesh tone,

489
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:55,655
it's going to look silly.

490
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,991
So instead of going
with a realistic character,

491
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,426
I'm going to go
with a stylized character.

492
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:04,297
I use the Kryolan aqua color
to create corrosive skin,

493
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:07,433
the same texture that I used
for the rust on the chest.

494
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:14,174
If I can color-match him,
then I don't have to worry

495
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,309
- about painting his arms.
- Yeah.

496
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:19,712
Getting natural-looking
skin tone is pretty difficult,

497
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:22,182
because skin is very
translucent.

498
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,651
And when you're painting
on a foam piece,

499
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,786
there's no translucency
whatsoever.

500
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:31,357
So the trick is to do
multiple layers of washes,

501
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,761
flecking and airbrushing
and veining and mottling.

502
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:38,364
So I'm just flecking
as fast as I can.

503
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,333
Time to patch you up.

504
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,869
Everything gets laid down,
and it's time to start blending.

505
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,604
Blending is key here.

506
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:46,472
I'm just really worried
about that chest piece

507
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:49,876
being all gross
and crazy-looking.

508
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,711
The chest piece area
is starting to look

509
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,680
a little bit gross,

510
00:22:53,714 --> 00:22:56,049
and that is absolutely not
what I want of this character.

511
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,817
It's got to be beautiful.

512
00:22:57,852 --> 00:22:59,385
So I started blending edges
with Cabo-Patch.

513
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,354
And I go over it
and over it again.

514
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:02,755
So you've got an hour left.

515
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,891
Maybe just continue
to make that chest work,

516
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,760
because another thing
is every time she moves,

517
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:10,430
this neck is crinkling
and mushing.

518
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:11,998
I'm already behind schedule.

519
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:14,334
Now I'm actually worried
about the makeup.

520
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,539
It's almost the end
of application,

521
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,975
and I'm falling behind.

522
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,543
I still have to figure out
how I'm going to get

523
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:26,346
this giant armor
to look steampunk.

524
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,547
Pour into there.

525
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:29,382
Make a nice little
oatmeal consistency.

526
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,852
Luckily, Laura suggested
mixing corn meal

527
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:36,055
and latex together,
and then smear it onto the armor

528
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,690
just to give that rusted look.

529
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:40,293
And painting on top of that.
It is a really cool effect.

530
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:41,661
I think you got,
like, 20 minutes.

531
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,396
So take a minute to pack up.

532
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,932
I only have the first layer

533
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,735
of the PAX skin tone base
on the model.

534
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,236
And I still have a ton
of work to do.

535
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:51,704
So I'm going
to have to prioritize

536
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:55,108
whatever little time
I have left.

537
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,317
That's it! Time's up!

538
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:05,618
Oh, God.
I hope I have everything.

539
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,487
Leaving the lab,
I'm really nervous.

540
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,088
If you do a good makeup

541
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:11,891
but it's still not exciting
or it doesn't fit the challenge,

542
00:24:11,926 --> 00:24:14,494
that's what sends you home
at this point.

543
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:17,263
And tonight, we'll know who's in
and who's out.

544
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,724
I get to last looks,
and I have one hour.

545
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,693
Can you hold the wardrobe
off to each side

546
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,295
while I'm doing this?

547
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:33,629
One of the most important things
I have to do

548
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:37,900
is glue the forge
onto the L200 base.

549
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,936
I'm happy with the way
the forge turned out,

550
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,338
and now I just have to make him
dirty and sweaty.

551
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,512
_

552
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:49,479
I don't know what happened.
It doesn't look as good

553
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:50,913
as it did
when she left the lab.

554
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:54,183
There's some serious edge
texture issues going on,

555
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:56,119
so I'm scrapping the idea
for the arm gag.

556
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:57,386
I don't have time for it.

557
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:00,723
I need to focus on making
this roughness softer.

558
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:03,359
If there were ever an hour
I needed to work my hardest,

559
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:05,394
it's right now.

560
00:25:07,764 --> 00:25:09,432
That's not going to work.

561
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,801
I start fussing around
with the vacuformed dome.

562
00:25:11,835 --> 00:25:15,171
It's taking forever just
to fit it inside the foam latex.

563
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:16,506
Screw it.

564
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,707
So I decide to scrap it.

565
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:20,676
Now I need to do as much
detail work as I can.

566
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,812
Ten minutes, everybody!

567
00:25:31,688 --> 00:25:34,190
- That's time, everyone.
- Whoo!

568
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,928
To me, it reads steampunk.
It reads cyborg.

569
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:40,363
It reads Western.

570
00:25:40,397 --> 00:25:44,100
But I'm worried that it's not
going to be enough.

571
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:56,245
Welcome back
to the reveal stage.

572
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,780
As you guys know,
only three of you

573
00:25:57,814 --> 00:26:01,717
will earn spots tonight
in this season's finale.

574
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:05,821
Which means one of you
will be eliminated.

575
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,256
But before we get
down to business,

576
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,625
let's say hello
to our talented judges.

577
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,961
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

578
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:13,496
Mr. Glenn Hetrick.

579
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,830
Good evening, guys.

580
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:15,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

581
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,533
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist,

582
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:21,037
- the lovely Ve Neill.
- Hi, everybody.

583
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:22,872
- Hey.
- Excited?

584
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:24,540
- Terrified?
- Both.

585
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:27,944
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

586
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:30,313
- Good evening.
- Hey.

587
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:33,015
All right, guys, this week
your spotlight challenge

588
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,351
was to choose a classic
old West character

589
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,688
and reimagine it
as a steampunk cyborg.

590
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,891
So with only three finale spots
on the line,

591
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:43,926
let's take a look
at your creations.

592
00:27:07,317 --> 00:27:08,684
I'm concerned that Glenn's

593
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,653
not going to think
it's steampunk enough

594
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:11,854
or cyborg enough.

595
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:13,456
So I'm scared.

596
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,858
I just want to be in the finale
so bad.

597
00:27:15,892 --> 00:27:18,961
I just hope this makeup
is good enough.

598
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:48,257
The fabrication is very rough,

599
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,593
but he still looks like
a villainous bad guy.

600
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,628
He is a really cool character.

601
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:18,054
I think, as a character,

602
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:19,855
it's one of my favorite pieces.

603
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,125
Technically, though,
I failed on a number of points.

604
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,528
And I hope it's not too much
to send me home.

605
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:54,623
There's three other really
strong artists right now.

606
00:28:54,658 --> 00:28:58,861
And I'm very concerned that
my concept isn't good enough.

607
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:01,330
I'm hoping that my application
is strong enough

608
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,366
to carry me into the finale.

609
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,109
Okay, judges.
It's time to take a closer look.

610
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:23,085
This is a nice
paint job on this.

611
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,620
- I do love the colors.
- Yeah.

612
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:26,989
- This confuses me.
- Yeah, me too.

613
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:29,024
But I do love the tubes.

614
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,095
I got to see this.

615
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,663
Ah.

616
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:36,532
I know it's the top
of the head,

617
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,300
but I wish that there was a bit
more control and purpose

618
00:29:38,335 --> 00:29:39,635
- to what all this is.
- Mm-hmm.

619
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:41,404
Because it feels like...

620
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:43,339
- A bunch of gears.
- Sort of.

621
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:44,540
- Yeah.
- It really does

622
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,575
have an overall great look.

623
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,978
But the sculpting is so rough.

624
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:50,813
It's just harsh carvings,
which is too bad,

625
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:53,082
because the whole idea
is very cool.

626
00:29:57,687 --> 00:29:59,789
I think this piece is bad.

627
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:01,724
I don't think it's meant
to be wrinkled like that.

628
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,726
It's just so rough.

629
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,061
Especially for it being one away
from the finale.

630
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,530
Up close, I know
the judges are pointing out

631
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,332
some of the seaming, some of
the weird wrinkles going on.

632
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,600
Nothing I can do about it now.

633
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:13,035
That's cool.

634
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:14,637
A little drink dispenser.

635
00:30:14,671 --> 00:30:16,505
Can you bend it at all?
Is it...

636
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,607
Okay. Good.

637
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,409
I hope as a package,
this is worth it

638
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,478
to get me into the finale,

639
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:24,647
because it would absolutely suck
if I went home for this.

640
00:30:28,852 --> 00:30:32,321
Tell us who made your favorite
Western steampunk cyborg

641
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:35,291
tonight on Twitter,
using #FaceOff

642
00:30:36,553 --> 00:30:38,387
I think this piece is bad.

643
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:39,855
I don't think it's meant
to be wrinkled.

644
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,323
I know the judges
are pointing out

645
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:42,925
some of the seaming,
some of the weird wrinkles

646
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:44,126
that are going on.

647
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,794
- I like this idea.
- Yeah.

648
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:47,696
- A lot.
- And I like how this

649
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:49,999
is all solid
and in the anatomical form.

650
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,567
Let's take a look at your arm.

651
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:54,336
That's cool.
A little drink dispenser.

652
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:56,739
He's paying attention
to making this functional.

653
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,807
I hope as a package,
this is worth it

654
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:00,809
to get me into the finale,

655
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:02,211
because I want to prove myself.

656
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:04,547
So it would absolutely suck
if I went home for this.

657
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,885
I love that the theme of this,
with him being a blacksmith,

658
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:14,356
that the actual core of the idea
is the core of the makeup.

659
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:16,592
That feels very metallic.

660
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,227
You know what's
a nice little touch

661
00:31:18,261 --> 00:31:19,962
that we have not seen
a whole lot of--

662
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:21,764
The sweat on his brow.

663
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,933
- It's on his arms too.
- Thank you.

664
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:31,106
All right, guys.
The judges would like to speak

665
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,242
with each of you
before deciding

666
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:35,044
who will make it to the finale.

667
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:37,246
- Darla, you're up.
- Okay.

668
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:44,620
Tell us about the concept

669
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,822
behind your steampunk-inspired
blacksmith.

670
00:31:46,856 --> 00:31:49,425
He took out his heart
and replaced it with a forge,

671
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:52,461
so that he could focus
on his work.

672
00:31:52,495 --> 00:31:54,196
Pretty much every element
of this challenge

673
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,332
was outside my comfort zone,
but all that considered,

674
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,866
I'm pretty happy with it.

675
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:01,036
I see your self-questioning
present in this week's work.

676
00:32:01,071 --> 00:32:04,440
But I do really like
the overall look.

677
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:06,241
Thank you.

678
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:07,643
What I like about your makeup

679
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:11,814
is the core theme
is center to the character.

680
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:14,383
It is a very clean character.

681
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:16,185
I would have liked to have seen
just a little scroll work

682
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:17,686
on this jaw piece,

683
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:18,921
or some riveting or something,

684
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:20,623
because this part up here
is very plain.

685
00:32:20,657 --> 00:32:23,058
And I do like the addition
of the sweat.

686
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:24,393
That was a really nice touch.

687
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:26,962
That really helps with the theme
of being the blacksmith.

688
00:32:26,997 --> 00:32:29,365
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Nice job.

689
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,702
He's got a cool look overall.
The skin growing over the piece,

690
00:32:33,737 --> 00:32:35,537
that takes the character
to a whole new level.

691
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:37,906
Thank you.

692
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:38,974
Darla, you can step down.

693
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:41,243
Thanks, Alex.

694
00:32:46,116 --> 00:32:48,183
Julian, you're next.

695
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,692
Julian, tell me about
your bank-robbing,

696
00:32:56,726 --> 00:33:00,362
cowboy steampunk cyborg.

697
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:02,364
My character originally
started out as a miner.

698
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,966
There was an accident,

699
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,367
and all the mechanics
on the top of the head

700
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:06,568
are keeping him alive.

701
00:33:06,603 --> 00:33:08,771
It was my first time
working with L200.

702
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:13,042
Well, I do love me a cowboy,
so I do like this character.

703
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,510
I do like the scar on the face,

704
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:17,780
but the sculpting
doesn't look like flesh.

705
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:19,648
I think your greatest success
on this one

706
00:33:19,683 --> 00:33:22,818
is the overall silhouette.

707
00:33:22,852 --> 00:33:26,922
But the brain feels like
bits and pieces just glued on.

708
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:30,726
I think you did a great job
embracing the Western aesthetic

709
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,361
of what we were talking about.

710
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:33,729
And I love the reveal
with the hat.

711
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:34,963
But one of my problems
with the makeup

712
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:36,231
is the top of his head
is too high.

713
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,834
Some really great things.
Some other things

714
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:41,870
that I've got to sort
of pick apart a little bit.

715
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,706
Julian, please step down.

716
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,674
Thanks.
Thanks, guys.

717
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:55,551
Emily, please step up.

718
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:02,124
Oh, gosh.

719
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:04,026
So, tell us about your
steampunk character, please.

720
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,261
He's a mortician.
He's not very familiar

721
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,996
with the chemicals they use
to embalm the bodies.

722
00:34:08,031 --> 00:34:10,365
Mixing them corroded the metal,

723
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,201
and his skin's starting
to turn to metal.

724
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:14,937
The overall color of this
is so beautiful and harmonious.

725
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,308
I just love the fact
that he's become so oxidized

726
00:34:19,342 --> 00:34:23,178
and so patina'd
by this chemical reaction,

727
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:25,914
which I think
is really quite nice.

728
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,417
- Thank you.
- What are the bottles

729
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:29,785
on his chest made of?

730
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,020
I found baby powder bottles.

731
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:33,956
I just-- I vacuformed it

732
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,625
and used hair gel, and I just
tinted it with acrylic paint.

733
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,826
Is this something
you've done before?

734
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:39,194
No.

735
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:41,463
There's a lot of overwhelmingly
genius decisions

736
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:42,865
that you're making
to do things quick,

737
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,869
and it works out
extraordinarily well.

738
00:34:46,903 --> 00:34:49,371
The texture of the skin
is really cool.

739
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:50,973
And I love the fact
that the paint's

740
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,408
all sort of dark
around the hairline,

741
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:55,177
so it's burnt out, smoked out.

742
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:56,779
It's really pretty, honey.

743
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:58,313
Thank you.

744
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:01,583
- Emily, you can head back.
- Thank you. Thanks, Marcus.

745
00:35:01,618 --> 00:35:04,319
- Good job. - Nice job.
- Thanks. Thanks.

746
00:35:06,156 --> 00:35:08,390
All right, let's talk to Logan.

747
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:19,067
Logan, tell us about how you
used the steampunk aesthetic

748
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:21,036
on your barmaid character.

749
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,671
She's classic barmaid.

750
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:26,775
She serves drinks
through her arm device here.

751
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,744
And what about the filigree
on her forehead?

752
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,112
Filigree
was hand-sculpted.

753
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:32,681
Well, I think that
in and of itself is impressive.

754
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:37,719
I also think it's an incredibly
articulate conveyance

755
00:35:37,754 --> 00:35:40,889
of that archaic technology
that we were talking about.

756
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:42,424
What I do not think is great

757
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:43,692
is some of the edging
and blending work

758
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,360
from her breast to her chest.

759
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,996
Really rough.

760
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:49,698
I really like this character.

761
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:51,433
It's so unfortunate
that you had

762
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:53,802
so many problems
in this area right here,

763
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:55,704
because this is a mess.

764
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:58,006
But I think the design of it
is really cool.

765
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:01,076
And I love this headpiece.

766
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,412
To do filigree right
takes time and patience.

767
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:05,447
So it's impressive that you
pulled off what you did

768
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:06,748
with that piece alone.

769
00:36:06,783 --> 00:36:08,884
Thank you.

770
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,587
- Logan, you can head back.
- Thanks.

771
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:16,892
All right, you guys can all
head back to the makeup room

772
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:20,262
while the judges decide
who will move on to the finale.

773
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:22,931
Oh, my God.

774
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,971
All right, judges.

775
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:31,173
Well, you have some
big decisions to make.

776
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:32,975
Why don't we start with Darla.

777
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:35,944
Well, Darla did another
exceptional application

778
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:37,946
and a beautiful sculpt.

779
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,349
I think it was missing
a little bit

780
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:43,085
of some of the steampunk
componentry

781
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,153
that we would have liked
to have seen.

782
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:47,823
But all in all,
it was a pretty solid character.

783
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,458
And it was painted beautifully.

784
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:51,727
The chin piece
was beautifully executed.

785
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:54,596
And she did that one extra
fine little detail

786
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,366
that we've so rarely seen,
sweat.

787
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,701
All right, judges,
let's move on to Julian.

788
00:36:59,736 --> 00:37:01,436
He really worked hard

789
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,272
at getting that whole
cowboy aesthetic down.

790
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:04,940
And he did a really great job
at them.

791
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,608
The dirtiness of the clothes

792
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,176
really pulled
that whole thing together.

793
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:10,846
The concept, with
his arm being augmented,

794
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,047
that's right-thinking.

795
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:14,917
The execution of it
was lacking precision.

796
00:37:14,951 --> 00:37:17,252
But it was his first time
using L200.

797
00:37:17,287 --> 00:37:19,054
- That's pretty courageous.
- Yeah.

798
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:20,689
All right, let's move on
to Emily.

799
00:37:20,723 --> 00:37:23,525
This little girl is
absolutely phenomenal.

800
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:25,427
She completed an entire makeup

801
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:26,962
with sort of the half face,

802
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,797
and then all this mangled
jaw area

803
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,300
that facilitated in putting
her steampunk elements over.

804
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,534
Okay, that's really smart.

805
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,536
Emily is fearless
in three categories--

806
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,973
fabrication, concept and form.

807
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:42,277
That kind of range is,
at any age, admirable.

808
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:45,314
All right,
let's move on to Logan.

809
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,249
Cool barmaid. Bitching arm.

810
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:50,886
He achieved one of the
most steampunk-looking objects.

811
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,822
He insculpted that
filigree on the plate in her head,

812
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,490
and the way that it just
divides her face in half.

813
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,893
It's all beautifully
encapsulated

814
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,094
within the human form.

815
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:01,063
As much as I love the design,

816
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:03,231
he should have thought
about that chest piece

817
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:05,968
right out there in the middle
of her body.

818
00:38:06,002 --> 00:38:07,803
Blatantly bad edges.

819
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:11,540
As a design,
this is on the right track.

820
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:13,108
Incredibly tough
decision this year.

821
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:15,344
This is one of the closest
it's ever been.

822
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:16,678
All right, judges.

823
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,113
Have you chosen
your final three, then?

824
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:19,848
Yes, we have.

825
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:22,084
Let's bring them back out.

826
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:31,827
Welcome back, guys.

827
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:34,763
It's time to find out
who is moving forward.

828
00:38:34,797 --> 00:38:37,899
So, Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge,

829
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:40,802
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

830
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:42,437
The winner of tonight's
challenge,

831
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:45,173
and the first person
moving on to the finale is...

832
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:55,262
So, Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge,

833
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:58,164
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

834
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,933
The winner of tonight's
challenge,

835
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,602
and the first person
moving on to the finale is...

836
00:39:06,374 --> 00:39:10,043
Emily.

837
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:12,746
Oh, my God.

838
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,014
We love the weathered

839
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:15,915
and oxidized paint
on your character.

840
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,351
Though he was not
traditionally steampunk,

841
00:39:18,386 --> 00:39:20,453
he still very much
evoked that world.

842
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,756
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

843
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:24,040
_

844
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:25,759
I'm going to start to cry.

845
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:27,427
What?

846
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:31,865
I'm the youngest person
to ever be on<i> Face Off,</i>

847
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:33,199
and I'm in the finale.

848
00:39:33,234 --> 00:39:35,201
It's so awesome.

849
00:39:35,236 --> 00:39:37,437
I will never forget the way
I'm feeling right now.

850
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:38,972
Emily, congratulations.

851
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:41,508
You have earned the first spot
in the finale.

852
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:43,009
Thank you.

853
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:46,146
Glenn, who is the next
person to make it to the finale?

854
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,448
The second person that will be
joining us in the finale is...

855
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:54,654
Darla.

856
00:39:58,658 --> 00:39:59,727
Thank you.

857
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:01,828
Oh.

858
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,363
We really liked your choice

859
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:04,831
to make the blacksmith
profession

860
00:40:04,865 --> 00:40:06,566
the central component
of your character.

861
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,201
And you delivered, once again,

862
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:09,803
your signature style.

863
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:11,938
A beautifully clean,
finished makeup.

864
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:13,306
Thank you so much.

865
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:15,108
I don't even know what to say.

866
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:17,243
I am shocked. I'm in.

867
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:19,713
I made it to the finale.

868
00:40:19,747 --> 00:40:21,614
And that is the most
incredible thing.

869
00:40:21,649 --> 00:40:23,383
Congratulations, Darla.

870
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,820
You've earned the second spot
in our finale.

871
00:40:26,854 --> 00:40:28,722
All right, guys,
this is the hard part.

872
00:40:28,756 --> 00:40:30,023
We have two artists left,

873
00:40:30,057 --> 00:40:32,992
and only one of you
can join us in the finale.

874
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:36,329
Glenn, who has earned
the last spot?

875
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,765
I do really want this spot.

876
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,500
I'm hoping that
they call my name.

877
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:42,335
I'm ready to go further.

878
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,704
More than anything,
I want a chance to prove

879
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:48,641
that I can do some of the things
that they think I failed at.

880
00:40:48,676 --> 00:40:50,176
I also don't want
to let Rayce down.

881
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:53,747
This was an awfully
difficult decision.

882
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:57,183
The third and final spot
goes to...

883
00:41:01,021 --> 00:41:02,422
Logan.

884
00:41:06,694 --> 00:41:08,461
The overall aesthetic
of your barmaid

885
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:09,963
felt really well-conceived,

886
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:13,199
and the sculpted filigree work,
particularly on her forehead,

887
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:15,335
was just really beautiful.

888
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:16,536
Thank you.

889
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,704
I'm incredibly grateful.

890
00:41:17,738 --> 00:41:18,905
This is where I've been hoping

891
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:20,106
to get to the whole time.

892
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,708
I feel like this is now
a competition

893
00:41:21,742 --> 00:41:23,042
that's starting for me.

894
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:25,845
- Logan, congratulations.
- Thank you.

895
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,981
Unfortunately,
that means, Julian,

896
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:30,617
you have been eliminated.

897
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:33,019
Julian, it has been
an absolute pleasure

898
00:41:33,053 --> 00:41:34,421
to have you here with us.

899
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:35,855
And I got to tell you,

900
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,757
you've done some amazing things
this season.

901
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,326
This is definitely
one of the worst situations

902
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:41,528
we've been in

903
00:41:41,562 --> 00:41:43,530
in terms of picking
our final three.

904
00:41:43,564 --> 00:41:45,098
You guys all killed
this challenge,

905
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:47,133
and I'm proud
of all four of you.

906
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,802
- Thank you.
- Julian, it's been

907
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:50,370
great having you here with us.

908
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:51,938
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

909
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:54,107
and pack up your kit.

910
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:55,575
Thank you.

911
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:58,411
- See you.
- See you, guys.

912
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:00,713
- Thank you, Julian.
- Good luck.

913
00:42:00,748 --> 00:42:04,117
It stings a bit that I've been
through every single challenge,

914
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:09,322
did some cool makeups and did
not make it to the finale.

915
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:12,559
But this whole competition
has really put everything I have

916
00:42:12,593 --> 00:42:13,660
to the test.

917
00:42:13,694 --> 00:42:15,061
I hope that I made my family,

918
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:16,329
my girlfriend proud,

919
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:19,432
because I'm proud of myself.

920
00:42:22,903 --> 00:42:25,972
Congrats again to you three.

921
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:28,007
I'm excited to be able
to call you finalists.

922
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:29,776
Nice work.

923
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,077
Oh, my gosh.

924
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:34,380
But your night isn't over yet.

925
00:42:34,415 --> 00:42:36,316
This season's finale
is going to be

926
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,719
- the most difficult one yet.
- Oh, no.

927
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:42,789
You guys have these amazing
champions in your corner.

928
00:42:42,823 --> 00:42:44,023
So we're raising
the bar on you.

929
00:42:44,058 --> 00:42:45,024
Aye, aye, aye.

930
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:46,159
What bar are we raising?

931
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:47,560
Oh, no.

932
00:42:47,595 --> 00:42:49,829
I don't feel like I'm ready
to start the finale.

933
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,898
We just went
through hell and back.

934
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:53,399
What are we doing?

935
00:42:53,434 --> 00:42:55,602
Why are we still on stage?
