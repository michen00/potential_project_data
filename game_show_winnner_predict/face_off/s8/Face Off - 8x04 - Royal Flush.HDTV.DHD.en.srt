1
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:01,986
The concept feels cohesive.

2
00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:04,188
Looks like a psychedelic
artichoke with a bat face.

3
00:00:04,223 --> 00:00:08,426
This is my favorite makeup
I've seen on <i>Face Off.</i>

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,028
Previously on <i>Face Off,</i>

5
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:12,864
Ben and Darla's cactus ram
brought Ben his first win.

6
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:13,865
Nice.

7
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:15,099
But Alan fell short

8
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:18,169
and was the first
on Team Anthony to be sent home.

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,140
Now 13 artists remain,

10
00:00:22,174 --> 00:00:25,677
and tonight they'll be dealt
their toughest challenge yet.

11
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,945
Having a panic attack
right now.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,081
Now I know why people freak out
on<i> Face Off.</i>

13
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:31,382
It's time, everybody.

14
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,884
Ah, shit.

15
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:35,186
Might be putting a makeup
onstage that's not finished.

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,487
It's really hard
not to love it.

17
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:37,555
Thank you.

18
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:39,057
In the end, only one will win

19
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,292
a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-up

20
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:44,195
to one of their
85 international locations,

21
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:46,998
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

22
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:50,802
and $100,000.

23
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:52,937
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

24
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,158
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

25
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,910
Wow, look at the chandeliers.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,348
We're walking through
this really cool casino.

27
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,384
People are gambling.

28
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:40,785
It's just
a beautiful atmosphere.

29
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:42,553
- Look at this.
- Nice.

30
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:44,288
We're like, "What's the deal?"

31
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:47,091
I have, like, a million things
going through my flipping head.

32
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:50,895
Hey, guys.

33
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:51,963
Hey.

34
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:53,931
Welcome
to The Normandie Casino.

35
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:56,167
This is a popular location
for filmmakers

36
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,103
in need
of that classic Las Vegas look,

37
00:01:59,138 --> 00:02:00,605
but it's right here
in Hollywood.

38
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:02,640
It's been featured in movies
and television shows

39
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,909
like<i> The X-Files, Big Love,</i>

40
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,111
and<i> Buffy The Vampire Slayer.</i>

41
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:08,846
And whether you're playing
Texas hold'em

42
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,081
with your poker buddies

43
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,583
or screaming "Blackjack"
on a casino floor,

44
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:15,520
this week's challenge involves
some classic characters

45
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:17,922
you're probably
very familiar with.

46
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:21,159
They make up the royal court
of the gaming world.

47
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:22,226
Nice.

48
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,861
King...

49
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,463
- Oh, my goodness.
- Queen,

50
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:28,132
jack, and joker.

51
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,168
Nice.

52
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:33,237
Now, in Tim Burton's
<i>Alice In wonderland,</i>

53
00:02:33,272 --> 00:02:36,207
Helena Bonham Carter's
highly exaggerated version

54
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,976
of the red queen of hearts
played a pivotal role

55
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:40,311
in establishing the film's

56
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:43,681
outlandishly stylized setting
and tone.

57
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,082
So with that in mind,

58
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:48,152
- your first individual...
- Yes!

59
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:50,755
...spotlight challenge

60
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,356
is to choose a card

61
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,425
and bring that character
to life

62
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,794
in an outlandish and quirky way

63
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,629
worthy of a Tim Burton film.

64
00:02:58,664 --> 00:02:59,630
Oh, my God.

65
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,132
And you must also somehow

66
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,635
incorporate your card's suit
into your makeup...

67
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,139
diamond, club, heart, or spade.

68
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,708
If you get the joker,
you can choose any suit you want

69
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:12,143
to incorporate into your makeup.

70
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:14,145
I'm thrilled that
it's an individual challenge,

71
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,980
'cause I get to show
what I have to offer.

72
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,049
This is awesome.

73
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,118
Jamie, you're first pick.

74
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:22,220
King of spades.

75
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:24,055
- King of clubs.
- Jack of spades.

76
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,089
Queen of hearts.

77
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:26,390
Queen of diamonds.

78
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,558
King of diamonds.

79
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:28,860
Jack of hearts.

80
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,394
- Joker.
- King of hearts.

81
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:32,163
- Jack of diamonds.
- Queen of clubs.

82
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:33,331
Queen of spades.

83
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:35,099
Jack of clubs.

84
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,335
All right, it's time
to get started on your sketches.

85
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:38,903
Good luck.

86
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,171
- Thank you.
- Bye.

87
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:48,346
The jack of diamonds
is the virtue of patience,

88
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,149
so I'm thinking of a character
that has been waiting so long,

89
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:54,519
he's just completely old
and decrepit.

90
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:56,621
So it's a whimsical character

91
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,589
yet scary at the same time.

92
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:03,628
My king of diamonds
is a greedy, lonely king.

93
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:06,631
One diamond that a witch
gave him is making him sick.

94
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:09,200
And to push the diamond factor,

95
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:11,669
I'm gonna give him
a diamond-shaped face.

96
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:16,307
I'm excited to have hearts
as my suit.

97
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,109
The jack of hearts,
specifically,

98
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:19,710
represents jealousy.

99
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,613
So he is the advisor
to the king of hearts,

100
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:24,415
but he is secretly in love
with the queen,

101
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,217
and so he is very jealous
of the king.

102
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:29,453
I'm gonna build his face
into a heart shape

103
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,923
by sculpting the beard and hair.

104
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:33,758
I think it's really gonna
capture the essence

105
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,293
of this challenge.

106
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:38,796
I get the king of clubs,

107
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,332
and the first things
that enter my mind

108
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,100
are jokes and plays on words.

109
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,002
So I'm doing a king
of nightclubs

110
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:47,838
who's this slick,
rat pack entertainer.

111
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:50,374
And if a party needs
to be thrown, he's throwing it.

112
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:55,713
My queen of spades
is this judge-like character.

113
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,348
When you walk
into her courtroom,

114
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,250
it's her decision whether you...

115
00:04:59,284 --> 00:05:00,484
...or you're let free.

116
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,421
The hair will be sculpted
into the headpiece,

117
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,556
and it'll read like a spade.

118
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:09,140
_

119
00:05:09,194 --> 00:05:11,062
I'm in trouble.

120
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:13,345
_

121
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,074
_

122
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:18,849
_

123
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,858
_

124
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,402
_

125
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,340
_

126
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:26,928
_

127
00:05:26,929 --> 00:05:28,596
_

128
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:32,350
All right, everybody,
let's go back to the house.

129
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:42,693
It's day one in the lab.

130
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,028
I have 5 1/2 hours.

131
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:45,463
I chose king of spades,

132
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:46,964
which is traditionally seen

133
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:50,001
as David in David and Goliath.

134
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,536
So I want to pick
a big, burly male model

135
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,173
and then style the wig
into the shape of a spade.

136
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:59,010
Finally, it dwindles down
to one male model

137
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:01,545
and one female model,

138
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,581
and the male model gets chosen.

139
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:05,983
Now my whole concept
has to change.

140
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:07,752
And it's time
to start sculpting,

141
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,620
but I have no idea what to do.

142
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:11,889
So I start sketching it out
in clay

143
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,325
to see what I can come up with.

144
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:16,460
Hey!

145
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:17,461
Hey, Laura.

146
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:18,462
- Hey, guys.
- How you doing?

147
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:19,530
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

148
00:06:19,564 --> 00:06:21,298
So what are you doing?

149
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,533
I have the king of spades,

150
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,301
but I have a female model.

151
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:25,936
Oh.

152
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,873
Gender change is automatically
gonna be a challenge,

153
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:30,374
especially with proportions.

154
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,842
- I'd say keep it fun.
- Yeah.

155
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:32,843
I wouldn't make it too...

156
00:06:32,878 --> 00:06:34,311
- Serious?
- Serious.

157
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,781
And I think you should make it
more of a whimsical character

158
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:38,115
so that the judges don't see it

159
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,617
as a woman underneath,
you know?

160
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,951
- A woman underneath a man.
- Yeah.

161
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:42,753
For my new concept,
my king of spades

162
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:46,290
is a very prideful, short man
who holds a big sword

163
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,260
but looks completely ridiculous.

164
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:50,461
Okay. We'll do this.

165
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,797
Okay.

166
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:53,798
So what you got?

167
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,599
Got the jack of clubs.

168
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:58,302
The jack of clubs
represents wisdom,

169
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:01,205
so I immediately think
of this older advisor

170
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,473
to the king of the underworld,

171
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,675
and he helps lead people
to the underworld.

172
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,710
I like the cheekbone.

173
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:07,078
I like how gaunt it is.

174
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:09,980
I'm sculpting the club form
directly on the forehead

175
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:12,283
using the cheekbones
as the side of the clubs.

176
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:14,885
I like the idea that he was
branded with the club symbol.

177
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,421
I really see
a lot of potential in Julian.

178
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:18,956
It's an incredible asset

179
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,592
to be able to think
outside the box.

180
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:28,899
So I got the king of hearts.

181
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:31,635
The king is stabbing himself
in the head with a knife.

182
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,903
Right, suicide king.

183
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,005
This is my favorite card
in the entire deck.

184
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,007
I decide that
the king is depressed

185
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,777
because the queen of hearts
was killed in front of him.

186
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:42,012
And I chose a female model

187
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,848
because I want this king
to look long,

188
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:44,982
kind of drawn out, thin.

189
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,383
I like
where you're going with it.

190
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,952
Okay, cool.

191
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:51,522
Oh, this is kind of fun.
Queen of hearts.

192
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,125
Yes, I don't want to go
too <i>Alice In Wonderland</i> with it.

193
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,159
Absolutely, yeah, I--

194
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,160
- I'm a little nervous,

195
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:57,428
because it can't look

196
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:59,530
like all the queen of hearts
that have been done.

197
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,532
But I do want
to take the evil route.

198
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:02,767
It could be any kind of heart.

199
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,635
So even, like,
the human heart is okay?

200
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:06,170
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Okay, all right.

201
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:09,874
So I decide that she keeps
all the hearts of her victims

202
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,776
on a picket fence
around her neck,

203
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,979
and she has a huge,
asymmetrical, red wig.

204
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:16,213
I kind of do love this.

205
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:17,381
Thank you.

206
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:20,951
Shit.

207
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:23,287
I'm not liking
what I'm doing right now.

208
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:25,923
My sculpt looks like a man,
not a queen,

209
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:27,191
and now I'm worried.

210
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,559
Doing it.

211
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:31,128
This is a confused piece.

212
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:32,396
He's got such a strong brow,

213
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,766
a strong nose, a strong chin--
too monster.

214
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,569
Daniel's concept is very scary,
very serious--

215
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:41,038
not really the point
of this challenge.

216
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:43,774
I think you should start again.

217
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,142
I don't believe it.

218
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,578
Anthony wants me
to start from scratch,

219
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,747
and I have no time.

220
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,482
People are already finishing,

221
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:54,251
but I know if I don't do this,
I'm gonna be in trouble,

222
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:55,586
definitely.

223
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:58,355
Do it?

224
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,124
Okay, let's go.

225
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:09,863
It's the first day
of our playing card challenge,

226
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:13,667
and I decide to destroy
my sculpture and start again.

227
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:15,402
I got to think
a little bit more,

228
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:17,037
because I need an idea,

229
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:20,974
not just, like, a bunch of clay
with nose and ears.

230
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,677
Here we go again.

231
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,745
Hi, everybody.

232
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,080
- Hi.
- Hey, how's it going?

233
00:09:26,114 --> 00:09:29,116
It's time to show me
what you've been dealt.

234
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,319
I picked the jack of spades,
the one-eyed jack.

235
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:34,388
So he's gonna be
a musketeer-style character,

236
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:36,323
and then I'm gonna incorporate
the actual spade

237
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:38,826
as a patch on his eye that's
actually sewn into his face.

238
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,094
It's more horror...

239
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:41,495
Okay, I see what you're saying.

240
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,496
Than it is whimsical
and Tim Burton.

241
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,997
- Yeah.
- Be careful with that...

242
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:45,766
- Okay.
- ...so it doesn't look gory.

243
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,301
I have the joker.

244
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,837
I'm thinking of him
more as a toy.

245
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:52,106
I want to do a face
in the front

246
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,942
and a face in the back
with a different expression.

247
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:57,411
You still have reality
going on there,

248
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,546
so I would take it
and go for the full fantasy.

249
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:00,547
Okay.

250
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:02,082
You are in clay hell.

251
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:03,283
Yeah.

252
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:05,018
Finally I came up
with a new design

253
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:06,320
for my queen of diamonds.

254
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,189
She's so vain,
and she collects diamonds,

255
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:10,390
and she eats them,

256
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:13,660
so her lips and face
will be a diamond shape.

257
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,163
Elongate the face
to create the whole diamond.

258
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,431
- Like this.
- Good, good.

259
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:18,632
Thank you very much.

260
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,735
My character
is the queen of clubs.

261
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,572
My concept is this aged,
heavier-set queen,

262
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,674
and I want to incorporate
the shape of the club

263
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,277
in some natural wrinkle lines
that complement her face.

264
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:32,513
I think your whole concept
of your symbol

265
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:33,814
is going to get lost.

266
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,849
These things have to have
more definition.

267
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:36,950
You got to be able to see it.

268
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:37,985
Okay.

269
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:39,019
Bye-bye.

270
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,587
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

271
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:45,425
I think this is ready.

272
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,327
I really want to get
this face knocked out

273
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:48,595
for my jack of diamonds.

274
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,663
Yeah, that's better, man.

275
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,131
The mouth is looking
really cool

276
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,367
'cause it's sunk in
like he's got no teeth,

277
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,668
real old-looking.

278
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:56,737
And now I'm ready
to start molding this thing.

279
00:10:59,474 --> 00:11:00,874
Just a little frustrated.

280
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,577
Something's feeling weird
about this character right now.

281
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:06,413
I think that the old age
is hindering you.

282
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:08,582
The wrinkle patterns
are blending in

283
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:10,284
with the cheekbones too much,

284
00:11:10,318 --> 00:11:12,853
so the club forms need to be
a little more obvious.

285
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:14,488
First idea is not
always the best.

286
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:15,889
This is a pretty big change.

287
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:19,826
I start scraping the old-age
sculpture off of the face,

288
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:23,397
so now I'm making my design
thinner and younger,

289
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:26,600
and I think that will help
show the shape of the club.

290
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:28,435
Time is of the essence.

291
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:31,972
I got to get out of here.

292
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:34,107
Good luck, all right?

293
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:35,342
All right, you know
the direction you're going?

294
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,443
I do.

295
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:37,811
Glad we got a chance to talk.

296
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:40,013
I'm most concerned about Logan,

297
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,481
because I want to make sure

298
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:44,084
that he is pushing his character
as far as it will go

299
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,519
before he molds it.

300
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:46,753
See you, guys.

301
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,967
That's time, everybody.

302
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:01,268
It's the end of day one,

303
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:03,337
and I'm rolling
with the punches here.

304
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,638
I changed the sculpt,

305
00:12:04,672 --> 00:12:06,006
and I'm happy to have done it.

306
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,276
But I am behind schedule,
so I need to be quick tomorrow.

307
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,253
It's day two of our whimsical
playing card challenge,

308
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:23,357
and I have 9 1/2 hours
and a lot to do.

309
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:24,524
Good morning.

310
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,360
I have to finish up my face
super quick,

311
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:28,195
get my cowl busted out,

312
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:30,931
and get everything molded
and cleaned.

313
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:31,932
It's gonna be sweet.

314
00:12:31,966 --> 00:12:32,933
- Ah!
- It's gonna be sweet.

315
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,601
Do it.
Let's do it.

316
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,006
I think it's better.

317
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,540
It's a lot softer.

318
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,195
_

319
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,612
While my face mold
is setting up,

320
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,581
I move on to the hair.

321
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,450
I'm hoping that
by sculpting the hair,

322
00:12:50,485 --> 00:12:52,552
it might make mine stand out
a little bit more.

323
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:56,456
So I start rolling out
individual noodles of clay

324
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:59,626
and then lining them up
along the base structure,

325
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:01,295
and then I'll be
smoothing it out,

326
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,397
so it doesn't look
quite so ridiculous.

327
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,334
I'm feeling
a little bit better,

328
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:11,071
but I know it's still a risk
to do a gender-swap makeup.

329
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:12,539
But it's getting
a little bit better.

330
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,708
The face is starting to look
a little bit more like a man.

331
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,610
But I know I need to spend
more time on this.

332
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:17,978
Yeah, I'd try to get these
in the mold room

333
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:20,147
by the five-hour mark.

334
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:27,554
Gonna have the biggest spade
of any spaders.

335
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,589
Since I'm making
a musketeer-style character,

336
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:31,958
I want to make the head
into a spade shape,

337
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:33,493
so I cut out around the shape,

338
00:13:33,528 --> 00:13:34,928
and I start using the heat gun

339
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:36,997
to get some texture
into the foam itself.

340
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:39,566
I'm excited because I've never
made a hat like this before.

341
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,301
I've made small hats
for my kids

342
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:42,903
but nothing
for a fabrication piece.

343
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:45,539
Dude, that's badass.
That's cool.

344
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:49,876
Right now
my joker's going to have

345
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:52,012
a face in the front,
face in the back.

346
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:54,181
But because I'm running
out of time,

347
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,683
I'm not gonna sculpt
the second face.

348
00:13:56,718 --> 00:14:00,387
Instead, I'm going to finish
the first face

349
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:02,856
and run a copy and latex.

350
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,858
Then I'll have two faces.

351
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:06,626
It's definitely
something different

352
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:08,795
than anybody else is doing
in the room.

353
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,534
That's pretty good.

354
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,170
I find my red wig that I wanted

355
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,505
and just start brushing it out.

356
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,242
And I'm using cotton and nylon
to create a shape,

357
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:25,879
and I start darkening areas
and making it more Burtonesque,

358
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:29,616
and I spray it with glitter
to make it classy.

359
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,886
I have this idea
that I could actually

360
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,488
make the broken heart bleed.

361
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:37,991
The idea for the chest piece
is to create this heart.

362
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:40,560
I want to make him look
as if he is broken

363
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,562
and devoid of all the blood
in his body.

364
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:45,132
It could kind of lead
more towards horror, which--

365
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,533
and you'll get kind of dinged,

366
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,202
like, "Where's the quirky
of this character?"

367
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:50,270
Rayce is right.

368
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:52,706
The design that I have
is too horror,

369
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,307
and it's supposed to whimsical.

370
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,543
What the hell else
am I supposed to do?

371
00:14:56,577 --> 00:14:58,445
This is the first
individual challenge,

372
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,180
so I need to stand out.

373
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:01,815
Oh, God.

374
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,193
I think it could go either way.

375
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,262
I just want to let you know
that it could go either way.

376
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:12,164
It's day two
of our playing card challenge,

377
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,734
and Rayce says to me,
my chest piece is too horror.

378
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,670
Do you think I should just cut
out the broken heart altogether?

379
00:15:18,704 --> 00:15:21,039
And then the only appliance
that I have would be the face.

380
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:22,641
And at this point,
I'm just like,

381
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:24,342
"I have to scrap
my chest piece."

382
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:25,377
Focus on the face.

383
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:26,845
Get this thing
in the mold room.

384
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,046
Every second counts.

385
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,749
Now all I have is a face piece.

386
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:33,418
I'm sitting here, like,
having a panic attack right now.

387
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:36,688
Doubting yourself wastes time,
and nothing gets done.

388
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:39,624
Now I know why people
freak out on <i>Face Off.</i>

389
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:40,992
Thank you.

390
00:15:43,062 --> 00:15:44,029
See you later.

391
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:45,030
Yeah, see you, Laura.

392
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:46,164
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

393
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,833
My time in the lab
is almost at an end.

394
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,469
I'm very confident
that they will get the job done

395
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:51,803
and get it looking good.

396
00:15:51,838 --> 00:15:54,673
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck, see you tomorrow.

397
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:55,841
I open my face mold,

398
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,776
I clean out the clay,
and it's done.

399
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,411
I still have to figure out

400
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:00,712
what my paint scheme
is gonna be,

401
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:02,581
so I pour gelatin
into the face mold,

402
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,149
so I have some sort of piece

403
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:07,118
that I can practice
pre-painting on.

404
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,787
One hour, everybody.

405
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:16,561
I just need this gelatin
to cool down,

406
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:17,629
so I can peel it out.

407
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,697
Oh, yeah.

408
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:20,499
The gelatin is still
tacky and gummy,

409
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,435
and this is just a nightmare.

410
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:26,805
I'm starting to freak out.

411
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,373
If I don't get this gelatin
cleaned out,

412
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,041
I don't have a foam piece,
and I'm screwed.

413
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,043
This was probably
a really bad idea.

414
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,948
Time is dwindling,
and I run with the mold

415
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:39,751
outside to the pressure washer.

416
00:16:39,785 --> 00:16:41,486
And I'm spraying like a madman

417
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:44,623
and pouring out
as much as I can.

418
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:48,660
It's working, but it was
a huge waste of my time.

419
00:16:48,694 --> 00:16:50,462
It basically took away time

420
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,931
from me being able
to work on anything else.

421
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:55,800
Just struggling with this.

422
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:58,603
That's time, everybody.

423
00:16:58,638 --> 00:16:59,971
It's the end of day two.

424
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:01,640
I'm feeling a little behind.

425
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,008
The mold is ready for foam.

426
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,109
Thank God for that.

427
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:06,344
I still have to figure out
my paint scheme.

428
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:09,447
I'm gonna have to really hustle
to get everything done tomorrow.

429
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:19,958
It's application day.

430
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:21,293
We have four hours in the lab

431
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,461
and one hour at last looks.

432
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:25,931
I know I got to get
this face painted, hand-painted,

433
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:28,400
and then this guy's got to get
a wig and a full costume.

434
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:29,834
I like the nostril hair.

435
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:30,936
Yeah.

436
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,137
- Cool.
- It looks pretty good.

437
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:34,139
That looks really good.

438
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:35,607
My prosthetic looks great,

439
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:37,008
but I get some bad news.

440
00:17:37,043 --> 00:17:39,377
My model is not
going to be there.

441
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:42,113
Let's see if your new model...

442
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,415
Looks anything like Kevin.

443
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,283
- Looks anything like Kevin.
- I'm hoping.

444
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:50,221
- Julian.
- Augustine.

445
00:17:50,256 --> 00:17:51,389
Hi.

446
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:52,624
How are you?

447
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,326
All right,
who's our replacement?

448
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,393
Is it Omar?

449
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:56,595
Hey!

450
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:59,297
Omar has a much narrower,
thin face.

451
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,734
It's gonna completely change it
from, like a wide diamond

452
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:04,436
to, like,
a really, really thin diamond.

453
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,838
And I got to try and fit
Kevin's face onto your face.

454
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:08,239
All right.

455
00:18:08,274 --> 00:18:09,941
I'm gonna make this work.
I'm rolling with it.

456
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:11,042
Is that gonna be my hair?

457
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:12,043
Yeah.

458
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:13,979
That's awesome.

459
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:19,417
Because my wig
is so big and heavy,

460
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:22,153
it could easily fall off
if she moves a certain way.

461
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,255
So I have to pin-curl
my model's hair,

462
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,459
so I have pins
to anchor the other pins to.

463
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:29,094
Hopefully it'll work.

464
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,662
I'm sorry if I'm hurting you.

465
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:31,970
_

466
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,001
So my plan for application day

467
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:39,170
is to apply the cowl
and then apply the face piece.

468
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,372
Are you gonna put this
over the face?

469
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:42,474
Should it,
or should this go over that?

470
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:43,475
This is gonna have
to come over this.

471
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:44,576
Yeah.

472
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,677
And then Anthony comes by,
and he goes,

473
00:18:45,711 --> 00:18:48,346
"No, no, no, no, no, no,
do the other way."

474
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:49,781
I'd almost consider
cutting this.

475
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:50,782
Right here?

476
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:52,350
Then this can come over that.

477
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:53,885
It's good advice,

478
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,854
but that means
I have to cut around the cowl

479
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:57,389
to make this face work on her.

480
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:59,491
It's gonna take a lot of time
out of my painting.

481
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,730
The only problem with it is,

482
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,332
she's very feminine.

483
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:10,335
I put the wig on her,
and it's not working.

484
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:11,770
_

485
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,103
_

486
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,573
I am so lost, because all of
the wigs that would have worked

487
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:18,043
have been taken
by all of the other contestants.

488
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:21,479
I pick out this wig
that wasn't my first choice.

489
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:22,914
But I go with it

490
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:27,385
because I'd much rather have
a makeup out on that stage

491
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,987
than have nothing at all.

492
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:30,689
- It's time to go.
- Yeah.

493
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:36,728
I'm applying a base coat
over all of the foam pieces.

494
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:39,931
And then I go through
and do a darker color

495
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:42,667
into all of the grooves
and cracks of the hair.

496
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:45,403
So far it's coming along
really nice.

497
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,644
- It's not white.
- It's still Tim Burton pale,

498
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:54,179
but it's not, like, clown pale.

499
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:55,380
Yeah.

500
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,917
I am panicking
about the beauty makeup.

501
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:00,185
We have a subtle face,

502
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:02,620
so we need to do
the same thing for the paint,

503
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:03,955
not go crazy.

504
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,658
So a little bit exaggerate
but still beauty.

505
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:07,659
That's just subtle enough.

506
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:08,727
I wouldn't go too dark there.

507
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:10,228
Okay, cool.

508
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:12,864
I feel like I have
a lot to do, and I just don't...

509
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,400
I would say
spend as much time as you can.

510
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:17,102
Hold off on packing up your kit.

511
00:20:17,136 --> 00:20:18,803
So behind on this.

512
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,171
I'm still trying to figure out

513
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:21,840
how to get
that second face applied,

514
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:27,011
and I haven't even finished
painting the front face.

515
00:20:27,046 --> 00:20:28,313
You don't have a back face?

516
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:29,447
I do.

517
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:30,882
I just don't know
how to put it on.

518
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,851
I'm concerned because now

519
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:35,086
I know that it's gonna be
a last looks thing.

520
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:37,055
It's 30 minutes, guys.

521
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:43,194
It's time, everybody.

522
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:44,496
Ah, shit.

523
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,264
I don't think
I'm gonna get this all done.

524
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:47,665
Good luck.

525
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,469
I still got to put this face
on the back and paint it.

526
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:54,973
It's an extreme amount
of work to do

527
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,975
for my first
individual challenge.

528
00:20:57,009 --> 00:20:59,778
Might be putting a makeup
onstage that's not finished.

529
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,090
It's coming off right here.

530
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,026
At last looks, we have one hour,

531
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,895
and the first thing I notice
is that my lip just came loose.

532
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,431
I don't want to go home
because of that.

533
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,369
I absolutely need to add
that face in the back.

534
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:25,346
- Do you feel like it's
gonna fall off at all? - No.

535
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:26,873
If I don't get that done,

536
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:29,342
then I don't have
the character that I want.

537
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:32,145
Emily, do you have one second?

538
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,379
Emily's incredible.

539
00:21:33,414 --> 00:21:35,048
She told me,
"When you put the eyelashes,

540
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:36,749
just ask me,
and I do for you."

541
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:39,752
Without Emily,
I have nothing to show onstage.

542
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:41,454
Thank you, Emily.

543
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,556
I put the crown on,
and it's just another thing

544
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:45,491
thrown into this tornado
of crap.

545
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:47,293
And I know it'll probably
end me up in bottom.

546
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:49,095
Ten minutes, everyone.

547
00:21:57,071 --> 00:21:58,872
All right, guys, that's time.

548
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:00,506
Thank you.

549
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,876
I just feel broken right now.

550
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,211
All I can do is hope
that I'm safe.

551
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,423
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

552
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,027
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

553
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:22,462
But before we see
your creations,

554
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:25,131
let's say hello
to our series judges.

555
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:26,266
Glenn Hetrick.

556
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,267
Good evening.

557
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:28,268
- Hi.
- Hello.

558
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:29,269
Ve Neill.

559
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:30,336
Good evening, everybody.

560
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:31,337
- Hi, Ve.
- Hello.

561
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:32,372
And Neville Page.

562
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:33,373
Hi, guys.

563
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:34,807
- Hi.
- Hi, Neville.

564
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,743
And we have
a very special guest

565
00:22:36,777 --> 00:22:38,411
joining our panel tonight.

566
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,146
He is a true triple threat,

567
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,115
having won five Emmys
for his work

568
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:44,217
as a visual effects artist,

569
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,519
two Academy Awards
as a production designer

570
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:50,757
on<i> Avatar</i> and Tim Burton's
<i>Alice In Wonderland,</i>

571
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,227
and he just directed
his first feature film,

572
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:55,528
<i>Maleficent.</i>

573
00:22:55,562 --> 00:22:59,132
Please give a warm welcome
to Mr. Robert Stromberg.

574
00:23:02,469 --> 00:23:04,337
I am a huge fan of his work,

575
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,838
and if there's anybody

576
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:08,775
who knows the Tim Burton
<i>Alice In Wonderland</i> feel,

577
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:10,143
it's Robert Stromberg.

578
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:11,978
Thank you so much
for being here, Robert.

579
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:13,379
It's a pleasure to be here.

580
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:14,847
How about we check out
some makeups?

581
00:23:14,882 --> 00:23:15,949
Definitely.

582
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:17,550
Okay, this week,

583
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:20,553
for your first individual
spotlight challenge,

584
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:24,190
I asked you to each choose
a royal playing card

585
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:27,460
and bring it to life
in an outlandish and quirky way

586
00:23:27,494 --> 00:23:29,796
worthy of a Tim Burton film.

587
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,733
Champions, let's take a look
at your proteges' creations.

588
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:00,093
He's way too vampire to me,

589
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:03,629
but I think he has
a dark Tim Burton look to him.

590
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:21,781
All I can think about is,

591
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:23,483
it may look good from afar,

592
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:24,884
but up close, it's rough.

593
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:26,519
It is really rough.

594
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:48,074
She really pops onstage.

595
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:51,677
I'm just like,
"Ooh, I love you.

596
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,513
You look so good."

597
00:25:10,764 --> 00:25:12,331
I think she looks fantastic,

598
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:14,767
but she's got a goatee.

599
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:17,103
She's elegant and beautiful
and bearded.

600
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:36,789
He's looking really good,
but I'm still worried

601
00:25:36,824 --> 00:25:38,424
that they're gonna think
that my concept

602
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:41,561
is too on the nose
or just too out there.

603
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:00,046
I'm ecstatic right now.

604
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,814
I'm feeling like
I could have a top look.

605
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:04,317
I'm just hoping that it's
whimsical enough for the judges.

606
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:24,103
It stands out
but not in a good way.

607
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:25,805
It doesn't read
as a king of clubs.

608
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,275
It just reads as a pimp.

609
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,194
He's doing his jig,
and it's really funny.

610
00:26:48,228 --> 00:26:49,395
It looks great.

611
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:51,430
He looks just like
the way I envisioned him.

612
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:12,585
This is not 100% my best work,

613
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:15,721
but she looks like a queen...
sort of.

614
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,374
I'm really happy
with the silhouette.

615
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:36,776
It looks very royal.

616
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,978
I feel really happy
with what I've accomplished

617
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:40,413
in the past two days.

618
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:02,435
You really can't tell
which side is which,

619
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:04,537
so I'm excited
about how this looks.

620
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:23,756
I feel like it's whimsical.

621
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,259
It really looks like
what I had envisioned,

622
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:28,427
and I'm really happy
with this one.

623
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:47,113
The sculpture looks nice.

624
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:50,716
It's just, everything around it
is just terrible.

625
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:53,052
And I'm embarrassed
to be saying that it's mine.

626
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:03,229
Okay, judges, why don't you
check out the royal court?

627
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:13,306
Looks like this edge is
really rough along the bottom.

628
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,807
Just a little.

629
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:16,042
Thank you.

630
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,546
Oh, this is
quite a bit rougher up close.

631
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,714
Wow.

632
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:23,316
It almost has
a carved wood feel to it.

633
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,418
There's just too many
different elements going on.

634
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:26,585
Yeah.

635
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:30,122
This makes me sad.

636
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:31,757
I love that it has
that very clear,

637
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,992
easy-to-read emotion.

638
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:34,527
I do like
some of the paint work,

639
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:36,228
even though it's very simple.

640
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:37,430
Thank you.

641
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:41,934
His patch is a bit too big.

642
00:29:41,968 --> 00:29:44,437
It looks like it's patching
the whole side of his head.

643
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,505
I might want to see
the rest of it,

644
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,207
how this transitions.

645
00:29:48,241 --> 00:29:49,375
Oh, man.

646
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:52,578
I see Glenn pulling
the actual appliance.

647
00:29:52,612 --> 00:29:54,714
The appliance
is falling off my model's face.

648
00:29:54,748 --> 00:29:56,315
I'm probably going home
because of that,

649
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,717
and I'm crushed.

650
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:03,622
Tell us who made your favorite
quirky royal character

651
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:06,292
tonight on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

652
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:11,043
Ooh.

653
00:30:11,078 --> 00:30:12,211
Oh, man.

654
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,813
The appliance came loose.

655
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:14,914
This is terrible.

656
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,349
I don't want to go home
at this point.

657
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:18,251
I'm frustrated
because I really wanted to shine

658
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:19,719
for the first
individual challenge.

659
00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:21,153
These edges are ripped out.

660
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:22,922
We have several blowouts.

661
00:30:24,658 --> 00:30:27,760
This gives bee-stung lips
a whole new definition.

662
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:30,563
It destroys any of the beauty
that was intentional.

663
00:30:30,597 --> 00:30:32,498
I think if I had this
in one of my films,

664
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:34,834
I would want the eyes
more readable.

665
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:36,669
Thank you.

666
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:37,670
Nice.

667
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:38,838
I really like this one.

668
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,641
That profile,
between the hair and the piece,

669
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:42,975
is gorgeous.

670
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,444
Thank you.

671
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,013
This is really interesting.

672
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,481
She was really smart.

673
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,284
She left it way down here,
so it wouldn't affect his mouth.

674
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:54,186
- Yeah, it was very clean.
- Yeah.

675
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:56,289
This is some rough stuff, boy.

676
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:59,492
And I don't understand what
the story could possibly be.

677
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:05,798
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

678
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,933
so let's find out
what they thought.

679
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,935
Kelly...

680
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,604
Ben...

681
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,339
Regina...

682
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,041
Rob...

683
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,776
Logan...

684
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,511
Stephanie...

685
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,479
Adam...

686
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,581
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

687
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:24,817
and can head back
to the makeup room.

688
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:31,257
All right, that means
the rest of you

689
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:33,459
were the best
and the worst this week,

690
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:35,394
and the judges would like
to speak with each of you

691
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:36,796
to learn more about your work.

692
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,531
Darla, please step up.

693
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,040
Tell us about your character

694
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,309
and how you used the card
to drive your design.

695
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,111
So I had the jack of hearts.

696
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:55,848
My character is the royal
advisor to the king of hearts,

697
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:58,217
but he's secretly in love
with the queen,

698
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,319
and so he's jealous of the king.

699
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:03,389
I think it's brilliant.

700
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,623
Very stunning.

701
00:32:04,658 --> 00:32:07,426
And I particularly love
the application technique.

702
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:10,596
I can't look at it and go,
"Here's exactly how you did it."

703
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,332
That thrills me to no end.

704
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:17,269
The subtlety of the paint work
around the edge of the heart,

705
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:20,573
that's very sophisticated
modeling technique.

706
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,041
I love this.

707
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,109
Thank you.

708
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:24,744
Really nice job
framing the face

709
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:26,912
and the decision
to sculpt the hair.

710
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,082
It's a really nice
interpretation of your vision.

711
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:31,650
Thank you so much.

712
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,486
Darla, please step back.

713
00:32:37,657 --> 00:32:38,657
Thank you.

714
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:40,126
Jamie, you're next.

715
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:47,633
Can you please tell us
what card you have?

716
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,201
The history
of the king of spades

717
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:51,404
plays off of David and Goliath.

718
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:53,806
But instead of playing,
like, the tall, proud man

719
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,107
that David is,

720
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:58,277
I decided to make a very
proud person but very small.

721
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,845
He's a little bit
of a dandy, then.

722
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,180
Yes.

723
00:33:01,214 --> 00:33:04,717
I'm not sure that
that was such a good choice.

724
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,552
The kings
are supposed to be regal.

725
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:08,621
The sculpting on it
is very, very rough,

726
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:11,590
and you could have put
more texture into the face.

727
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,926
There's some good shapes
happening,

728
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,095
but it's
all about the execution,

729
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,930
and the sculpted hair

730
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:20,032
feels more like the top
of a Klingon's head.

731
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:23,335
It has that shape
versus styled hair.

732
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,771
The paint job is very drab.

733
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:28,474
You've got to be able to deliver
that killer paint job,

734
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:31,076
and that didn't happen.

735
00:33:31,111 --> 00:33:32,978
Jamie, if you'd please
step back.

736
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:40,719
All right, let's talk to Emily.

737
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:46,091
So tell us about your character

738
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,060
and how the card inspired this.

739
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:49,662
She is the queen of hearts.

740
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,864
Immediately I thought
of human heart,

741
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:55,668
so I wanted to incorporate
the hearts into her collar

742
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,670
and play with the shapes.

743
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:01,440
Everything about this
is so beautiful.

744
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:03,509
From the head shape to profile,

745
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:05,578
it's a beautiful,
beautiful design.

746
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:06,645
Thank you.

747
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,214
When I did <i>Alice In Wonderland,</i>

748
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:12,384
we would have gobbled that idea
up about being real hearts,

749
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:13,686
and they would be beating.

750
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,954
I think you did a good job.

751
00:34:14,988 --> 00:34:16,088
Thank you.

752
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,456
There's one thing about this

753
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:18,924
that, honestly, I hate,

754
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:21,260
and that is
how much better you are

755
00:34:21,294 --> 00:34:23,462
than I was when I was your age.

756
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,031
It's really hard
not to love it.

757
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:27,666
Thank you.

758
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:30,436
Emily, you can step back.

759
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,904
Thanks, Megan.

760
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:35,241
Nice job, lady.

761
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,242
- Thanks.
- Nice.

762
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:37,877
Anthony, please come forward.

763
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:47,553
Hey, Anthony.
Tell us about your character.

764
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:50,022
The king of hearts
was once this great ruler,

765
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,491
and the spades attacked
and killed his queen,

766
00:34:52,526 --> 00:34:54,159
which caused him
to have a broken heart.

767
00:34:54,194 --> 00:34:57,296
Honestly, I feel like
there's a few problems here.

768
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:01,333
I think that the paint work
feels muddled,

769
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:03,435
like a combination
of many thoughts

770
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,939
that didn't coagulate
into one single form.

771
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:10,809
The hair is an absolute mess.

772
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,411
And I'm using a nice word.

773
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:13,412
No.

774
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:14,847
In close-up, it's so horrible,

775
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:17,116
it's not even
a good clown makeup.

776
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:20,819
Anthony, you can step down.

777
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,121
Thank you.

778
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,795
Daniel, if you'd please
step up.

779
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:37,269
Please tell us the concept
behind your makeup.

780
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,038
I got the queen of diamonds,

781
00:35:39,072 --> 00:35:43,108
and she's hunting for diamonds
in all the kingdoms.

782
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,978
This is conceptually
unintelligible to me.

783
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,915
If you weren't telling me,

784
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,352
I wouldn't have known
that's the queen of diamonds.

785
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:55,554
One of the huge mistakes
that you made

786
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:57,623
was trying to put
a three-dimensional diamond

787
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:58,724
on her mouth,

788
00:35:58,758 --> 00:36:00,759
because it looks like
she's deformed.

789
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:02,494
I feel like you went into it

790
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,063
with a little bit
of uncertainty,

791
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:07,800
and being whimsical is not being
afraid to go too far.

792
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:11,837
Daniel, you can step down.

793
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:13,305
Thank you.

794
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:18,077
Julian.

795
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:26,452
Julian, would you please
tell us about your character?

796
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,454
My card was the jack of clubs,

797
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:31,624
and he made a deal
with the king of the underworld,

798
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,560
so he helps with ferrying
the dead to the underworld.

799
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:39,398
This is a really interesting,
bizarre-looking makeup.

800
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:42,868
I like the way that you actually
did take the shape of the club,

801
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:46,805
but you have this great little
damaged section of his forehead.

802
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,340
And it's really out of the box.

803
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,375
I really like it.

804
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,609
Thank you.

805
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:52,277
It's not on the nose,
it's not literal,

806
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:53,412
and that's a good thing.

807
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:56,415
Yours is one of the only ones
that stood out.

808
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,951
You have shown
some serious skills

809
00:36:58,985 --> 00:37:01,687
in the sculpting, painting,
and applying of the makeup.

810
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,222
Thank you.

811
00:37:03,256 --> 00:37:04,657
Julian, please step back.

812
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:05,758
Thanks.

813
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:12,364
Thank you, guys.

814
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,732
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

815
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,801
while the judges deliberate.

816
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:21,206
All right, judges, let's start
with your favorites tonight.

817
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,474
How about Darla's work?

818
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:23,776
I love it.

819
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,711
She's the only one
that pulled off the pointy chin

820
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,146
and had it work visually.

821
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,881
Yeah, technically solid.

822
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:31,383
The overall graphic of it,
very solid.

823
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,152
I think
it was absolutely stunning,

824
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:36,088
and she put the rest
of the competitors on notice.

825
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:38,257
She is going to be
a force to be reckoned with.

826
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,325
All right, judges,
let's move on to Emily.

827
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,660
Just stunning.

828
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:44,296
The hearts with the arrows
and the whole schmegegge,

829
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,330
it was awesome.

830
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:47,900
She did heart face, heart hair,

831
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,902
hearts around her collar.

832
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,471
It would have seemed like
too much of a good thing,

833
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:55,441
but because they were nuanced,
they just echoed.

834
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:57,976
All right, judges,
let's move on to Julian.

835
00:37:58,011 --> 00:38:01,180
I do admire the subtleties
of the scarring,

836
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:02,815
and there was a certain flow
to it.

837
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:05,284
There's some beautiful
sculpting and painting on it.

838
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:08,454
It's just its own unique vision.

839
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:10,322
All right, judges,
let's move on

840
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:12,458
to the looks you like the least.

841
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,593
Let's talk about Jamie's work tonight.

842
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,296
It's a king's face
with a spade haircut.

843
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,764
That's not a very good idea.

844
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,666
She had the choice
not to use that head piece.

845
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,101
She could have put
real hair on it.

846
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,502
Which I think she should have.

847
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:26,271
There was too many pieces
that didn't fit together.

848
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,307
Let's move on to Anthony.

849
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:29,808
You can't overlook
the paint job.

850
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:32,244
I've seen more kingly bowls
of spaghetti,

851
00:38:32,278 --> 00:38:33,378
to be honest with you.

852
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:35,981
Simple illustration-style
makeup,

853
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:37,516
it's the hardest thing to do,

854
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,718
because it's just
a couple colors and some lines,

855
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:41,186
and they have to be perfect.

856
00:38:41,221 --> 00:38:44,890
Visually, it read more
like a hybrid tribal mask

857
00:38:44,924 --> 00:38:47,626
than it did a playing card.

858
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,962
Okay, let's move on to Daniel.

859
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:51,730
He was so lost.

860
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:55,400
That was so shoddily sculpted,
applied, and painted.

861
00:38:55,435 --> 00:38:57,069
At the core of it,
the problem is,

862
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:59,471
the concept for the makeup
is nonexistent.

863
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,440
Why didn't he at least
do some sort of

864
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:02,941
cool, monstery-looking queen...

865
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:04,209
Precisely.

866
00:39:04,244 --> 00:39:06,145
...with, like, diamonds
protruding out of her skin

867
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,412
and give it the Tim Burton look?

868
00:39:07,447 --> 00:39:09,314
At least it would have been
something creative.

869
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,617
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

870
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:12,651
- We have.
- Yes.

871
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:14,419
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

872
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:26,231
So, Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

873
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:29,735
Darla, your jack
had a powerful presence,

874
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,303
and you really impressed us

875
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:33,372
both with
your beautiful application

876
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:35,240
and your technical prowess.

877
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:38,811
Emily, your queen was replete
with graceful forms

878
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,212
and great colors,

879
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:41,513
and it all came together

880
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:44,750
into a beautifully unified
finished product.

881
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:47,119
Julian, the sculpture
of your face

882
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:49,288
showed some strong
technical talent,

883
00:39:49,322 --> 00:39:51,523
and the uniqueness
of your character

884
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,058
stood out among the crowd.

885
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:55,661
And, Laura,
I've got to congratulate you

886
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:58,997
since all three top looks
came from your team.

887
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:01,867
It's all them.

888
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:03,168
All them.

889
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:05,137
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

890
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:06,171
Tonight's winner is...

891
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,201
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

892
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:15,469
Tonight's winner is...

893
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:22,309
Emily.

894
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:23,310
Wow.

895
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:27,581
Oh, my God.

896
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,049
It's weird.

897
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:32,786
You gave us such a thoughtful
and artistic makeup tonight.

898
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,154
We just cannot wait to see

899
00:40:34,188 --> 00:40:35,989
what you put in front of us
next week.

900
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:37,557
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

901
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:38,592
I am thrilled.

902
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,427
I win
the first individual challenge,

903
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:41,495
which is so nice.

904
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:43,029
I'm just so happy with it.

905
00:40:43,064 --> 00:40:44,564
I'm glad the judges
liked it too.

906
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,832
All right, Emily.

907
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:47,868
You, Darla, and Julian

908
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:50,537
can all head back to the makeup
room with the coaches.

909
00:40:57,812 --> 00:40:59,946
All right, guys,
that means the rest of you

910
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:01,548
are on the bottom this week,

911
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:03,984
and one of you
will be going home.

912
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:05,152
Please step forward.

913
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:12,926
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

914
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,962
Jamie, you had
some good ideas this week,

915
00:41:15,997 --> 00:41:18,064
but you were let down
by poor execution

916
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,900
in your sculpture and painting.

917
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:23,803
Anthony, though your makeup
did portray some emotion,

918
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:25,038
at the end of the day,

919
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:27,174
we couldn't really tell
what we were looking at.

920
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:30,477
And, Daniel, though
your character did appear royal,

921
00:41:30,511 --> 00:41:32,279
there were some fundamental
flaws with your makeup

922
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:33,747
on a conceptual level

923
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:35,949
that left it incoherent.

924
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:38,285
All right, Glenn,
who is going home tonight?

925
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,253
The person going home
tonight is...

926
00:41:45,826 --> 00:41:48,728
Daniel.

927
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:51,131
Your character suffered
from many technical flaws,

928
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:53,500
and ultimately
it felt uninspired.

929
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:54,634
I agree.

930
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:56,336
Daniel, I am so sorry.

931
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,872
That means
you have been eliminated.

932
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:02,075
Jamie and Anthony,
you're both safe this week.

933
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:03,843
You can head back
to the makeup room.

934
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,553
Don't give up.

935
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:16,556
I mean, you made it this far
because you have talent.

936
00:42:16,591 --> 00:42:18,992
Learn and give this
another try.

937
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:19,993
Thank you.

938
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,294
I will.

939
00:42:21,329 --> 00:42:23,396
Daniel, it's been great
having you here with us,

940
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:25,365
but if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

941
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:26,600
and pack up your kit.

942
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:27,667
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

943
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:29,035
Take care.

944
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,003
I've been doing makeup
for about, like, eight months,

945
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:35,716
so the next step for me
is learning more and getting better.

946
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:36,833
Oh, no.

947
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:40,762
- Daniel?
- Yes.

948
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:45,077
Having Anthony as
my coach and teacher

949
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:47,069
inspired me to learn a lot.

950
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,733
My experience at <i>Face Off</i>
was incredible.

951
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:53,630
I think ***
you can do whatever you want.

952
00:42:54,312 --> 00:42:56,222
Just try hard and you can get it.
