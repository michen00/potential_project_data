1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,157
You were incredibly successful.

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:04,560
One of the prettiest paint jobs
I've seen on the show.

3
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:07,362
You've created these dimensions.
It's very smart.

4
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:08,864
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:10,399
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

6
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:13,902
Logan's beautiful body paint
carried him to victory,

7
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:16,505
and Rob became Team Rayce's
third straight artist

8
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,173
to be sent home.

9
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:23,545
Now nine artists remain,

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,014
and tonight they will tackle
a terrifying challenge

11
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,482
for a movie legend,

12
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:28,617
Clive Barker.

13
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:30,152
Hello,<i> Face Off</i> contestants.

14
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:32,387
Oh, shit.

15
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:33,555
My mold's cracked.

16
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,257
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

17
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,425
How did this happen?

18
00:00:36,459 --> 00:00:40,095
My face is a frickin' disaster.

19
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:41,964
I do not know
what I'm looking at.

20
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,499
In the end, only
one will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,068
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

22
00:00:46,102 --> 00:00:48,870
to one of their 85
international locations,

23
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:51,840
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:53,909
and $100,000.

25
00:00:55,578 --> 00:00:57,446
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

26
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:32,910
Sync and corrections by n17t01

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,521
- Congrats on that win.
- Thanks.

28
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:41,256
I got to celebrate
for about five minutes,

29
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,058
until I found out
Rob was going home.

30
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:46,194
Adam and I are the only ones
left on Team Rayce,

31
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,463
so it's time for other teams
to start losing people.

32
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:49,531
All right.

33
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:51,066
I hope I can keep bringing it,

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,901
but it's gonna be tough.

35
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:01,176
Whiskey A Go Go.

36
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,277
That's cool.

37
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,478
This place is legendary.

38
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,579
All right.

39
00:02:04,614 --> 00:02:05,947
So I'm pretty excited for this.

40
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:10,752
_

41
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:12,254
Hey, guys.

42
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:16,157
Welcome to the most legendary
music venue on the Sunset Strip,

43
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,594
the world-famous Whisky A Go Go.

44
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:24,065
Since 1964, this stage has
featured incredible performances

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,301
from iconic bands
like The Doors,

46
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:28,904
Led Zeppelin, The Ramones,
and The Sex Pistols.

47
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:29,938
Wow.

48
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:31,206
Are you guys ready to rock?

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,540
Yes!

50
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:34,943
Good, because this week's
Spotlight Challenge

51
00:02:34,977 --> 00:02:39,481
is inspired by a true master
of the macabre.

52
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:42,183
He has spawned some of the most
terrifying characters

53
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:43,685
in the history of horror films,

54
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,423
including Candyman
and<i> Hellraiser's</i> Pinhead.

55
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:49,925
Clive Barker.

56
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:50,992
Wow.

57
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:58,133
Not only am I
a huge horror fan.

58
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,969
I am a massive<i> Hellraiser</i> fan.

59
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:02,504
So I'm pumped.

60
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:03,772
So in the 1980s,

61
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:06,775
Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees
and Michael Myers

62
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:09,277
terrified audiences
as silent killers

63
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:10,979
hell-bent on destruction.

64
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:14,716
However, in Clive's
now-classic film<i> Hellraiser,</i>

65
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,519
he essentially redefined
the cinematic villain

66
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:20,655
by making Pinhead
intelligent, eloquent,

67
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,124
and, best of all, stylish.

68
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,195
Perhaps it's best if you hear it
from Clive himself.

69
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:31,433
Hello,<i> Face Off</i> contestants.

70
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:32,767
I'm Clive Barker,

71
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:35,070
and I'm very excited
about this challenge.

72
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:37,739
When I was making demons
for a new age,

73
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:39,441
it was the punk clubs I went to

74
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:41,676
where I looked
for fresh inspiration,

75
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,211
fresh blood if you will.

76
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:45,246
I would love to see you
create something new.

77
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:47,215
go to the very cutting edge
of current fashion,

78
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:51,586
and marry that with images that
are startling and terrifying.

79
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,488
Have fun.

80
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,423
So for this week's challenge,

81
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,926
like Clive,
you'll find your inspiration

82
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,396
from today's
futuristic fashions.

83
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:09,704
Oh, this is so cool.

84
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,115
Your Spotlight Challenge
is to choose

85
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,151
one of these stunning
avant-garde outfits

86
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:25,787
and use it as an inspiration
for your very own

87
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:30,125
stylish and intelligent
horror villain.

88
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,260
Your villains will be wearing
these outfits

89
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,561
on the reveal stage.

90
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,163
And by choosing the outfit,

91
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:39,434
you're also choosing your model
for this week's challenge.

92
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:42,003
Jamie, you're up first.

93
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:43,605
Megan.

94
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,006
Matt.

95
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,875
Sarah.

96
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,510
Elena.

97
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,011
Alex.

98
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:51,613
Naele.

99
00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:53,281
Augustine.

100
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:54,783
Kerstin.

101
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:56,184
Come on, Kodi.

102
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:02,357
All right, guys,
in true muse fashion,

103
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:05,226
your models will stay with you
while you work on your designs.

104
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,227
Good luck.

105
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,529
Bye.

106
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:12,600
Turn around.

107
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,302
I'm looking at Kodi's outfit,

108
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,738
and I find a shape
that is just different,

109
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:18,239
and I want to run with it.

110
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,542
So my concept is a fallen angel

111
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,745
who is cursed with a cage
around his head.

112
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:25,647
So your head will be,
like, right there,

113
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:28,216
and this is gonna go over it.

114
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,284
It's almost spider-like.

115
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:30,485
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

116
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,587
So I was thinking
we can go black widow-ish.

117
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,588
Yeah.

118
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,889
My concept is a female

119
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:37,592
who has been scorned by men,

120
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:39,894
so she attracts them
through her beauty

121
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,062
and then kills them.

122
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:42,564
I'm so excited.

123
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:46,734
Such a weird combination,

124
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:50,371
old relic necklace
and the futuristic jacket.

125
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,841
This character
needs to be intelligent,

126
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,909
but also scary and creepy.

127
00:05:54,944 --> 00:05:56,411
So my concept is a demon

128
00:05:56,445 --> 00:05:58,813
that goes after people
that wear this amulet

129
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:00,048
and kills them.

130
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:02,150
His whole head
is one giant mouth

131
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,918
with finger-like appendages

132
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:06,020
that rip the souls
out of its victims.

133
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,612
_

134
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:09,214
_

135
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,625
Yeah.

136
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,127
Look at me.

137
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,428
Ooh, that's cool.

138
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,230
My character is very vain,

139
00:06:15,264 --> 00:06:18,199
very obsessed
with plastic surgery.

140
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:20,502
Then she starts going
under her own knife.

141
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:22,403
I also want to give her a mask.

142
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:25,340
So she appears to be
super sleek and stylish,

143
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:27,075
then she takes off the mask

144
00:06:27,109 --> 00:06:30,545
to reveal the ultra,
ultra nastiness.

145
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:33,381
With how fierce you are, girl,
it's gonna be so rad.

146
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,683
All right, thanks a lot.

147
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,318
- I'll see you soon.
- Yep.

148
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:45,760
We get to the lab.

149
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:47,195
We have 5 1/2 hours today.

150
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,631
And I really want
to sculpt to finish the face

151
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,133
and block out that extreme cowl,

152
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:53,801
because if it doesn't
look good in clay,

153
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,670
I want to have enough time
to scrap it

154
00:06:55,704 --> 00:06:57,805
and create something else.

155
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,241
Clive Barker said, "We want
to see something different."

156
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,577
So I'm gonna try
something different.

157
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:06,614
- Ooh, hey.
- Hello, guys.

158
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:08,616
That's a cool costume.

159
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:11,653
Right now I don't have
a solid concept.

160
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,621
I'm feeling like
there's not a whole lot

161
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:16,024
that I can do with this
without going too obvious.

162
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,625
So I'm getting
a little frustrated.

163
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,793
So that's what I'm stuck with.

164
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:20,128
No, it's not "stuck with."

165
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:23,298
You've been given an opportunity
to expand on it.

166
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:26,067
Stephanie is having some
serious conceptual problems,

167
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:28,436
and I implore her
just to take some time

168
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,838
and think about it
before starting to sculpt.

169
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:34,042
I kind of want to just start
throwing clay down and playing.

170
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,417
I think this
is a cool challenge,

171
00:07:42,451 --> 00:07:44,385
to kind of create things
that are just bizarre.

172
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,554
Mine has this big silver tutu,

173
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,824
so I come up
with this metal-like surface

174
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,627
that is encapsulating
the back of her head,

175
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:56,097
which is gonna be
this leather-bound skull cap.

176
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:57,599
And I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

177
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:04,072
I think I've landed
on a theme of poisons.

178
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:06,207
My character's going to be
a snake charmer

179
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,942
who has turned killer

180
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:11,112
and has developed
an immunity to venom.

181
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:14,582
He's going to look sickly
and anemic and have boils.

182
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:17,051
And to suggest his intelligence,

183
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,053
I've actually come up
with this grid-like pattern

184
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:20,455
down both sides of the arms.

185
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:21,723
It's a means of cataloging

186
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,925
all the different poisons
that he creates.

187
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,995
The one thing I'd suggest
is making bigger grids...

188
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,996
Yeah.

189
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,097
Just so from afar it doesn't

190
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:30,632
read like a busy
mess kind of a thing.

191
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,633
Does that make sense?

192
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,067
Yeah, good point.

193
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,141
I picked the costume
that screams "post-apocalyptic."

194
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:42,543
And I'm doing a demon character.

195
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:45,780
But I want to make sure visually
he looks completely different

196
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:49,784
than what you would
necessarily expect of a demon.

197
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:56,057
Hi, everybody.

198
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:57,725
- Hey.
- Hi.

199
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,494
So it looks very interesting.

200
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,829
She's pretty much
a South American goddess

201
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:02,964
that was resurrected,

202
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:05,967
and she kills people
by turning them to gold.

203
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,435
Are you meaning this as a hat?

204
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:10,305
Some kind of headdress,
but it's also a part of her.

205
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,707
I would blend this off
onto her nose,

206
00:09:12,741 --> 00:09:14,876
and then it actually
becomes her.

207
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,010
Okay.

208
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,378
She comes out kind of seeming

209
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:18,846
all nice and pretty
and beautiful...

210
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:19,981
Right.

211
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,783
Then reveal this
nasty, nasty mouth.

212
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,351
You could even
put a little blood there

213
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:24,352
and shoot a little water,

214
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:25,987
and it'll just kind of drip.

215
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:29,624
Then it really looks horror
when that piece comes off.

216
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:31,793
What are you pounding on?

217
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,294
- A cowl.
- A cowl.

218
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:35,496
I've been battling
the concept all day.

219
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:36,931
Let's see what
you're doing there.

220
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:38,499
Right now you've got
a head piece

221
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,301
with nothing going on here.

222
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:42,203
An interesting
thing to do would be

223
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:44,706
put little hooks
on the ends of these things

224
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,940
so it looks like it's hooked

225
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:47,542
into her skin
all the way around.

226
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:48,543
Yeah, that's an idea.

227
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:49,577
- Go for it.
- Ehh...

228
00:09:49,611 --> 00:09:50,745
Go for it, you know.

229
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,380
Listen.

230
00:09:52,414 --> 00:09:54,082
You're on the way;
you're on the way.

231
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:57,285
The idea is, put one big hole
in the back of his head.

232
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,120
It's almost like
he has these appendages

233
00:09:59,154 --> 00:10:01,022
that sucks the souls
through this hole.

234
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:02,123
Mm-hmm.

235
00:10:02,157 --> 00:10:03,524
I think
you need to think somewhere

236
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,393
of having something into it

237
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:07,862
that is either pulling skin

238
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:12,500
or something that is going
to read as horror.

239
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:13,501
Mm-hmm.

240
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:14,535
Thanks, everybody.

241
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,570
- See ya.
- Thank you.

242
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:17,305
Bye, thank you.

243
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,710
I'm really embarrassed
that Mr. Westmore came through

244
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:24,612
and I didn't have anything
to show him.

245
00:10:24,613 --> 00:10:27,282
_

246
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,849
_

247
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,986
_

248
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:34,589
It's frustrating because I feel
like this should be my element.

249
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,723
I'm a haunter.

250
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,625
I do scary all the time.

251
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:39,160
This shouldn't be that hard.

252
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,430
I can't not make anything.

253
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:46,033
I can't say, "Oh, give me
another day to think about it."

254
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:47,235
Stupid.

255
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,936
And at this point
in the competition,

256
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,539
if you don't make something
really cool,

257
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,307
you could be going home.

258
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,550
So, it's day one
of our Clive Barker challenge,

259
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:05,252
and I'm having trouble,
like, nailing down

260
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:06,554
a solid concept.

261
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:08,823
And I'm just super frustrated.

262
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,625
What parts of that do you like?

263
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,893
I'm definitely
worried about Stephanie.

264
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:14,695
She's such a good
concept person,

265
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,932
and for her to struggle,
it just breaks my heart.

266
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:20,167
I decide to just
keep concepting

267
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,369
for the rest of day one.

268
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:22,436
No more sculpting.

269
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:24,438
I have 9 1/2 hours tomorrow.

270
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:26,407
And hopefully I'll get it done.

271
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:32,313
Do something like this,

272
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:33,848
not just-- boom-- into it.

273
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:36,050
It's just that subtle
change of form.

274
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:38,252
Jamie is having some
trouble refining the face,

275
00:11:38,286 --> 00:11:41,355
so I keep pointing out
some things just to clean up.

276
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,226
Maybe you want to
get a little bit more.

277
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,427
Oh, yeah, down--

278
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:47,595
- In here.
- Uh-huh.

279
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:49,497
And we talk about incorporating

280
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:51,098
elements of the spider

281
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:54,435
to be a little bit more
into the Clive Barker universe.

282
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:55,436
We'll see.

283
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:01,876
Just keep refining;
get all the details.

284
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,144
- I got to get going.
- Okay.

285
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:04,645
And have fun, most importantly.

286
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,646
Okay.

287
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,881
I'm leaving.

288
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:08,315
It's time for the coaches
to leave,

289
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,617
and I'm pretty confident

290
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:12,420
with what both Adam and Logan
have done today.

291
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:13,888
But at the same time,

292
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:16,557
I only have two artists
left on my team,

293
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:19,460
so I'm really not feeling
relaxed in this stage.

294
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:20,728
Just win, okay?

295
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:22,263
- Yeah, Yeah.
- Just win.

296
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:24,198
Have fun.

297
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:25,599
How you feeling about it?

298
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:26,634
Pretty good.

299
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:28,169
Struggling a little bit.

300
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:30,104
Think I'm headed
in the right direction, though.

301
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:32,039
I decide to follow
Mr. Westmore's advice

302
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:35,776
and work on making the face
look a little less human--

303
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:37,111
a lot less human.

304
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:40,548
Have to do a lot more
detail sculpting,

305
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:42,650
but I feel really good
about this concept,

306
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:44,485
and I think I have
a good chance.

307
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,153
I'd really like
to win this one.

308
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,655
Yeah, same.

309
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:49,557
30 minutes, everybody.

310
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:58,999
That's time, everybody.

311
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:14,381
It's day two, and I'm feeling
a little better than day one.

312
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,750
I know what I'm gonna do now.

313
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:17,518
Basically it's gonna be
gross skin,

314
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:19,887
like, peeling up
and being, like, hooked forward.

315
00:13:19,921 --> 00:13:20,888
Ooh, okay.

316
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,189
My concept for this character

317
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:23,524
is some sort of seer,

318
00:13:23,558 --> 00:13:25,626
and then the way she kills
is that she tells people

319
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,228
their futures
and how they're gonna die,

320
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:28,562
and if they try to avoid it,

321
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,364
then she ends up
killing them herself.

322
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:31,532
The only advice I'd give

323
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:33,601
is to try to keep her
somewhat beautiful.

324
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:34,802
Pretty, yeah.

325
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:36,637
I have to have something
sculpted, molded,

326
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,573
and ready for foam today.

327
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,743
So I decide to just go
with a cowl

328
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:44,945
that's manageable for me
in one day.

329
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,118
Today I've got a lot to do.

330
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:52,620
I have to get the face done.

331
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,188
I also have to get
these arm pieces done.

332
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:55,422
These are gonna be, like,

333
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:56,924
the different poisons
that he injects...

334
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,025
Mm-hmm.

335
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,193
And the different things
it causes?

336
00:13:59,227 --> 00:14:00,194
Yeah.

337
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,163
I'm sculpting with monster clay,

338
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:03,430
which is a wax-based clay,

339
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:05,533
and it's great for fine detail.

340
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,035
You can melt it
with a heat gun or torch,

341
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,704
and you can get certain effects
that I think will really help

342
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:13,374
with the character design
that I've come up with.

343
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:15,009
I like what you're doing here.

344
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:19,380
I think it's cool.

345
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:20,948
I'd start working
on the face, you know?

346
00:14:20,982 --> 00:14:23,350
Well, I was gonna mold this
and then go work on the face.

347
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:24,919
So I've got my cowl sculpted.

348
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:27,655
Now I need to get it molded
as soon as possible,

349
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:31,025
because I still need
to make a face piece.

350
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:33,327
The overall design for
Ben's cowl is really awesome.

351
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:35,796
Hopefully the face
looks equally cool.

352
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,501
No, the string
isn't long enough.

353
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:43,871
For the cowl,
I want to fabricate a cage

354
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,140
that interlocks with the face.

355
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,475
And I'm really inspired
by string art.

356
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,910
One thing that
was really important

357
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,312
is, like, make sure
it's something

358
00:14:51,346 --> 00:14:52,646
that Clive hasn't seen before.

359
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:54,114
- Yeah.
- So, I just--

360
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,783
I haven't seen
anything like this before.

361
00:14:55,817 --> 00:15:00,321
It's going to have a wonderful
profile and silhouette.

362
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,326
Sweet.

363
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,460
I finish my cowl,

364
00:15:06,494 --> 00:15:08,062
and I'm actually
really pleased with it.

365
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:11,165
Now I have to get it molded
and out the door.

366
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,033
So it's really important
that I take my time,

367
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,568
because it's gonna be
a two-part mold,

368
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:17,371
and if one half
is slightly overlapping,

369
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,839
it'll lock my mold.

370
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:26,881
It doesn't look like this
is all stretched skin.

371
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:28,148
Mm-hmm.

372
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,885
Darla is still kind of
struggling with her cowl.

373
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,287
She's sculpting
the stretched skin idea,

374
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,688
but, for whatever reason,

375
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,557
it doesn't seem
to be translating.

376
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:39,760
So I just grab a head
and I start sculpting on it

377
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:41,829
to show her how
to sculpt wrinkles.

378
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,797
These wrinkles,
they go all the way.

379
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:49,270
Yeah.

380
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:50,271
We're leaving.

381
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:52,072
All righty.

382
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:53,874
Cool, good luck.

383
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:54,942
- Awesome.
- Okay?

384
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,010
Sweet, thank you.

385
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:57,544
Leaving day two,
I think everybody

386
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,446
seems to be in a good place,

387
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:01,582
but I'm still worried
about Jamie.

388
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,317
Her face has to look beautiful

389
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:05,352
in order for this character
to work,

390
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,354
and right now she still has
a long way to go on it.

391
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:08,656
- Bye, guys.
- Keep kicking ass.

392
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,424
Good luck.

393
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,539
I get my cowl molded,
and I start to open it.

394
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,707
Oh, shit.

395
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:29,677
I notice that my mold's cracked.

396
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,779
And I'm like, shit.

397
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:33,781
I'm trying not to freak out.

398
00:16:36,084 --> 00:16:37,584
I'm looking at the crack
in the mold,

399
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:38,986
and it's a pretty big crack.

400
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,821
I mean, I've seen
some big cracks.

401
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,389
This is the biggest crack
I've seen.

402
00:16:45,026 --> 00:16:46,293
This is my only piece,

403
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,362
and if I mess this up,

404
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:51,165
I'm gonna go out on stage
with nothing.

405
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,766
So this needs to get fixed.

406
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,401
Mold cracked in half.

407
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,603
It's day two
of our horror villain challenge,

408
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:06,305
and my mold's cracked.

409
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,340
I'm freaking out
because it's just all I got.

410
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:09,441
This is my only piece.

411
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:11,510
You got to be fucking
kidding me.

412
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:15,013
I grab a plumber's epoxy
and use it to seal the crack.

413
00:17:15,048 --> 00:17:16,248
I got it fixed, but I'm worried

414
00:17:16,282 --> 00:17:17,683
I'm gonna have
a lot of patchwork

415
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:18,717
on application day.

416
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,124
Man, you need to start molding.

417
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:26,258
I know.

418
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,993
Last time I was
in an individual challenge,

419
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:30,529
I sacrificed sculpting detail

420
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,264
in order to get
the molds done on time.

421
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:33,932
It was a really bad idea.

422
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,334
I don't want to do that again.

423
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,269
So I don't see how
you're not freaking out.

424
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:39,104
What's the worst
that could happen?

425
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,772
You're not gonna get
your cowl out.

426
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:43,575
Ben's looking over at me
and thinks that I'm crazy,

427
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,544
but I'd rather risk it.

428
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:48,380
I just want to make sure
I put out something good.

429
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:54,686
So now it's time to work on my
futuristic surgical fetish mask.

430
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:57,623
It needs to be smooth,
sleek, and sharp

431
00:17:57,657 --> 00:18:00,025
to reveal the nastiness
underneath.

432
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,427
The mask is gonna work
with my wardrobe

433
00:18:02,462 --> 00:18:05,564
to add that Clive Barker element
to my character.

434
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:08,700
Looking pretty freaking cool
right now.

435
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,673
That's time, everybody.

436
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:15,974
I'm feeling okay.

437
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,844
I've got a general idea
of what the character is

438
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,179
and what it's going
to look like.

439
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,581
I just have to attack it
for application day.

440
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:30,656
- Nice shirt.
- You too.

441
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,890
It's application day.

442
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,292
We have four hours in the lab,

443
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:35,894
one hour for Last Looks.

444
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:38,363
Oh, my God.

445
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:41,200
My face is a frickin' disaster.

446
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:43,035
How did this happen?

447
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:44,937
I don't know, just could be
one of those things.

448
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,306
It has the worst
second skinning

449
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,208
I have ever encountered.

450
00:18:49,242 --> 00:18:50,242
So you can...

451
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,310
Oh, my God,
that's so--

452
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:52,444
...work it in.

453
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:53,745
Kelly's face is mutilated.

454
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,781
but to be honest,
I think it could help it.

455
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:57,883
with the type of character
she's doing,

456
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,451
That could be a happy accident,

457
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:02,187
because if someone's
continuously cutting themselves,

458
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:05,023
it wouldn't be
in such perfect symmetry.

459
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:07,793
It would be a little bit more
sporadic and spontaneous.

460
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,161
But, you know...

461
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:10,996
It's okay; it's okay.
I can work with it.

462
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,397
- She's mutilated.
- Yeah, she's mutilated.

463
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:13,865
Got some of those cuts,
work it, part of your story.

464
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,200
It might make it
more in the horror realm

465
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,368
than the alien realm.

466
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:17,803
Yeah.

467
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:25,844
'Sup?

468
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:27,079
- How you doing?
- Hey.

469
00:19:27,113 --> 00:19:29,314
So you have, like,
the back of your head too.

470
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:30,582
Oh, it looks
like a spider body.

471
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:31,883
Yep.

472
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:34,953
These are all test samples of
poisons on your arm.

473
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:36,388
Ohh.

474
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:37,789
Today I'm starting
with the arms.

475
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:39,691
I know that I have to be
very delicate,

476
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:42,561
otherwise I'm gonna be
tearing my prosthetics apart.

477
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:43,996
Rotate in just a little bit.

478
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,030
Thank you.

479
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,331
So one arm at a time,

480
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,933
I lay it down very carefully.

481
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,034
They're fragile,

482
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,269
especially where
the joint bends,

483
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,704
so don't do any
excessive movements.

484
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:55,007
I just hope they're able
to hold up

485
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,708
between now
and the reveal stage.

486
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,617
I'm cooling down the black mesh

487
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:09,021
into the eye area
of the face prosthetic.

488
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,790
Hopefully it will block out
my model's eyes completely

489
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:14,359
and he'll still be able
to see through it perfectly.

490
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:15,948
_

491
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:16,503
_

492
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:17,903
_

493
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,632
_

494
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:20,661
_

495
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:21,598
_

496
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,569
_

497
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:26,638
It came out pretty good.

498
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:28,073
I am super relieved,

499
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,876
because the crack I was
trying to fix on the cowl mold

500
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,045
didn't even show up
in the piece.

501
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,780
So, as far as these eyes,

502
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:36,481
push them out
and then cut them?

503
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:37,949
This is what I'd do.

504
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:39,618
Right now we're
just making sure

505
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,053
the eye slits are big enough.

506
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,588
I'll come in, and then
I'll kind of ride the line.

507
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:45,290
See what I'm doing there?

508
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:46,458
Yeah.

509
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,563
Come under your nose.

510
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:52,864
I'm bouncing back and forth

511
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:54,833
between sponging, airbrushing,

512
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:58,804
and flicking just to break up
all of the solid colors.

513
00:20:58,838 --> 00:21:00,372
All right,
tilt your head up for me.

514
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:04,009
I'm having to spend
a little more time

515
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,345
on the area where the cowl
comes over the eye,

516
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:08,213
because certain parts
are lifting

517
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,015
and I have to glue it
back down.

518
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,350
Stupid things.

519
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:12,684
It's looking a little rough,

520
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:16,054
but I can't let myself
get frustrated.

521
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,360
Are you gonna paint
this whole thing black?

522
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:24,162
Well, I was thinking of doing,
like, black under there

523
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:25,931
and then a lighter tone
on the top.

524
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,532
The paint scheme
I'm gonna go with is,

525
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:29,601
dark colors come in
across the cowl piece

526
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:30,936
all the way to the front
of the face

527
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,437
and keep the front very light,

528
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:33,605
because I don't want
to take away

529
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,273
from the skin color aspect
of it.

530
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:37,576
And then here on the face,
this his gonna be fun.

531
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,644
I'm a little worried
about her pieces

532
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,880
looking like
realistic skin texture,

533
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:43,482
but hopefully
she can pull it off.

534
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:44,883
Keep it scary but pretty.

535
00:21:44,917 --> 00:21:46,118
Yeah, I like that.

536
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:50,655
Oh, gosh.

537
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,357
I'm fumbling
with the webbing part

538
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:55,127
of my cage
that's on top of the cowl.

539
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:58,797
And the left side
starts falling.

540
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:00,832
So now the string
is falling off,

541
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:03,034
and it looks disastrous.

542
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:05,303
I'm going home for this,
I'm telling you.

543
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:07,806
This is atrocious.

544
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,907
I look at the clock.

545
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:11,376
I do not have time
to fumble with this.

546
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:14,913
So I scrap it, and I decide
to throw feathers into it

547
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,014
and just leave it.

548
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:18,850
And I'll work
with the feathers later.

549
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:19,985
Ten minutes.

550
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:27,192
We're running out of time,

551
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:28,927
and I'm so far behind on paint,

552
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,328
I'm worried
that I won't be able

553
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:32,597
to actually complete
the full beauty makeup.

554
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:34,633
It's gonna crack.

555
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,834
You think it's gonna crack?

556
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,235
I'm trying to do it
as fast as I can,

557
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,371
'cause there's a lot to cover
on this thing.

558
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:43,675
That's time, everybody.

559
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:46,611
A big part of my concept
is the beauty aspect of it,

560
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:48,413
so it's really important
to get that down.

561
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:51,149
But now I've got to wait
until Last Looks,

562
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:52,517
and now I'm worried.

563
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:01,495
Come over here.

564
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:02,562
Get out of the way.

565
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:03,697
Let's get this done.

566
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:05,365
It's Last Looks;
I have one hour left.

567
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:07,234
And I have to finish
my paint job.

568
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:09,069
The highlights and shadowing
aren't working.

569
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:10,604
The skin tones aren't matching.

570
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:11,938
I'm just struggling.

571
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,542
Oh, God, all this disease
that I got to paint.

572
00:23:15,576 --> 00:23:16,743
I got to do your eyes.

573
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,411
I'm rushing around
like a madhouse,

574
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:20,213
trying to get
this beauty makeup done.

575
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:21,248
Close.

576
00:23:24,218 --> 00:23:25,519
It's not gonna work.

577
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:26,987
These teeth are not fitting.

578
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:30,891
All I can do right now
is make that mouth look nasty.

579
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,058
30 minutes.

580
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:43,036
All right, time, everybody.

581
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,471
Thanks, Kodi, good luck.

582
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:45,872
I'm really worried,

583
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:48,508
because it's not as finished
as I wanted it to be.

584
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:51,478
So I'm just hoping
that I'm at least safe.

585
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:03,623
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

586
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:07,360
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

587
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,396
But before we see
your creations,

588
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,798
say hello to our series judges.

589
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:12,799
Glenn Hetrick.

590
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,800
Good evening.

591
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:14,801
Hello.

592
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:15,802
Ve Neill.

593
00:24:15,836 --> 00:24:16,836
Hello, everybody.

594
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:17,837
Hello, Ve.

595
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:18,905
And Neville Page.

596
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,140
Hi, guys.

597
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:21,308
Hello.

598
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:24,377
And joining us tonight
is a very special guest.

599
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:25,545
He's the co-head

600
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,714
of Clive Barker's
production company,

601
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:29,149
Seraphim Films.

602
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:32,352
Please give a warm welcome
to Mark Alan Miller.

603
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:34,721
Pleasure to be here.

604
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:36,189
Thank you so much
for being here.

605
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:37,324
Thank you for having me.

606
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:38,959
I'm extremely excited.

607
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:40,927
He is Clive Barker's
right-hand man,

608
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:42,829
so to hear what mark has to say

609
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:45,198
is gonna be really interesting.

610
00:24:45,232 --> 00:24:47,567
All right, guys, this week
your Spotlight Challenge

611
00:24:47,602 --> 00:24:49,836
was to choose
an avant-garde outfit

612
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,707
to inspire a stylish
and intelligent horror villain

613
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:56,343
in the vein
of<i> Hellraiser's</i> Pinhead.

614
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:59,112
So let's take a look
at your creations.

615
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:23,169
I'm nervous.

616
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:25,805
It looks a lot different
than everything else,

617
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,974
which could be a bad thing
or a good thing.

618
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:52,332
I definitely could have
done way better

619
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:53,333
on this challenge.

620
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:54,701
I know I'm on the bottom.

621
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:18,625
I am a little bit worried

622
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,794
that maybe the character
is not scary enough.

623
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:22,562
But I am happy
with the way it looks,

624
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:24,431
and hopefully
the judges like it.

625
00:26:46,687 --> 00:26:49,456
It is the best thing I
could picture in that outfit,

626
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,958
so I'm like, "All right, cool,
mission accomplished."

627
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:17,250
From far away,
I like the paint job.

628
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:19,652
but up close,
it's really rough.

629
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:22,021
They're gonna see
all the mistakes in there.

630
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,710
Even from a distance, I can see

631
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,912
how much he's able
to emote with his face.

632
00:27:45,946 --> 00:27:47,981
just giving
this really creepy vibe.

633
00:27:48,015 --> 00:27:49,783
And I'm hoping the judges agree.

634
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,006
She's got this
creepy vibe to her.

635
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,708
I see the white face
with the silver tips.

636
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:17,277
And overall I'm pretty happy.

637
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:41,134
I don't know
whether or not to think

638
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:44,204
I am unique in the way it looks

639
00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:45,972
or if I'm completely off.

640
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:47,307
I don't really know.

641
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,494
She looks nasty!

642
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,963
And I'm like, "You know,

643
00:29:09,997 --> 00:29:12,098
you're pretty fucked up, Kelly.

644
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:13,399
Did all right."

645
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:20,573
All right, judges,

646
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:22,408
why don't you
take a closer look?

647
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:29,883
There's no texture
in the prosthetic piece.

648
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:30,984
It's not so much monstrous.

649
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:32,585
It's more sympathetic.

650
00:29:34,588 --> 00:29:36,089
What is going on here?

651
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:37,490
I don't know, but it's cool.

652
00:29:37,524 --> 00:29:38,925
It's beautiful coloring on it.

653
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,560
Yeah, I love the paint job.

654
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:44,898
This feels
like an alien character.

655
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:46,232
I was gonna say the same thing.

656
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:48,635
Yeah.

657
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:51,404
I do love the originality
of this in sculpting.

658
00:29:51,438 --> 00:29:53,907
I would have liked to have
seen a lot more of this gold

659
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:56,576
being brought down onto
all these highlighted areas.

660
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:58,678
Oh, jeez.

661
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:00,813
This does not even
resemble skin.

662
00:30:00,848 --> 00:30:04,083
This chin and nose and forehead

663
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:06,219
don't say, "Clive Barker."

664
00:30:06,253 --> 00:30:08,321
I'm mainly worried
about the paint work.

665
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:09,989
It's too flat.

666
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:11,591
This could be a disaster.

667
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:17,664
Tell us who made
your favorite horror villain

668
00:30:17,698 --> 00:30:20,667
tonight on Twitter
using #FaceOff

669
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:25,241
This does not
even resemble skin.

670
00:30:25,276 --> 00:30:26,910
I am freaking out.

671
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:29,212
The paint work is too flat.

672
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,915
The quality of it
isn't where it needs to be.

673
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:38,588
This is even better close
than it was far away.

674
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:39,789
Yeah.

675
00:30:39,824 --> 00:30:42,025
This is the first time
I'm scared today.

676
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,293
And that's good.

677
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:47,997
I love these weird
asymmetrical shapes.

678
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:50,233
All of these notes
tie into the wardrobe,

679
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,468
and it's the only makeup

680
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:53,203
that addresses that
so completely.

681
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:54,237
Oh, yeah.

682
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:00,510
Gets a little soft and full
through here,

683
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:04,114
but up in here,
that's really well-handled.

684
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:10,487
Oh, the eyes, it's creepy.

685
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:12,355
She is creepy.

686
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:13,490
We have pain.

687
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:15,525
We have disgusting and sexy.

688
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,193
I love it.

689
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:18,328
Oh.

690
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:25,068
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

691
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:27,203
Let's find out
what they thought.

692
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:29,038
Adam...

693
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:30,974
Logan...

694
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:32,776
Darla...

695
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,211
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

696
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:37,247
and can head back
to the makeup room.

697
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:38,248
Thank you.

698
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,210
Oh, my God.

699
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:47,423
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

700
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,359
and the judges would like
to speak with each of you

701
00:31:49,393 --> 00:31:50,794
to learn more about your work.

702
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:52,262
Julian, you're up.

703
00:31:57,902 --> 00:31:59,602
Give us the
backstory of this character

704
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:02,672
and how Clive's work
inspired you to design this.

705
00:32:02,706 --> 00:32:03,973
Well, the first thing I noticed

706
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,542
when I chose the costume
was the amulet,

707
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,677
and I figured that that was
some sort of cursed object,

708
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:10,180
and whoever wears it,
he comes after them.

709
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:12,081
And his whole head
is a second mouth

710
00:32:12,116 --> 00:32:14,384
that rips the souls
out of his victims.

711
00:32:14,418 --> 00:32:18,388
I am absolutely thrilled
with what you did this week.

712
00:32:18,422 --> 00:32:21,090
I am a huge Clive Barker fan,

713
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,692
and I think you did
an amazing job

714
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:24,861
of working within his world.

715
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:27,831
You're obviously a Clive fan,
and you know your stuff.

716
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:28,832
Well done.

717
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,033
Thank you.

718
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,901
On a scale of one to ten
in the creepiness,

719
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,970
he is a 15 1/2.

720
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,338
I love the paint job.

721
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,674
I think this character
was very successful.

722
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,842
Thank you.

723
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,476
I don't think
it's that creative.

724
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:41,945
I think it's a very good
"now" design.

725
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:44,681
I don't think it's
a very next-gen version

726
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,716
of Clive Barker world.

727
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,351
He's definitely scary.

728
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:49,986
I do love the idea
of the mouth.

729
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,254
I love the jaw line.

730
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,522
He's very cool.

731
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:53,723
Thank you.

732
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:55,491
Julian, if you'd please
step back.

733
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:56,726
Thanks.

734
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:04,367
Emily, please step up.

735
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:11,941
Would you please tell us
how your avant-garde wardrobe

736
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:13,409
inspired your character?

737
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:17,747
I had the crow feather
and the chain mail skirt.

738
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:20,617
So I decided to go
with a fallen angel.

739
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:22,318
This is a great makeup.

740
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:24,053
Thanks.

741
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:26,289
I absolutely
love the paint job,

742
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:29,025
and the silhouette
on this character is phenomenal.

743
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,393
Oh, thanks.

744
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:33,229
What you've achieved is
something that's iconic

745
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:35,265
and extraordinarily memorable.

746
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,033
I think this is beautiful.

747
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:38,534
Thank you.

748
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:41,037
I'm not quite sure it falls
into the Clive Barker world,

749
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:43,539
but I do think it is
something extraordinary.

750
00:33:43,574 --> 00:33:45,074
Thank you.

751
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:47,010
Emily, you can step back.

752
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:48,211
Thank you.

753
00:33:52,483 --> 00:33:53,549
All right,
let's talk to Stephanie.

754
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:54,584
Okay.

755
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:01,925
So tell us about
your Clive Barker character

756
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:05,161
and how the fashion motivated
some of your choices.

757
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:06,963
She's basically, like, a seer,

758
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:09,866
but she was cursed
into, like--

759
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,435
I don't know, it just was
a much more twisted form

760
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,270
than she had
originally intended.

761
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:15,972
I don't think you know

762
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:18,274
what it is that you were
trying to execute.

763
00:34:20,377 --> 00:34:23,513
It's so nonspecific
in terms of sculptural form

764
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:26,516
that I simply do not know
what I'm looking at.

765
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,650
Yeah.

766
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:29,452
Another huge problem with this

767
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:33,022
is, it is not conducive
to your model's facial features.

768
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:36,225
You've weakened her chin,
which evokes sympathy,

769
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,696
and it does not use
her jaw line or her nose

770
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,666
to convey any of the things
that we were looking for.

771
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:45,401
Stephanie, please step back.

772
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:52,742
Kelly, you're next.

773
00:34:58,482 --> 00:35:00,683
Could you tell me a little
about your character?

774
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:03,219
She was obsessed
with plastic surgery,

775
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:07,023
so she is just continuously
under her own knife.

776
00:35:07,057 --> 00:35:10,293
Well, I'd like to applaud you
for marrying sex and violence.

777
00:35:12,062 --> 00:35:14,197
That's definitely a
big part of what we do.

778
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:15,431
We have a new<i> Hellraiser</i>

779
00:35:15,466 --> 00:35:16,966
anthology comic book
coming out,

780
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:19,736
and I could very easily
see this character

781
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,037
in one of those stories.

782
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,038
Oh.

783
00:35:22,072 --> 00:35:24,073
The integration
of your wardrobe

784
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:25,975
through that vacu-form thing

785
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,877
is an astounding touch.

786
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:31,247
It brings the avant-garde
into the Clive Barker world.

787
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:32,515
Thank you so much.

788
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,550
That green dress
and the red hair

789
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:36,185
are phenomenal together.

790
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,290
She is the most disturbing thing
I have seen in ages.

791
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:42,358
Kelly, thank you.

792
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:43,359
You can step back.

793
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:44,761
Yeah, girl.

794
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:52,268
Jamie, please step forward.

795
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,343
Please tell us
how your wardrobe

796
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:02,245
inspired this
Clive Barker character.

797
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:04,280
I thought black widow lady

798
00:36:04,314 --> 00:36:06,849
who attracts people
through her beauty.

799
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,551
The legs are coming out,

800
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:11,154
grabbing the rest of her face.

801
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:13,122
I am not thrilled
with this makeup.

802
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:17,060
The spider growing out
of the back of her head

803
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,227
and grabbing her skin,

804
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:20,797
it just feels alien/monster-y

805
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:24,734
in a way that's not part
of the Clive Barker mythology.

806
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:25,968
That's okay.

807
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:28,104
This paint job
is completely flat.

808
00:36:28,138 --> 00:36:29,572
It doesn't look like skin.

809
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:30,740
This is a failure this week.

810
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:31,974
Okay.

811
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:33,576
There's stuff on it that says

812
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,379
it's a Klingon, it's a Borg,

813
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:39,482
not at all in the world
of Clive Barker.

814
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:42,485
It's very problematic.

815
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,387
Jamie, please step down.

816
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,927
Ben.

817
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:58,468
Would you please give us
a little backstory on her?

818
00:36:58,502 --> 00:36:59,836
She was a fetish model,

819
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,270
always worried about her looks,

820
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:04,874
and now she reaps the souls
of other people who are vain.

821
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:08,478
She is really quite exquisite
when you get up close.

822
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:11,514
I love how you use the
inspiration from her bodice here

823
00:37:11,548 --> 00:37:14,750
and put that in her cowl
as well as her neck.

824
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:17,086
You brought the fashion
into the makeup,

825
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:18,855
which is really a great idea.

826
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:19,856
Thank you.

827
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,990
I love the story.

828
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,460
I love the corrupted
porcelain doll look.

829
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,864
And I know Clive said
to go to the avant-garde,

830
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:30,366
and you, perhaps more
than any other, have done that.

831
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,534
Thank you.

832
00:37:31,568 --> 00:37:33,503
I absolutely love
the back of the head.

833
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:35,204
It's so cool.

834
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,440
And I appreciate
how smooth that is

835
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,308
and the detail
that you put into it.

836
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,878
I think it's a brilliant
and daring combination

837
00:37:41,912 --> 00:37:43,412
of all the different things

838
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:45,848
in what is an extraordinarily
complex challenge.

839
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:46,949
Thank you.

840
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,718
Ben, please step back.

841
00:37:54,825 --> 00:37:56,025
All right, thank you, guys.

842
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:57,293
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

843
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:58,961
while the judges deliberate.

844
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:07,470
All right, judges,

845
00:38:07,504 --> 00:38:09,071
let's start with the looks
you liked the most tonight.

846
00:38:09,106 --> 00:38:10,473
How about Julian's work?

847
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:11,974
He hit all the
right notes for me.

848
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,943
It's the one
that is the most standout

849
00:38:13,977 --> 00:38:15,711
in the Clive Barker world.

850
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:17,146
Up close, definitely one

851
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:18,915
of the most terrifying
of the bunch.

852
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:20,416
All right, let's move on
to Emily.

853
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,984
The silhouette
of that character

854
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:23,486
is just unbelievable.

855
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,487
It's freaky.

856
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:26,322
I mean, she's amazing, this kid.

857
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:28,391
it's an incredible makeup,

858
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:30,826
but it's nowhere near
the Barker universe.

859
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:32,728
All right,
let's move on to Kelly.

860
00:38:32,763 --> 00:38:34,530
Talk about a makeup that feels

861
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,466
so perfectly suited
for this challenge.

862
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:38,467
It was scary.

863
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:39,869
It was sexy.

864
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:42,004
The story behind it was maybe
my favorite of the night.

865
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,239
I agree.

866
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:45,441
All right, judges,
let's move on to Ben.

867
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:48,878
I think that it is
the most astute treatment

868
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:51,147
of bringing fashion
into the makeup.

869
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:52,548
It's got pleasure and pain.

870
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,317
It's got grace and grotesquerie.

871
00:38:54,351 --> 00:38:55,818
And that's all
that we can ask for.

872
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:57,620
All right, judges,
let's move on to the looks

873
00:38:57,654 --> 00:38:59,255
that didn't quite work
for you this week.

874
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:00,323
How about Stephanie?

875
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:01,891
It is not avant-garde.

876
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,759
It sure as hell
isn't Clive Barker.

877
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:05,094
And it's not scary.

878
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:06,929
I don't think she has any idea

879
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:08,264
where she as going with it.

880
00:39:08,298 --> 00:39:10,967
I don't think it was executed
particularly well.

881
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:12,535
All right,
let's move on to Jamie.

882
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:14,370
The paint job was atrocious.

883
00:39:14,404 --> 00:39:15,805
It did not look like skin.

884
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,107
And the black widow wasn't even
painted properly.

885
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:20,376
It had nothing to do
with Clive's world at all,

886
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,677
even on a technical level.

887
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:24,013
The chin and the nose
look like melted wax.

888
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:26,549
All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

889
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,717
Easy.

890
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:29,485
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

891
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:41,264
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

892
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:44,800
Julian, you gave us
a sophisticated

893
00:39:44,835 --> 00:39:46,502
and intelligent horror villain

894
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:49,538
that definitely felt like it was
in the world of Clive Barker.

895
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:54,443
And Kelly, your character
and concept told a great story,

896
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:57,980
and you did a fantastic job
tapping into Barker imagery.

897
00:39:58,015 --> 00:40:01,917
And Ben, we were thrilled
by your high-concept thinking

898
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:04,220
and loved the way that you
integrated your costume

899
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:05,855
into the back of the head.

900
00:40:05,889 --> 00:40:08,291
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

901
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,426
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

902
00:40:17,642 --> 00:40:19,510
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

903
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:21,312
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

904
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,250
Ben.

905
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,621
While some of the characters
may have better captured

906
00:40:30,655 --> 00:40:32,756
the classic
Clive Barker aesthetic,

907
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,425
you gave us a glimpse
into the future.

908
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:35,426
Great job.

909
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,427
Thank you.

910
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:37,561
Second win for me.

911
00:40:37,596 --> 00:40:39,530
It's extremely cool,

912
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:41,565
especially since this
is a Clive Barker challenge.

913
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,601
I'm sure that he's
gonna see this creature,

914
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:45,269
which feels awesome.

915
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:46,870
Ben, congratulations.

916
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:49,873
You, Julian, Emily, and Kelly
are all safe

917
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,376
and can head back to the makeup
room along with the coaches.

918
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:57,915
All right,
that means the two of you

919
00:40:57,949 --> 00:40:59,416
are on the bottom this week,

920
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:01,352
and one of you
will be going home.

921
00:41:01,386 --> 00:41:02,720
Please step forward.

922
00:41:09,394 --> 00:41:11,629
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

923
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:14,098
Stephanie,
the prophet seer concept

924
00:41:14,132 --> 00:41:15,866
could have been
very interesting,

925
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,836
but you let your indecision
compromise many of the aspects

926
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,104
of your final makeup.

927
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:23,040
And Jamie,
we get wanting to draw

928
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:24,608
on the spider vibe
of the outfit,

929
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:26,677
but that concept
was heavily undermined

930
00:41:26,711 --> 00:41:29,346
by all the technical issues
with your makeup.

931
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:31,715
So who is going home
tonight, Glenn?

932
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,784
The person going
home tonight is...

933
00:41:37,722 --> 00:41:38,756
Jamie.

934
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,326
Despite all your best efforts,

935
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,863
it seems like you just couldn't
pull all of your ideas together

936
00:41:45,897 --> 00:41:48,198
to deliver a clean makeup
this week.

937
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:52,302
Jamie, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

938
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:54,705
Stephanie,
you are safe this week

939
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:56,540
and can head back
to the makeup room.

940
00:42:01,379 --> 00:42:04,615
Jamie, I personally feel
that we're quite fortunate

941
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:06,750
to have experienced your talents
on<i> Face Off.</i>

942
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,119
And I know that this week
it got a little away from you,

943
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:12,756
but I know that you've also got
a tremendous amount left in you.

944
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,091
Thank you.

945
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:16,660
Jamie, it's been so great
having you here with us,

946
00:42:16,695 --> 00:42:19,329
but if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

947
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:20,497
and pack up your kit.

948
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:21,799
Thank you, guys.

949
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,833
- Good luck, Jamie.
- Good luck, Jamie.

950
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:24,802
Thank you.

951
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:26,603
I'm really surprised
that I'm going home.

952
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:30,340
I feel that I have
a lot more to show.

953
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:35,546
Jamie?

954
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,183
I've met some amazing people,
and my coach is amazing.

955
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:41,719
You've shown you can
do great makeups.

956
00:42:41,753 --> 00:42:43,787
You know, you've progressed
throughout the season.

957
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:46,490
So continue growing
as an artist.

958
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:50,227
I came out here to push myself
and break out of my shell.

959
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:54,631
I'm upset,
but at the same time,

960
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:56,734
I'm excited to look ahead.
