1
00:00:00,748 --> 00:00:02,282
I think it's brilliant.

2
00:00:02,317 --> 00:00:04,585
It's not even
a good clown makeup.

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:06,753
It's a beautiful,
beautiful design.

4
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:08,755
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,257
Previously, on <i>Face Off,</i>

6
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,827
the judges fell in love
with Emily's queen of hearts,

7
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,596
but Daniel was eliminated,

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,699
leaving only three artists
on Team Anthony.

9
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:23,303
Now, 12 artists remain,
and tonight,

10
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:26,406
their stamina is tested
with two intense challenges.

11
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,674
It's relay race time.

12
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,943
I'm a makeup artist,
not an athlete.

13
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,078
Ahh!

14
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:32,713
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm freaking out.

15
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:34,214
Is he a good guy
or is he a bad guy?

16
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,483
There's a lot of blank stares.

17
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:39,119
We do have business
to attend to.

18
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:42,456
- What?
- What is going on?

19
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:45,459
You did an amazing job.

20
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:47,861
In the end, only one will win
a VIP trip

21
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:49,363
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

22
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:52,165
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,202
a brand new 2015 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,537
and $100,000.

25
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:00,941
This is <i>Face Off.</i>

26
00:01:32,698 --> 00:01:36,083
Sync and corrections by n17t01

27
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,720
- Okay.
- So we walk into the lab,

28
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:48,822
and I see that there are
these four makeup stations

29
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,357
that look like lanes.

30
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:51,358
What is this?

31
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:55,228
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

32
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:58,765
So life on a Hollywood set
can be pure chaos,

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,401
and sometimes, that means
having to hand off your work

34
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:03,303
to someone else
to finish the job,

35
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:05,739
and that's exactly
what you'll be doing today.

36
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:08,375
- It's relay race time.
- Oh, yeah.

37
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:10,143
I don't feel
to good about this,

38
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:13,213
'cause I'm a makeup artist,
not an athlete.

39
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:15,015
You'll be working
in teams of three,

40
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:18,318
and each team member will get
two 20 minute turns.

41
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:21,455
When I call, "Switch,"
at the end of your first turn,

42
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,657
you need to grab
a new prosthetic

43
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,759
and hand it off
to your teammate.

44
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:28,128
That new piece
must be incorporated

45
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,297
into your team's
overall design.

46
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,631
Oh, my God.

47
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,233
While you're working,
you will not be able

48
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,902
to communicate
with your team at all.

49
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,138
So you'll find out
what you're dealing with

50
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:39,873
when you come
around the back side

51
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:41,708
of one of these
makeup stations.

52
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:44,177
Now, you're going to need
a little inspiration

53
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:45,946
for your makeups.

54
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:51,084
Oh.

55
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,220
From Freddy Krueger
in <i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i>

56
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,788
to<i> Edward Scissorhands,</i>

57
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:56,723
claws have played
a significant role

58
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,359
in defining
iconic movie characters.

59
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:02,429
So you will use
your model's claws

60
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:05,932
as inspiration
for an original character.

61
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,435
The winner of today's challenge
will earn immunity...

62
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:09,636
Ooh.

63
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,804
...and cannot be eliminated

64
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:12,606
in this week's
spotlight challenge.

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,807
I want that immunity

66
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:15,342
because I've been
in the bottom twice,

67
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:16,943
and I know I'm better
than what I've been able

68
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:20,080
to accomplish so far.

69
00:03:20,114 --> 00:03:21,481
Your guest judge this week

70
00:03:21,516 --> 00:03:24,618
is the co-host
of ABC's hit show<i> Wipeout,</i>

71
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,954
and one of the stars
of MTV's<i> Teen Wolf.</i>

72
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,058
Please give a warm welcome
to Jill Wagner.

73
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:35,729
It's really cool
to have Jill Wagner here

74
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:38,298
because she knows how it feels
to be in prosthetics

75
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:40,300
and understands
the importance of makeup

76
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:42,302
in creating
a cohesive character.

77
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,770
So Jill, you have
some claws of your own.

78
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:45,405
You're a were-jaguar.

79
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,240
I do-- Which are
totally different claws,

80
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:48,408
by the way, than a werewolf.

81
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:49,843
Exactly.
Good point.

82
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:51,278
So what are you gonna be
looking for today?

83
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:53,547
Everything has to flow.
It's got to look like

84
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:56,349
your claw belongs
with the rest of the character,

85
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:58,418
but the most important thing
for me

86
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,987
is the detailing in the makeup,

87
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,422
particularly the mouth.

88
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:03,723
All right, everybody,

89
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:06,526
your teams and stations
have been randomly assigned.

90
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:10,730
Head back to the starting lines
and stand with your teammates.

91
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,899
On your mark, get set,

92
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:14,134
- go!
- Ahh!

93
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:16,503
Oh, geez.

94
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,671
What's up, man? I'm Logan.
I can't shake your hand.

95
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,439
You have stuff all over it.

96
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:22,676
Our claws have a lot
of colorful, mechanical parts,

97
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,911
and I think,
"Toy factory, cyborg."

98
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:26,346
- Yeah.
- Tip your head back.

99
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,681
So I apply a bald cap...

100
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:29,015
Ready for this?

101
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,384
...and lay down a gear prosthetic
right on the forehead.

102
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,688
This is exciting.

103
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:39,459
I see these amazing,
bedazzled out in gold cat claws,

104
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:41,561
so I think,
"Egyptian cat goddess."

105
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,764
Let me see those claws.

106
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,467
We've got these
Freddy Krueger-looking claws,

107
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:49,202
so the first thing
I could think of is

108
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,238
maybe he's cutting himself.

109
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,507
I find a prosthetic,
and it's got all these cracks,

110
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,842
and I start applying it
to his face.

111
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,377
It makes scars
and some open wounds.

112
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:59,412
So I'm just setting
a foundation for my team.

113
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:01,414
I have no idea what's going on,

114
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:02,883
and it's excruciating,
knowing I'm up next.

115
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:09,789
We get these sparkly,
icy fingers,

116
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:11,691
so I first think, "Ice queen,"

117
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:14,628
and I'm gonna have
this really pointy, evil brow,

118
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:19,399
and I need to also grab
the next appliance for Adam.

119
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,634
Switch!

120
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,905
What the hell is it?

121
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,940
I look at the prosthetic
Logan hands me,

122
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:29,609
and it's a set of teeth
with, like,

123
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:31,678
more mechanical stuff
underneath it,

124
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:33,947
and I see gears
on our model's head,

125
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:35,949
and it triggers cyborg for me.

126
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,450
That's pretty cool.

127
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:38,718
_

128
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:41,221
It is, but you have
a nose piece in your brow.

129
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,823
I remember Jill's comment
about details around the mouth,

130
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,193
and I just create
a little chin piece out of it.

131
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:49,329
Oh, I get it.

132
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,566
Ben gave me
a set of eye bag prosthetics,

133
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,335
but I decide to use
these as blender pieces

134
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:57,370
to cover up some of the edges,

135
00:05:57,405 --> 00:06:00,106
and I notice that there's
some really thick edges

136
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,342
along his brow area,

137
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:05,345
so I find a piece
that will cover that

138
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,547
for Emily to apply.

139
00:06:07,582 --> 00:06:10,283
I can tell that Anthony's going
for some kind of Egyptian style,

140
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:12,385
so I start gluing down
the horns on the chin

141
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,521
to add some kind of silhouette.

142
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,091
It's getting down to the end
of my turn,

143
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,460
and my concept
is an alien diva,

144
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:22,395
but I don't know
how to tell Rob,

145
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,297
so I grab some blues,
whites, and silvers,

146
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,199
and I hope rob gets
the message.

147
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:27,300
Then I grab a set of horns.

148
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:28,902
Perfect.

149
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,503
Switch!

150
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:35,308
- Hi.
- Hi.

151
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:36,977
I hope she doesn't take
what I gave her too literally.

152
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,246
Stephanie has handed me
a full face,

153
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,181
and I kind of know
where they're going with it.

154
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,515
Somebody's been torn up.

155
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,584
So I'm like, "Okay,
I got to Frankenstein this."

156
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,486
What is he supposed to be?

157
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,021
I have
a little nose prosthetic.

158
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:50,957
I think Darla wants me
to cover up the edges

159
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:52,292
around the eyes...

160
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:53,426
Perfect.

161
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:55,662
So I apply the nose piece
very quickly,

162
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:57,931
and I just start painting.

163
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:59,966
I see Adam grab the paints,

164
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:02,535
and I start laying down
Kryolan Aquacolor.

165
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:04,971
Switch!

166
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,343
You are looking
like a beast, man.

167
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:12,545
At this point, this is obviously
a wounded character,

168
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,581
so we're just gonna burn him up.

169
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,287
Switch!

170
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:23,356
Hi.

171
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,357
What do we got?
What do we got? What do we got?

172
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:26,893
Oh, shit.
What in the--

173
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:33,967
Switch!

174
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:45,412
Time, guys!
That's it, brushes down!

175
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:50,721
Tell us about the concept
that you created with the claws you got.

176
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,022
First thing
that I could think of was,

177
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,357
"He's always picking
at himself,"

178
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,624
so I found something
that looked like

179
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,293
it had already been cut.

180
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:57,894
- And then, we all added...
- Yeah.

181
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:59,629
layers of paint to it to create

182
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:01,331
extra depth within the piece.

183
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,600
Overall, it's great.
The cracks and everything,

184
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:05,669
they're really good,
but I just would like to see

185
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:10,841
just a little more originality,
but he looks like his claws.

186
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,210
- It matches.
- Thanks.

187
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:16,179
I immediately thought doing
an Egyptian cat goddess.

188
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,281
What made you put
the horns right there?

189
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:19,883
I could just tell
that Anthony wanted the bangs

190
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,985
to be flowing down, and
I didn't want to interrupt that,

191
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,187
so I thought the chin would be
the place to put them.

192
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:26,323
I love the coloring,
love her lips,

193
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,492
but where the horn comes out

194
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:31,628
needs to be blended
a little bit better.

195
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:35,766
This is Ivan, he was involved
in a toy factory explosion.

196
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,001
All the bits were seared
into his face.

197
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:40,404
I love the whole story
of this one.

198
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:41,538
He looks scary.

199
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:43,206
He would have terrified
the hell out of me.

200
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,409
Thank you.

201
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:48,412
She's Princess Meg,
and she's a hostess

202
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,946
for an intergalactic
music video show.

203
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:53,049
I have to say, the wig was
a pretty bold choice.

204
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,718
Who made that decision?

205
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:56,153
When I saw how he went
with blue,

206
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,889
I walked back there, and
I was like, "That's the one."

207
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:01,024
I love the coloring.

208
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:03,126
This is really cohesive.

209
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:04,261
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

210
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,630
So Jill, how did they do today?

211
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:07,864
They did amazing.

212
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,468
I love the characters
and originality.

213
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:13,103
- Great job.
- All right, who created

214
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,271
your favorite looks?

215
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,306
Kelly, Adam, and Rob,

216
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,008
'cause I love the way you guys

217
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:20,677
made her beautiful
instead of scary.

218
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,913
- She's uber-cool.
- Thank you.

219
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:26,516
My other favorite was from
Logan, Stephanie, and Jamie.

220
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:29,753
It was very cohesive
and creepy and scary.

221
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,087
Thank you.

222
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:33,757
All right, Jill,
so who has won immunity?

223
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:37,527
The winner is...

224
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:38,528
Adam.

225
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,834
The wig totally made
the character,

226
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:46,102
and this little chin piece
was so unexpected,

227
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,871
so congratulations, Adam.

228
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:49,606
Thank you so much.

229
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,741
I'm stoked,
because having immunity

230
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:53,577
is gonna give me a chance
to do some things that

231
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:56,980
I don't typically do without,
you know, the consequences.

232
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,849
Jill, thank you so much
for being here.

233
00:09:58,883 --> 00:09:59,916
- Thank you so much.
- It was such a pleasure

234
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,451
to have you.

235
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:04,421
Bye.

236
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,823
All right,
before I send you home,

237
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:10,126
we do have a little bit
of business to attend to.

238
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,631
What is going on?

239
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,766
Rayce?

240
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,736
- Hey, guys.
- What?

241
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,772
Oh, man,
what's Rayce doing here?

242
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,997
So why don't you fill them in?

243
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,767
I have a big client that I have

244
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,135
some prior commitments with,

245
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:36,471
and I will not be able to attend
this spotlight challenge.

246
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,740
But I've got
a<i> Face Off</i> rock star

247
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,809
that is gonna come
help you guys out.

248
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,414
Hey.

249
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:47,682
Hey, guys.

250
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:50,919
- Ah.
- You look great.

251
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,320
So good to see you.

252
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:54,156
Thank you.
It's awesome to be here.

253
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,991
All right, well,
you guys all remember RJ.

254
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:58,427
So Rayce, how do you feel
about this guy

255
00:10:58,461 --> 00:10:59,594
stepping in while you're gone?

256
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,996
Oh, I'm really excited.

257
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,165
He's got an insane amount
of knowledge

258
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,599
to help execute your makeups.

259
00:11:04,634 --> 00:11:06,334
All right, guys,
RJ will be in the lab

260
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:08,036
with Anthony and Laura
in the morning,

261
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,606
so we'll see you tomorrow for
your next spotlight challenge.

262
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,675
It's gonna be really weird
not having Rayce around,

263
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:15,911
but RJ's an amazing artist,

264
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:18,447
so I'm really excited
to be working with him.

265
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,258
We arrive at Fox Studios.

266
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:34,830
I can just feel the history,
walking down these streets.

267
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:37,165
It's so amazing.

268
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:46,741
Welcome to the historic Newman
scoring stage at Fox Studios.

269
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:50,345
Now, some of the most memorable
motion picture music ever

270
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,248
was recorded right here
in this room.

271
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:57,786
And this, of course, leads us to
your next spotlight challenge,

272
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,523
which taps into an essential
element of movie magic,

273
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,525
sound.

274
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,327
Sound designers are often
involved

275
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,262
before a creature
is even designed,

276
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:10,665
meaning the sound
inspires the final creation.

277
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,969
Your spotlight challenge
is to create a character

278
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,271
inspired
by a unique sound effect.

279
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:18,306
Ooh.

280
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,774
I think that's awesome.

281
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,142
This challenge is gonna
really show

282
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,445
everyone's imagination
and what they can do.

283
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:26,648
Now, you'll be working
together in teams of two,

284
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:28,316
so go ahead and pair up.

285
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,022
I'd like to introduce
a very special guest.

286
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:36,992
He's earned five
Primetime Emmy nominations

287
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,327
and two Academy Award
nominations

288
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:41,229
for his sound design work.

289
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:45,967
Please give a warm welcome
to sound designer Erik Aadahl.

290
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,308
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

291
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:55,010
Oh, my pleasure.
It's great to be here.

292
00:12:55,044 --> 00:12:57,913
Well, I mean, you have built
quite an impressive resume.

293
00:12:57,947 --> 00:12:59,714
How do you find inspiration?

294
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:01,416
When you're giving voice
to something,

295
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,817
you're giving it its soul.

296
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:06,454
So the job of the sound designer
is to illuminate that soul.

297
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:10,325
So try to find the personality,
the environment, the genre,

298
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,027
and play off of that.

299
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:13,295
You will have
the unique pleasure

300
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,431
of using original sounds
that Eric has created

301
00:13:16,465 --> 00:13:18,733
to inspire your designs
this week.

302
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:20,235
That's real cool.

303
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:23,104
They've been randomly assigned
and preloaded onto your tablets.

304
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:25,774
This guy is a genius,

305
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:29,344
and the fact that he is making
our sounds, that's awesome.

306
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:31,513
- Thank you so much again.
- My pleasure.

307
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:32,647
All right, guys,
your sound effects

308
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:34,549
will play back
alongside your characters

309
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,484
on the reveal stage
for the judges.

310
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,987
So grab your tablets
and headphones

311
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:41,356
and start conceptualizing
your creations.

312
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:47,729
I think we should both
individually

313
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:49,431
listen to the sound twice.

314
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,871
Rob and I get this rumbly,
roaring character

315
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:59,107
that sounds like t-rex
with a cold.

316
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:02,043
We want a large bog creature,
bigger than life.

317
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:03,979
We want to make it
a head-to-toe piece.

318
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:08,116
It's this big, snarling,
snotty beast

319
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,485
with a few different
nostril sets.

320
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,753
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

321
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,928
We hear, like,
these clicking noises,

322
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,896
and then rustling and water.

323
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,966
I'm thinking
very dinosaur-like.

324
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:25,967
Mm-hmm.

325
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:27,068
Our concept for our character

326
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:30,105
is a prehistoric,
bird-like creature.

327
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,774
It lives in the jungle,

328
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,143
and it defends itself
by its quills.

329
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:41,516
What are you thinking?

330
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,019
I'm thinking
similar to full robot.

331
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:46,821
We have something that
the other sounds don't have,

332
00:14:46,856 --> 00:14:48,456
which is words.

333
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:51,159
Activated.

334
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:57,365
Weapon system armed.

335
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,268
I don't want to do a robot.

336
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:02,137
I think that it's too obvious.

337
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:03,405
This is speaking to me, though.

338
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,939
One-armed robot?

339
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:06,441
That's been done before.

340
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:09,878
Armed.

341
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:19,754
It sounds horror.

342
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,690
Yeah,
that's a terrifying sound.

343
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:24,492
There's women screaming
and hollow ghost sounds

344
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,394
and men groaning, and I'm like,

345
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:28,430
"What the actual hell?"

346
00:15:28,464 --> 00:15:33,334
What if we did some form
of, like, demon banshee?

347
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:36,004
The first thing that pops
into my head is Satan's servant.

348
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,572
He's able to grasp
onto their souls

349
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,541
and drag them down into Hell.

350
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:44,279
The character's face
is definitely gonna be demonic,

351
00:15:44,313 --> 00:15:46,815
but then, all down his chest,

352
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:49,417
we're gonna have
these sort of ghostly figures.

353
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:52,554
It sounds like multiple things
happening at the same time.

354
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:54,422
So basically, Anthony and I
are gonna make Hell.

355
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:59,360
All right, everybody,
let's go back to the lab.

356
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,841
Like the clockmaker's wife
or something,

357
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,510
and she died or something
so he put her back together.

358
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:17,612
Ticking is really prominent
in our sound,

359
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:20,949
and we decide that we're not
gonna do the clockmaker,

360
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:22,784
but do the clockmaker's wife.

361
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:28,289
She dies and he ends up making
a porcelain clockwork doll

362
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,958
that looks like her.

363
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:32,260
But maybe we can make her,
like, '50s housewife.

364
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:35,163
I'm digging this.

365
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:41,636
I really, really want to focus
on the detail on this guy.

366
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,271
I'm gonna get this molded today

367
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:44,305
- when it's done.
- Okay.

368
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,580
We have kind of bits
and pieces of an idea,

369
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,616
but we don't have
a concept right now.

370
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,752
This sound is really tough.

371
00:16:57,787 --> 00:16:59,687
It just sounds like breathing.

372
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:04,759
We just start adding clay
on there,

373
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:08,730
and hoping maybe a concept
will appear to us

374
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:09,964
as we're sculpting.

375
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:12,867
- Do you a back story in mind?
- I don't.

376
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,907
- How are you?
- Good to meet you, man.

377
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:20,842
We're Team Rayce.
That's why I called you over.

378
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,377
- Hey, guys, how are you?
- Rob, how are you?

379
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,412
I am so excited to be back
this season,

380
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:25,947
- coaching Team Rayce.
- As you can see,

381
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:29,651
- I've started on a face on--
- That's a big head.

382
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:31,052
These two guys are planning
to build

383
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,720
a creature suit
from head to toe.

384
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,790
The sound really works
with this design,

385
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:38,593
and I'm gonna make sure that Rob
and Logan get things done today,

386
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:40,628
because that clock
is always ticking.

387
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:41,830
You got to move.

388
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:44,532
Is he a warrior?
Where-- you know,

389
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:46,801
what period does he come from,
like, time frame?

390
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:49,470
Laura and I see they are
struggling with their concept.

391
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:50,905
Is he a good guy
or is he a bad guy?

392
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,040
- Frankenstein character...
- Yeah.

393
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:53,608
- Orc character...
- Is he science fiction?

394
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:54,943
- Grotesque character?
- Is he horror?

395
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:56,578
What genre is he?

396
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:58,646
There aren't a lot of answers.
There's a lot of blank stares.

397
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,381
Take a few minutes and
figure it out a little bit more.

398
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,749
Maybe draw a few more pictures.

399
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:06,654
So I'm sculpting
the chest piece

400
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,756
with all the different faces,
and Darla is working

401
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,925
on the facial sculpt,
and I realize

402
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,995
we have all of the models'
silicone life casts.

403
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:16,397
So I grab white clay,
and I press it in,

404
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,833
take the imprint
of the models' faces,

405
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,401
and then slap it right on
and have

406
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:21,970
a form that I can just
work with.

407
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:25,740
Actually use a chest,
so that you can see the lines.

408
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:27,242
You don't want edge problems.

409
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,779
That's really clever.
It looks really good too.

410
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:32,814
Thank you.

411
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,718
I hear gears.
I hear heavy breathing,

412
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:39,807
and I hear a knife
or some kind of blade at the end.

413
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:42,990
After two long miserable hours,

414
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:46,531
we finally come
to some sort of concept.

415
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:48,700
It sounds like something's
coming towards me.

416
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,335
At the last second,
when I finally see it,

417
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,470
- that's when he-- "ching."
- Yeah.

418
00:18:52,504 --> 00:18:55,440
Our concept is
a demon executioner

419
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:59,177
that wears the faces
of people that he kills.

420
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:00,278
I'm a little nervous.

421
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:01,613
It seems like
the only other people

422
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,148
that haven't gotten started yet
are Adam and Regina.

423
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:11,389
I'm thinking, like,
almost, like, organic-ness.

424
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:12,590
Like, bio-organic

425
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,292
- is the style?
- No, no, no, no, no, hold on.

426
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,561
Adam wants to go robotic.

427
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:19,164
That takes
a lot more fabrication,

428
00:19:19,198 --> 00:19:22,867
which is not
one of my strong points.

429
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,004
I have to do
a really good job at this,

430
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,206
because Adam has immunity.

431
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,143
I'm freaking out
because we're lost.

432
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,809
It's the first day
of our sound design challenge,

433
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,245
and the entire room has
at least one sculpture,

434
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,315
but Adam and I
don't have anything.

435
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:47,484
I'm just getting frustrated
at this point.

436
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,252
They're kind of lost,
so I'm gonna go over

437
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,320
and hang out with them.

438
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,821
I really like the face.

439
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,290
So after sketching
back and forth,

440
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:55,192
I'm thinking robot,
but Regina has

441
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:58,228
this idea
of this alien super soldier.

442
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:00,063
Activated.

443
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,399
I want to stick
to Regina's design

444
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:03,500
'cause I do have immunity.

445
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:05,268
You got to get
some clay in your hand.

446
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,337
If I don't see some clay
on this face,

447
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,339
I'm gon' bust some humps.

448
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:10,540
We got to get something
on that positive now.

449
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:11,875
You got-- You grabbed it
for a reason.

450
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,986
Time's up, everybody.

451
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,023
Adam and I are really behind
for such a big concept,

452
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:29,726
but it's definitely
something different

453
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,428
than anybody else is doing
in the room.

454
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:45,675
It's day two in the lab.
We got 9 1/2 hours.

455
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,379
We're gonna make the doll
look like she's withering away.

456
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:51,748
I'm trying to think of where
I want to put the cracks on her.

457
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,883
She's gonna have cracks,
but underneath all of that,

458
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:55,885
she's still
perfect and pristine.

459
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,054
To unify these pieces,
to get hers a little more

460
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:02,359
like yours, or make yours have
a little bit more going on.

461
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,526
Okay.

462
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:05,595
Our sound is so cool.

463
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,364
I started fabricating the cowl.

464
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,733
It needs to look
more bird-like,

465
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:14,004
so I used latex and paper towels
to create a shell,

466
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,473
and then put in all the quills.

467
00:21:16,507 --> 00:21:17,907
I'm getting very frustrated

468
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:21,077
because the cowl is taking
a lot longer than I expected.

469
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,182
I need to finish the chest,
and then fabricate

470
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:30,020
arms, legs, and hands,
and somehow get it done today.

471
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,054
I mean, is he wearing anything?

472
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:33,089
No.
It's full fabrication.

473
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,225
It looks like there's
a lot left to do on this,

474
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,760
and I'm not seeing
all the pieces

475
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:37,827
that I should be seeing.

476
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,262
I'll get it done.

477
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,332
I finish the sculpture
for the helmet,

478
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:45,468
so RJ helps me
with the vacuform piece.

479
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:46,903
Ooh, that's cool.

480
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:48,538
All right, guys, good luck.

481
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:49,539
- Uh.
- Got this.

482
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:50,540
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

483
00:21:50,574 --> 00:21:51,741
Good luck, guys.

484
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:54,744
Now I need to finish
the cowl and the face.

485
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:56,813
- What's going on with him?
- I don't know.

486
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,882
The clock's ticking,
and we're at the point where

487
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,884
we won't have time
to mold everything,

488
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:04,187
so I help Regina finish the face
so she can finish the cowl,

489
00:22:04,221 --> 00:22:06,623
and then, we finally get
into molding.

490
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:14,831
I've never done
this amount of molding

491
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,266
in this amount of time.

492
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,667
That's time, everybody.

493
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:30,680
Go, go, go, go, go.

494
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,148
It's application day.

495
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:34,651
We've got four hours in the lab
and one our at last looks.

496
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:36,152
Yeah, if you put reds
on first...

497
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:37,487
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and then you dry brush

498
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:38,588
the black over it, that'll be

499
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:40,056
- a good transition.
- All right.

500
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,725
Dude, this came out
pretty nice.

501
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,429
Oh, that's sweet.

502
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,198
Kelly and I want to give
our character a prop,

503
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:49,966
so I do a quick drawing

504
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,735
of the husband
and our character.

505
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,504
So we're gonna just take
some tea, stain it,

506
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:56,639
and it looks
like an old photograph.

507
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:02,011
I got another big cowl for you.

508
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,948
And you're just, like, kind of
looking-- like, looking down.

509
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:08,051
We're not gonna put this on
you until we get to last looks.

510
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:09,386
This is such a big costume,

511
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,720
we don't want to make
the model uncomfortable.

512
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:12,055
If you could put this on,

513
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,990
'cause I just need
to size up some pieces.

514
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:16,860
I have to basically
refit the whole suit itself

515
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:18,561
to make sure it fits
our model perfectly,

516
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,297
and then, Logan pre-paints
the face,

517
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:22,532
so we have a lot on our plate

518
00:23:22,566 --> 00:23:24,000
and no room for error
on this one.

519
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,791
_

520
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:26,692
_

521
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,110
We've got a lot to do.

522
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:37,914
Adam still has to make
arm pieces.

523
00:23:37,948 --> 00:23:41,184
Since Adam's gonna be
fabricating these arms,

524
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:42,919
I'm gonna be
the one that's applying,

525
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:47,557
and I'm not sure if we're gonna
be able to get it all done.

526
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,438
_

527
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,609
_

528
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:56,633
The most important thing
is getting those pieces down.

529
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:59,702
Once I get the face down,
Anthony comes over

530
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:03,973
and we sort of tag team
gluing down the chest piece.

531
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:06,276
I think we do have
a really cool concept.

532
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,111
I personally would love a win.

533
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,382
So while I'm applying
the bald cap and the face,

534
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,051
Stephanie is pre-painting
this cowl,

535
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:17,420
and anything that's not smooth,

536
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,122
we're gonna have to make
look like cracks.

537
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:22,325
The back piece
and the front piece

538
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:25,161
they haven't even put on yet.

539
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:26,830
They need to motor
on this stuff.

540
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:28,498
Are you almost good with that?

541
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:31,501
Yeah, we're at 1:53.
I'm just letting you know.

542
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:32,936
I'm wrapping up.

543
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,737
One thing about <i>Face Off</i> is that

544
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:37,273
you got to figure out
what shortcuts are gonna work

545
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:39,442
so that you can get these things
done in time.

546
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,312
Try and lay that one hard edge
right up against the other one,

547
00:24:42,346 --> 00:24:45,114
and then that way, you don't
have to hide two hard edges.

548
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,115
- Do too much.
- You know what I mean?

549
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,150
Yeah.

550
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:50,035
_

551
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:51,687
_ _

552
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,056
Jamie's applying this face,

553
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,757
and it's taking her
a little bit longer

554
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:58,261
because we have to overlap
the face onto the cowl

555
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:00,597
and then do
a full body paint job.

556
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:04,167
We just have so much to do
still, so I'm nervous.

557
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:10,039
It's 15 minutes, everybody.

558
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,683
This is a huge risk
because we need to put

559
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:23,453
everything on this model
in last looks.

560
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:24,687
That's time, everybody.

561
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:25,722
Whoo.

562
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:26,923
Everything is at stake,

563
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:28,358
because if anything goes wrong
at this point,

564
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:30,927
it's gonna completely ruin
everything.

565
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,979
It's last looks.
Kelly and I have one hour.

566
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:46,048
We got to get her contacts in,
we got to do her beauty makeup,

567
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,517
we have to gloss her down, and
then we have to dirty her up.

568
00:25:48,552 --> 00:25:49,552
Nice.

569
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:52,688
We've still got to glue down
the face.

570
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:54,790
We have to stretch
the prosthetic a little bit

571
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:56,192
in order to fit the cowl,

572
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:58,828
and it's kind of pulling
on our model's eyes,

573
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:00,062
so it's making me
a little worried.

574
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:03,366
_

575
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:04,867
_

576
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:06,068
Luckily, he's 6'4,

577
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:08,337
and the judges can't see
down into his mouth,

578
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,673
but it's not gonna be
the top look.

579
00:26:10,707 --> 00:26:12,074
I'm gonna have to get
more glue in there.

580
00:26:13,977 --> 00:26:15,578
Still got to paint
the helmet green.

581
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:16,679
Yeah, just do it.

582
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:18,314
This helmet that we have
has to match

583
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:19,582
all the other armor,

584
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:22,485
and I can't find
the color we need.

585
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,020
I find something close,

586
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:27,556
and I end up just spattering
color onto the helmet.

587
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:28,624
Ten minutes.

588
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,298
That's time, everybody.

589
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:41,871
There's a lot of missteps
that happened during last looks.

590
00:26:41,905 --> 00:26:45,541
Now, I'm super nervous.

591
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,588
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

592
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:02,091
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight,

593
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,393
but before we see
your creations,

594
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:08,097
let's say hello to our
illustrious series judges.

595
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:10,366
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

596
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,834
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening.

597
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:13,069
Good evening.

598
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:15,938
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

599
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:18,174
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey, Ve.

600
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,042
And creature and concept
designer, Neville Page.

601
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:21,544
- Hello.
- Hello.

602
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:22,645
And welcome back, Rayce.

603
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:23,980
Thank you.
It's good to be back.

604
00:27:24,014 --> 00:27:25,915
I'm excited to see
what they've come up with.

605
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,450
Well, guess what?

606
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:28,451
The wait's over.

607
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,152
- Yes!
- Yeah.

608
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:32,688
All right, guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

609
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:34,757
was to create a character
inspired

610
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:37,059
by one of the unique sounds
created

611
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:41,931
by Academy Award-nominated
sound designer Erik Aadahl.

612
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:44,066
So let's take a look
at your creations.

613
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:07,056
I feel like we really were able

614
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,657
to capture the sound
in our makeup.

615
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:11,127
I love it, and I'm proud of it.

616
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,980
He's really bigger than life,
but I'm kind of worried.

617
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:32,848
Did we do enough, makeup-wise?

618
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:35,384
At this point,
it's either go big or go home.

619
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:38,020
They made a full fucking suit?

620
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,655
Mm-hmm.

621
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:00,910
She rocks it.

622
00:29:00,944 --> 00:29:05,915
Oh, my gosh, Stephanie and I
are just on Cloud Nine.

623
00:29:28,872 --> 00:29:31,774
Our demon's looking
scary and badass,

624
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:33,542
and I'm so excited,

625
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:36,579
and I think our execution
is near perfect.

626
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,220
Activated.

627
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,259
Weapon system armed.

628
00:30:01,071 --> 00:30:03,606
I'm really disappointed
with the paint job.

629
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,443
It looks washed out
and kind of clownish.

630
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:09,578
I'm really scared
that I'm gonna be going home.

631
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,134
Jamie and I are feeling
really good.

632
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:33,435
It's an overall character,

633
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,905
and I feel like it
really matches our sound.

634
00:30:41,044 --> 00:30:43,179
All right, judges, why
don't you take a closer look?

635
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,720
You know, for having to do
so many heads,

636
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:54,690
they're pretty well rendered
in terms of sculpture.

637
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:56,759
I just don't understand
this jaw line,

638
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:59,128
and the way that it comes
down into the chin.

639
00:31:01,698 --> 00:31:04,166
Wow, they did
a lot on this guy.

640
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:05,568
It's too bad though that...

641
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,904
_

642
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,535
_

643
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,073
Turn all the way around for us.

644
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:14,771
_

645
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:15,840
_

646
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:17,479
I'm really worried
about the back

647
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,148
because a lot of that
didn't get done.

648
00:31:19,182 --> 00:31:20,983
It was just kind of thrown
together last minute.

649
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,419
I'm just hoping
nothing's falling off.

650
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,787
It's just a mess.

651
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,827
Tell us who made your favorite
sound-inspired creation

652
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,762
on Twitter, using #FaceOff.

653
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:37,918
Yeah, that's a waste of time.

654
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:39,286
It's just too much.

655
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,522
I'm just hoping
that nothing's coming apart

656
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:43,924
and they really like our idea.

657
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,859
It's busy,
but it's still kind of cool.

658
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:47,361
Thank you.

659
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:51,565
Look at her earrings,
they're little screws.

660
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:52,666
- Yeah.
- It's cute.

661
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,101
Look at that beautiful profile.

662
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:58,105
They did a great job retaining
the female facial form.

663
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:03,377
Open as wide as you can and
just see what that mouth does.

664
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:05,279
You know what?
That's not as bad as

665
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:06,280
- what I feared.
- Yeah, I didn't think

666
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:07,314
it was gonna move.

667
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:14,154
There's just nothing
around his lips.

668
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,389
It really doesn't blend.

669
00:32:15,423 --> 00:32:16,990
It's just the hole
for his mouth.

670
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,797
Can you turn around, Megan?

671
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:25,299
- Wow.
- Amazing.

672
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,168
Amazing profile.

673
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:29,303
Thank you.

674
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:36,710
Okay, the judges have
scored your creations,

675
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:38,579
so let's find out
what they thought.

676
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:42,249
Emily and Jamie...

677
00:32:42,283 --> 00:32:45,886
Logan and Rob...

678
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,188
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

679
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:49,189
and can head back
to the makeup room.

680
00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:57,564
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week,

681
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,732
and the judges
would like to find out

682
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:00,133
more about your work.

683
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:02,603
Stephanie and Kelly,
if you'd please step up.

684
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:13,146
Tell me how you used the sound
to inspire your design.

685
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:14,681
There's a clockmaker
and his wife,

686
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:16,350
and she ends up dying.

687
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:18,886
He can't live without her,
so he makes a doll

688
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,320
that looks just like his wife.

689
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:22,189
You could not have done
a better job

690
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:25,959
of integrating the sound cue.

691
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:29,363
And your story motivated
the decision, sculpturally,

692
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,031
to put some of these cracks
and things,

693
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:32,466
which created opportunity

694
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,735
to put those nice brown,
eroded colors in,

695
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:37,237
and that makes
all the difference in the world.

696
00:33:37,272 --> 00:33:38,872
Thank you.

697
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:41,341
I think you both did
an amazing job, and of course,

698
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,111
the little portrait of her
and her husband, adorable.

699
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:45,412
Who drew that portrait?

700
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:46,547
- That was me, yeah.
- You did?

701
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:48,015
Good job.

702
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:49,016
Thank you.

703
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,384
It's beautiful, graphically.

704
00:33:50,418 --> 00:33:52,386
Who sketched out
the overall idea?

705
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,321
I came up with--
instead of doing

706
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:56,823
a steampunky, grungy character,
I was like,

707
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:59,560
"Well, why don't we make it look
like a '40s, '50s housewife?"

708
00:33:59,594 --> 00:34:02,396
It really is rendered
and sculpted quite well.

709
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,897
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

710
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:06,934
Kelly and Stephanie,
please step back.

711
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,838
- Yes.
- Good job.

712
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:13,206
Adam and Regina.

713
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:21,214
Please tell me how
your sound influenced

714
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:22,683
the design of your character.

715
00:34:22,717 --> 00:34:25,018
We got a pretty direct
robotic sound,

716
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:27,788
and there was an animalistic,
techno sound in it,

717
00:34:27,822 --> 00:34:30,257
so we went half organic,
half mechanical with it.

718
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,559
And who is responsible
for what on this character?

719
00:34:32,594 --> 00:34:34,561
The idea came from Regina.

720
00:34:34,596 --> 00:34:36,897
I sculpted
the chest and the back.

721
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:39,967
And I sculpted the cowl,
the face, and the dome.

722
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:42,703
I don't feel that this is
a very successful makeup.

723
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,175
The face sculpt underneath
is very, very rough.

724
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:50,010
He almost looks like
an old man without teeth,

725
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:52,379
and his mouth
sucked up on itself.

726
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:55,015
The body pieces are a lot more
successful than the face,

727
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:57,050
which is what your center
of attention should be.

728
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:58,852
Okay.

729
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:00,554
- The visor you sculpted...
- Mm-hmm.

730
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:03,857
...is gorgeous,
but the face is an abomination,

731
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:05,192
and I know you're better
than that.

732
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:09,129
Adam and Regina,
please step back.

733
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:11,098
Thanks, man.

734
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,272
Julian and Ben, you're up.

735
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:25,112
Tell us about your character

736
00:35:25,146 --> 00:35:27,014
and how the sound
influenced its design.

737
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:30,283
The heavy breathing
really stood out as demonic,

738
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:33,220
and so we went for a demon
that kills

739
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:35,222
anything and everything,
and then rips their face off,

740
00:35:35,256 --> 00:35:36,690
and en wears it himself.

741
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:38,392
Face off demon.

742
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:41,028
I did the cowl,
and then Julian did the face.

743
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,396
I think you hit it
out of the park.

744
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,298
I think the sculpting
is done really well.

745
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,401
The proportions
are done really well.

746
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:49,903
I love the changes,
graphically,

747
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:52,873
from black to red
to the pale face.

748
00:35:52,907 --> 00:35:54,441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

749
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:57,344
Getting that nice,
light tone in the face

750
00:35:57,378 --> 00:35:59,279
and then fading
into the darker colors

751
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:01,314
just presents
extraordinarily well.

752
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:02,983
- Thank you.
- He's very scary,

753
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:04,685
and I think you did
a great job this week.

754
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,886
Thank you.

755
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,355
Thank you, guys.
You can please step back.

756
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:10,390
Thank you.

757
00:36:12,527 --> 00:36:15,028
Darla and Anthony,
please step forward.

758
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:23,236
Tell me how your sound
inspired your design tonight.

759
00:36:23,271 --> 00:36:25,439
We noticed that it was
a very ghostly sound

760
00:36:25,473 --> 00:36:26,907
that had
a lot of different voices,

761
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,608
so we created Satan's servant,

762
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:31,545
who absorbs souls
and drags them down into Hell.

763
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:35,549
I primarily sculpted the face,
and Anthony did the chest.

764
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,751
It feels a bit directionless,
I'm afraid.

765
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:40,987
The paint job-- it feels like
you didn't leave yourself

766
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:42,255
enough time to color it,

767
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,425
and the dark tones
in the lower half of his face

768
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,728
muddle his head into his chest.

769
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,730
From here, it looks like
he as whiskers,

770
00:36:49,764 --> 00:36:51,932
and the facial structure

771
00:36:51,966 --> 00:36:55,235
is much too big for the size
of his face and his body.

772
00:36:56,571 --> 00:36:58,839
You're trying to animate
this chest

773
00:36:58,873 --> 00:37:01,641
in a way that doesn't work
as a practical makeup,

774
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,711
so it feels silly as a result.

775
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:05,879
All right, thank you very much.

776
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:07,080
Please step back.

777
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:14,888
All right,
I'd like to offer our coaches

778
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:17,524
the opportunity to speak
on behalf of their team members

779
00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:19,426
before the judges
make their decisions.

780
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,395
I feel like I need
to speak up for Darla.

781
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,332
She has done amazing top looks,

782
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:27,000
and I would love to see
more of her work,

783
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:29,569
and I hope we get to.

784
00:37:29,604 --> 00:37:31,938
Regina, she's had
some really successful makeups

785
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:33,273
up to this point, and I think

786
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:34,708
the sculpture did get
away from you a little bit,

787
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:35,976
but I know you can sculpt,

788
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,278
so I think it was just
kind of a bad day.

789
00:37:38,312 --> 00:37:40,447
Something I thought was
really clever

790
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:43,517
on Anthony's part was to take
the silicon face casts

791
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:46,586
of the actors and press
the wet clay into their faces

792
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:48,088
and use those
in the chest piece.

793
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:49,356
Yeah.
Innovative thought,

794
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,390
I think it's really important.

795
00:37:50,424 --> 00:37:52,092
All right, thank you, guys.

796
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:53,527
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

797
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,462
while the judges deliberate.

798
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,667
Alright, judges, let's start

799
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:02,636
with your favorite looks
tonight.

800
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,404
How about Stephanie and Kelly?

801
00:38:04,438 --> 00:38:06,006
Oh, I love that makeup.

802
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,542
Really nice touches, right down
to their little earrings.

803
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:10,677
Stephanie drew
that family picture

804
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:12,179
that she was carrying
around with her.

805
00:38:12,213 --> 00:38:14,381
That's a detail that you often
don't have time to do

806
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,683
and have it actually look
as competent as it did.

807
00:38:16,717 --> 00:38:19,686
All right, should we talk
about Ben and Julian?

808
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,823
I think it was
so well executed.

809
00:38:22,857 --> 00:38:24,791
They made really great use
of the model as well.

810
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:27,127
They didn't have to take
a whole, big, phony chest piece.

811
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:29,296
They just sculpted it down
as far as they had to.

812
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,264
I think this is the second
time we've also seen

813
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:33,767
this idea of a face
going onto a cowl,

814
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:35,802
and it's almost a separate
element within the design,

815
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:37,971
which I like.
It's a quality makeup.

816
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:39,606
All right,
let's move on to the makeups

817
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,808
that didn't quite work
for you guys.

818
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:43,043
Regina and Adam.

819
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:45,278
I liked the cowl,
the chest, and the back,

820
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:46,880
and the face was
horribly painted,

821
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:48,348
and it was horribly sculpted.

822
00:38:48,382 --> 00:38:50,550
He went into this challenge
knowing that he had immunity,

823
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:52,619
but the one thing
that does work

824
00:38:52,653 --> 00:38:54,855
are the elements
that he contributed.

825
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:57,090
She needed to make the decision

826
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:59,326
of bailing on that makeup

827
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,295
and showcasing what she did
a gorgeous job on,

828
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,397
and that is this visor.

829
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:06,733
All right, let's move on
to Anthony and Darla.

830
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:10,770
What a confused concept.
That face was bad.

831
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:13,106
There was no sense
of understanding of anatomy.

832
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,741
Yeah, I don't know
what she was thinking of

833
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:16,810
when she sculpted that brow,
because it really did look

834
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:18,612
like big, giant, bushy
eyebrows.

835
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:21,848
The bottom of the face merges
into the top of the chest

836
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:24,384
and it makes it worse,
not better.

837
00:39:24,418 --> 00:39:26,152
I'm want to give higher marks,
though, for Anthony

838
00:39:26,187 --> 00:39:28,355
in using clay presses

839
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:30,357
- as the faces on the body.
- Yeah.

840
00:39:30,391 --> 00:39:31,691
And I'm glad RJ
brought that up,

841
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:34,194
because that was
a smart process.

842
00:39:34,228 --> 00:39:36,529
All right, judges,
is everything settled, then?

843
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:37,530
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah.

844
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:38,531
- It is.
- All right,

845
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,467
let's bring them back out.

846
00:39:48,843 --> 00:39:51,945
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

847
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:55,081
Stephanie and Kelly,
your crystal-clear concept

848
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:57,284
paid off big time
with a unique character

849
00:39:57,318 --> 00:39:59,703
that paired brilliantly
with your sound.

850
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:04,319
Julian and Ben. The precise
forms and quality sculpting

851
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:05,480
really made him shine.

852
00:40:05,647 --> 00:40:06,793
So which team came out on top?

853
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:08,743
The top team tonight is...

854
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:14,451
So which team came out on top?

855
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:20,024
The top team tonight is...

856
00:40:20,058 --> 00:40:21,258
Stephanie and Kelly.

857
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:26,964
Yes.

858
00:40:26,998 --> 00:40:28,599
Your character was
the best tonight

859
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:31,068
in terms of matching up
to the sound effect.

860
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:32,069
- Well done.
- Thank you.

861
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,170
Thank you so much.

862
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:35,639
Stephanie and Kelly,
congratulations,

863
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:38,142
but as you know,
we can only have one winner.

864
00:40:38,176 --> 00:40:39,343
Glenn?

865
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:41,345
Tonight's winner is...

866
00:40:41,379 --> 00:40:42,913
Stephanie.

867
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,252
You were more responsible
for the concept,

868
00:40:48,286 --> 00:40:50,521
which is exactly what
sealed the deal here tonight.

869
00:40:50,555 --> 00:40:53,357
It feels so awesome,
winning a spotlight challenge.

870
00:40:53,391 --> 00:40:55,659
It, like, rejuvenates
my confidence in myself.

871
00:40:55,694 --> 00:40:57,428
Stephanie, congratulations.

872
00:40:57,462 --> 00:41:01,432
You, Kelly, Julian,
and Ben are all safe,

873
00:41:01,466 --> 00:41:03,734
and Adam,
since you have immunity,

874
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:05,302
you are also safe, and can head

875
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,605
back to the makeup room
along with the coaches.

876
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:16,847
All right, guys, the rest of you
are on the bottom this week,

877
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:19,183
and one of you
will be going home.

878
00:41:19,217 --> 00:41:20,417
If you'd please step forward.

879
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,628
Glenn, tell us about tonight's
bottom looks.

880
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:33,931
Regina, you and Adam
actually had a cool concept,

881
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:36,333
but a lot of your
sculptural choices

882
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,435
resulted
in a confused character.

883
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,473
Darla and Anthony,
the face and the body

884
00:41:42,507 --> 00:41:46,243
ended up really disconnected
in both shape and color palette.

885
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:47,845
So who is going home tonight?

886
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:51,882
The person going home
tonight is...

887
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,754
Regina.

888
00:41:56,788 --> 00:41:59,623
We know that you're
a talented makeup artist,

889
00:41:59,658 --> 00:42:00,991
but we just couldn't get past

890
00:42:01,026 --> 00:42:02,793
the poor face sculpture
this week.

891
00:42:02,827 --> 00:42:06,497
Regina, I am so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

892
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,732
That means Darla and Anthony,

893
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,869
you're safe this week and can
head back to the makeup room.

894
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:23,909
Regina, you have
so much more to offer,

895
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:26,846
and I'm truly looking forward
to seeing it in a professional world.

896
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,049
Thank you.

897
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:30,932
Regina, it's been really great
having you here with us.

898
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,999
But if you please head
backstage and pack-up your kit.

899
00:42:34,386 --> 00:42:36,384
- Good luck.
- Good luck, Regina.

900
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:40,252
I think the hardest part
is knowing how you do better.

901
00:42:42,912 --> 00:42:45,514
I'm really happy that
I got to this point.

902
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:46,815
I really, really am.

903
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,598
This is a great job, okay?

904
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:51,438
I found my voice,
I found my heart,

905
00:42:52,129 --> 00:42:54,081
I found what I love to do,

906
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:56,931
and I found myself again.
