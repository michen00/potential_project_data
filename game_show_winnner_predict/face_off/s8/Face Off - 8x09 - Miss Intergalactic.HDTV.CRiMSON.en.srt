1
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,408
I am absolutely thrilled.

2
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:04,709
It's very problematic.

3
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:06,545
On a scale of one to
ten in the creepiness,

4
00:00:06,579 --> 00:00:07,546
he is a 15 1/2.

5
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,880
Thank you.

6
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:10,515
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,919
Ben's futuristic villain
brought him his second win.

8
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,720
But Jamie was eliminated,

9
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:19,391
leaving Team Anthony
with just two artists.

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,262
Now eight artists remain,
and tonight,

11
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:27,432
they strive to win two
incredibly colorful challenges.

12
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,735
Please give a warm welcome
to Gabriela Isler.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,537
This is the best challenge.

14
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:33,905
Oh, what?

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,508
It's the crappiest situation
you can be in right now.

16
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,728
_

17
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:42,080
The forms are just stunning.

18
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,482
In the end, only one

19
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:46,118
will win a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

20
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:48,854
to one of their 85
international locations,

21
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:51,790
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

22
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:54,059
and $100,000.

23
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:57,762
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

26
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:38,862
_

27
00:01:39,872 --> 00:01:41,373
You'll be fine
in the next challenge.

28
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:43,241
Yeah, I'll just--
I'll bounce back this time.

29
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:45,978
It was just not good for me
last challenge.

30
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:48,613
I don't want to be on the bottom
continuously.

31
00:01:48,648 --> 00:01:51,049
I want to show the judges
that I have cool ideas

32
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:53,218
and the technical skills
to do it.

33
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:54,753
You'll be fine.

34
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,288
I'm thrilled
I didn't get sent home,

35
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:59,291
'cause now I can redeem myself
with a better makeup this time.

36
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,760
This competition
is getting way harder now,

37
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:04,262
so I got to keep on trucking
if I want to win.

38
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:15,674
- This is so pretty.
- Dolphins.

39
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,808
We're in Long Beach.

40
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:18,977
The sand's nice,
and we see dolphins,

41
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:20,946
but I have no idea
what we're doing.

42
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,981
I hope we don't have
to run in the sand.

43
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,250
We walk up to McKenzie,
and she's standing

44
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:27,285
near a bunch of models.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,620
What's next to them?

46
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:30,422
And there's
tables set up with bowls,

47
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:31,890
but I can't see what's in them.

48
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:34,192
I don't see any makeup kits.

49
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:37,029
I'm not entirely sure
what's happening.

50
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,030
All right.

51
00:02:38,064 --> 00:02:39,331
Hey, everybody.

52
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:40,399
Hello.

53
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,666
Today's Foundation Challenge

54
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,035
is gonna be a blast.

55
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,271
It's inspired by an ancient
Hindu religious festival

56
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,707
celebrated all over the world

57
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:51,076
as winter ends
and spring emerges

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,445
with its abundance
of beautiful colors,

59
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,280
the Holi Festival.

60
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:56,448
Yes!

61
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:57,549
I immediately know
what we're doing.

62
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,984
This is gonna be so cool.

63
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:02,454
Commonly referred to
as the Festival of Colors,

64
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:04,489
people gather with friends
in city streets,

65
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:05,624
religious temples,

66
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:07,893
and even beaches like this
to celebrate

67
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:10,362
by hurling colored Holi powder
at each other

68
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:12,864
in a chaotic spectacle of color.

69
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:16,435
So with immunity
on the line today...

70
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,636
Oh, my goodness.

71
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,004
...your Foundation Challenge

72
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:22,441
is to create your own colorful
and beautiful makeup

73
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,243
that represents spring.

74
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:28,947
However, you will not have
your makeup kits, brushes,

75
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:32,417
or fabrication materials
for this challenge.

76
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:35,487
You can only use your hands.

77
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:37,389
There's only eight artists left,

78
00:03:37,423 --> 00:03:39,424
so immunity
is extremely important,

79
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,094
but now we're not even gonna
get to use any brushes.

80
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,162
Talk about holy shit.

81
00:03:44,197 --> 00:03:45,297
Now, the workstations

82
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,933
each have seven different colors
of Holi powder,

83
00:03:47,967 --> 00:03:50,735
and you'll have two hours
for this challenge.

84
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,605
On my go, I want you to select
a model and get started.

85
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,606
You guys ready?

86
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,607
Oh, God.

87
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:56,608
Go!

88
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:57,709
McKenzie says go,

89
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:59,111
and I feel like
I'm running for my life.

90
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:00,612
Hi.

91
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:02,314
What's up, dude?

92
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,649
This is for not winning
the last challenge.

93
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:08,353
This is more difficult
than I'd expected.

94
00:04:08,387 --> 00:04:10,188
The powder keeps blowing
in the wind

95
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:12,457
and back into our faces.

96
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:14,192
But it's sticking,
and it's fun.

97
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,331
I'm going for an Indian goddess.

98
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:21,566
I want to represent
the warmth inside her

99
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,702
that's pushing out
all of this cold.

100
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:27,439
So I'm using warms in the middle
and fading it out to purples,

101
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:29,074
and I think it makes her
like a goddess.

102
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,876
She's looking cool.

103
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,178
The phoenix symbolizes
rising from the ashes,

104
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:35,180
the dead of winter
coming into spring.

105
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:37,816
So he's gonna be a phoenix.

106
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,651
I'm gonna do
a henna pattern to it.

107
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,219
Ooh, that's so pretty.

108
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:42,354
I wipe my finger,

109
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:44,956
and I start cleaning the pathway
for my pattern,

110
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:46,925
and it's working beautifully.

111
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,060
Is this wet?
I see what you're doing.

112
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:51,997
I'm going for a sunset
on a beach...

113
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,466
That's the sun.

114
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,434
...with a palm tree
and a river.

115
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:58,303
These are all spring things
to me.

116
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:00,972
I'm trying to make leaves.

117
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,042
I don't necessarily have, like,

118
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:05,677
a specific character concept,

119
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:07,746
but I'm pulling
color inspiration

120
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,381
from sunsets and sunrises.

121
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:11,116
So I'm trying
to do some nice blending,

122
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,386
and then I dip Matt's fingers
in the orange powder

123
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,356
to create this feeling
of energy coming into the world.

124
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,091
That's kind of cool.

125
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:23,361
I want to show the battle
between winter and spring,

126
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,530
so I'm doing a lot
of bright spring colors

127
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,566
bleeding into the blues
and purples

128
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,467
to convey a story through colors

129
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:31,336
instead of, like,
a literal design.

130
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,737
Sweet.

131
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:34,940
I have no concept at all.

132
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:36,608
I'm just going with
the colors of spring

133
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:38,877
and letting it
go abstract and crazy.

134
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:41,379
I'm having so much fun
with this challenge.

135
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:42,480
Ugh!

136
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,717
Never seen Ben look so happy.

137
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,519
He always looks angry,
except for now.

138
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:50,722
I'm putting angel wings
on your back.

139
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:53,558
I'm thinking that maybe she's
the angel of spring,

140
00:05:53,593 --> 00:05:55,093
and she floats around,

141
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:57,095
and she's just
this heavenly being.

142
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,464
Bam.

143
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:00,966
15 minutes, guys.

144
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:11,943
Time's up.
Hands and powder down.

145
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:13,645
All right.

146
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,980
Now, I'm sure you're wondering

147
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:17,882
who's gonna judge
this challenge.

148
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:20,185
Well, I have a big surprise
for you.

149
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,321
Your coaches will be the ones
judging this challenge

150
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:25,156
and awarding
one of you immunity.

151
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,458
Holy crap.

152
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:27,993
Now, I'm gonna separate
you guys from your makeup,

153
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:29,561
so it's gonna be a blind pick

154
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,963
based solely on the work
in front of them.

155
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:34,165
So why don't you guys
go ahead and step to the side,

156
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,834
and I'll bring in the coaches.

157
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:40,905
Welcome, coaches.

158
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,040
- Hello.
- Hi, McKenzie.

159
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:43,275
Ready to check out
some makeups?

160
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:44,342
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

161
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:51,383
I like the negative space,
how they put on all the color

162
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,952
and they took away
for the details.

163
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:57,355
Cool thing I really like,
whoever did this

164
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,190
put down their base tones
and came with, like,

165
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:01,660
a wet finger
to create all the streaking.

166
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:03,561
Yet there's no green
or anything in it.

167
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:08,800
They really played up the whole
Hindu, Indian feel of it.

168
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:10,068
Love the lotus flower.

169
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:13,872
The fingers
are very, very bright,

170
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:16,274
as if they're radiating
some sort of energy.

171
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,577
I think the face
is absolutely beautiful.

172
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:21,546
You know, the contours
are coming through.

173
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,016
Because they brought in

174
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:26,551
the orange and the yellows
through here

175
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:28,520
actually make it look
like there's a light.

176
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:30,088
It's like--
it's really cool.

177
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:34,426
The gradation between
the seasonal change as well.

178
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:39,331
Now, there's nice attention
to where the color is

179
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,366
and keeping it light
in the center of the body.

180
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,367
- I like it.
- Awesome.

181
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:43,935
Thank you very much.

182
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:47,038
All right, guys, after
we inspected your makeups,

183
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:49,407
the coaches
did choose a favorite.

184
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:51,643
They still don't know
whose creation it is,

185
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:53,712
but I do.

186
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:56,247
The winner of today's
Foundation Challenge

187
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:58,316
and the prize of immunity is...

188
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:02,487
Stephanie.

189
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,993
Congratulations.
How's that feel?

190
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:11,329
That feels awesome.
Yes!

191
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,098
I really like the treatment
of the blue

192
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:14,999
in transition with the orange.

193
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,936
It felt like bounce light
from a two-dimensional painting.

194
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,104
Thanks.

195
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:21,005
It's a huge relief
to have immunity.

196
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,074
Now, no matter what,
I'm gonna be in the next round.

197
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,242
All right, guys,

198
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:25,710
head back to the house
and get cleaned up.

199
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:27,879
I'll see you tomorrow for
your next Spotlight Challenge.

200
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:28,947
See you.

201
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:42,794
This is so weird.

202
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:44,963
We're at the stage,
and it's freaking me out

203
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:47,098
because this
is where people go home,

204
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,868
and I see these dress forms
onstage.

205
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:51,336
This is bizarre.

206
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,638
Hey, guys.

207
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,073
- Hey.
- Hello.

208
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:57,208
Welcome to the reveal stage.

209
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:58,877
I know, normally,
this is a place

210
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:00,712
reserved for elimination,
but don't worry.

211
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:03,248
None of you
are going home today.

212
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,950
Instead, I've bought you here
to talk about your next

213
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:07,752
Spotlight Challenge.

214
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:11,055
While aliens are often portrayed
as hideous creatures,

215
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,324
films like<i> Avatar</i> and<i> Species</i>

216
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:16,594
have embraced the sexy side
of extraterrestrials,

217
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,897
transforming them
from bug-eyed monsters

218
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,899
into out-of-this-world beauties.

219
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:23,301
So this week's
Spotlight Challenge

220
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:27,205
is to create
your very own beautiful alien.

221
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,307
Okay.

222
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,708
Cool.

223
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:34,012
I know beauty makeup very well,
so I feel pretty good with this.

224
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:36,314
I'd like to introduce you
to a very special guest

225
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:38,850
who definitely knows
a thing or two about beauty.

226
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,819
She's a fashion model
and beauty queen

227
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,321
who became Miss Venezuela
in 2012

228
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:47,158
and was then crowned
Miss Universe in 2013.

229
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:50,695
Please give a warm welcome
to Gabriela Isler.

230
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,468
It's so cool to
have Miss Universe here

231
00:09:56,502 --> 00:09:58,736
because she knows
all about beauty,

232
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,238
so I think this challenge
is gonna be fun.

233
00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:01,239
Hello.

234
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:02,373
Hello.
Thank you for having me.

235
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:03,374
It's an honor and a pleasure.

236
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,576
I'm so excited.

237
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,578
Now, you've won
multiple crowns in your career,

238
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,146
so what advice
can you give these guys

239
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,949
to make sure that their aliens
are truly beautiful?

240
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:13,518
Beauty pageant
is not just about beauty.

241
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:16,020
It's the way that you
present yourself.

242
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,288
Have some fun.

243
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:19,424
Put your friendly attitude
in every single makeup

244
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,692
and enjoy.

245
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:22,794
Fantastic advice.
Thank you.

246
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:25,964
All right, guys,
in the Miss Universe Pageant,

247
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:30,835
all of its participants hail
from the same planet, Earth.

248
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,906
This week, we're going
to broaden that competition.

249
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,508
If this is what I think it is,

250
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:39,511
this could be the best challenge
<i>Face Off</i> ever.

251
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:47,285
All right, guys,
in the Miss Universe pageant,

252
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:51,456
all of its participants hail
from the same planet, Earth.

253
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,326
So this week, we're going
to broaden that competition.

254
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:03,000
That's right, your aliens
will be taking part

255
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:06,404
in our very own
Miss Intergalactic Pageant,

256
00:11:06,438 --> 00:11:07,739
and they will strut their stuff

257
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,307
right here in front
of the judges

258
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:11,309
with the hopes
of being crowned the winner.

259
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:12,710
I'm so excited.

260
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:13,911
It's a pageant.

261
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:15,813
This is the best challenge.

262
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:17,749
I just love fun characters.

263
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:20,151
Now, on each
of these dress forms

264
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:23,588
is a sash with the name
of a different galaxy

265
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:26,491
that you will use as inspiration
for your aliens.

266
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:28,192
When Gabriela calls your name,

267
00:11:28,227 --> 00:11:31,496
I want you to come up
and select a sash.

268
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,465
Okay, he looks very excited,
so, Ben,

269
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,334
you have to pick first.

270
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:38,236
Miss Andromeda Galaxy.

271
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,738
- Emily.
- Miss Pinwheel Galaxy.

272
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:42,907
- Logan.
- Miss Comet Galaxy.

273
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,876
- Julian.
- Miss Whirlpool Galaxy.

274
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,378
- Stephanie.
- Miss Tadpole Galaxy.

275
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,947
- Darla.
- Miss Sculptor Galaxy.

276
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:51,983
- Adam.
- Miss Cigar Galaxy.

277
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:54,252
Kelly, you're the one
with the hat,

278
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:55,787
so take your sombrero sash.

279
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:58,556
Miss Sombrero Galaxy.

280
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,560
All right, guys,
this week's winning character

281
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:06,364
will not only be crowned
Miss Intergalactic

282
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:09,500
but will also be featured
in a full-page spread

283
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,302
in<i> Entertainment Weekly.</i>

284
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:13,237
- Cool.
- What?

285
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:16,240
To have a full-page spread
in<i> Entertainment Weekly</i>

286
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,942
would be absolutely awesome.

287
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:21,279
It really sells the other side
of the makeup industry

288
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,080
other than just making monsters.

289
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:25,249
Gabriela, thank you so much
for joining us today.

290
00:12:25,284 --> 00:12:27,552
Thank you for having me,
and you guys enjoy.

291
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:29,587
All right, it's time to start
working on your designs.

292
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,489
Your coaches will join you soon
at the lab

293
00:12:31,523 --> 00:12:32,623
to see how you're faring.

294
00:12:32,658 --> 00:12:33,624
Good luck, guys.

295
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:34,659
- Bye.
- Bye.

296
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:45,002
Pageants incorporate hair,
something I love;

297
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:47,271
sass, I'm kind of sassy;

298
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:48,806
and, I mean, come on,

299
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:51,509
it's an alien beauty pageant.

300
00:12:51,543 --> 00:12:54,545
Pinwheel Galaxy
is full of young stars,

301
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,614
and I conceptualize a character

302
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:59,417
that has an asymmetrical style
dress,

303
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:01,252
and I want to incorporate
a big wig

304
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:04,322
with a pinwheel with rhinestones
and glitter on it.

305
00:13:04,356 --> 00:13:06,157
This challenge, I need to win.

306
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:07,925
I just want to win it so bad.

307
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:12,430
The Comet Galaxy
is essentially being torn apart

308
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:13,965
by a bunch of smaller galaxies,

309
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:18,002
and my concept is to go from
an organized, beautiful face

310
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:21,672
to a chaotic, far less beautiful
profile in the back.

311
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:23,608
This one's definitely
taking me out of my comfort zone

312
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:25,409
'cause it's a beauty challenge,

313
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:27,345
but it's an opportunity
to explore some things

314
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,546
that I haven't done before.

315
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:35,353
My alien
is from the Whirlpool Galaxy.

316
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,555
She's going to have
a very human face,

317
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:40,424
and I'm thinking of some kind
of elongated head.

318
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,692
I'm gonna go
with a green color scheme

319
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,428
to incorporate the colors
of the actual galaxy.

320
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:46,530
She's won Miss Whirlpool Galaxy,

321
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:49,333
so I don't see why she
can't win Miss Intergalactic.

322
00:13:51,103 --> 00:13:52,870
I picked the Tadpole Galaxy.

323
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,272
It looks like a tadpole

324
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:56,841
with hot, yellowy orange
in the center.

325
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,311
So I want my alien to have
a really long tadpole tail.

326
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:01,679
The face will be the focal point

327
00:14:01,713 --> 00:14:03,814
and then just more muted
in the back.

328
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:05,049
I'm loving my immunity.

329
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,918
I can do basically
whatever I want,

330
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,020
but I don't want
to just be safe.

331
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,821
I want to have, like,
a top look at least.

332
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:16,527
Since the Sombrero Galaxy

333
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,463
is the brightest galaxy
that we can see.

334
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:20,898
I'm thinking the outside

335
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:23,668
is just so inhabitable
that she's this beauty

336
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,603
that hides within caves.

337
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:28,806
I really want to take away
all the human aspect,

338
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,876
so I want to make
huge vacuform eyes.

339
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,977
Very cave-dwelling,

340
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:35,279
very amphibious kind of a feel.

341
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:39,083
All right, guys,
let's get back to the lab.

342
00:14:51,296 --> 00:14:53,264
We get back to the lab,
and we pick our models,

343
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:56,167
and we have 5 1/2 hours
to work today.

344
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:59,704
The Sculptor Galaxy
is a spiral-shaped galaxy,

345
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:02,873
so I decide to take
the spiral shape

346
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,642
and kind of put it
on the back of the head

347
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:09,246
to create sort of an
avant-garde-looking hairstyle.

348
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,716
I'm not entirely sure
if it's gonna work or not,

349
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,551
but I decide
to just quickly block it out

350
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:14,585
and see how it looks.

351
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:20,858
- Hey.
- Good morning.

352
00:15:20,892 --> 00:15:22,927
So I have the Cigar Galaxy.

353
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:25,062
It's pretty much a galaxy
with a lot of stars...

354
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:26,097
Okay.

355
00:15:26,131 --> 00:15:28,666
So I immediately
attributed that to heat.

356
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,136
My concept for Miss Cigar Galaxy
is that she, over time,

357
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,739
has developed this crest
on her head that gives it

358
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:37,174
this sort of beautiful form,
but at the same time,

359
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,111
I want that old Hollywood
elegance about her.

360
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:41,278
I just want to give the judges

361
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:42,713
something
that they've never seen before.

362
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:47,618
I think you're on to something
interesting with some of this.

363
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:50,354
The Andromeda Galaxy is
the largest galaxy in our sky.

364
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:52,790
I'm kind of playing
with shapes and drawings.

365
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:55,059
It just has to be
striking and beautiful.

366
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:58,329
I've really got this cool design
of this three-winged head

367
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:00,564
with these diamond
three-pointed eyes.

368
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,199
I'm really
stepping outside the box,

369
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:04,368
but I'm actually
feeling pretty good about this.

370
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:11,108
So you're putting
multiple eyes on it?

371
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:12,109
- Yeah.
- Be careful with--

372
00:16:12,144 --> 00:16:13,444
Any time you add
the multiple eyes,

373
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:14,845
it's always a risk.

374
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,147
I'm looking at the character,

375
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:19,216
and I realize
adding the extra eyes

376
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:20,785
could get too arachnid.

377
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:23,320
This is where I start
to get lost.

378
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:24,388
You all right?

379
00:16:25,024 --> 00:16:26,724
_

380
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:29,126
By now, I'm usually sculpting,

381
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:33,097
and now I feel like my concept
is not working.

382
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:34,698
_

383
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm super lost.

384
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:38,602
What am I gonna do?

385
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:47,603
It's day one of our
Miss Intergalactic Challenge,

386
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:50,272
and for the first time,
I feel lost.

387
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:52,842
I'm really stuck on my
original idea about the eyes.

388
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,443
Think of something
where you cannot rely

389
00:16:54,478 --> 00:16:55,744
too much on the eyes.

390
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,514
Anthony and I decide
to remove the multiple-eye idea,

391
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:01,984
and now she has tentacles
that wrap up into a hairdo.

392
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:04,186
It makes so much more sense,

393
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:07,022
and it's going to be
an awesome character.

394
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:13,529
I'm using that shape

395
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:16,765
to create the head
to give it that asymmetry.

396
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,002
Something symmetrical
is universally attractive.

397
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,604
Laura brings up
a really good point,

398
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,672
that when you're trying
to do something beautiful,

399
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:25,541
asymmetry can really
throw it off.

400
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,743
And if I take the spiral shape

401
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,211
that I had put on the back
of the head

402
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:31,580
and just move it around
to the side of the head,

403
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:34,283
I can essentially create
a more symmetrical,

404
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:35,484
beautiful design.

405
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,390
That's time, everybody.

406
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,060
Even though it took
me a little bit more time,

407
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:48,998
I really like this idea because
it keeps my original concept

408
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:52,168
but turns it into
a much more beautiful character.

409
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:01,544
- Go.
- Grr. Grr. Grr.

410
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:04,580
It's day two in the lab.
We have 9 1/2 hours to work.

411
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:07,650
I'm excited to get into some
detail on the face and cowl.

412
00:18:07,684 --> 00:18:09,185
I've got to get it done.

413
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:12,855
The face is essentially going
from organization to chaos,

414
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,290
but it's not looking right.

415
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,392
I want to make it more subtle
in its transition,

416
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,460
so it's speed sculpting time.

417
00:18:22,365 --> 00:18:24,233
- Emily.
- What?

418
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:25,367
Huuuuh!

419
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:26,635
Oh! Oh, no.

420
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,838
There's only room for one,
Pinwheel Galaxy.

421
00:18:29,873 --> 00:18:32,074
The battle is on
for Miss Intergalactic.

422
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:33,475
Step it up, Kelly.

423
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,878
All I get for breakfast...
power squats.

424
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:37,313
Gosh.

425
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:40,583
Miss Universe said to have fun
and make a fun character,

426
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:42,451
so that's what we're doing.

427
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:46,388
I'm using foam tubing
and swirling it like a pinwheel,

428
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:50,359
and then I'm going to paint it
like a galaxy, add some glitter,

429
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:52,228
and make it fabulous.

430
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:55,731
I'm working on the cowl

431
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,367
and taking a lot of inspiration
from the tail end of the galaxy,

432
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:01,570
making sure the shapes
of the face flow into the cowl.

433
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,772
It looks like
the tail's attached.

434
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,207
Laura's giving me advice

435
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:07,843
on how to keep the flow
for the tail.

436
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:10,212
Gouge all of this out
and then round it.

437
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:11,213
It's looking good.

438
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:12,314
Yeah.

439
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:18,087
I think this is gonna be
a four-piece mold, man.

440
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,356
Usually the cowls
are a two-piece mold.

441
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,524
There's a front
and a back that come together.

442
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,693
I'm going for a four-piece mold.

443
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:28,797
I don't want to have to seam
across these soft blended edges,

444
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:31,233
and so having two core pieces

445
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:34,236
that are gonna pop out
in between these three forms

446
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,472
will really give me
a nice, sleek prosthetic

447
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,607
when it's all done.

448
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:40,042
Hey, one hour.

449
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,312
At the end of the
day, I'm picking out

450
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:46,215
some Kryolan beauty products
for tomorrow.

451
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:48,884
I know a lot
of these really nice pigments

452
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:51,487
will add that pearlescent sheen
that's gonna

453
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:54,556
make Miss Sombrero Galaxy pop
and look beautiful.

454
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,058
Oh, so many pretty colors.

455
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:02,631
That's time, everybody.

456
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,033
All right.

457
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,901
Leaving day two,
I'm a little worried.

458
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,870
I only have Kelly and Ben
remaining,

459
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,805
and I think Kelly's
might not be enough.

460
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,540
I think Ben's
could fit the challenge,

461
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:13,676
but it could be
a little too out there.

462
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,377
There's quite a few
more challenges

463
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:18,914
to get to that finale, so I'm
hoping that I get both there.

464
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,188
- Go.
- Good luck, guys.

465
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:27,589
It's application day.

466
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:29,091
I got four hours in the lab,

467
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,326
one hour at Last Looks.

468
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,760
Four-piece mold?

469
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:32,995
- Yeah.
- Holy shit.

470
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,830
Yeah, talk about a pain
in the ass.

471
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:37,132
My face has got beautiful
blend edges,

472
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,801
and I've got a couple
seam edges

473
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,369
that I need to work
on this cowl,

474
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:42,037
but I'm feeling really good
about it.

475
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:43,272
You're crazy.

476
00:20:43,306 --> 00:20:45,007
How did it come out?

477
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,709
You might have
to put a blender on it.

478
00:20:46,743 --> 00:20:48,410
Oh, what?

479
00:20:48,445 --> 00:20:52,548
There's a huge indentation
on one side of my cowl.

480
00:20:52,582 --> 00:20:53,682
This is a beauty pageant.

481
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,050
It needs to be symmetrical.

482
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:57,753
It's just
the crappiest situation

483
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:58,787
you can be in right now.

484
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,222
I'm gonna try the foam patch,
I think.

485
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:01,290
Mm-hmm.

486
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:04,259
It'll at least
fill it in somewhat.

487
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:07,096
Foam patch is when you mix
foam latex

488
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,165
and you apply it
to wherever you have problems,

489
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,768
and then you cure the foam
with a heat gun.

490
00:21:12,802 --> 00:21:15,838
The foam patch gets rid
of the crater and makes it seem

491
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:17,873
like that's what I meant to do
the whole time.

492
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,076
- Logan.
- Alyssa.

493
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,077
Good to meet you.

494
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:23,078
How are you?

495
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:24,480
I'm good.
How are you?

496
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:26,648
You're not gonna have a ton
of stuff on your face.

497
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:28,183
- That's crazy.
- Pretty nice, huh?

498
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:29,184
Great to hear.

499
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,552
I'm a little worried

500
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,154
because even though
I don't have a face to apply,

501
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:35,691
I have to apply the cowl,
two arm pieces,

502
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,426
two chest pieces,

503
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,561
and 12 individual scales
on her face,

504
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:40,863
so I have a lot to do.

505
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:48,303
As I'm gluing the face down,

506
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:51,306
I notice a crease
going from the nose

507
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:52,674
all the way down the lip.

508
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:53,942
The whole point
of this challenge

509
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:55,844
is to create something
very beautiful,

510
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,880
so I'm gonna have to be
really careful to make sure

511
00:21:57,914 --> 00:22:02,317
that I don't end up with
any other undesired creases.

512
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,686
I'm using Kryolan
Aquacolor Dayglow

513
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:06,688
as well as pink,
purple, and turquoise

514
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:09,091
to create an artificial skin.

515
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,893
So let me glitter you.

516
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:12,728
And then I glue glitter.

517
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:15,697
Ah, it's just so much glitter.

518
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:19,435
My model loves glitter,
so it's gonna be a perfect day.

519
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:21,870
This is making my heart happy.

520
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,105
One hour, everyone.

521
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:25,474
Great, I'm pretty behind.

522
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:27,743
We only have, like,
an hour left in lab,

523
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:30,112
and I need to get in to paint.

524
00:22:30,146 --> 00:22:32,381
These tentacles take
so much detail,

525
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,749
and they have to pop.

526
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:35,417
This is what's gonna
make or break me.

527
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:38,620
So definitely,
when you airbrush,

528
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:40,389
have to accentuate
her cheekbones.

529
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:43,892
I've never done beauty makeup,
so Laura gives me some advice

530
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,994
on where the eye shadow
should end,

531
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:47,796
the lipstick color.

532
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:49,164
You wouldn't think
that the hot light

533
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,200
is gonna make much
of a difference, but it does.

534
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,202
It's stuff that I'm not
very familiar with.

535
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:54,603
15 minutes, everybody.

536
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:01,143
Because this is a beauty
pageant, I need to get good

537
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:03,545
at doing beauty makeup
as fast as possible...

538
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,013
That's time, everybody.

539
00:23:05,048 --> 00:23:07,883
Or this challenge can be
the one that sends me home.

540
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:17,437
Let me see how I like this.

541
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:19,606
I have an hour left
for Last Looks.

542
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:21,808
I still have to paint her body

543
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:24,711
and figure out how I'm going
to blend in these tentacles.

544
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:27,314
This is going to take up
a lot of time.

545
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:29,182
Let me know
if I'm being too rough, okay?

546
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:30,684
I still have a ton of work
to do,

547
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:33,420
but I need to just focus
on doing the beauty makeup

548
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,088
as best as I can.

549
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,456
Got to get these eyes on you.

550
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:37,891
I'm scrambling.

551
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,360
This is an important piece,
so I need to focus on the eyes

552
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,596
and shy away
from the beauty makeup.

553
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,297
That's cool.

554
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,967
I have to attach the spikes
on the back of the cowl.

555
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,102
I'm trying to figure out
how to set this hot glue

556
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,504
and not wait for it to hold.

557
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:53,340
So I shoot the cold air
from the airbrush,

558
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,609
and the spikes are setting up,
and I'm like, "Oh, my God,

559
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,744
I just MacGyver'd this,
and it's working."

560
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:58,812
Ten minutes, everyone.

561
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:08,955
That's time, everyone.

562
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,990
Whew.

563
00:24:11,592 --> 00:24:15,228
I don't feel like this
is anything like I wanted.

564
00:24:15,263 --> 00:24:16,763
That ended up being a hot mess.

565
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,532
I just want to be safe.

566
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:31,144
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

567
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,746
Now, as you know,

568
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,449
one of you
will be going home tonight.

569
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,950
But before we see
your creations,

570
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:39,953
let's say hello
to our series judges.

571
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:42,956
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

572
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,891
- Good evening, guys.
- Good evening.

573
00:24:44,926 --> 00:24:47,427
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

574
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:49,196
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Ve.

575
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,398
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

576
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:52,866
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Neville.

577
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,302
And joining us tonight
to help choose the winner

578
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:58,004
of the full-page spread
in<i> Entertainment Weekly</i>

579
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,474
is senior writer
for<i> Entertainment Weekly</i>

580
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:02,242
Darren Franich.

581
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:05,545
Darren Franich has got his hand

582
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,981
on the pulse of Hollywood,
so even if I don't win,

583
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:09,750
I hope he's at least
impressed by the makeup.

584
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:11,918
Darren, thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

585
00:25:11,953 --> 00:25:13,386
Thank you very much
for having me.

586
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:15,355
So did you ever think you'd be
judging a beauty pageant?

587
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,923
It was one of my biggest dreams,
actually,

588
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,692
so I'm glad
it's finally coming true

589
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,260
in an appropriately strange way.

590
00:25:20,294 --> 00:25:23,296
Well, I guarantee you
this is gonna be a lot of fun.

591
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,399
All right, guys, this week,
your Spotlight Challenge

592
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:29,936
was to choose a galaxy
and create an alien beauty queen

593
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:34,775
to participate in our very own
Miss Intergalactic Pageant.

594
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:37,477
So let's take a look
at your creations.

595
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:43,416
Fresh from sector EW-1,

596
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:46,887
Miss Pinwheel Galaxy
enjoys space, beekeeping,

597
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:50,957
and is saving up to buy her own
passel of space possums.

598
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,793
She's also a strict vegetarian

599
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:55,195
and hopes to someday end
animal cruelty

600
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:56,997
throughout her galaxy.

601
00:25:57,031 --> 00:26:00,500
Say hello
to Miss Pinwheel Galaxy.

602
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:08,875
It's really nice to
see the overall character.

603
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,012
I'm so happy.
It looks so cool.

604
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:16,316
Miss Tadpole Galaxy
is from the planet M-13,

605
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,853
where her hobbies include
shopping, stardust surfing,

606
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,087
and dancing.

607
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,423
With a major
in celestial sciences,

608
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,792
she dreams of one day
leading a research team

609
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:28,461
to discover the far end
of the universe.

610
00:26:28,496 --> 00:26:31,498
Say hello
to Miss Tadpole Galaxy.

611
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:39,172
I'm really happy with her.

612
00:26:39,207 --> 00:26:41,441
She's just all kinds
of fun and happy

613
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,844
and really killing it
and looking like a beauty queen.

614
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,715
Miss Andromeda Galaxy

615
00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:52,352
loves long walks around Neptune
and eating at the Milky Way.

616
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:54,154
She hopes to one day meet a guy

617
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:56,990
who will give her a ring
as big as Saturn's.

618
00:26:57,024 --> 00:27:00,427
Say hello
to Miss Andromeda Galaxy.

619
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,768
I'm not sure if I went
in the right direction.

620
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:10,270
I really thought
outside the box.

621
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,439
I'm just hoping that the judges
are with me on this one.

622
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:16,910
All right, we
have Miss Cigar Galaxy.

623
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:20,614
She hopes to one day command
her own interstellar army

624
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:23,617
and achieve
intergalactic domination.

625
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:27,053
Her hobbies include devouring
her mates after fertilization

626
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:28,188
and knitting.

627
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:31,324
Please say hello
to Miss Cigar Galaxy.

628
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:39,065
I know I have a strong concept,

629
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,402
but I'm worried that I may not
do as well as I'd hope to do.

630
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,508
Miss Comet Galaxy
enjoys interstellar travel

631
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:52,245
and spends her time paragliding
through solar flares.

632
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,180
She dreams of clothing the needy

633
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,150
and increasing literacy
throughout her galaxy.

634
00:27:57,184 --> 00:28:00,587
Please say hello
to Miss Comet Galaxy.

635
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:07,961
I think she looks fantastic.

636
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:09,396
The only thing
that I am concerned about

637
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:13,400
is that the overall shape
of the face is a little bit off.

638
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,537
Miss Whirlpool Galaxy.

639
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:20,040
She enjoys surfing
through black holes,

640
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,709
Earth gazing,
and dancing in the moonlight.

641
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,445
She hopes to find
Mr. Affirmative one day

642
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,280
and start a colony together.

643
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:30,350
Say hello
to Miss Whirlpool Galaxy.

644
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,058
She definitely has this, like,

645
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,026
Marilyn Monroe alien vibe
going on,

646
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:42,929
so I think I might have
a good chance.

647
00:28:42,964 --> 00:28:45,999
All right, now
Miss Sombrero Galaxy.

648
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:47,834
She loves small animals

649
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:51,771
and hopes to one day
devour one of every species.

650
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:55,041
Her hobbies include diving
for gems, ex-husbands,

651
00:28:55,076 --> 00:28:57,077
and giving herself neck rubs.

652
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,313
Please lay hello
to Miss Sombrero Galaxy.

653
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,254
I didn't get to
finish the paint job,

654
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,991
but I think she looks beautiful.

655
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:16,629
Miss Sculptor Galaxy
grew up near a black hole.

656
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:18,999
Raised in darkness,
she hopes to bring light

657
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,067
and good fortune
to the universe.

658
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:24,804
She loves to travel and enjoys
collecting coins and currency

659
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,740
everywhere she goes.

660
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:30,510
Please say hello
to Miss Sculptor Galaxy.

661
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:37,951
I'm really proud of it.

662
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,185
She's so elegant.

663
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,021
I really hope that the judges
like it as well.

664
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,628
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look at our beauties?

665
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,168
Whatever's happening
with the mouth

666
00:29:55,202 --> 00:29:58,438
takes her from being beautiful
to injured.

667
00:29:58,472 --> 00:30:00,140
It's the one character
that really seems to kind of

668
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,375
tell a story beyond just,
"This is what I look like."

669
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,410
Yeah.

670
00:30:06,547 --> 00:30:09,249
She looks like a microwaved
marshmallow Peep.

671
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:10,683
I think, with a
better paint job,

672
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:12,786
this could have been
a lot more interesting makeup.

673
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,220
The nose and the back,

674
00:30:14,255 --> 00:30:16,823
they sort of seem to come from
two very different design ideas.

675
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,526
I agree.

676
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,693
Holy moly.

677
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,228
The combination
of color and form,

678
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:24,130
it's so stuck on.

679
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:25,465
Up close, it feels sort of
less thought out.

680
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:26,566
I'm looking at the judges.

681
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,301
Not sure
how they're feeling about it,

682
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:30,904
and I'm worried my concept
and design might send me home.

683
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:36,643
Tell us who made your favorite
alien beauty queen tonight

684
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:39,345
on Twitter using #FaceOff

685
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:42,986
It feels sort of
less thought out

686
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,521
the closer up you get.

687
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:46,623
I don't think the judges
like my makeup very much,

688
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:48,758
but hopefully
they won't send me home.

689
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,593
When you look at the chin,

690
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:53,363
that is some really nice,
simple form,

691
00:30:53,397 --> 00:30:55,165
and then it gets excessive.

692
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:58,268
Wow.

693
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:00,203
The head is awesome.

694
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,205
- It feels very original.
- Oh, yeah.

695
00:31:05,242 --> 00:31:06,709
It's really quite pretty.

696
00:31:06,744 --> 00:31:08,878
I think it's a beautiful
combination of shapes

697
00:31:08,913 --> 00:31:10,213
that we've never seen before.

698
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:11,448
It's very brave and original.

699
00:31:14,418 --> 00:31:17,253
This little piece
right here enhances her lips,

700
00:31:17,288 --> 00:31:18,922
and it does retain
the prettiness.

701
00:31:18,956 --> 00:31:20,190
The elegance,
more than anything,

702
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:21,257
is what struck me with this.

703
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:22,592
I think because it's so simple,

704
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:23,893
it was actually quite effective.

705
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:26,162
Yeah.

706
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:28,698
This is very busy.

707
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,467
Just a little, head to toe.

708
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:34,037
It befuddles me that she
didn't put a beauty makeup on her.

709
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,572
I'm just not
sure it goes together.

710
00:31:35,606 --> 00:31:37,107
The ear tentacles,

711
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:39,843
they don't necessarily seem to
apply to the rest of the design.

712
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:42,745
This is stunning.

713
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,447
Look at all the detail in this.

714
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:45,615
This is really gorgeous.

715
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:48,251
The beauty makeup
widens her face

716
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:49,719
and makes it
that much prettier.

717
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:50,753
Thank you.

718
00:31:57,394 --> 00:31:59,629
All right, the judges
have scored your creations,

719
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:01,231
so let's find out
what they thought.

720
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:03,366
Logan.

721
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,201
Emily.

722
00:32:05,236 --> 00:32:07,837
Stephanie.

723
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,372
You guys are safe this week

724
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:11,641
and can head back
to the makeup room.

725
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:12,675
Thank you.

726
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:20,884
The rest of you are the best
and the worst this week.

727
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:22,552
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

728
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:24,053
to find out
more about your work.

729
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:26,289
Adam, if you'd please step up.

730
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:33,997
Tell us about how your galaxy
inspired your makeup.

731
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:36,533
One tidbit about
the Cigar Galaxy is,

732
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:37,734
there's more suns,

733
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:39,469
hotter planets,
rougher environment,

734
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:42,005
so I decided to go for something
very rough and coarse

735
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,840
and make that beautiful.

736
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:45,008
I really want to applaud you

737
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:48,178
for how brave you were
with your design.

738
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:49,445
It's amazing.

739
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,047
I've never seen the shape
before.

740
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:52,248
Thank you.

741
00:32:52,283 --> 00:32:54,951
Can you turn sideways for us
for a moment?

742
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:57,554
That's just an amazing,
bizarre shape

743
00:32:57,588 --> 00:32:59,722
that is so elegant
from the side.

744
00:32:59,757 --> 00:33:01,691
- Nice work, honey.
- Thank you.

745
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:06,696
What I'd love to have seen
is the power of that side view

746
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,532
brought into the front view
as well.

747
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,467
I love the way that the skin
sort of gives way

748
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:14,037
to something that looks
very lavalike and rocklike.

749
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:16,272
The overall look of this
was so compelling for me.

750
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:17,340
Thank you.

751
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:19,742
Please step back.

752
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:28,251
Kelly, you're up next.

753
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,157
Would you please tell us

754
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:37,560
how your galaxy inspired
your alien beauty queen?

755
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:39,862
My galaxy
was the Sombrero Galaxy,

756
00:33:39,897 --> 00:33:42,165
and it has very bright stars,

757
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:44,334
so the only way
that she can live

758
00:33:44,368 --> 00:33:47,270
is to hide in caves
and live in the waters

759
00:33:47,304 --> 00:33:48,404
because the outside

760
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:51,107
is just so uninhabitable
from the radiation.

761
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,543
So she's more
of an aquatic-type character?

762
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:54,978
Mm-hmm.

763
00:33:55,012 --> 00:33:57,814
I have to tell you, I think all
of this is just way too busy.

764
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:02,185
You don't have any place
for your eye to focus,

765
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:05,822
so for me, this is not
a really great makeup this week.

766
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:08,024
What you sculpted, I do like,

767
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:09,859
but the application of it

768
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:12,895
makes it look
like a pullover mask.

769
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:16,366
The sort of mixture of
the fishlike crown on the front

770
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,834
and then the tentacles in back

771
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:21,671
feel like there's a few too many
things happening here.

772
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:23,673
Kelly,
if you'd please step down.

773
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:31,381
Julian, please come forward.

774
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:40,757
Tell us about your concept
and how your galaxy choice

775
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,091
may have influenced the design.

776
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:44,027
Well, I had
the Whirlpool Galaxy,

777
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,662
and it's a very new galaxy,

778
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:47,563
so I wanted to give her
a sleek, elegant look

779
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:50,233
while incorporating some of
the colors of the galaxy itself.

780
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:53,369
There's a beautiful thing
happening around the face

781
00:34:53,404 --> 00:34:55,772
with shape.

782
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:58,441
It's simple
and extraordinarily successful.

783
00:34:58,475 --> 00:34:59,609
Thank you.

784
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:01,244
I think the forms are stellar.

785
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:05,548
You very nicely balanced
the alien beauty part

786
00:35:05,582 --> 00:35:07,583
of this concept.

787
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:09,018
She's absolutely gorgeous.

788
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,621
You did a beautiful job
of shading her cheekbones,

789
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,389
and the treatment
of the eye makeup

790
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:14,757
is done really, really well.

791
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:16,059
Thank you.

792
00:35:16,093 --> 00:35:17,527
Julian, please step back.

793
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:19,095
Thanks.

794
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,568
Darla, please step
to the center.

795
00:35:32,843 --> 00:35:34,410
Can you tell us a bit
about your character

796
00:35:34,445 --> 00:35:36,779
and how your galaxy
inspired the design?

797
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:38,681
I had the Sculptor Galaxy.

798
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:42,085
The main inspiration I took was
the spiral pattern for the head,

799
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,921
and it's also known
as the Silver Dollar Galaxy,

800
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:47,423
so I put silver contacts
in her eyes.

801
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:50,660
There's this real element
of glamour to it.

802
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:52,962
There's almost an alien
old Hollywood quality,

803
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:55,164
like space Norma Desmond
or something like that,

804
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,300
and I really just think
it's very well done.

805
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,102
Thank you so much.

806
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:01,771
The forms are just stunning.

807
00:36:01,805 --> 00:36:04,540
That is what I want to see
from everybody every week.

808
00:36:04,575 --> 00:36:06,175
I'm really impressed.

809
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,477
Thank you.

810
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:08,811
She's classy.

811
00:36:08,846 --> 00:36:09,879
She's elegant.

812
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:11,147
She's beautiful.

813
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:12,148
We hate it.

814
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:16,386
- Didn't like it very much.
- You're in trouble.

815
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,355
Darla, please step back.

816
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,890
Thank you so much.

817
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:25,928
_

818
00:36:25,929 --> 00:36:27,063
Thanks.

819
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,231
Ben, you're up.

820
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:38,908
Ben, tell us
how the Andromeda Galaxy

821
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:40,743
informed your decisions
this week.

822
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:42,011
I pretty much took it

823
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:44,580
as the opportunity
to make whatever I wanted to,

824
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:46,749
and then I started thinking
about these eyes.

825
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:49,452
As an eye piece,
I haven't seen it done before,

826
00:36:49,486 --> 00:36:51,854
and just wanted to play around
with makeup today.

827
00:36:51,889 --> 00:36:54,056
You went a different route
than everybody else,

828
00:36:54,091 --> 00:36:55,258
and I applaud that,

829
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,194
but for some reason,
it didn't come together.

830
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:03,666
The texture of the plane
directly around this device

831
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,435
begs to be broken up with color,

832
00:37:05,469 --> 00:37:07,870
whether that's speckling
or veining or something.

833
00:37:07,905 --> 00:37:09,839
I think texture and color

834
00:37:09,873 --> 00:37:13,810
could have pulled together
what is a really solid idea.

835
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:15,978
There's some really beautiful
form work,

836
00:37:16,013 --> 00:37:18,181
and then we get
to this eye thing,

837
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:23,085
which feels like a '60s Japanese
superhero-type character,

838
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,855
and that is not this challenge.

839
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:28,124
I love the basic
abstract design of this,

840
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,692
but there's something missing,

841
00:37:29,726 --> 00:37:32,462
and it doesn't quite hit me
the way I think it should.

842
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:33,963
Ben, please step back.

843
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:35,932
Thanks.

844
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:40,136
Thank you guys.

845
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,571
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

846
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:42,905
while the judges deliberate.

847
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:51,047
All right, judges,
so let's start

848
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:52,815
with your favorites this week.

849
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,217
How about Adam?

850
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:56,719
An amazing makeup,
an amazing creature.

851
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:58,988
I loved the
biogeological elements of it.

852
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:01,457
I loved the way that the lava
melded in with the skin.

853
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:02,758
I really loved the profile.

854
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:05,461
We've really never seen
anything like that before.

855
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:07,296
All right,
let's move on to Julian.

856
00:38:07,331 --> 00:38:08,898
One of the things he did best

857
00:38:08,932 --> 00:38:11,200
was utilize
the actual model's beauty.

858
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:13,903
The simplicity, I think,
is what we all responded to.

859
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:16,472
Not a lot of other people
really achieved that this week.

860
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,975
Okay, judges,
let's move on to Darla.

861
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,710
It's clean. It's elegant.

862
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:21,711
It's classy.

863
00:38:21,745 --> 00:38:23,646
It's just a stunning makeup.

864
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,047
The forms are beautiful.

865
00:38:25,082 --> 00:38:28,584
You could put that character
as a lead alien in a film.

866
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,053
All right, let's move on
to your least favorite makeups.

867
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:32,822
Why don't we start with Kelly?

868
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:35,858
She mixed up so many different
colors, purples and pinks.

869
00:38:35,893 --> 00:38:38,394
It looked like it had purple
slugs coming out of its ears.

870
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:41,964
The edges, where they
even were sculpted, don't work.

871
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,000
The execution of it is bad,

872
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:47,503
but I still see the potential
in this design.

873
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:49,805
Let's move on to Ben.

874
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,641
There are so many good ideas,

875
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:53,509
but it's not beautiful.

876
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:54,877
There are so many
things that didn't work there,

877
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,479
but it's interesting
that his whole aesthetic

878
00:38:56,513 --> 00:38:57,513
is very much built around,

879
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:58,848
"I'm gonna take a wild gamble,"

880
00:38:58,882 --> 00:39:00,116
and sometimes it works,

881
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,651
and this time,
it really didn't.

882
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:03,719
Okay, judges,
have you made your decisions?

883
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:04,921
- Yeah, we have.
- We have. - Yes.

884
00:39:04,955 --> 00:39:06,188
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

885
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:17,767
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the semifinalists.

886
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:21,504
Adam, your character
is striking from afar,

887
00:39:21,538 --> 00:39:24,340
and it managed to create
a wow factor profile

888
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:27,443
with that cowl
that we have never seen before.

889
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:29,812
Julian, you did an excellent job

890
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:32,181
embracing your model's beauty
and enhancing it.

891
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:35,318
Though she was clearly alien,
she was still a stunning beauty.

892
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:36,752
Darla,

893
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:39,155
we loved the inherent glamour
of your character.

894
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:40,456
She has a sexy,

895
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,225
almost regal feeling
that made her a real standout.

896
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,226
Thank you.

897
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:45,928
All right, big moment.

898
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:49,732
Who is the winner of
our Miss Intergalactic Pageant?

899
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:53,035
The winner of our
Miss Intergalactic Pageant is...

900
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:05,112
All right, who is the winner of
our Miss Intergalactic Pageant?

901
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:08,148
The winner of our
Miss Intergalactic Pageant is...

902
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:15,222
Miss Sculptor Galaxy.

903
00:40:18,193 --> 00:40:19,660
She is not only beautiful,

904
00:40:19,694 --> 00:40:22,897
but the makeup is applied
and painted flawlessly.

905
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:25,366
We are so glad to see you
back on top this week.

906
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,800
Thank you so much.

907
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:29,470
I can't believe
that I just won this challenge.

908
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:32,139
It's exciting to be a top look,

909
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:34,308
but to actually win
a Spotlight Challenge

910
00:40:34,342 --> 00:40:36,343
is such a great feeling.

911
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:39,046
Darla, congratulations,
and, of course,

912
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,317
congratulations to our
very first Miss Intergalactic.

913
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:45,986
The two of you will be featured
in a full-page spread

914
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:47,554
in<i> Entertainment Weekly.</i>

915
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:49,390
- That's amazing.
- Congratulations on that.

916
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:50,591
Thank you.

917
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:54,028
Darla, you, Adam, and Julian

918
00:40:54,062 --> 00:40:55,496
can head back to the makeup room

919
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,364
with the coaches
and our beauties.

920
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,007
All right, that means
the two of you

921
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:08,208
are on the bottom this week,

922
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,344
and one of you
will be going home.

923
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:11,512
Please step forward.

924
00:41:19,554 --> 00:41:21,855
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom looks.

925
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,825
Kelly, some of your sculpting
was interesting,

926
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,827
but the poor application
of your pieces

927
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:28,729
and rough nature
of your paint work

928
00:41:28,763 --> 00:41:30,464
were underwhelming.

929
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:33,600
Ben, we appreciate that you
swung for the fences again,

930
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:36,036
but there were a number
of things, design-wise,

931
00:41:36,071 --> 00:41:38,505
that detracted from her beauty.

932
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,174
So who is going home tonight?

933
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,976
The person
going home tonight is...

934
00:41:46,247 --> 00:41:49,483
Kelly.

935
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:51,952
We know that you had some
good ideas going on this week,

936
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:54,521
but it seems that you really
struggled to bring them

937
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:57,424
all together
into a cohesive, clean makeup.

938
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,994
I had a bit
of a struggle this week,

939
00:42:00,028 --> 00:42:01,395
and it showed.

940
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:04,798
Kelly, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

941
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,066
Ben, you are safe this week

942
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:07,534
and can head back
to the makeup room.

943
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:15,342
Kelly, you have done some
inspired and fun makeups for us,

944
00:42:15,377 --> 00:42:16,577
and I really look forward

945
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:18,679
to what the future
has in store for you.

946
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:20,014
Thank you.

947
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:22,349
Kelly, it's been great
having you here with us,

948
00:42:22,384 --> 00:42:24,351
but if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

949
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:25,352
and pack up your kit.

950
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:26,453
Thanks, guys.

951
00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:27,233
Good luck, sweetheart.

952
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,593
Thank you.

953
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:30,595
I know that I'm better
than what I put out there,

954
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,196
and if I had to do it
all over again,

955
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:34,649
I would have made
much better choices.

956
00:42:36,953 --> 00:42:38,202
It's me.

957
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:39,820
I'm leaving
with a lot of knowledge

958
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:41,472
and a lot of confidence
in myself.

959
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:43,207
You have such a creative
passion about you,

960
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:45,843
and I don't want to ever
see you lose that, you know.

961
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,278
Get over here.

962
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:50,314
I made it this far on<i> Face Off,</i>

963
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:52,316
and that's pretty awesome.

964
00:42:52,352 --> 00:42:53,851
I love what I do,

965
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,587
and I'm gonna keep making
my spooky things.
