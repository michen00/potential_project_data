1
00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:03,240
I think you did
an astounding job.

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:04,875
I just don't get it.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,644
Love it,
and I love how you're thinking.

4
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,112
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:10,114
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

6
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:13,784
Jamie's wooden bridge troll
earned her her first win,

7
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:15,553
but Anthony stumbled,

8
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:18,589
and Team Rayce suffered
their second loss in a row.

9
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:24,462
Now ten artists remain,

10
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:27,598
and tonight all bets are off.

11
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:30,167
Models, come on out.

12
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:31,335
Ooh.

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,037
I've never body-painted
before in my life.

14
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:34,405
I don't need this now.

15
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,273
Changing it halfway through
isn't helping.

16
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:38,943
I'm not comfortable
changing my entire paint job.

17
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:41,479
You will be the one going home.

18
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:44,515
It looks like a little kid's
painting at a county fair.

19
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,050
In the end, only one will win

20
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:48,386
a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,155
to one of their
85 international locations,

22
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:54,225
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

23
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,460
and $100,000.

24
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,997
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

25
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,233
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

26
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,470
Oh, well, here we go.

27
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:40,604
This is so weird.

28
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,440
Beautiful.

29
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:45,476
We walk into the lab, I
see all these different hats,

30
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,112
and I am pumped.

31
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:51,248
The hats are wild
and very inspiring,

32
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:54,785
so I'm really excited to hear
what the challenge is.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,786
Hey, guys.

34
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,354
Hi.

35
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,890
Well, as you can tell,
this is gonna be a fun one,

36
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:01,826
so let's get to it.

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,129
Some of Hollywood's
most unforgettable characters,

38
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:07,932
like The Cat in the Hat
and Davy Jones,

39
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:10,601
they're not only known
for the roles they play,

40
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:12,736
but also their singular hats.

41
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,839
In this Foundation Challenge,

42
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:17,141
you will select
one of these hats

43
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:20,811
and use it to inspire an
original character of your own.

44
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:22,146
This is really cool.

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,614
Before we get started,

46
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:27,284
I'd like to introduce you
to today's special guest judge.

47
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,587
Last season,
she joined the<i> Face Off</i> family

48
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,189
when she filled in for Ve
on the judges' panel.

49
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:36,427
Please give a warm welcome back

50
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:39,563
to Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

51
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:45,169
Lois Burwell, makeup legend
and judge from season seven.

52
00:02:45,203 --> 00:02:47,404
She's known for her work
with Steven Spielberg

53
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,839
and her realism.

54
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:50,407
I'm really stoked
that she's gonna be judging

55
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:51,942
our Foundation Challenge.

56
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,811
- What a great hat.
- Thank you very much.

57
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,213
It would be rude not to,
wouldn't it, on a hat challenge?

58
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:00,451
All right, well, you've seen it
all in your storied career,

59
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:04,054
and you've brought so many
incredible characters to life.

60
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:06,056
So what is it about a hat
that can make

61
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:07,258
a character stand out?

62
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,360
Well, the wonderful thing
about a hat

63
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:10,895
is that it frames the face.

64
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:14,398
So the hat complements
the makeup, the character.

65
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:17,134
Be inspired by the hat.

66
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:19,036
What are you gonna be looking
for in today's final makeups?

67
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,805
Not only technique and skill,

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,644
but more importantly,
a clean makeup.

69
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:29,613
All right, we started
this season with 15 of you.

70
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:31,949
Now only 10 of you are left.

71
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:34,785
So winning today's challenge
and its prize of immunity

72
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,421
means more than ever.

73
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:39,723
Immunity would be fantastic.

74
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,825
With me being in bottom looks
last challenge,

75
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,027
it gives me the ability

76
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,195
to try things
that I would never try before.

77
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,264
Your models
and your makeup stations

78
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,568
have been randomly assigned,
and on Lois's go,

79
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:52,836
I want you to grab a hat
and get to work.

80
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,839
You have two hours
for this Foundation Challenge.

81
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,975
Ready, set...

82
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,177
Go.

83
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,282
- This one.
- Shit, this is heavy.

84
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:09,219
Hey, let's see if this fits.

85
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:11,655
I grab the poofy dandelion hat.
It's fluffy.

86
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,357
I immediately think Dr. Seuss,

87
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,360
so I'm thinking cute, like,
Whoville-style character.

88
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:17,895
Yay.
Okay, let's go with that.

89
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,934
Let's see
how this fits you first.

90
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:26,103
Ridiculous.

91
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:27,871
I end up picking a ship hat.

92
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:29,373
I thought I would make
a pirate.

93
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:30,641
But no ship's captain

94
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,544
would wear a hat that looked
like a ship on his head.

95
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:35,045
It's a silly hat.

96
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,580
So I don't know what I'm doing.

97
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:39,116
I guess I'll just make
a dead ship's captain.

98
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,818
Arrgh.

99
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:44,488
- I'm gonna make you all wood.
- Okay.

100
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:45,956
A wooden boy.

101
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:48,492
I have the top hat,
and I'm really excited,

102
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:50,127
because my kids will like
my concept,

103
00:04:50,161 --> 00:04:52,363
which is a dark version
of Pinocchio.

104
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:55,599
Geppetto didn't save Pinocchio,
and he's still trying

105
00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:57,568
to find his father
after all these years.

106
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:59,903
This is if you stayed in
the whale longer than expected.

107
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:12,449
I am creating this asymmetric
goddess-style character

108
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:14,485
in a tin-foil dress.

109
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,820
I picked a really big,
busy hat.

110
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,389
It's full of metal
and rhinestones...

111
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:20,557
It's gonna get uncomfortable
kind of fast.

112
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:23,527
So I start gluing
crushed rhinestones on my model.

113
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,697
I want it to be more sparkly
and gold and silver,

114
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:29,166
and on the other side, I want it
to be more blue and purple.

115
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,968
Oh, gosh.

116
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,637
Give me your whimsical face.

117
00:05:33,672 --> 00:05:37,174
My hat is this cool toy,

118
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,411
tinker, metal, old-school hat.

119
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:42,012
It's just obnoxious.

120
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:44,048
It's great.

121
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,683
A little trim-trim.

122
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:48,552
My character is, like, the
Willy Wonka of the toy world.

123
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:49,853
You look so good.

124
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:52,189
Five minutes, you guys!
You got five minutes left!

125
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,834
Time's up.
Brushes down.

126
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,369
Yay.

127
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,871
All right, so tell us
about what you created today.

128
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:10,074
So I wanted to go
with a smaller hat.

129
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:13,911
I just made, like, an evil
Victorian queenlike figure.

130
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:15,145
When you do a lip line,

131
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,649
you will find
if you just put a finger here,

132
00:06:18,683 --> 00:06:19,783
and then work like that...

133
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:20,918
Hmm, oh.

134
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:24,188
...you can gauge
the movement of the actor,

135
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:26,156
and you'll get a finer line.

136
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:28,192
- It's a nice makeup.
- Thank you.

137
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:30,160
I thought, "What if
Pinocchio wasn't saved?

138
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:31,628
What if he was lost at sea?"

139
00:06:31,663 --> 00:06:32,663
It's an amazing backstory.

140
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:34,098
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

141
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,934
This section here, I think,
is the area that works best.

142
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:40,604
But if you just added
some highlights going through,

143
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:43,173
it would've made the whole thing
feel more three-dimensional.

144
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,542
- Yeah, I agree 100%.
- It's a very nice makeup.

145
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:46,610
Thank you very much.

146
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:48,112
So she is
the emperor's daughter,

147
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,247
and she has two sides
to her-- a dark side,

148
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:52,316
and then the other side,
she's more serene.

149
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,284
This is a huge amount of work.

150
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,021
I like very much the use
and understanding of color

151
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,290
and the transition
from one color to the other.

152
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,025
- It's very well done.
- Thank you.

153
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,095
So I've created
a nomadic warrior.

154
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,630
I wouldn't have used
so many pieces.

155
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:09,166
I would have concentrated
doing one thing

156
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,434
extremely well.

157
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:11,935
- But it is a good makeup.
- Okay.

158
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,303
Thanks.

159
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:14,972
Looking around the lab
is really cool,

160
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:16,306
because people went

161
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,708
in a lot of different directions
with this one.

162
00:07:17,742 --> 00:07:19,109
The hats were so different,

163
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:20,878
and there's some
really interesting makeups.

164
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:22,479
I don't know who's gonna win.

165
00:07:27,085 --> 00:07:29,686
Okay, Lois.
So how did they do today?

166
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:32,055
Everyone did
exceptionally well.

167
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,557
I'm really impressed.

168
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:35,058
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

169
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:36,627
All right, who created
your favorite looks, then?

170
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:39,630
Rob, I thought the work
said something

171
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:41,665
about the simplicity of the hat

172
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,134
being translated
into a simple makeup.

173
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,470
- Thank you.
- Emily...

174
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:48,972
you achieved
a huge amount of work

175
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:53,677
and translated the hat
into that makeup superbly well.

176
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,045
Thank you.

177
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,648
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

178
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:59,349
The winner this week is...

179
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,086
Emily.

180
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,860
You have an understanding
of color, form, and shape.

181
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:12,095
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

182
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,396
Emily, congratulations.

183
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,432
As the winner
of today's Foundation Challenge,

184
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:18,468
you have earned immunity
in the next Spotlight Challenge.

185
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:19,536
How's that feel?

186
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,770
It feels really good.

187
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,472
Doesn't it?
I bet.

188
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,473
I'm thrilled.

189
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,075
It's exciting because who knows

190
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:26,276
what the next challenge
could be?

191
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,677
They're getting more difficult.

192
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,446
Lois, thank you so much
for being here today.

193
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,547
It was a pleasure.

194
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,315
Oh, thank you for having me.

195
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,817
It's a delight to be back.

196
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:36,253
Nice work today, you guys.

197
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:39,856
I will see you tomorrow for
your next Spotlight Challenge.

198
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:41,758
- Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,994
- Thanks.
- Night-night.

200
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:03,146
We arrive out to Canyon Ranch,

201
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,515
and I am not much
of a nature boy.

202
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,150
I'm not a happy camper.

203
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,986
So I am looking out
for rattlesnakes, bugs,

204
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:11,922
any of God's creatures
that could kill me.

205
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:15,759
So I'm really looking forward
to going back to the lab.

206
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:17,494
Does McKenzie always
hang out in the woods?

207
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:21,598
Hey, guys.

208
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:22,666
Hi.

209
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,201
Welcome to Canyon Ranch.

210
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:26,469
This beautiful wooded landscape
has been featured

211
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:29,739
in a variety of television shows
and feature films,

212
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:32,842
including<i> The Office,</i>
<i>Sons of Anarchy,</i>

213
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:35,645
and my personal favorite,
<i>True Blood.</i>

214
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,882
All right, let's talk about
your next Spotlight Challenge.

215
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,018
Mankind continues
to be fascinated by royalty.

216
00:09:42,053 --> 00:09:45,121
Now, while royals
rule over humans,

217
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:47,891
nature shows us
that this social stratum

218
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,794
actually exists
in other species

219
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:54,464
that represents more than half
of all known living organisms.

220
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:57,334
In fact, you may even have
a few by your feet

221
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,169
at this very moment...

222
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:00,704
insects.

223
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,973
Oh.

224
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,374
I'm feeling really pumped.

225
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:06,743
I'm thinking about sculpting
little appendages

226
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:08,878
and just nasty,
like, awesomeness.

227
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,046
Deep in these woods,

228
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:13,049
you will find
several elaborate habitats,

229
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:16,753
along with an image
of a unique insect.

230
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:18,455
Working in teams of two,
you will select

231
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:20,357
an insect and habitat
to inspire

232
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:24,160
a beautiful insect queen
and her companion.

233
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,730
All right, why don't you
go ahead and select a teammate?

234
00:10:28,232 --> 00:10:30,367
Did you just--

235
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:32,135
What's up, brother?

236
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,937
Now, before
you can get started,

237
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,172
there is a big part
of this challenge

238
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,741
that I haven't told you about.

239
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:39,342
Oh.

240
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,444
You're not gonna be working
in the lab this week.

241
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:44,614
In fact, this entire
Spotlight Challenge

242
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,150
will take place
right here in the woods.

243
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:49,119
- What?
- What?

244
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:50,420
Are we camping here?

245
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:52,656
I don't really understand
what that means.

246
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,558
So are we sculpting
in the forest?

247
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:57,427
Models, come on out.

248
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:02,799
Oh, God.

249
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:07,637
Um...

250
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,873
Oh, God!

251
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:12,409
Shit.

252
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,315
Models, come on out.

253
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:20,283
Um...

254
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:22,118
This is new.

255
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:25,755
So obviously, this is
a nude body painting challenge.

256
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,390
Yeah.

257
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,692
Okay.

258
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:30,760
I don't body-paint.
I don't need this now.

259
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:32,662
- Rob, you all right?
- I'm all right.

260
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:35,432
All right, thank you, models.

261
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:37,901
Why don't you go ahead and take
your places in your habitats?

262
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:42,472
All right, now,
I know body-painting

263
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:44,107
is a difficult task

264
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:46,476
and requires
a very specific skill set.

265
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,213
So I brought in an expert
to give you some advice.

266
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,082
He's an award-winning
body-painter

267
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,651
whose work has appeared
in<i> Playboy</i> and<i> Fangoria.</i>

268
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:57,520
You may also recognize him
from season two of<i> Face Off.</i>

269
00:11:57,555 --> 00:12:00,957
Please give a warm welcome
to Nix Herrera.

270
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,762
Nix knows body-painting
so well.

271
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:08,565
I'm super excited that
he's gonna be giving advice.

272
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,867
- How are you? Good to see you.
- Good.

273
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:12,902
All right, so tell these guys
what you've been up to lately.

274
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:15,038
I have a brush line
coming out for body-painters,

275
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:16,773
and I'm getting ready
to do some work in Hong Kong.

276
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:19,342
Well, for a lot of
special-effects makeup artists,

277
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:22,846
body-painting is way
out of their comfort zone.

278
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,414
So what advice do you have
for these guys

279
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,549
to make a beautiful
body-painting?

280
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:28,084
I think the first thing
is just remember,

281
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,186
you have a full body
as your canvas.

282
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:31,721
Take advantage
of this opportunity.

283
00:12:31,756 --> 00:12:33,523
And insects have
a lot of colors.

284
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:35,125
Have fun with it.

285
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,395
As a reminder, one of your
characters must be a queen,

286
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:42,098
but the other could be anything
that you'd like, even a blend,

287
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:45,702
where your model completely
disappears into the landscape.

288
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:48,471
All right, guys, you'll have
5 1/2 hours for this challenge.

289
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:51,574
Your coaches will be by soon
to see how you're doing,

290
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,977
and Nix here will also check in
with you in a couple of hours

291
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:56,579
to make sure that
you're all on the right track.

292
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,114
All right, on "Go,"
you'll select your habitat.

293
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,316
Make sure
that you choose wisely,

294
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:03,019
as your final makeups
will be photographed

295
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,554
presiding over their kingdoms

296
00:13:04,588 --> 00:13:07,090
for the judges
to see on the reveal stage.

297
00:13:07,124 --> 00:13:08,691
So, Nix, would you like
to do the honors?

298
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:10,560
I would love to.

299
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:11,895
Your time starts now.

300
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:15,532
We all start running
through the woods

301
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:19,803
like crazy people looking at
the different insect habitats.

302
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:21,004
Jamie, you okay with this?

303
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:22,539
- I'm okay with the honey bee.
- Cool.

304
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:24,240
- You want ladybug?
- Let's do it.

305
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,775
You want to do
this, European hornet?

306
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,143
- Yeah, or...
- We're doing it.

307
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:29,078
Don't have time
to think about it.

308
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,247
- Let's just grab it.
- Okay.

309
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:33,416
Darla and me pick
the jewel beetle

310
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:36,953
because its back is metallic-y
greens and blacks and blues,

311
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:40,256
and I'm seeing pinks and oranges
on its stomach.

312
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,459
This could be something
really, really, like, elegant.

313
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:45,862
I'm Darla.

314
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:48,064
Our models come over,
so we meet them,

315
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:51,334
and we just start kind of
looking around at our habitat.

316
00:13:51,368 --> 00:13:55,038
So we'll just paint him
not to specifically disappear,

317
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,773
but to match the wood.

318
00:13:56,807 --> 00:14:00,410
Our concept is
to create a insect queen

319
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:01,678
using our female model

320
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:05,381
and then use our male model
to create a burned log.

321
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,749
I think that'll look
really nice.

322
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:12,489
Liberating walking around
in the nude, isn't it?

323
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:14,524
_

324
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:17,126
If you were to ask me
to devise a challenge

325
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,028
that was my worst nightmare,

326
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:22,298
it would be nude body-painting
in the forest,

327
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,501
'cause I've never
body-painted before...

328
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:25,935
Um...

329
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,338
...and I'm gonna have to explain
all this to my wife.

330
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:31,808
We're gonna make you up
in probably those colors.

331
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:33,142
We end up getting
the cuckoo wasp,

332
00:14:33,177 --> 00:14:35,311
and it has a very unique
color scheme to it.

333
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:36,813
It's got greens and blues.

334
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,448
It also has red in the abdomen.

335
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,350
She's the queen
protecting the larvae.

336
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:42,051
You'll be embedded in the sand.

337
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:44,220
It's really important
that this looks good on photo,

338
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:46,389
because that's all the judges
are gonna see.

339
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:49,893
So we really have to make sure
that we plan this out perfectly.

340
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:56,866
Something I was thinking of
is painting, like, his back,

341
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:59,969
so that it's,
like, the back of her.

342
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:02,839
We choose the European hornet.

343
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:05,441
I have this concept
that I really love--

344
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:09,812
making the female the thorax
and the head of the queen

345
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:13,283
and making the male model
the abdomen.

346
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:15,218
Well, I want to blend him
right into the background.

347
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:18,821
I've seen really nice blends,
and now that I finally have

348
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:21,257
the opportunity of doing
something like that myself,

349
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:23,459
I'm gonna try my hand at it.

350
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:25,895
If he's going to be
blending into the background,

351
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,031
my piece is gonna be
the main focus,

352
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,233
so she's got to be
pretty freakin' badass.

353
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:33,336
And maybe turn
a little bit more other way.

354
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,371
So how I'm
gonna pose her is having

355
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:38,107
the back showing
this wonderful thorax--

356
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:39,642
just reds and blacks.

357
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:42,111
I'm not as in love with it
as I was my original concept,

358
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:44,948
but I'm still
gonna make this work.

359
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:51,654
So it's the
queen of the ladybugs

360
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:52,822
coming out of the leaves,

361
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:55,091
but then
she's giving life to you,

362
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,193
and it's all these larvae
returning to the earth.

363
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:58,928
I picked the ladybug
because it's an insect

364
00:15:58,963 --> 00:16:01,831
that we can make read
as a ladybug easily.

365
00:16:01,865 --> 00:16:05,401
I come up with this take
on the famous image

366
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:08,705
of God and Adam touching fingers
from the Sistine Chapel.

367
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:09,939
You're gonna see it,

368
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,507
and you're gonna know
exactly what it is.

369
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,809
Do you want me to
start blocking her out?

370
00:16:12,843 --> 00:16:14,043
Yeah, go ahead.
I'm just gonna start

371
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:15,244
laying down the dirt tones
on him.

372
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,779
I'm going to take
the male model

373
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:19,782
and do the blend work
for the ground and the larvae,

374
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,619
and he's gonna start
blocking out for the ladybug.

375
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:24,454
I definitely got to bring
my game to this one,

376
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:26,656
because I was in bottom looks
last time,

377
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,225
and I really need
to step it up.

378
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,293
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

379
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:31,294
- Hi.
- Hey.

380
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:32,395
Laura and Anthony come over

381
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,863
to see what Jamie and I
are working on.

382
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:35,898
- So you're doing the honey bee?
- Yes.

383
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,433
We're gonna take
our female model,

384
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:40,203
and we're going to make her
into the queen bee,

385
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:41,571
and then we're gonna take
our male model

386
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,072
and make him into a drone.

387
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:46,709
We're gonna just really
enhance their natural curves

388
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:50,213
and bring it into the honey bee
pattern, then coloring.

389
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:51,681
Have you guys
thought about your poses?

390
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:54,417
- Yes, we have a picture.
- Oh, okay.

391
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:57,253
They are going for
the feel of a honey bee

392
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:59,822
with high contrasts
of black and yellow and white.

393
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:03,693
It's a little bit more abstract,
which is the smart way to go.

394
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:06,562
Ooh, what do y'all got?

395
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,331
Did y'all already
position them?

396
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,899
Yep.

397
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:12,568
We're going to have him
as actually a larva with sand.

398
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:14,170
So larva, as in worm?

399
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,838
Yeah, with some kind
of pattern on his back.

400
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:17,206
Do you have
a picture of the worm?

401
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,775
- No, we don't.
- You're just gonna wing it?

402
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,209
We were planning to.

403
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:23,046
You may want to think about
the concept a little bit more.

404
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,514
I don't want you going up there
and having to explain

405
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:26,716
to the judges, where they're
gonna be like, "What is that?"

406
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,184
Like, "Oh, that's a larva."

407
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:29,519
"What does a larva look like?"

408
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:30,887
"Oh, we didn't have pictures,
so we made it up."

409
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:32,922
Okay.

410
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:35,391
I'd rather not change
our concept right now,

411
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:39,095
but she does actually open
my eyes to other possibilities.

412
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,697
Could turn him into the thorax.

413
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:42,765
Or you could turn him
into the thorax.

414
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,367
That would be pretty clever.

415
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:46,269
The abdomen of this bug

416
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:49,706
is in stark contrast
to the upper part of the body.

417
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,807
I think it would be cool

418
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:53,876
if we put them together
to create one bug.

419
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:54,944
We'll start butt-to-butt.

420
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:56,560
_

421
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,449
Something like that.
What do you guys think?

422
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,184
- I think we're good.
- All right.

423
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:02,418
I like that.

424
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,123
It's very straightforward.

425
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:09,525
A lot of people are doing
some really creative things.

426
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,561
I think you guys are
the only ones that are doing

427
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:13,229
- just a straight blend.
- Yeah.

428
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:14,997
If the blend falls short,

429
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:17,767
you will probably be
the one that could be...

430
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:19,202
- Going home?
- ...going home.

431
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:21,070
I'm really
worried for Ben and Kelly,

432
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,705
especially after seeing
everybody else's concept.

433
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,540
The posing
that they're trying to do

434
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:25,908
doesn't really tell any story,

435
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,077
and their characters
don't interact.

436
00:18:28,112 --> 00:18:30,980
I want this composition to be
really beautiful, you know?

437
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,682
Well, let's figure out
how those two

438
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,751
need to be put together
so we can keep moving.

439
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,686
I'm not really comfortable

440
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,588
completely changing
my entire paint job.

441
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:39,822
I just don't want to see
you guys in trouble.

442
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:41,424
No, I didn't either,
but--

443
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,392
Well, changing it halfway
through isn't helping,

444
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,194
so let's figure something out.

445
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:47,730
I just--

446
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,560
I just don't want to see
you guys in trouble.

447
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:54,328
Well, changing it
halfway through isn't helping.

448
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:56,998
Kelly's making
a queen European hornet,

449
00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:58,833
while I'm working
on the camouflage

450
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,702
that I want to do,
and then Anthony walks in,

451
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:03,371
worried about the direction
we're going in.

452
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,507
And I think just shifting
a little slightly

453
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,909
creates a better composition.

454
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:10,912
All I can really do
is try to rotate them

455
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,847
around the tree
so it's still utilizing

456
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:14,649
the forms that Ben
had already painted,

457
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,485
but also make it
just slightly more interesting.

458
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,555
That is more interesting, 'cause
at least it shows some depth.

459
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:21,556
What do you think?

460
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,625
I have no idea, man.

461
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,993
We got three hours left.

462
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:27,195
I'm not completely comfortable

463
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:28,696
with moving these models
right now.

464
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:31,532
Hopefully, that doesn't bite me
in the long run.

465
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:32,867
Just looking out, guys.

466
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,368
I'm just a little concerned
about them getting

467
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:36,037
everything finished in time.

468
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:37,705
I don't want the members
of my team on bottom.

469
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:40,641
I don't want them going anywhere
because of a boring concept.

470
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:43,177
Thank you.

471
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,587
How are you brushing?
Are you patting?

472
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,522
I'm doing a mixture of both.

473
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,591
- You are?
- Patting seems to work.

474
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,426
We're really excited
'cause we both feel

475
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,162
a lot better about this concept
than the original one.

476
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:03,164
At this point,
it's just on how we execute it.

477
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:05,399
Being that neither of us
have actually body-painted,

478
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:08,436
we still are a little bit
worried about pulling this off.

479
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,472
Yeah, I brush it, and then
I pat what needs a little more.

480
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:18,913
So, making him a log
and leaves and branches,

481
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:20,181
that's a lot of work.

482
00:20:20,215 --> 00:20:22,850
Stephanie and Darla's concept
is beautiful,

483
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:26,053
but camouflage makeups
are extremely difficult.

484
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,288
Have you tried
different positions,

485
00:20:27,322 --> 00:20:28,789
or is this the first one
you tried?

486
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:30,725
I mean, that was the first one
that we got to that made sense.

487
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:31,726
_

488
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:32,406
Mm-hmm.

489
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:33,505
_

490
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:34,128
_

491
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:36,697
I've already got
the base all laid out,

492
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:39,367
but I know I'm not
a strong body-painter.

493
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:42,670
Laura is really great
with concept design,

494
00:20:42,704 --> 00:20:45,406
so I decide to go
with Laura's suggestion.

495
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,977
She's down.
He's still back here doing this.

496
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:51,779
So our new concept is that

497
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,514
we're going to use
our male model

498
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:56,284
to create the wingspan
of the beetle.

499
00:20:56,318 --> 00:21:00,154
We have leaves
that we can... use.

500
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:01,289
- Okay.
- Cool.

501
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:03,024
I get the look of it,

502
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,326
but I'm a little bit nervous
about the fact that

503
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,230
these are dark, green,
opaque leaves,

504
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:12,733
and we're trying to make
translucent wings.

505
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:14,769
- What's your plan?
- I'm doing this.

506
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:17,872
And then I'm gonna stipple
tinted latex over it

507
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:21,642
so that I can get
the translucency appearance.

508
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:28,316
Look straight, hon.

509
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,650
I love the honeycomb pattern.

510
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:31,452
I think that it would be
really neat

511
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:34,588
to incorporate that pattern
onto my queen.

512
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:37,925
It's risky, because
if it's not done right,

513
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,494
it looks ridiculous
'cause it's so geometric.

514
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,763
I'm nervous, but I feel like
I need to make her

515
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,466
more interesting,
so I'm gonna try it.

516
00:21:50,005 --> 00:21:51,172
I don't body-paint,

517
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:53,040
so I'm glad we have Nix
as our guest mentor.

518
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:54,108
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

519
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:55,409
So what do you guys
have going on?

520
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,178
So we picked the ladybug,

521
00:21:57,212 --> 00:22:00,247
and we were inspired
by classic art.

522
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,282
I love it.
It's a great concept.

523
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:02,483
Thank you.

524
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:03,985
With your stuff,
you're getting to the point now

525
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:05,720
where I think
it's getting a little busy.

526
00:22:05,754 --> 00:22:07,822
So I think if you crispen up
a couple of spots,

527
00:22:07,856 --> 00:22:10,257
so there's a little bit
of depth, so it's not so muddy.

528
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:11,826
Cool. Keep it up.
You guys are doing awesome.

529
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,094
- All right, thank you so much.
- Keep it up.

530
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:14,562
What are you guys
going for here?

531
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,297
We're gonna do a
queen bee and a drone bee.

532
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:18,299
I love the colors
that you have going on.

533
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,035
One thing that I found
for making the color pop

534
00:22:21,069 --> 00:22:23,637
is paint it with white and then
airbrush yellow over it.

535
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,106
That'll give it more dimension.

536
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,107
- Thanks, Nix.
- Good luck, have fun.

537
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:27,108
Thank you.

538
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:29,110
All right,
so the head is her head.

539
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:30,644
- Is that right?
- Yep.

540
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,280
I like it, and then
for all of the shimmery,

541
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:34,782
reflective parts of it,

542
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,050
I'm trying to figure out a way

543
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,051
to get that
to translate into it,

544
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,652
whether or not it's airbrushing

545
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,621
or brighter color,
so that it has depth,

546
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:41,756
'cause right now
it's just a little--

547
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,757
- It's flat.
- Yeah, a little flat.

548
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:43,758
Okay.

549
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,559
And you have
the European hornet?

550
00:22:45,594 --> 00:22:46,927
- Yeah.
- You're doing the camouflage.

551
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:49,363
I think I just want to make him
disappear as much as possible.

552
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:50,931
One of the things that's
gonna be challenging is,

553
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,600
because the sun
is constantly moving,

554
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:54,735
it's gonna change
the colors of your background.

555
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,771
Every once in a while, come back
to your spot, photograph it.

556
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,506
_

557
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,007
Yeah, I'm not gonna
keep you much longer,

558
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:02,076
'cause you have
one of the hardest ones to do.

559
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,544
- Kelly?
- Hey.

560
00:23:03,578 --> 00:23:05,079
- Hi, how you doing?
- Great.

561
00:23:05,113 --> 00:23:06,647
You are covered in body paint.

562
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:08,149
Well, it happens.

563
00:23:08,183 --> 00:23:09,483
- The hair looks awesome.
- Thank you.

564
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,218
I think the only thing
I'm a little worried about

565
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:13,854
is how much actual paint
you have on the body.

566
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:15,022
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

567
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:17,758
He's actually going to be
her wings.

568
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:21,729
Is the color from her
gonna translate into him?

569
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:24,298
Mm-hmm. We want to
use metallic airbrush colors

570
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:25,933
just to give it a shimmer.

571
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,368
Yeah, try to pop those colors.

572
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:29,003
- There's iridescent powders.
- Okay.

573
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:30,104
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

574
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:31,372
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah, keep at it.

575
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:33,641
I'm gonna head out.
Good luck, guys.

576
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:34,875
Thank you.

577
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,444
Just give me a basic shape
to work with.

578
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:37,478
I got you.
I got you.

579
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:38,913
Adam and I decided
to switch off,

580
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:42,149
so I'm going to add the
Kryolan aquacolors to the face,

581
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:45,419
while he's adding the texture
of the larva on the male model.

582
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:47,354
What color lips we going, Adam?

583
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:48,589
White for the lips.

584
00:23:48,623 --> 00:23:50,458
Okay.

585
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:53,427
Have you airbrushed
the shiny spots?

586
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:57,098
I want to make sure Rob and Adam
both paint the larva correctly.

587
00:23:57,132 --> 00:23:58,466
To make those larvae pop,

588
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,601
you have to create
a little bit more contrast,

589
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,269
and add shiny highlights

590
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,072
to make 'em feel
like some kind of larva bug.

591
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:06,474
So it's kind of a dance
back and forth

592
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:08,876
where you can see how it starts
to look more wormlike.

593
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,877
Mm-hmm.

594
00:24:12,614 --> 00:24:14,415
Darla's still
working on the wings

595
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:16,050
that we're gonna put
with our male model,

596
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:18,853
and I continue painting
our female model,

597
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:21,789
and we're both frantic,
trying to finish our makeups.

598
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:24,258
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

599
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,293
It's a rough challenge.

600
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:29,330
Because we spent so much time
working on our first concept,

601
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:31,499
I don't know if we're gonna
have enough time to finish.

602
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:34,301
I'm just worried that
literally just his arms are showing,

603
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:36,137
and we're gonna
get killed for that.

604
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,538
- That's not good.
- Yeah.

605
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:38,572
And it would be me going home.

606
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,307
I'm not a body painter.

607
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:41,575
This isn't what I do.

608
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,445
To know that I could go home
for this is really,

609
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,746
really frustrating.

610
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:52,531
Literally,
just his arms are showing,

611
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:54,800
and we're gonna
get killed for that.

612
00:24:54,834 --> 00:24:56,068
Okay, let me start airbrushing.

613
00:24:56,102 --> 00:24:57,603
Yeah.
I think it's time to airbrush.

614
00:24:57,637 --> 00:25:00,806
Because we spent so much time
working on our first concept,

615
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,208
I don't know if we're gonna
have enough time to finish.

616
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:05,644
But I've spent too much time
on these wings,

617
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,880
so it's too late to go back.

618
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:09,381
Just need some highlights.

619
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,650
Yeah, and then I need to paint
the fuck out of these wings.

620
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:14,753
One hour, guys.
This is Last Looks.

621
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:16,155
Good luck.
See you<i> mañana.</i>

622
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:18,324
Good luck, dude.
This is looking really nice.

623
00:25:18,358 --> 00:25:19,892
- All right, good luck, guys.
- Thanks.

624
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,496
I got a lot of shit to do.

625
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:27,333
I want to go in
with some more reds and yellows,

626
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,668
get cream foundation
around the eyes,

627
00:25:29,703 --> 00:25:32,938
and just make sure
everything is painted.

628
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:34,406
- More yellow?
- Yeah.

629
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,910
That line--
Yeah, right there.

630
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:39,545
It's too harsh
compared to the rest.

631
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,046
We don't have much to do.

632
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,282
We're just gonna add
a little bit more feathering.

633
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:45,017
Jamie and I feel
really good about this.

634
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:46,418
That looks cool.

635
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:49,488
I've never done hair.

636
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:51,056
I've seen my wife do it.
That's about it.

637
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,758
Hey, we can just do this.

638
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:55,828
So I hold my tablet up
as a mirror.

639
00:25:55,862 --> 00:25:58,130
Thank God for our model
to do this to her hair,

640
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,231
or we would've been screwed.

641
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:00,833
We're running out of time here.

642
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:03,435
Ten minutes, everybody!
You have ten minutes left!

643
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:14,480
All right, guys, time is up!

644
00:26:14,514 --> 00:26:17,249
I can't wait to see your work
onstage tomorrow.

645
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:18,384
Go get some rest.

646
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,687
We're gonna get some time
to work with the photographer

647
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:24,390
to make sure our models
are positioned correctly,

648
00:26:24,424 --> 00:26:26,759
but unfortunately,
we don't get to see the photos,

649
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:31,330
and I'm really concerned that
our male model in underutilized.

650
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:32,998
So we're just keeping
our fingers crossed

651
00:26:33,032 --> 00:26:34,500
that everything looks good,

652
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:36,802
and tomorrow at the reveal
stage, we'll find out.

653
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,921
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

654
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:58,957
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

655
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,759
But before we
see your creations,

656
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:03,095
say hello to our series judges.

657
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:05,664
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

658
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:07,499
- Good evening.
- Hello.

659
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,968
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

660
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,037
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Ve.

661
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:14,373
And creature and concept
designer Neville Page.

662
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,008
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.

663
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:17,242
All right, guys, so this week,

664
00:27:17,277 --> 00:27:19,611
I changed things up
a little bit on you.

665
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,413
Your Spotlight Challenge
was to create

666
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,348
two body-painted characters--

667
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:24,683
an insect queen

668
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:26,919
and a companion character
of your choice.

669
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:29,721
Your creations were photographed
in their habitats yesterday,

670
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:32,858
so let's take a look
at the final images.

671
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:35,294
I've lost two
contestants in a row,

672
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,396
but I still have
Adam, Logan, and Rob,

673
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,965
and I think all three
of these guys have the chops

674
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:41,233
to take it all the way.

675
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:45,471
So I just hope their images
stand out onstage.

676
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,591
This definitely looks
like a complete insect,

677
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,893
regal, queenlike character.

678
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:10,429
You almost can't tell
Armando's a person under there.

679
00:28:10,463 --> 00:28:11,864
I think it looks fantastic.

680
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:34,553
There's definitely some issues
with the position of the models.

681
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,022
It looks like the wings are
coming out of the female's neck,

682
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:38,290
instead of back.

683
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:41,226
I'm really hoping
that we'll be safe.

684
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:00,546
The light isn't
hitting it right.

685
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,947
It looks just like a flat image,

686
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:04,550
and the earth tones
that I put on there

687
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:05,617
are really muddy-looking.

688
00:29:05,652 --> 00:29:08,020
I'm really worried
about this one.

689
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,804
We're so happy.

690
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:27,973
Like, it just looks
the way we wanted it to,

691
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:31,143
so we hope that the judges
like it as well.

692
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:50,929
I'm starting to notice that
there needs to be more darks

693
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:53,432
in certain areas
and lights in other areas.

694
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:57,069
I'm worried about this one.

695
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:02,474
All right, judges,
why don't you take a closer look

696
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:04,977
at the photos?

697
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,617
This is really clever
the way they used

698
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:13,085
that second body, I think.

699
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,853
So smart.
The whole thing

700
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:16,288
is one big illustration.

701
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,890
There's a lot of
attention paid to creating

702
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:21,593
a false light source,
and it makes everything pop.

703
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:22,961
Yeah.

704
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:27,966
So I guess their second person
must be the wings,

705
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,568
'cause I can see the hand
on the outside.

706
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:30,836
Right.

707
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,071
It just feels
like it's an underutilization

708
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:34,806
of that body.

709
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:37,576
I'm really scared
because the wings may look

710
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,544
just a little bit too high up,
or they're gonna think

711
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,814
that we should've utilized
the male model more.

712
00:30:42,815 --> 00:30:44,415
_

713
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:45,917
Oh, don't be too harsh.

714
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:47,619
It's my first time
body-painting.

715
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:50,288
Ugh.
This is not good.

716
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:56,128
Tell us who made your favorite
body-painting tonight

717
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:58,964
on Twitter, using #FaceOff

718
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,349
So I guess their second person
must be the wings.

719
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:07,352
I'm worried because
the judges are gonna think

720
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:10,055
that we should've utilized the
male model a little bit more.

721
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:12,057
I like the way
the wings are painted.

722
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:14,259
I'm not as crazy
about the body paint

723
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:16,194
on the featured performer.

724
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:22,367
You guys understand what
we're looking at there

725
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:23,869
with the second body?

726
00:31:23,903 --> 00:31:26,205
I don't know what
that second body is.

727
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,673
Her left thigh is gorgeous.

728
00:31:27,707 --> 00:31:29,475
You just don't see it
on the rest of the body.

729
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:30,642
- Yeah.
- You don't.

730
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:33,545
Unfortunately, I think
the ladybug is dreadful.

731
00:31:33,546 --> 00:31:35,654
_

732
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,287
Wow.
This is really pretty.

733
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:44,223
Look at the striations
in her legs.

734
00:31:44,257 --> 00:31:46,992
I love the additional texture

735
00:31:47,026 --> 00:31:49,595
on her shoulders and chest too.

736
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,533
The camouflage is successful,

737
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,902
but it doesn't complement
the main figure.

738
00:31:56,936 --> 00:31:58,337
I love the colors,

739
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:01,006
but I feel the fact that they
put that black muzzle on her

740
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,675
is kind of not a good idea.

741
00:32:07,614 --> 00:32:09,648
All right, guys,
the judges would like to speak

742
00:32:09,682 --> 00:32:12,417
with each of you to find out
more about your work.

743
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:15,320
Logan and Julian,
please step forward.

744
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:21,927
Tell me how your chosen insect

745
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:24,029
inspired you
to create this body makeup.

746
00:32:24,063 --> 00:32:25,764
I observed that the abdomen

747
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:27,866
had a starkly different
color scheme

748
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,334
from the upper part of the body

749
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:31,036
and it would be
a good opportunity

750
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,906
to incorporate the second model
in that part of the bug.

751
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:38,110
We had some guidance from the
coaches, Laura in particular.

752
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,480
I fabricated the wings and
mainly painted the male model.

753
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:44,416
I predominately took on
the female model.

754
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,052
I think you were
incredibly successful.

755
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:48,653
Thank you very much.

756
00:32:48,688 --> 00:32:52,090
This is a brilliant use
of the two human forms.

757
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,525
I love the paint job.

758
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:56,661
I love the coloration,
the iridescence in the legs,

759
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:58,163
so I have to commend you
on that.

760
00:32:58,197 --> 00:32:59,498
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

761
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:02,734
I think it's really
a very smart choice,

762
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:04,436
the combination of the bodies,

763
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,005
getting that inverse leg
with his elbow.

764
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,473
Really, really good.

765
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:10,308
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

766
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:12,544
Logan and Julian,
if you please step back.

767
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,150
Thanks.

768
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:20,585
Darla and Stephanie,
you're next.

769
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:28,827
Would you please tell us
what insect you had

770
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,595
and who did what
on the character?

771
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,164
We had the jewel beetle.

772
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:35,000
I was focusing primarily
on the male model.

773
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:36,334
I fabricated the wings

774
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:37,836
and applied them
and painted them.

775
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,338
I did most of the painting
on the female.

776
00:33:40,373 --> 00:33:42,007
I think you made a big mistake

777
00:33:42,041 --> 00:33:46,778
by not camouflaging
your model's breasts.

778
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:49,548
They're accentuated, which
gives her a more human form

779
00:33:49,582 --> 00:33:51,483
than it does an insect form.

780
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:55,120
The jarring thing
is really the wing placement,

781
00:33:55,154 --> 00:33:58,523
because it starts to feel like
it's more connected to her head,

782
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:00,425
but the graphic design
feels good.

783
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:04,563
It's just
some missed opportunities.

784
00:34:04,597 --> 00:34:06,264
Thank you.
Please step back.

785
00:34:10,937 --> 00:34:12,671
All right,
let's talk to Rob and Adam.

786
00:34:19,946 --> 00:34:23,548
Tell us how your insect
inspired this design.

787
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:26,284
I thought it would be
a fun play on visuals

788
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:28,653
to do the Sistine Chapel's
God and Adam.

789
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:31,923
I did the ladybug queen.
I outlined the face.

790
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,159
Rob came in and did
some hard lines on the face.

791
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:38,263
And then I laid the base
coat down for the larva itself.

792
00:34:38,297 --> 00:34:41,399
The ladybug doesn't feel
elegant or queenlike.

793
00:34:43,336 --> 00:34:45,837
I just can't get away
from the face.

794
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:50,242
It has almost a Cowardly Lion,
kabuki hybrid going on,

795
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:52,110
and that's a big problem.

796
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:54,512
So have either one of you
been to a county fair?

797
00:34:54,547 --> 00:34:55,580
Not in a while.

798
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,115
Okay, well,
you could've fooled me,

799
00:34:57,149 --> 00:34:58,516
because the face on the ladybug

800
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:02,087
looks like a little kid's
painting at a county fair.

801
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:04,756
She's a queen. You should've
made her beautiful.

802
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,726
This is not working for me.

803
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,694
Rob and Adam, please step back.

804
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:17,836
Emily and Jamie,
please come forward.

805
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,610
Tell me about the insect you had

806
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:27,779
and how it inspired
your makeups.

807
00:35:27,813 --> 00:35:29,948
So our insect is a honey bee,

808
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:32,484
and our story
behind our queen bee

809
00:35:32,518 --> 00:35:36,021
is that one of the drones
have fallen in love with her,

810
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,856
but she's kind of giving him--

811
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,857
The buzz-off?

812
00:35:38,891 --> 00:35:39,858
Yeah.

813
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:43,862
And division of labor?

814
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,298
Emily focused mainly
on the female,

815
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:48,400
and I focused on the male.

816
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:51,503
I think you guys
did a great job.

817
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:54,072
The way that you created
an insect-y feeling

818
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:57,075
with the broken-up panels,
it's a stunning final image.

819
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:58,243
Thank you.

820
00:35:58,277 --> 00:36:00,111
Emily, I have to compliment you
on this queen.

821
00:36:00,146 --> 00:36:02,247
The face makeup is

822
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:04,449
one of the prettiest paint jobs
I've seen on this show.

823
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:06,451
Really well done.
Congratulations.

824
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:08,253
Thank you.

825
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:10,121
Emily and Jamie,
you can step back.

826
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:17,429
Ben and Kelly, you're up.

827
00:36:21,634 --> 00:36:23,101
Tell us what insect you had

828
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:25,203
and how it inspired
your creations.

829
00:36:25,237 --> 00:36:27,105
We had the European hornet.

830
00:36:27,139 --> 00:36:30,408
My original concept was
to integrate the second model

831
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:31,643
to be the abdomen,

832
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:34,779
but Ben was very driven
to blend the second model

833
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:36,047
into the background.

834
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,682
Now, Ben,
how do you think they are

835
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,017
as two characters together?

836
00:36:39,051 --> 00:36:40,785
I don't think they go together.

837
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,455
I really wanted to do
a camouflage pattern.

838
00:36:43,489 --> 00:36:45,156
I felt strongly about it.

839
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:47,058
I have problems
with your female.

840
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:50,962
Her face looks
very animalistic.

841
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:55,967
It looks more like a muzzle
than it is insect-looking.

842
00:36:56,002 --> 00:36:58,036
Did you guys work well
together on this one?

843
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,906
We pretty much just worked
on our own, for the most part.

844
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:05,343
'Cause it definitely
feels like you guys were doing

845
00:37:05,378 --> 00:37:08,346
two separate things that
ultimately work independently,

846
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:12,784
but as a unit,
I just find it boring.

847
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:15,120
I hate it as an overall image.

848
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:16,588
I think there's some good work
within it,

849
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:18,957
but here's the thing
about a team challenge--

850
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:21,659
it requires teamwork
to succeed.

851
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:24,863
Thank you.
You can step down.

852
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:32,470
All right, please head
back to the makeup room

853
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:34,072
while the judges deliberate.

854
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,847
Let's talk
about this week's makeups.

855
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:45,150
Why don't we start
with Logan and Julian?

856
00:37:45,184 --> 00:37:46,284
I love the makeup.

857
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:48,486
Really good integration
of the second character,

858
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:51,122
using it as the abdomen
for the wasp.

859
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:54,726
I think Logan's paint job
was absolutely gorgeous on that.

860
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,294
They knocked it
out of the park for me.

861
00:37:56,328 --> 00:37:59,064
The thing that impressed me
the most was the fact

862
00:37:59,098 --> 00:38:03,501
that they had addressed every
square inch on both bodies.

863
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:06,304
It actually looked
like exoskeleton plating.

864
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:09,240
All right, judges, let's
move on to Darla and Stephanie.

865
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,242
This is in the middle for me,

866
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:12,944
because it just
didn't quite get there,

867
00:38:12,978 --> 00:38:14,512
but it is not a total failure.

868
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:17,115
I actually think that the
painting on the wings is superb.

869
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:20,718
I felt that they didn't take
advantage of their second model.

870
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:23,088
I saw it as lost opportunity.

871
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:25,757
They highlighted
the whole bosom area,

872
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:29,594
which was a mistake, because
that said human right there.

873
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:32,464
All right, let's move on
to Emily and Jamie.

874
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:35,166
It's the graphic design
of this that makes it so beautiful.

875
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:37,669
I really like the
composition of their photograph,

876
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:38,870
and I like their story.

877
00:38:38,904 --> 00:38:39,971
The queen is gorgeous.

878
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,940
And Jamie's execution

879
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:45,110
felt appropriate
for a drone worker bee.

880
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:48,179
Judges, let's move on
to Rob and Adam.

881
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:52,183
Rob's responsible for that
hard line graphic to the face,

882
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:54,018
which is the biggest problem.

883
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:55,320
And it could have been pretty,

884
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:57,989
but this was just
a hokey-dokey paint job.

885
00:38:58,023 --> 00:39:01,059
All right, judges,
let's move on to Ben and Kelly.

886
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:02,894
She painted a black
muzzle on this thing,

887
00:39:02,928 --> 00:39:04,429
which gave it
an animalistic look.

888
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:06,431
Ben's camouflage
is more complex.

889
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:08,032
I don't know
that I needed to see it.

890
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:11,836
He came into it adamant
that he was doing camouflage.

891
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:13,738
This was not a team challenge
for them.

892
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:15,773
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

893
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:16,975
Yes, we have.

894
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:19,010
Okay, let's bring 'em back out.

895
00:39:26,785 --> 00:39:29,821
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

896
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:31,689
Logan and Julian,

897
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:33,758
you did a great job
with your color palette,

898
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:35,793
and we love
the unconventional choice

899
00:39:35,828 --> 00:39:37,462
to turn your two models
into one.

900
00:39:37,496 --> 00:39:39,430
Emily and Jamie,

901
00:39:39,465 --> 00:39:41,833
we thought you achieved
some truly beautiful forms,

902
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:43,501
particularly on the queen,

903
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:46,871
and your partnership produced
a striking final image.

904
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,540
All right, Glenn,
which team came out on top?

905
00:39:48,574 --> 00:39:51,442
The top team tonight is...

906
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:57,703
So, Glenn,
which team came out on top?

907
00:39:57,738 --> 00:40:02,108
The top team tonight is...

908
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:03,576
Logan and Julian.

909
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,247
The way that you used
your models as one

910
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,716
is something
that could've gone really wrong,

911
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:12,518
but you managed it
incredibly well,

912
00:40:12,553 --> 00:40:14,353
and you gave us
quite a provocative image.

913
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:15,455
- Well done.
- Thanks very much.

914
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:16,522
Thank you.

915
00:40:16,557 --> 00:40:18,357
Logan and Julian,
excellent work,

916
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:20,893
but as you know,
we can only have one winner.

917
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:21,961
Glenn?

918
00:40:21,995 --> 00:40:25,131
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

919
00:40:25,165 --> 00:40:26,299
Logan.

920
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,770
Good job, buddy.

921
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:34,040
There was a lot of great stuff
going on in your image,

922
00:40:34,074 --> 00:40:35,575
but it was the queen

923
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:36,642
that was the standout.

924
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:37,844
I appreciate it.

925
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:39,712
I win the body-painting
challenge,

926
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:41,180
and I've never done it before
in my life.

927
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:43,516
If I can do a body-painting
challenge and win,

928
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,650
then I think I can do

929
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:46,452
just about any challenge
on the show and win.

930
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:50,022
All right, Logan,
you, Julian, Emily, Jamie,

931
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:52,191
and Darla and Stephanie
are all safe

932
00:40:52,226 --> 00:40:54,894
and can head back to the makeup
room along with the coaches.

933
00:40:54,928 --> 00:40:57,497
- Seriously?
- Oh, shit.

934
00:40:57,531 --> 00:40:58,831
Okay.

935
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:06,272
That means the rest of you
are on the bottom this week,

936
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:08,741
and one of you
will be going home.

937
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:10,076
If you'll please step forward.

938
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:20,186
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

939
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,854
Adam and Rob,

940
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:24,457
we loved
some of the finer details,

941
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:28,094
but the broader graphic design
was flawed.

942
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:29,862
Ben and Kelly,

943
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:32,498
there were redeeming elements
of your makeups,

944
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,567
but your poor teamwork showed

945
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:36,602
in the image
presented to us this evening.

946
00:41:36,637 --> 00:41:38,704
So who is going home tonight?

947
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:40,840
The person
going home tonight is...

948
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:49,448
Rob.

949
00:41:49,483 --> 00:41:52,184
While you didn't do
anything horrific,

950
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,486
we had a really hard time

951
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,088
distinguishing any standout
contribution of yours

952
00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:57,423
in these creations.

953
00:41:57,457 --> 00:41:58,791
Okay.

954
00:41:58,825 --> 00:42:01,994
Rob, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

955
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:05,998
That means Adam, Kelly, and Ben,
you guys are all safe this week

956
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:07,400
and can head back
to the makeup room.

957
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:15,174
Rob, I know you guys are better
than what you presented us,

958
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:17,877
so I really look forward to
seeing what you come up with

959
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,879
in the future,
and good luck, darling.

960
00:42:19,913 --> 00:42:21,347
Thank you so much.

961
00:42:21,381 --> 00:42:23,683
Rob, it's been so great
having you here with us,

962
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:25,585
but if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

963
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,086
and pack up your kit.

964
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,621
Thanks, guys,
really appreciate it.

965
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:29,755
Good luck, Rob.

966
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,890
Yeah, I'm a little surprised.

967
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,291
You know, for being
my first body-paint,

968
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:34,961
I think it was a great job.

969
00:42:34,995 --> 00:42:36,596
- Oh!
- No, Rob.

970
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,497
- What?
- Yeah.

971
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:41,462
_

972
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:42,962
_

973
00:42:43,136 --> 00:42:45,004
My family is my life,
and it's hard

974
00:42:45,038 --> 00:42:47,673
because I wanted to win it
for them,

975
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:50,309
but they're gonna be really
proud of me for what I did.

976
00:42:50,344 --> 00:42:51,544
It's been a blast.

977
00:42:51,578 --> 00:42:53,346
I've done a lot of things
I'm happy with.

978
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,115
I've met a lot of great people,
and I don't regret a thing.
