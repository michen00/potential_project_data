1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:02,900
This was a very smart direction
to take it.

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,802
It's lackluster this week.

3
00:00:04,854 --> 00:00:07,872
It is spot-on, perfect.

4
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,340
Previously on<i> Face Off,</i>

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:12,643
Adam's imaginative monster
brought him his first win,

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,246
but Ben's design decisions
sent him home,

7
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,315
making Anthony
the first returning champion

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,583
to be eliminated.

9
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,587
Now only five artists remain,

10
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,623
and tonight they'll toy
with disturbing designs.

11
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:28,059
So scary.

12
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,227
Oh, my God.

13
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,695
But as the finale approaches,

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,163
some artists will crack.

15
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,531
Are you talking
about starting over?

16
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,532
Yeah.

17
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:35,866
Today is lost.

18
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,101
Holy shit!

19
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,769
That's it, I'm done.

20
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:41,539
It is absolutely thrilling.

21
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,341
In the end, only one will win

22
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,676
a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

23
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,379
to one of their 85
international locations,

24
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:51,315
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

25
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,517
and $100,000.

26
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,221
This is<i> Face Off.</i>

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,860
What's up, brogan?

29
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,863
I'm starting to feel,
like, creatively drained.

30
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,649
I didn't do so well in
the last spotlight challenge.

31
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,668
And we're all just
exhausted at this point.

32
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,136
I can't stand whimsical.

33
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,187
We're almost done.

34
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:47,188
You're almost to the finale.

35
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:48,472
Just push through it.

36
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,441
A big part of the reason
for being here

37
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,543
was because
of my younger brother Brent.

38
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,078
He has NBIA,

39
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,547
which is a neurologic illness.

40
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:58,899
I'm trying to raise awareness,

41
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,584
and if I win the money,

42
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,453
I would donate
a large portion of it

43
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,021
to research for his disease.

44
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,506
We've got our
work cut out for us.

45
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,124
Definitely, but we can do it.

46
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,126
If I'm gonna get
to this finale and win,

47
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,628
I'm really gonna have
to bring my A-game.

48
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,063
Team Laura in the finale.

49
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,098
Top five and Team Laura
in the finale.

50
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,050
We walk into the Bob
Baker Marionette Theater,

51
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:35,686
and I'm so excited.

52
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,488
I love the energy of puppets,

53
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:40,057
and I think it's so cool to see
all the different marionettes,

54
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,259
and I can't wait to hear
what our challenge is.

55
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,196
Hey, guys.

56
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,430
- Hey.
- Hi.

57
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:50,267
Welcome to the historic
Bob Baker Marionette Theater.

58
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,571
Bob Baker was a legendary
puppeteer and marionette maker

59
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,374
who spent a lifetime
creating incredible pieces

60
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,510
to appear alongside some
of Hollywood's biggest icons,

61
00:02:59,545 --> 00:03:02,079
like Judy Garland
and Elvis Presley.

62
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,532
His work has also appeared
in major motion pictures,

63
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,684
like<i> Close Encounters</i>
<i>Of The Third Kind</i>

64
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,552
and<i> Addams Family Values.</i>

65
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,121
It's pretty amazing, huh?

66
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,288
Oh, this is awesome.

67
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,008
This enchanted setting
is the perfect backdrop

68
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,559
for your spotlight challenge,

69
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,511
because this week
you'll be creating

70
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:21,732
and original character
inspired by a classic doll.

71
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:26,954
I'm pretty positive
that this is gonna be

72
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,323
another whimsical challenge,
so I'm worried.

73
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,777
I have brought seven

74
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,546
classic dolls
for you to choose from.

75
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:37,364
However, before you
make our choices,

76
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,151
there's something else you need
to know about the dolls.

77
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,335
Of course.

78
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,388
Not all cultures
consider them child's play.

79
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,094
That's so scary.

80
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,112
Oh, my God.

81
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,630
This darker side
of the doll world

82
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,832
has led to some
iconic horror films,

83
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,534
like<i> Poltergeist,</i>

84
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,902
<i>The Conjuring,</i>

85
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,904
and of course, <i>Child's Play.</i>

86
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,872
So for this week's
spotlight challenge,

87
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,208
you won't be creating
something happy and pretty.

88
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,570
_

89
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,245
You'll be creating an evil,
demonic doll character

90
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,798
inspired by one of these dolls.

91
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,817
Oh, God.

92
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,185
Logan, you're up first.

93
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,788
Voodoo doll.

94
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,123
Ventriloquist.

95
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,324
Baby.

96
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,559
Porcelain doll.

97
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,993
The ragdoll.

98
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,094
Oh.

99
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,764
This is so creepy.

100
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,898
Now, I want you to make sure

101
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,700
that you tap into
the colors, materials,

102
00:04:29,735 --> 00:04:33,037
and cultural history
of your dolls for inspiration.

103
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,739
See you guys on the reveal stage
in a few days.

104
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,424
Have fun, and good luck.

105
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:38,909
Bye.

106
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,050
I'm actually pretty excited.

107
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,034
This is pretty fun.

108
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,352
I picked the baby doll,

109
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,187
and I decide that my character

110
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,523
is used for religious practice.

111
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,525
When a human touches
the baby doll,

112
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,061
that human's life-force
is sucked into the doll.

113
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,264
I come up with this doll face
that's cracked open,

114
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,534
with a tentacle monster
on the inside of it.

115
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:08,772
I actually had a porcelain doll

116
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,641
when I was a little girl,

117
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,761
so this is bringing back
a lot of memories.

118
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,981
I think a good way
to make this doll really creepy

119
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,817
is to make it appear broken.

120
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:21,919
I'm going to keep the classic

121
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,954
porcelain doll
shape of the face,

122
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,774
but then add a lot
of cracking texture.

123
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,959
I'm pretty excited
about this concept.

124
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,198
I picked the voodoo doll

125
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,533
because there
are certain elements

126
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,767
about the voodoo doll itself--

127
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,402
the stitching, the burlap--

128
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,671
that are very unique
as opposed to the other dolls.

129
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,406
I decide that my character
is a child

130
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,809
who was tortured with
a voodoo doll relentlessly,

131
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,846
to the point where it started
to transform him physically.

132
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,198
So I'm turning a man
into a doll.

133
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,886
I am so excited.

134
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,188
I picked the ragdoll.

135
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,024
I decide that the family dog

136
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,993
took this ragdoll
out in the rain, ripped it up,

137
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,195
then the little girl brought it
back into the house.

138
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,498
And it's soaking wet,
and it starts to mold,

139
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,266
and it's slowly
killing the family

140
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,268
by releasing mold spores.

141
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,938
Oh, God, it's so creepy.

142
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,539
I picked
the ventriloquist dummy

143
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,775
just 'cause I've always been
kind of creeped out by it

144
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,026
since I was little.

145
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:23,130
My concept is that he was carved
out of a sacred tree

146
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:25,115
by a witch to be her minion.

147
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,252
So I want to incorporate
wood texture into the sculpt,

148
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,888
try to figure out how to get
a rigid jaw piece

149
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,157
to get that flapping motion.

150
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,292
All right, guys,
let's head back to the lab.

151
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,300
We have five
hours in the lab today,

152
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,502
and my priority is not even
to think about the face.

153
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,088
It's just to get the chest done.

154
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,758
There's no exceptions.

155
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:54,545
Since I'm creating
a ripped-fabric look,

156
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,846
I need to find something

157
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,315
that will give it
that fabric texture.

158
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,302
And I see crepe wool,
which is used for hair work.

159
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,436
That'd be neat.

160
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:04,655
It's exactly
what I want to sculpt,

161
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,157
so I'm not gonna sculpt it;
I'm gonna mold it.

162
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,659
What are you trying to do?

163
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:10,594
I'm making a mold
of this texture,

164
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,930
so then I can put the clay in it
to get the fabric.

165
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,131
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

166
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,332
Once I have my mold,

167
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,551
I roll out the clay
into little logs,

168
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,269
and I press it into the mold,

169
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,106
and then I just pull them apart
and place it all over the chest.

170
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,748
All right.

171
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,732
Hey, Laura.

172
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,950
Hey, how you guys doing?

173
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,151
I'm great.

174
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,152
Oh, gosh, where are the dolls?

175
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,320
They're over
in the corner there.

176
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,738
Oh, my God, they're creepy.

177
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,772
Yeah.

178
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:39,773
You excited
about this challenge?

179
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:40,758
Yeah.

180
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,976
I got the baby doll,

181
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,344
so I came up with a story

182
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,264
where a baby is a portal
for demons to come through.

183
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,666
I think if you
can pull this off,

184
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,767
it'd be great.

185
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,435
But if everyone is just
doing faces and cowls,

186
00:07:51,487 --> 00:07:53,437
they're gonna be able
to put more time into that.

187
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:54,605
Right.

188
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,324
Which could make their faces
and cowls look better,

189
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,325
if you're not careful.

190
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:59,343
I understand.

191
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,678
I don't want Logan and Adam

192
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,447
to lose that risk factor.

193
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,249
I don't want them
to play it so safe

194
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,134
that it bores everyone.

195
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,653
But it's getting that time
in the competition

196
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,822
where you can't have
one slip-up.

197
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,491
I only have two artists
left on my team.

198
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:16,226
I don't want to lose
anyone else.

199
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,814
I'm gonna do
a broken porcelain doll.

200
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,999
Oh, it's so creepy.

201
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,500
Once it's glued back together,

202
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,536
the little girl doesn't want
to play with it anymore,

203
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,156
so then the cracks are now
where the evil comes from.

204
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,858
You could actually
exaggerate the head,

205
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:31,859
I think, a little bit.

206
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:32,860
A little bit further?

207
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:33,944
- Further.
- Yeah.

208
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,162
If I sculpt the head

209
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,381
just a little bit too big
for the body,

210
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,617
that'll really help kind of
sell the creepy factor.

211
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,352
And that's exactly what I want.

212
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,824
After I finish the chest piece,

213
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,625
I run it to the mold room
and start molding

214
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,561
as fast as I can.

215
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,712
I need to get this done

216
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,831
so I can start
sculpting the face.

217
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,503
Hi, everybody.

218
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:00,537
- Hey.
- Hey.

219
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,538
Hi.

220
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,790
- Hi, Logan.
- Hey, Mr. Westmore.

221
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:04,141
How are you?

222
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,043
I'm essentially creating
a human-voodoo doll hybrid

223
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,394
- these will be forms...
- Okay.

224
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,879
...to which I will
apply the burlap

225
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:10,714
where it's been
infused into the flesh.

226
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,849
That should work very well.

227
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,217
When you get down
to your edges here,

228
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,818
make sure you get
all those down,

229
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,454
as opposed to getting
a hard edge right there.

230
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,455
All right.

231
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,274
This baby doll
is actually a portal

232
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,825
for demonic possession.

233
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,695
There's something
coming through the doll

234
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,597
from hell or another dimension.

235
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,432
You're really going way out.

236
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,433
Yeah.

237
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,434
Be careful.

238
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,652
Don't lose "baby doll,"

239
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,904
that you all of a sudden
wind up making a monster...

240
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:34,905
Right.

241
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,073
That doesn't really relate

242
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,641
to what the challenge is.

243
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,543
I understand what
Mr. Westmore has to say,

244
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:43,313
but I don't want to put a big,
baby-headed doll out there.

245
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,015
I'd rather go complete 180

246
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,918
and at least make something
different that stands out.

247
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,887
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you very much.

248
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,222
I selected
the ventriloquist dummy.

249
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,224
This is actually
gonna be wood grain here?

250
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,192
Yes.

251
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:56,660
Old carved wood.

252
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,612
Okay, I like what you're
doing with the mouth here.

253
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:01,498
Now, you can glue this down
nice and tight,

254
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,118
so when he does open his mouth,

255
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,253
that will work the same way.

256
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:07,688
Okay.

257
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,706
So this is the porcelain doll.

258
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,824
Porcelain doll.

259
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,975
I'm gonna make it
look as though

260
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,977
it's broken into large pieces

261
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,612
that have been glued
back together.

262
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,632
You've got such a nice
base sculpture going for you.

263
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,633
Be careful with the cracks now.

264
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:20,651
Okay.

265
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,369
Usually there's a major spot,

266
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,788
and then from the place
they've originally cracked from,

267
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,023
it thins.

268
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,724
It's almost like a few
little branches off of it.

269
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:28,759
Yep.

270
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,861
Now, you have the ragdoll.

271
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,496
What are you planning
on your facial sculpture?

272
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,448
I'm going to make button eyes,

273
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:38,101
and have one here, one that
kind of popped and falls.

274
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:39,353
You know what'd be interesting

275
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,955
is to take
some good-size thread

276
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,674
and attach it up in here

277
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,443
so it looks like the thread
has actually come loose.

278
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,162
- Good luck.
- Thank you so much.

279
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:49,580
Good luck, everybody.

280
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,098
Your sculptures look wonderful.

281
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,249
- Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.

282
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,500
Thank you.

283
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:02,359
My mold's not very ready.

284
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:05,045
But if I don't get
this chest done today,

285
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,530
I will be so far behind.

286
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,198
So I need to open it now.

287
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,499
As I pull it apart,

288
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,469
it opens nice, but then...

289
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,638
Holy shit!

290
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,207
It just falls.

291
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,843
I expect to see this mold
just in pieces

292
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:20,844
when I lift it up.

293
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:22,062
Oh, no.

294
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:23,513
And all I'm thinking is,

295
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:25,315
"That's it, I'm done."

296
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:33,797
It's the first day
of our creepy doll challenge.

297
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:35,749
And as I pull it apart,

298
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:38,618
my chest mold just falls.

299
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,454
Holy shit!

300
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:43,573
I expect to see this mold
just in pieces.

301
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:46,326
But I pull it up,
and the mold is thick enough

302
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,695
where it was able
to take the blow.

303
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,280
Wow.

304
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:52,582
How did that not break?

305
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,568
It has a slight crack in it.

306
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,952
But then I realize

307
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:58,255
it's supposed to have
that distressed look anyway,

308
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,456
so it's okay.

309
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,334
So what are these gonna be?

310
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,736
Burlap.

311
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,838
I think it'd be much easier
to lay the burlap over the top,

312
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:16,840
instead of sculpting
the burlap.

313
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,643
I essentially need to sculpt in
basic forms on the face

314
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,077
to represent burlap.

315
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:23,613
And I'm usually very receptive
to Rayce's inputs,

316
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,849
but he's got his own aesthetic;
I have mine.

317
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:26,917
It's not that I'm trying

318
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:28,885
to, like, totally
disrupt your design.

319
00:12:28,921 --> 00:12:31,221
It would actually be
more realistic.

320
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,640
All right, are you
talking about starting over?

321
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:35,058
To do that, yeah.

322
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,126
Ultimately, this is my project.

323
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:37,294
This is my character.

324
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,129
It's my responsibility
and my burden.

325
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:40,914
Rayce is my coach.

326
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:43,066
But he's been right repeatedly.

327
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:44,367
So this is challenging.

328
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:48,972
That's looking better?

329
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:50,340
Yeah, I think that's great.

330
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,192
Looks like you're
in a good direction.

331
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:53,193
Have fun.

332
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:54,711
See you.

333
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:55,695
See you, guys.

334
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,247
- Later.
- See you later.

335
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:58,248
- Bye.
- See you.

336
00:12:58,283 --> 00:12:59,549
One hour.

337
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,821
I know I want to distort
the human face a lot.

338
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:07,057
I'm just worried
about pulling it off

339
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,742
in a way that doesn't
look goofy.

340
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,377
I'm just starting to take
into consideration

341
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:11,811
how to turn up the flow

342
00:13:11,863 --> 00:13:14,798
and go in and out
of the pieces of the face.

343
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,199
I really love it.

344
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,325
Day one is winding down.

345
00:13:25,377 --> 00:13:28,912
Finally I realize that
I originally had liked my plan.

346
00:13:28,964 --> 00:13:31,715
I just needed
to execute it better.

347
00:13:31,717 --> 00:13:34,017
There's no point in wasting time
or crying over it.

348
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:36,202
And I tear the clay
all the way off

349
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,138
to essentially just reset.

350
00:13:38,173 --> 00:13:40,724
This is not a great way
to start out the challenge.

351
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,727
I look around, and I see a lot
of progress everywhere else,

352
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:45,562
and zero progress on my face.

353
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:47,197
That's time, everybody.

354
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,915
Today is lost.

355
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,800
And for the first time
in the competition,

356
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:53,370
I'm leaving the lab
without being satisfied.

357
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:54,704
And that worries me.

358
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,274
It's too close to the finale
to be going home.

359
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:09,686
Morning!

360
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:10,987
Good morning.

361
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:13,490
It's day two
of our creepy doll challenge.

362
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,292
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

363
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:18,461
First thing that I need to do
is finish both of these sculpts.

364
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:19,529
What I'm gonna do is

365
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:21,998
have these little cracks
in certain areas.

366
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,283
Cool.

367
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:26,469
I start adding really small,
fine cracking detail,

368
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,306
as if it's an infection
that's spreading.

369
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:31,441
I'm really happy with the way
things are looking,

370
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:33,276
but I do need to get
into the mold room

371
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:35,045
about halfway through the day
to make sure

372
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,079
that I have enough time

373
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:38,081
to get both of the molds
ready for foam.

374
00:14:40,118 --> 00:14:41,584
So creepy.

375
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,207
So you started over.

376
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,709
Rayce notices that I've
removed the entire face.

377
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,628
What made you start over?

378
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:53,063
I think I threw
clay on too fast,

379
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:55,065
and it just didn't look right.

380
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,700
I'm gonna start
with a foundation.

381
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:58,668
Then, on top of that,
I can build detail.

382
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,103
It's more authentic that way.

383
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:04,107
I need to more deliberately
lay down the seams, you know?

384
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,876
I'm a little shocked, but...

385
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:08,044
I actually really like the idea

386
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,713
that Logan decided
to start from scratch,

387
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,448
because now he's
going to be able

388
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:14,050
to put in some more
anatomically correct forms,

389
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:15,185
and I think that the burlap's

390
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:17,854
gonna lay over
those forms better.

391
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:24,778
If you go too far
with the texture...

392
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,329
It might come off
as, like, a wooden...

393
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:28,932
It will come off as,
like, a tree-type creature.

394
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:30,100
In order to give this cowl

395
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:31,701
the appearance
that it's made of wood,

396
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,319
I start sculpting lines

397
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:36,189
on the side
of the back of the head.

398
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:38,942
I've never sculpted hair before.

399
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:42,929
And I've only just now
sculpted wood texture.

400
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:45,165
So I'm trying to do
two different things

401
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,601
that I've never done before
in one sculpt.

402
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:51,838
It's a little more difficult
than I pictured.

403
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,279
This wig is the ugliest wig
in the wig room.

404
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:04,167
I'm going to create
a jute dreadlock yarn wig.

405
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:07,003
I take a hideous blonde wig,

406
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:09,539
cut off the top,
pre-cut some jute,

407
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,491
and I start gluing it down,

408
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:14,978
and then I start to unravel
the jute to break it up

409
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,813
and give it more
of a distressed look,

410
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:19,048
but it's taking forever.

411
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,250
Is there a power tool

412
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:21,651
or something you could use
to create it?

413
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:24,154
Laura suggests
that I start sanding it.

414
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,074
It's working beautifully,

415
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:30,610
and it's taking
a lot less time.

416
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:35,432
I'm looking at Adam's sculpture,

417
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:37,834
and there are some things
that are just

418
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:39,302
really throwing me off.

419
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,004
I think it would be wise

420
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,722
to bring out some of the doll.

421
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,174
I'm trying to get away

422
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:46,176
from this person in a doll mask

423
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:47,310
as much as I can.

424
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:48,678
I'm just really concerned.

425
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,346
He could save this
in the paint,

426
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,098
but I'm really worried.

427
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,317
You just want to be careful
with going too extreme.

428
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:55,952
Rayce just keeps telling me

429
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:57,804
that I may be sidestepping
the challenge

430
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,255
and not going "doll" enough.

431
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,691
I am going really big on this,

432
00:17:01,743 --> 00:17:03,993
and standing out
could put me on bottom.

433
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:06,563
I just don't want to put
a big baby out on the stage.

434
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:08,965
But now there's
this nagging worry.

435
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,534
I could be
just fucking this up.

436
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:14,504
I don't have time
to deal with this,

437
00:17:14,506 --> 00:17:15,972
but at the same time, I do know

438
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:18,391
that if it's not up to par
with everybody else,

439
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:19,909
it could send me home.

440
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,245
I'm just getting frustrated
at this point.

441
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:24,380
I'm completely lost
with my concept.

442
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,318
I'm worried about him
not reading "doll" enough.

443
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,153
It's day two
of our creepy doll challenge,

444
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:38,473
and Rayce is a little worried
that I'm not going "doll" enough

445
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,458
and that my character
could send me home.

446
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,544
Rayce is right.

447
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,546
It is really pushing
the boundary

448
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:46,748
of what this challenge is.

449
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,067
But in this competition,

450
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,868
it's more than just
addressing the challenge.

451
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,137
It's showing who you are
as an artist.

452
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,707
And I'm all about
pushing boundaries.

453
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,376
I love looking different.

454
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,645
So I decide to just
embrace this opportunity

455
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,698
and go out of the norm
and just have fun.

456
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,516
So I'm just moving forward.

457
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,794
All right,
I'm gonna let you go.

458
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,379
- We'll see you, good luck.
- See you.

459
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:19,414
Thank you much.

460
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:20,415
See you, guys.

461
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,416
Have fun.

462
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,634
For my voodoo doll,

463
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:23,952
I think it'd be neat
if there was a pin

464
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:25,536
going through him entirely.

465
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,939
I think that gives a more
interesting silhouette.

466
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,141
But I need to find the lightest
weight materials possible

467
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,209
to make this pin.

468
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,594
I find small-gauge
armature wire,

469
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,013
small foam tubing,

470
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:37,181
and actually a clown nose
made of foam.

471
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:41,219
I glue it down
and start painting.

472
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,972
I think it will definitely sell
the voodoo doll part of it,

473
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:45,923
as opposed
to just a burlap doll.

474
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,991
So I think that's something

475
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,526
that has to be a part
of my character.

476
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,994
Really like that.

477
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,995
Thanks, man.

478
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:51,996
Kind of want it.

479
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:59,303
My plan for the wig
is to do a hairstyle

480
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,639
like a porcelain doll
with the big curls

481
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:03,658
and just really try
and make this wig

482
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,328
as messy and dirty
and ugly as possible,

483
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:10,448
but still kind of fitting
that doll character.

484
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,385
Sick.

485
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,255
We have less than an hour,

486
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:19,924
and I make flat mold
specifically for the shoulder

487
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,026
that matches up with the top
of the chest piece,

488
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:23,961
and I have to get these done.

489
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:27,081
Oh, shit!

490
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:28,700
I just cracked my mold.

491
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,234
The most important flat mold

492
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,070
completely breaks
down the center.

493
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:34,906
I literally do not
have time for this,

494
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,908
so I'm just gonna scrap it,

495
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,743
but it's not good.

496
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,878
Shit.

497
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:41,929
That's time.

498
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,719
Now I don't have that piece.

499
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:50,755
I have to figure something out
during application.

500
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,990
I don't feel good,
and it sucks.

501
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,518
It's application day
for the doll challenge,

502
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:04,886
and we have four hours
in the lab

503
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,337
and one hour at last looks.

504
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:07,588
Pretty decent.

505
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,741
The first thing I do
is look at my foam pieces.

506
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,276
The edges around the eye
are great,

507
00:20:12,328 --> 00:20:13,945
and for the most part
everything else is.

508
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,880
Like, the wig's gonna
cover all this anyway.

509
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,265
The edges are nice and thin.

510
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,599
Ew.

511
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,685
Ew, Darla, that's sick.

512
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:22,820
But if those cracks
don't stand out,

513
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:25,456
then it's kind of
a wasted effort.

514
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,643
So I need to get
these pieces applied quickly

515
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,395
so that I leave myself a lot
of time for the paint job.

516
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,002
How are you?

517
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,187
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

518
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:40,304
Good to see you again.

519
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,141
So you're
a demonic porcelain doll.

520
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,175
- It's going to be awesome!
- Yeah.

521
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:46,878
I'm pre-painting the face piece,

522
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,179
and the details are coming out.

523
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,081
The tentacles look
nice and slimy.

524
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,918
I'm also applying a black
mesh screen around one eye.

525
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,570
This allows her
to see through it,

526
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,171
but because there's
no light inside,

527
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,973
it just looks
like an empty socket.

528
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,141
- Is that comfortable?
- Yeah.

529
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,726
I apply the face to my model.

530
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:03,361
It's actually fitting
really well.

531
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,029
I still have
to make the doll face

532
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,247
read more "doll face."

533
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:09,217
But it's looking
to be a promising character.

534
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,606
I need to start working
on this paint job.

535
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,475
Because this is a doll
that's supposed to be

536
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,243
from the 17th century,

537
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:23,214
I need to make sure that this
looks very, very old.

538
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:25,016
It looks like old paint, right?

539
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,217
Right.

540
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,935
If you find the place
that just doesn't

541
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:29,353
have a lot of visual interest,

542
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,289
just cover that up, or cover it
on the top of the head.

543
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,991
Laura suggests
I mix up some alginate

544
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,627
and apply it
onto the foam latex.

545
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,297
When it dries, it actually
starts to crack and shrink.

546
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:41,382
And this could be
a really cool texture

547
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,001
for chipped old paint.

548
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,172
Even if it does fray
a little bit and come up,

549
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,924
it'll actually
kind of add to the look.

550
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,909
I start laying in the burlap
on the face.

551
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:54,178
I take pieces that are bigger
than what I need,

552
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,013
adhere them, and then trim them

553
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,983
to sell the idea that this whole
thing is stitched together.

554
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,067
I think it looks great.

555
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:08,976
I start sponging
on a layer of pax paint

556
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:13,214
that has that sort of pink,
peach porcelain color to it.

557
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:16,334
And once I get the base layer
of pax on,

558
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,970
I use a wash
of alcohol-based paints

559
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,455
that I've thinned down
so it's very watery.

560
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:24,475
I brush this color
over the cracks,

561
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,912
and then I use a sponge
to wipe away any of the excess.

562
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,364
This is a little bit
of trial and error.

563
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,849
But now that I've got
the hang of it,

564
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:33,484
I'm just gonna
go to town with this.

565
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,952
- That's really cool.
- Thank you.

566
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:36,888
That's a nice effect.

567
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,756
Because I scrapped the shoulder,

568
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,392
I need to figure out
what I'm gonna do instead.

569
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,794
So I decide to use cotton
to fill it in,

570
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,930
because it's so much of a gap.

571
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,866
And I add thread to the edges

572
00:22:48,918 --> 00:22:51,719
so it looks like the doll
has been ripped apart

573
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,838
and all the stuffing
is coming out.

574
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,041
So now it looks
like it's a complete character.

575
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:09,604
I start to airbrush
a mocha-brown color

576
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:10,938
into all the creases,

577
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,391
and I start dry-brushing
with a highlighted color.

578
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:16,077
I've never done
this type of paint job before,

579
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:17,428
so it's definitely
something new to me.

580
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,996
But it's starting
to look pretty cool.

581
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,070
You have to take
many steps back and squint

582
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:27,738
to make sure that's
not looking muddy.

583
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,907
Overall contrast, you need
to bring this chest out.

584
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:31,092
You'd want to go in
with the blacks

585
00:23:31,127 --> 00:23:32,610
and spray it, though, first.

586
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,794
Rayce is trying
to explain to me

587
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,329
what he thinks would look best,

588
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,448
and it's just not sinking in.

589
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,916
You're throwing
a lot of things at me.

590
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:40,084
What are you thinking

591
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,419
I'm supposed to be
doing right now?

592
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,753
I mean, I can't even think

593
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,455
about what I would be doing
by myself.

594
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,123
Now I'm doubting myself.

595
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,191
It's stressful.

596
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:49,694
Ten minutes.

597
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,552
That's time, everybody.

598
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,423
I am nowhere near
proud of this piece.

599
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,125
I still have to work
on the eyes

600
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,327
and do a whole lot of work
to the mouth.

601
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:07,745
I could be screwed.

602
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,472
This is probably the most

603
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:20,324
I've ever had to do
in last looks.

604
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,376
I have to finish puppet paws,

605
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:23,911
apply a face, apply a wig,

606
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:25,663
and just finish the makeup.

607
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:26,981
I'm sweating bullets.

608
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:30,251
It doesn't look good,

609
00:24:30,253 --> 00:24:32,303
and I'm desperately
trying to fix it.

610
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:35,439
I start with giving some depth
to the eye,

611
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:36,857
and then I'm going
to be painting

612
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,660
for the entire hour.

613
00:24:39,696 --> 00:24:41,062
Okay, keep your mouth
closed for a sec.

614
00:24:41,097 --> 00:24:43,214
I still need to attach
the doll pieces,

615
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:44,999
address the back of the neck,

616
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,534
address the front
of my model's neck,

617
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,636
airbrush everything,
and tie it all in together.

618
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:49,670
I've got a bit to do.

619
00:24:49,672 --> 00:24:52,273
I'm just scatterbrained
right now.

620
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:54,575
Luckily I got done
with my paint job,

621
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,179
so I'm really able to focus
on detail work.

622
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,930
Perfect.

623
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:03,150
I need to make sure
this paint job really pops.

624
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:06,887
Not having the finishing details
can send you home at this point.

625
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,372
Ten minutes, everybody.

626
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:19,917
That's time, everyone.

627
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:21,886
I take a step back
and look at the makeup,

628
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:24,972
and the paint job is not
exactly where I want it to be.

629
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:27,108
I think it looks
a little too muddy.

630
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:28,359
So I'm nervous about this.

631
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,088
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

632
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:44,859
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

633
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,277
But before we see
your creations,

634
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:48,696
let's say hello
to our series judges.

635
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:49,697
Glenn Hetrick.

636
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:50,848
Good evening, guys.

637
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,916
Good evening.

638
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:52,917
Ve Neill.

639
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:53,934
Hi, everybody.

640
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,902
Hi.

641
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:55,936
And Neville Page.

642
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:56,921
Hello, everyone.

643
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:57,905
Hello.

644
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,573
And we are very lucky

645
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,859
to have a special guest
joining our panel tonight.

646
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,745
He's a true Hollywood
triple threat--

647
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:07,148
writer, director,
and producer--

648
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:11,085
and it just so happens
that he created the most iconic

649
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,389
evil doll character
in film history, Chucky.

650
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:18,242
Please give a warm welcome
to Don Mancini.

651
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:20,661
Thank you.

652
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:22,113
Thank you guys so much
for having me.

653
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,330
It's really exciting.

654
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:25,766
Don Mancini created Chucky.

655
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:27,752
Out of all the demonic dolls,

656
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:29,804
he made the most demonic doll.

657
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,838
It's awesome.

658
00:26:30,873 --> 00:26:32,339
I hope he likes mine.

659
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:34,608
Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

660
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,910
I'm thrilled to be here.

661
00:26:35,945 --> 00:26:38,145
This is exactly
in my wheelhouse.

662
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,914
I'm really curious to know

663
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,582
what you think it is
about Chucky

664
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:44,819
that has resonated
so strongly with audiences.

665
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,520
There's something almost primal

666
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,391
about a creature that looks
human but is not quite.

667
00:26:50,426 --> 00:26:51,859
I think that's
the essence of it.

668
00:26:51,894 --> 00:26:52,977
All right, well,
you ready to see

669
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,161
what these guys
have come up with?

670
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,162
Definitely.

671
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,164
Me too; let's do this.

672
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,933
Julian, you're up.

673
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:24,892
It's really creepy.

674
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,727
It's just up to the judges
at this point

675
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,129
whether it's enough.

676
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,584
I think I did a good job.

677
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,419
He's a scary character.

678
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:55,189
I'm definitely happier
than I thought I was gonna be.

679
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:17,745
I'm thrilled.

680
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,613
She's so creepy.

681
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:21,182
This is definitely
my favorite makeup

682
00:28:21,217 --> 00:28:22,766
that I've done
in this competition.

683
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:43,837
I really love my character.

684
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:46,724
She's creepy,
definitely has an impact.

685
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:08,629
Everything turned out
exactly the way I envisioned.

686
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,197
So I'm proud of it.

687
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,521
All right, judges,
why don't you go ahead

688
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:19,039
and take a closer look?

689
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:27,715
It reminds me a
little bit of the zombies

690
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,017
from John Carpenter's movie
<i>The Fog.</i>

691
00:29:30,052 --> 00:29:31,635
I wish that the hair
and the skin

692
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:32,753
differed in tone.

693
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:34,955
I just wish all the tones
had a lighter range.

694
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,624
It does read wood grain,

695
00:29:36,676 --> 00:29:39,243
but there's almost
too much of it.

696
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:44,498
It's kind of Chucky-esque,
isn't it?

697
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,834
With the stitching
and the raw eye.

698
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:47,968
This is awesome.

699
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,603
I almost wish there were
a few more of them.

700
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:50,604
But I love it.

701
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:52,056
It's a simple solution

702
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,924
that really helps to convey

703
00:29:53,976 --> 00:29:55,793
the inspiration for the makeup.

704
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,032
Jeez!

705
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,303
No, thanks.

706
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:10,090
These cracks
are so well rendered.

707
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,026
It really looks like porcelain.

708
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,294
Phenomenal.

709
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:14,612
She did the wig really well.

710
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:16,363
Just looks like
a filthy, dirty hair

711
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,932
that a child's played with
forever, you know?

712
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,100
Thank you.

713
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,006
I'm kind of disappointed

714
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,909
that this part here isn't
a little bit more realistic.

715
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:31,945
It's confusing, too,
as to what's going on.

716
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:33,263
These don't really look
like cracks,

717
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,016
and this doesn't really
look like hair.

718
00:30:36,018 --> 00:30:37,668
I have something that looks
completely different

719
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,036
than all the other contestants,

720
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,522
and I'm worried that it's
so far from a makeup

721
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:43,390
that it may put me
on the bottom.

722
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:49,730
Tell us who made your favorite
evil doll character

723
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:52,399
tonight on Twitter
using hashtag #FaceOff

724
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:56,840
The hollowing out of this eye,

725
00:30:56,876 --> 00:31:00,544
it almost comes out of, like,
a bad pirate eye patch.

726
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:03,197
All I really have on stage
is a cool concept,

727
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:05,215
so I'm hoping that's enough.

728
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:12,155
I love that none of the
facial features are addressed

729
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:13,457
it's completely anonymous.

730
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,709
Still, the whole thing
is so expressive.

731
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,494
I love the way that the hair

732
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:20,931
affects the entire
overall silhouette.

733
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,066
It's not just hair.

734
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:24,351
Thank you.

735
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:33,360
Okay, guys, the judges would
like to speak with each of you

736
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:34,895
to learn more about your work.

737
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:36,313
Logan, please step up.

738
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,804
Tell us how your voodoo doll

739
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,555
inspired your creation
here tonight.

740
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:48,391
He was a victim
of voodoo doll sorcery,

741
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:51,762
so much so that he started
to become a voodoo doll himself.

742
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:54,431
Now he has this misguided sense
of vengeance.

743
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:57,300
I like the overall vibe
of the character.

744
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:02,139
If you integrated the magical
component a little more,

745
00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:04,107
it would take it
away from scarecrow

746
00:32:04,143 --> 00:32:06,093
and more
into voodoo doll for me.

747
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:08,295
But I do really like
the overall concept.

748
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:09,312
Thank you.

749
00:32:09,348 --> 00:32:10,514
I really like this character.

750
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:13,016
You did the literal translation
of the doll,

751
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:14,067
but all in all,

752
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:16,119
he's a darn
scary-looking dude.

753
00:32:16,121 --> 00:32:17,120
Good job.

754
00:32:17,156 --> 00:32:18,255
Thank you.

755
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,259
The palette of this
is really fantastic,

756
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:24,144
almost like
pointillistic paintings,

757
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,030
where all the bits and pieces
create the palette.

758
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,733
Head to toe,
it's a solid, solid character.

759
00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:30,734
Thank you.

760
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,619
I feel like some
of the stitching

761
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:37,073
and the raw flesh effect
around the right eye

762
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:38,525
reminds me of Chucky.

763
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,343
It reminds me of, like,
<i>Bride Of Chucky,</i>

764
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:41,845
<i>Seed Of Chucky</i> era.

765
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,829
Yeah, I dig it.

766
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:43,964
Thanks very much.

767
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:45,749
Logan, you can step down.

768
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:50,787
Good job.

769
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:52,055
Thanks.

770
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,790
Emily, please step up.

771
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:05,368
Please tell us
about your ragdoll.

772
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:07,304
A mother made this doll
for her child,

773
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:09,956
and then the dog
takes it outside,

774
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:11,007
rips it up,

775
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:12,409
and it gets all moldy and gross,

776
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:14,811
and the doll gets angry,

777
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:16,096
'cause she's not wanted,

778
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:18,048
and starts slowly
killing the family.

779
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,583
She is terrific.

780
00:33:19,618 --> 00:33:21,184
Thanks.

781
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,320
Did you lay out crepe wool
and mold it?

782
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:24,321
Mm-hmm.

783
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:26,256
Yeah? Really clever idea.

784
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:28,425
I think you did
an excellent job, darling.

785
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,492
Thank you.

786
00:33:29,494 --> 00:33:31,194
I think this is so effective.

787
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,796
The simplicity of the face,

788
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:35,582
how you just have
the button eyes

789
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:37,500
and there's really no nose,

790
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,570
I feel bad for her
as well as being spooked.

791
00:33:40,606 --> 00:33:41,571
I love it.

792
00:33:41,607 --> 00:33:42,889
Thank you.

793
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:47,627
The use of the extraordinarily
long dread extensions

794
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,046
did more than just add hair.

795
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:51,765
It massively affected

796
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:54,568
the overall silhouette
of the character,

797
00:33:54,603 --> 00:33:56,720
and that is so impactful.

798
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:58,321
So I'm impressed.

799
00:33:58,357 --> 00:33:59,406
Thanks.

800
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:00,991
Emily, please step back.

801
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:02,525
Okay, thanks, Megan.

802
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:04,611
Good job.

803
00:34:04,663 --> 00:34:05,662
Thanks.

804
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,649
Julian, please step up.

805
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:18,608
Tell us about your
ventriloquist dummy character.

806
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,277
Back in the 1600s,

807
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,429
a witch carved
this ventriloquist dummy

808
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:25,515
out of a sacred tree
as a demonic minion.

809
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,666
There's a few details

810
00:34:26,702 --> 00:34:30,170
that make it difficult
to read easily.

811
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,857
I would probably adjust the wood

812
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:36,643
so that it feels
more wood-like

813
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:38,178
and maybe less textural.

814
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,064
I also think a fake
large sculpted eye

815
00:34:41,066 --> 00:34:42,432
would have sold it
a bit better.

816
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:43,500
Okay.

817
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:46,319
He almost can appear
like a zombie

818
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:48,955
rather than specifically
what you're going for.

819
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:50,740
This is effectively creepy,

820
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:51,942
but there, for me,

821
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:53,760
was a little bit
of a dissonance there.

822
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:54,861
Sure.

823
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:56,730
It doesn't immediately convey

824
00:34:56,782 --> 00:34:59,232
the idea
of a carved wood puppet.

825
00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:01,251
Something more angular
and chiseled

826
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:02,335
would have helped a lot.

827
00:35:02,371 --> 00:35:03,970
Also, some other tones

828
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,289
to pull the hair
away from the face,

829
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:08,124
that would have helped too.

830
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:10,026
Julian, thank you.

831
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:11,378
Thanks, man.

832
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:18,685
All right, let's talk to Adam.

833
00:35:25,627 --> 00:35:28,044
Tell us how your doll
inspired your work this week.

834
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,529
When someone touches the doll,

835
00:35:29,581 --> 00:35:31,247
their soul is sucked in

836
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:35,018
as this stark, elemental,
greater being comes out.

837
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:38,371
It's just too big conceptually.

838
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,425
I'm just not sure
that it's that appropriate

839
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:44,627
for this specific challenge.

840
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:45,662
I agree.

841
00:35:45,664 --> 00:35:47,430
The remainder of the doll,

842
00:35:47,432 --> 00:35:49,399
the portion of the doll
that we still see,

843
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:52,385
that should have really looked
like a rubber doll.

844
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:55,221
And I also think
that these big gaping holes

845
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:58,575
around the eyes
do not read "doll-like" either.

846
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,511
You didn't quite get
to the doll zone for me today.

847
00:36:01,563 --> 00:36:02,679
Okay.

848
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:04,147
You have to be a little bit
more conscious

849
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:06,499
of what the physical
parameters are

850
00:36:06,551 --> 00:36:10,637
of plastic being stretched
by a demonic entity.

851
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:11,938
And I think
that's what's missing,

852
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,924
is the animated quality
of what has happened to this.

853
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:18,678
Adam, please step back.

854
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:28,838
Darla, please step up.

855
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:38,815
Tell us about your concept,
please.

856
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,083
She was a little girl's doll.

857
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:41,568
The girl dropped her,
and she broke.

858
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:42,769
So she cast it aside,

859
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,688
and the doll found
this enchanted mirror.

860
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:48,658
She uses the mirror
to attack people

861
00:36:48,693 --> 00:36:50,927
that are looking
in other mirrors.

862
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:52,128
She's amazing.

863
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:54,047
Thank you.

864
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:57,667
This captures
what is fundamentally

865
00:36:57,702 --> 00:37:01,087
most effective about
the living doll concept

866
00:37:01,123 --> 00:37:02,939
and why it's
so primally frightening,

867
00:37:02,991 --> 00:37:06,643
because it's
so freaking disturbing.

868
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:07,677
Congratulations.

869
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,112
Thank you so much.

870
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:13,817
You've managed to get
the proportions so doll-like,

871
00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:17,120
and the head is creepy
and swollen.

872
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:18,655
It is absolutely thrilling.

873
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:19,789
Thank you so much.

874
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:21,825
I love the sheen on the skin.

875
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:24,494
The paint job up close
is spectacular.

876
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:26,162
I love the dark sockets.

877
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:28,782
It just gives it
that spooky look.

878
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:29,783
Holy cow, dude.

879
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:30,817
I don't know how you did it.

880
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:31,835
It's amazing.

881
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,869
Thank you.

882
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:34,771
Darla, please step back.

883
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:36,172
Thank you, sweetie.

884
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:43,847
All right, thanks, guys.

885
00:37:43,899 --> 00:37:45,064
Please head back
to the makeup room

886
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,666
while the judges deliberate.

887
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:55,258
All right, judges,

888
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:57,710
let's talk about
tonight's evil dolls.

889
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:59,996
Why don't we start
with Logan's?

890
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:01,548
It was a guy
turning into a doll.

891
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,832
He should have just said
it was a doll.

892
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:04,234
Right.

893
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:05,869
I really did
like the complex colors.

894
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:08,121
There was purples,
and there was pinks.

895
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:12,375
There was a variety that made
one harmonious palette.

896
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,744
All right,
let's move on to Emily.

897
00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:17,430
I love that simple face,

898
00:38:17,482 --> 00:38:19,749
but so much emotion
really comes across.

899
00:38:19,784 --> 00:38:21,651
I love characters
where you can see

900
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:23,386
the broken heart
inside the monster,

901
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:25,755
and I feel that she really
accomplished that.

902
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,807
How she laid those
buttons falling off

903
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:29,058
and the eyelashes,

904
00:38:29,094 --> 00:38:31,594
everything was just
so beautifully done.

905
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,464
All right, judges,
let's move on to Darla.

906
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,432
The porcelain and the cracks

907
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:40,203
were all weathered with
really nice yellows and browns

908
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:41,538
to stunning effect.

909
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:43,706
That character is so creepy,

910
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:45,742
so spooky, so beautiful.

911
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:48,144
That could have gone
on camera right now.

912
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,847
It's an incredibly
effective evocation

913
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:52,515
of the living doll concept.

914
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:55,251
All right, judges,
let's move on to Julian.

915
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:57,654
It's a good idea
to have it be so old.

916
00:38:57,689 --> 00:38:59,289
It takes it
out of the expected.

917
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,757
But I don't think he applied

918
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:02,926
the right sculptural
and painting techniques

919
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:05,495
to give it the clarity
it needed to tell his story.

920
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,864
It needed some paint
that was once there

921
00:39:07,899 --> 00:39:08,898
that has weathered off.

922
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,701
Exactly, like whitewash,
like, chipped away

923
00:39:11,736 --> 00:39:13,069
with darker tones underneath.

924
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:14,220
That would have been awesome.

925
00:39:14,256 --> 00:39:16,573
Shape-wise, it just
didn't work for me.

926
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:19,275
All right, why don't we
move on to Adam.

927
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:20,910
I just really appreciated

928
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:23,079
the originality of that idea,

929
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:24,714
of a doll possessed.

930
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:26,916
But the fact that he
left one human eye in there

931
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,668
and blocked out the other one,

932
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,003
that made no sense to me.

933
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:31,120
I couldn't agree more.

934
00:39:31,156 --> 00:39:32,455
It looked like what it was,

935
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,991
which was a piece of cloth
stretched across the hole.

936
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:36,226
It was so contrived,

937
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:38,328
it didn't communicate the story.

938
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:40,430
All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

939
00:39:40,432 --> 00:39:41,564
We have.

940
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,299
Okay, let's bring them back out.

941
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:56,379
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

942
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:59,449
Emily,
you made such clever choices

943
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,651
with your materials
and concept this week,

944
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:02,685
and we thought that they

945
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,787
complement each other
beautifully.

946
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:08,174
And Darla, you nailed
the shapes of the face,

947
00:40:08,226 --> 00:40:11,127
and the paint job looked
like real cracked porcelain,

948
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:12,528
even up close.

949
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:15,064
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

950
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,116
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

951
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,525
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

952
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,426
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

953
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:32,148
Darla.

954
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:34,901
Thank you.

955
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:38,271
People at home
may not understand

956
00:40:38,306 --> 00:40:40,106
how technically difficult it is

957
00:40:40,141 --> 00:40:42,842
to pull off that kind
of sculpting and painting.

958
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:45,144
Those shapes and textures
are really tough.

959
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:47,046
Unbelievable work this week.

960
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,481
Thank you so much.

961
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:50,550
I'm so excited
to win this challenge.

962
00:40:50,602 --> 00:40:53,486
This is a really important time
to be winning challenges.

963
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:55,922
It just gives me
that extra spark.

964
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:58,507
Darla, congratulations.

965
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:00,426
You and Emily are safe.

966
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,562
Logan, you are also safe.

967
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:04,113
You can all head back
to the makeup room,

968
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:05,364
along with your coaches.

969
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:10,202
- Good luck.
- ***

970
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:15,474
Unfortunately, that means

971
00:41:15,476 --> 00:41:17,076
the two of you
are on the bottom this week,

972
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:19,211
and one of you
will be going home.

973
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:20,646
Please step forward.

974
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:30,690
So, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

975
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:33,826
Julian, you definitely captured
the doll in your makeup,

976
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:36,762
but the shape of your face and
some of the painting techniques

977
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,698
soften the overall image.

978
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,601
Adam, love that
you think big-picture,

979
00:41:41,636 --> 00:41:43,803
and while the faraway read
was really good,

980
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,339
there were just too many things
that didn't quite come together.

981
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:48,040
So who's going home tonight?

982
00:41:48,076 --> 00:41:49,675
The person going home
tonight is...

983
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:55,598
Adam.

984
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:59,385
You have given us
some insanely cool concepts

985
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,419
this season.

986
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:01,787
But this one was just

987
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,806
a little too far away
from this week's challenge.

988
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:05,174
It's all good.

989
00:42:05,226 --> 00:42:08,260
Adam, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

990
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:10,229
That means, Julian,
you are safe this week

991
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:11,864
and can head back
to the makeup room.

992
00:42:17,722 --> 00:42:19,739
Adam, I'm really sorry
to see you go,

993
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:22,441
but where you're going
is probably straight to work,

994
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:24,627
because you're
a very employable guy.

995
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:25,995
Thank you.

996
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:28,264
Adam, it's really been great
having you here with us.

997
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:30,449
But if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

998
00:42:30,485 --> 00:42:31,984
and pack up your kit.

999
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:33,285
Thanks.

1000
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:34,737
Good luck.

1001
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,872
I really just wanted
to show people my designs,

1002
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,474
and I did that.

1003
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:40,400
They didn't like baby arms.

1004
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:42,469
I have no idea what's next,

1005
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,797
but I got affirmation
I can make monsters.

1006
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:47,324
I'm really impressed
with everything you did.

1007
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:49,397
I'm so thankful
for this opportunity.

1008
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:50,998
I've had such a
great experience

1009
00:42:50,999 --> 00:42:53,523
and I've done so many
amazing things on the show

1010
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:56,800
that I can't wait to see
where that takes me.
