1
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:02,484
I think she's
pretty damn fabulous.

2
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:04,720
There's a severe
lack of detail.

3
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,822
This works very well.
I congratulate you.

4
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:08,423
Huge honor.
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,726
<i>Previously,
three Face Off champions</i>

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,494
led their teams of five artists

7
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:14,663
through a challenge
of astronomical proportions.

8
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:15,998
Whoo!

9
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:17,199
Team Rayce dominated,

10
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:18,734
and Logan's
magnificent sculptures

11
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,169
- gave him his first win.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:22,738
But Gregory's monkey
fell short,

13
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:27,442
and Team Laura
lost its first member.

14
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,711
Now 14 artists remain,

15
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:33,081
and tonight they battle
to win a monstrous challenge.

16
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,350
We want to be really
frightened by these creatures.

17
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,753
I'm screaming and jumping
up and down, "Yay!"

18
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,388
Watch your nose.

19
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:41,823
The pressure is on as one of
the world's biggest movie stars

20
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:44,760
joins this weeks panel,
Josh Hutcherson.

21
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,995
The concept feels cohesive.

22
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,231
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

23
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:50,799
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

24
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,869
to one of their
85 international locations,

25
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:56,605
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

26
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,342
and $100,000.

27
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,377
<i>This is Face Off.</i>

29
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:45,988
Oh, my God,
what are we doing here?

30
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,255
What is this?

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,824
We're at this large
empty stadium.

32
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,592
I hope this isn't
a football challenge.

33
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,928
It's like being
in the Roman Colosseum.

34
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,796
Feel like a gladiator
walking in for battle.

35
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,164
If we're gonna have
to fight to the death,

36
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,432
I call dibs on the ax.

37
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:00,702
- Who... Is that Glenn?
- Ve and Glenn.

38
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:02,671
I see Ve Neill
and Glenn Hetrick

39
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,905
standing there with McKenzie

40
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,209
and all of these flowers
and these gold emblems.

41
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,611
Is it what
I think it's gonna be?

42
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:11,480
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

43
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:15,384
Welcome to the Historic
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum,

44
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,753
a national landmark
that has hosted

45
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:20,589
some of the largest
sporting events in the world,

46
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:24,226
including Super Bowl VII,
the 1959 World Series,

47
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,031
and the 1932
and 1984 Olympic Games.

48
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,267
This week's challenge is
inspired by sporting events

49
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:36,271
that aren't always
fun and games.

50
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:38,907
<i>Films like The Hunger Games
and The Running Man</i>

51
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,510
feature deadly competitions
wherein game engineers

52
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,612
forced participants
to fight for their lives,

53
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:46,148
fending off everything
from their fellow competitors

54
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:48,884
to vicious animals
and poisonous plants.

55
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,552
So, for your next
spotlight challenge,

56
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:53,355
you will play the role
of an evil game engineer

57
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:55,924
and create your very own
deadly predator.

58
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:01,630
I'm pumped.
I like gnarly beasts.

59
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:05,033
I like to make them mean
and just nasty.

60
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,503
Now, in order to make
these designs truly unstoppable,

61
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,172
you must incorporate
the elements

62
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:13,842
of a deadly animal
and an exotic plant.

63
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:15,844
Each of these plants is paired

64
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:18,480
with the emblem
of a deadly animal.

65
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:22,751
Working in teams of two,
you'll choose a plant and animal

66
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:27,122
and use their exotic features to
inspire your deadly predators.

67
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,690
That's cool.

68
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,225
Your teams have been
randomly assigned.

69
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,728
Kelly and Daniel.

70
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,229
Ben and Darla.

71
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:36,865
Julian and Adam.

72
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:39,067
Anthony and Logan.

73
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,069
Emily and Regina.

74
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,338
Stephanie and Alan.

75
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,273
Rob and Jamie.

76
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,809
Go ahead and stand
with your new teammates.

77
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,746
Let's go.

78
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,614
Kelly and Daniel,
you're up first.

79
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:55,150
- Wanna go with the scorpion?
- Yes.

80
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:58,754
Kelly and Daniel, you picked
the scorpion and delphinium.

81
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:03,592
Ben and Darla,
you picked the ram and cactus.

82
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:04,793
Julian and Adam,

83
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,562
you have the bat
and the sugarbush protea.

84
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:10,332
- Go get that pig.
- Anthony and Logan,

85
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:12,868
you have the warthog
and the American pitcher plant.

86
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:17,539
Emily and Regina, you have
the hyena and shampoo ginger.

87
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,040
Stephanie and Alan,

88
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:22,077
you picked the thorny dragon
and the cockscomb.

89
00:04:22,111 --> 00:04:25,747
Rob and Jamie, you have
the piranha and blue thistle.

90
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,149
All right, now you worked on

91
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,583
<i>The Hunger Games films
together,</i>

92
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,452
so your creations
helped the franchise

93
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,554
become a worldwide phenomenon.

94
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,589
Now, it's not easy to combine

95
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,091
the features of a plant
and an animal,

96
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,026
so what advice do you have
in order for them

97
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,462
to make their creatures
cohesive?

98
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,930
<i>In The Hunger Games,</i>

99
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,566
the games makers created deadly
hybrids that were called mutts.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,902
They were not cute.
They were not funny.

101
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,503
They were deadly killers.

102
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,939
We want to be really frightened
by these creatures.

103
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:53,141
And also, I don't want
to see someone

104
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:54,509
with a flower around their head.

105
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,511
Create your own
predator creature,

106
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,648
and integrate elements
from your plant and your animal.

107
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:01,483
Thank you, guys.

108
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,585
Now before I send you off
to work on your designs,

109
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:06,888
I have a big announcement
to make.

110
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,623
Oh, God.

111
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,793
<i>One of the stars
of The Hunger Games franchise</i>

112
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,930
will be joining us
onstage this week.

113
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:18,900
He has won all kinds of awards
for his role in the films,

114
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:22,204
including MTV Movie Awards,
Teen Choice Awards,

115
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,240
and The People's Choice Award.

116
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:29,511
Peeta himself, Josh Hutcherson.

117
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:32,981
The inner fan girl nerd
is just, like, screaming

118
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:36,852
and jumping up and down, "Yay,
we get to meet Josh Hutcherson!"

119
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:38,320
I'm such a huge fan of him.

120
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:42,591
He is such a sweet guy,
an amazing young actor,

121
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,326
<i>and he is a huge fan
of Face Off,</i>

122
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,361
so I'm very excited
Josh is joining us.

123
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,430
- I like him even more now.
- Yeah.

124
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:51,700
All right, it's time to start
working on your designs.

125
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:54,169
- Good luck, everyone.
- Good luck, guys.

126
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,142
I'm really excited
about this challenge.

127
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:03,712
The fact that these are all
genetically modified creatures,

128
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:05,080
you can really do
a lot with that

129
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,849
and make things
really terrifying.

130
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,885
We need to bulk out
the shoulders.

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,386
Our concept
is going to be this ram

132
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,055
that's got cactus spikes
coming out of his head.

133
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,491
He hangs around dark crevices,

134
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,759
and he's there
just to pummel you.

135
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,761
Are the horns gonna
attach to the cowl?

136
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:22,264
- Yeah.
- Okay, I like that.

137
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,135
With the texture from the plant

138
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,703
and color from the hyena.

139
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:31,973
I like the idea of it
blending into its surroundings,

140
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,175
so it would be the form
of the hyena

141
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,912
- and then just layering it.
- Yeah, no, I totally get it.

142
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,547
We come up with a predator
that incorporates

143
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:43,418
scaling of the plant to blend
into its surroundings,

144
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:45,820
and I really like the idea
because nothing's scarier

145
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:48,523
than something that's hiding
in plain sight.

146
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,126
- Can I sculpt the face?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,761
Okay.

148
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,167
It's a human genetic hybrid,
so it's made to be a warrior.

149
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,736
Our plant is
the sugarbush protea

150
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:03,305
and our animal is the bat.

151
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,273
- Want to do a chest piece?
- I don't think we should.

152
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:06,975
I think we should
focus on things

153
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,610
that are going to give us
a strong silhouette.

154
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:12,814
Adam sketches this very
humanoid-looking bat,

155
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:17,319
so the batty nose, batty mouth,
it looks really badass,

156
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,854
and I think it's gonna kill it.

157
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,897
Like Gill-man features, but
then we'll do the piranha jaw.

158
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,532
My partner is Jamie,
which is fantastic,

159
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,200
because she's really talented
and we have a lot in common.

160
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,702
Do you want to do
a body piece, too?

161
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:35,203
Yeah, that would be perfect.

162
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,471
Our concept is to make

163
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,440
a more modernized version
of the Gill-man.

164
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:40,275
I want to incorporate
piranha teeth

165
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,377
with armor around the eyes,
and then the blue thistle,

166
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,912
I want to bring it
up from the teeth

167
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,847
to where it actually looks like
it's growing out

168
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,283
of the Gill-man itself.

169
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:51,052
All right, everybody.
Let's go back to the lab.

170
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,254
I'm really, really excited
for this challenge.

171
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,325
Alan and I are ready to bring
our deadly predator to life.

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,462
This is exciting.

173
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:08,770
We have 5 1/2 hours in the lab,

174
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,973
and the first thing that we do
is pick our models

175
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:15,744
and start sculpting right away.

176
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:18,380
Me and Logan are the warthog
and the American pitcher plant

177
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,648
and we decided
that this character

178
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:23,752
is this gigantic
monster creature

179
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,854
with this open, rotting flesh
that resembles

180
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,089
that resembles
the American pitcher plant.

181
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:29,591
Dude, I'm excited.
This is fun.

182
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,027
- I am too.
- Anthony starts on the face,

183
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,563
I start on the cowl, and since
the boar's nostrils are so big,

184
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,699
we use them as eyeholes,

185
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:40,235
so that gives us
a different shape

186
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,340
that is distinctly less human
and more boar-like.

187
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:51,112
Hey, guys.

188
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:54,382
We have a hyena, and we have
the shampoo ginger.

189
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,917
Whose is this?
Is this yours?

190
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,419
- Yeah, it's mine.
- Oh, that's a good sketch.

191
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,320
I haven't seen
a lot of things like that,

192
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:01,990
and I know the judges are
looking for something unique.

193
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:05,160
Emily is on my team,
and Regina is on Rayce's team.

194
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,162
Love the concept,
and I'm looking forward

195
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:10,065
to working with the other
coaches on this challenge.

196
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,734
This is the one I've seen
that's the most unexpected.

197
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,941
Definitely you guys
are working to think about

198
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:22,177
ways of incorporating this
even more.

199
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,845
- For sure.
- So that way you're not

200
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,747
just sculpting
a literal translation of...

201
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,949
- The lizard.
- Yeah.

202
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,718
Stephanie and I get the thorny
dragon and the cockscomb.

203
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:33,888
And our concept is
this dragon character

204
00:09:33,923 --> 00:09:38,026
that's very spiked out and
has a hand base like a lizard

205
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,995
but has very vibrant reds,
greens, and pinks

206
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,997
to represent
the cockscomb flower.

207
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:47,202
Stephanie is sculpting the face,
and I am sculpting the cowl,

208
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:48,636
and I'm feeling really good.

209
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,039
That kind of shape might be
kind of cool to put into here,

210
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:54,876
- for, like, venom glands.
- Ooh, I do like that.

211
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:01,683
I think I don't wanna go
too bulky away from the face

212
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,718
because that might have been
our mistake last time.

213
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:06,421
My partner is Daniel.
We're both on Anthony's team,

214
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,156
and, last challenge,
Daniel and I

215
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,758
ended up being
one of the bottom looks,

216
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,128
so we have something
to prove this time.

217
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:16,598
We have the scorpion
and the delphinium.

218
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:20,301
We're gonna combine
the hard shell of the scorpion

219
00:10:20,336 --> 00:10:23,471
but still have the forms
of the petals of the flower

220
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:26,741
in a gladiator helmet
that's part of her.

221
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:28,610
She is her own armor.

222
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:31,246
Wanna extend the armor
down to the nose?

223
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,182
Yeah, I think that's cool.

224
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:41,623
What do you think?

225
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:42,891
I think one design

226
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:46,027
looks very feminine,
and one reads more menacing.

227
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,729
The face is half-sculpted,

228
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:51,032
and I look over at Regina's cowl
and it's not matching up.

229
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,735
So you can kinda get...

230
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,204
It just doesn't look like
they would fit together.

231
00:10:56,238 --> 00:11:00,141
- Maybe keep it very uniform.
- I'm really confused,

232
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:03,545
because I'm doing my part
to replicate the original idea,

233
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,848
but I feel like my direction is
not the same direction as hers.

234
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:08,416
I don't want to sculpt
and then change it

235
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,951
and just eat the rest
of the time.

236
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:11,519
Because we're already
eating into our time.

237
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:12,820
I'm freaking out.

238
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:14,556
Emily and I keep on
going back and forth,

239
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,991
and we're losing so much time.

240
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,393
What do you want me
to change on it?

241
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,028
So I know what I can do.

242
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:23,464
This isn't gonna work out.

243
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:30,261
I need a direction where
to go, and I'll follow it.

244
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:32,497
Today's the first day
of our predator challenge.

245
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:33,932
There's two hours
left in the day,

246
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:37,168
and we still don't have
a clear idea of what we want.

247
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:38,336
So what do you want to do?

248
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,972
I think we should change
the concept.

249
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:43,808
Ultimately, Regina and I
decided to scrap the face.

250
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:46,611
There's still time to catch up
to everyone, okay?

251
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:49,380
Gina and Emily,
they've lost a lot of time.

252
00:11:49,415 --> 00:11:51,649
Every decision they make
from here on out

253
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:54,185
has to be perfect, otherwise
they're going to be in trouble.

254
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,087
These things have to scare
the pants off ya,

255
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:59,390
so create that powerful feeling,
that could be your ticket.

256
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:09,000
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

257
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:11,002
Our initial idea was doing,
like, a four-legged bat,

258
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:13,671
but it was a little ambitious
for just the two of us.

259
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:15,073
In looking at the face,

260
00:12:15,107 --> 00:12:17,008
I like the way you're tying
all this into it.

261
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:19,410
I mean, your plant
works really well,

262
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:22,580
but it's a nose
we've seen a thousand times.

263
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,549
Maybe open the nostrils
a little more, flare them,

264
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,786
just to give us another little
bit of bat type of look.

265
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:29,988
Our animal is the ram,

266
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:32,457
and the cactus is--
what we're gonna do

267
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,059
is end up putting
probably some spikes.

268
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:36,961
- I love it.
- Awesome.

269
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,363
It's a really unique concept.

270
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:39,697
Let's see the face.

271
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:41,599
I'm bringing in some
of the features of the ram

272
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,534
but making it
a little more demon-like

273
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:45,003
but keeping those eyes human.

274
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:46,771
When you put the human eyes
in there...

275
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,373
Do you think it will just
take away from it?

276
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:49,774
Take away from it,

277
00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:50,775
make it look like somebody
that's wearing a mask.

278
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,343
Okay.

279
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:56,381
So we had a shampoo ginger
plant and a hyena.

280
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:57,749
Now, you're going
with a hyena face.

281
00:12:57,783 --> 00:12:59,217
Mm-hmm.

282
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,786
- I see literally nothing there.
- I'm still working on that.

283
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,588
Okay.
Let's see your cowl.

284
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:06,357
This is reading
like you've made a flower

285
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,893
and you're forgetting
your animal.

286
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:11,062
Your creature has to be scary.

287
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:13,665
So keep that in mind
as you're working on this.

288
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:14,866
- Okay?
- Okay.

289
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,735
We have the piranha
and the blue thistle.

290
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,805
Seems like you're doing
a very literal face on here.

291
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,808
In the nose area,
maybe do something interesting,

292
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:25,710
add a little bit
of thistle into it.

293
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:28,246
And that would take it away
from holding a picture

294
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,547
and going, "Oh, my God.
It's a piranha."

295
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,316
So maybe put some nostrils
down in here, then, or--

296
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,684
- You could, yeah.
- Okay.

297
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:34,852
Mr. Westmore's a legend
in the effects world,

298
00:13:34,887 --> 00:13:36,621
and he knows what
the judges want,

299
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:39,424
so we know we have
to take his advice seriously.

300
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,792
Good luck to everybody.

301
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:42,760
- Bye.
- Thank you.

302
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:53,504
Okay, everybody, that's time.

303
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:57,075
By the end of day one,
I'm really stressed.

304
00:13:57,109 --> 00:14:01,446
We have a face and a cowl
that still needs help.

305
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,816
So Regina and I have
a lot of work to do tomorrow.

306
00:14:10,155 --> 00:14:13,057
- Let's go.
- Good morning.

307
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:14,859
Today is day two at the lab,

308
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:18,396
and Kelly and I need
to finish our sculptures,

309
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,666
make the molds, and be ready
to run this thing.

310
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,868
Wow.
I'm real excited.

311
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:25,494
_

312
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:26,886
_

313
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:28,606
That is scary.

314
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:36,547
Just gonna go over
and brush out all of this stuff.

315
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:37,982
The first thing
that me and Logan do,

316
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:41,753
we go to our sculptures to
finish the rest of our details.

317
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:43,821
Right now, this area's
still very friendly.

318
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:46,391
I would really suggest
looking at gravity

319
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,826
and how it would affect
this guy's mouth.

320
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:52,697
I have never sculpted
any face piece this big before.

321
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:55,767
And I'm having a hard time,
so Logan jumps in

322
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,602
and starts putting on this lip

323
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:59,337
that sticks out
a little bit more,

324
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:01,072
and the silhouette
that it's adding

325
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:03,107
definitely is
a little bit better.

326
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:04,470
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

327
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,281
- Sculpt's looking good.
- Thanks, dude.

328
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:13,117
I get my sculpts to a place
where I'm very happy,

329
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:16,554
and I take it to the mold room.

330
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:18,856
I'm the first one molding,
so it feels good.

331
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,658
At this point,
I'm feeling like Adam and I have

332
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,628
a really good handle
on our time management.

333
00:15:23,662 --> 00:15:25,129
I like that.

334
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:28,433
Emily and I talked last night
and changed our concept.

335
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:30,601
We've decided that I'm going
to sculpt the face,

336
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:32,069
she's going to sculpt the cowl.

337
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:33,738
Regina wants
to bring the mohawk

338
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:36,808
- down the middle, like the front.
- Oh, cool.

339
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:39,844
So we're taking the scaling
from the shampoo ginger plant

340
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,913
and having the silhouette
of a hyena.

341
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:43,114
It's sneaky, it's creepy,

342
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:45,149
and it's a different
kind of predator.

343
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:46,851
Looking around,
we're very behind.

344
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,653
I'm feeling
really nervous about it.

345
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,388
It's intimidating.

346
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,360
So some
of the important details

347
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:58,129
that I'm working on on the cowl

348
00:15:58,163 --> 00:16:00,231
are separation
between the horn and the skin.

349
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:03,868
So if you come around in here,
it breaks the surface.

350
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:08,272
It looks more like one piece of
flesh that's being integrated.

351
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:09,807
Anthony gives me
some real good advice

352
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,209
on how to build up details,

353
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:13,678
to really give it
that human, creepy feel.

354
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:16,247
This is cool, guys.

355
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:20,218
Yay.

356
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:22,520
While Alan is molding the face,

357
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:24,021
I'm looking at the cowl.

358
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:26,724
I'm getting a little bit worried
that we may not be doing enough.

359
00:16:26,758 --> 00:16:30,161
Whenever something is really
hard next to soft tissue,

360
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:31,629
there's going to be a wrinkle.

361
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:33,998
Laura's helping give the cowl
some secondary form

362
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:35,633
to make it
a lot more interesting.

363
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:37,635
But we're already too far
into day two.

364
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,738
We can't really make any
dramatic changes to our concept.

365
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:41,939
Much better.

366
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:44,909
This needs to get molded
right now.

367
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:54,585
I get a little lost
sculpting the cowl,

368
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,687
and I realize
I took way too much time.

369
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:58,089
You got it?

370
00:16:58,123 --> 00:16:59,724
In the back of my head,
I'm like,

371
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:01,092
"Get to the mold room,
get to the mold room,

372
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:04,395
you need to get there now!"

373
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,064
We have three hours
to finish the mold,

374
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,867
and the big issue that we have
is the cowl.

375
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:13,104
Has a lot of details that make
it very complicated to mold.

376
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:15,006
Ooh, shit.

377
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,375
I'm freaking out.
This is the most detailed

378
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:19,410
and hardest mold
I've ever done.

379
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:20,978
And I have to prevent anything
from happening

380
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,513
like what happened last week.

381
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:25,950
We don't have enough plaster
bandage to even do the job.

382
00:17:25,984 --> 00:17:29,987
After being bottom looks,
I don't want to be there again.

383
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,723
It's day two in the lab,

384
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,225
and our challenge this time
is to make a deadly predator.

385
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,461
I wanted to get this done
a while ago.

386
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:42,463
I don't want to rush the mold

387
00:17:42,497 --> 00:17:46,701
and risk ruining all the detail
in my sculpture.

388
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:49,003
Don't worry.
We're gonna do it.

389
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:52,239
Kelly's freaking out, so I'm
trying to make her feel better.

390
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,808
We'll be good.

391
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:57,278
I'm not worrying about it.
We're going to get this done.

392
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,587
So I start cutting out leaves
that will create

393
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:08,689
the rest of the head form
on the cowl,

394
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:10,858
and I take the dremel tool,
and I just start adding

395
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:13,494
a basic texture to it.

396
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:16,263
- I start coating those in latex.
- That's very cool, bro.

397
00:18:16,298 --> 00:18:21,168
- Want me to get one?
- No, I got it.

398
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:24,071
Because we only have
a face and a cowl,

399
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:26,841
we need something to give it
that hyena quality

400
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,076
and something that brings it
to the next level.

401
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,045
I see the hemp in the mold room,

402
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,247
and I figure that
this could work as hair,

403
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,816
so I take acrylic paints
with a little bit of water

404
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,651
and I mix hemp with it,

405
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:38,853
then I lay them out to dry,

406
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,988
so I have
all different shades of brown.

407
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:43,124
Color done.

408
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:49,430
Time's running out,
and we want to incorporate

409
00:18:49,464 --> 00:18:52,733
the leaf aspect of
the blue thistle to our makeup.

410
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:56,270
So I grab a piece of L200,
I draw the pattern,

411
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:57,605
I cut out around the shape,

412
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,740
and then I form it
to the bust that we have.

413
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,509
The leaves are going
to fit in there perfectly,

414
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,210
like they're growing
out of the head,

415
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:06,180
almost like dreadlocks.

416
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:11,152
It's getting
towards the end of the day,

417
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:13,053
and I start prying
this cowl mold apart,

418
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,422
and, luckily,
the back half pops right off.

419
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:16,891
But now I gotta
get the head out,

420
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,526
and Darla comes
running in to help,

421
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,594
because we need to get this
thing open as fast as we can

422
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:23,798
- so we can clean it out.
- There's just a lot of suction.

423
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:26,066
It's taking a lot longer
than we want to,

424
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:29,665
but not having this cowl
tomorrow is not an option.

425
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,009
We finally get the core out
of the second half of the mold,

426
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:36,844
but we're not going to have
enough time

427
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:38,212
to clean it out properly,

428
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:41,882
which means that we could have
an unusable foam piece.

429
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,712
That's time!

430
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:47,988
We're both a little scared.

431
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:50,224
It was so rushed
trying to get that done.

432
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:52,092
So we're keeping
our fingers crossed,

433
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:54,528
but we know that
if we have any issues

434
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:58,232
we're just going to have
to use what we got.

435
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:11,345
It's application day.

436
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:12,613
We have four hours in the lab

437
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:13,948
and one hour of last looks.

438
00:20:13,982 --> 00:20:17,351
- Ooh, this is rough.
- The cowl is not too bad,

439
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,486
but it's got excess foam
all over it,

440
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:22,389
so I grab a razor,
start cutting this thing off,

441
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:24,758
start making it look pretty.
Nose isn't too bad.

442
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,228
Overall, it came out nice.

443
00:20:30,866 --> 00:20:33,400
Uh-oh.
Ooh.

444
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:36,270
Our foam piece
is a pretty big mess.

445
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,305
It's like rubber.
Like sawed rubber.

446
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,507
And that's really bad,
because we're going to be

447
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,409
spending most of the day
patching it.

448
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:47,414
Let me get my scissors
and start cutting the seam.

449
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:51,218
Mmm, the smell of foam latex
in the morning.

450
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,755
- Hey, how's it going?
- This is you today.

451
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,523
- Regina.
- Nice to meet you.

452
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,827
My plan is to fabricate
the chest piece and back piece,

453
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:02,663
and Regina is applying
the makeup,

454
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:04,565
and then we'll both work
together on painting it.

455
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,700
I'm going to take the hemp
and start layering it.

456
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:09,169
Today is going to be
a crazy day.

457
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:11,071
Don't let me slow you down.

458
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:12,706
- Lean your head back.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:16,277
- There you go.
- Watch your nose.

460
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:20,581
Ben and I put the cowl on
our model, and it's way too big.

461
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,449
It's just another thing
that sets us back

462
00:21:22,484 --> 00:21:25,619
because we have to cut away
all the excess to make it fit.

463
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:26,921
I'll cut this at a bevel.

464
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,856
This way, you can taper it in
a little bit more.

465
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,891
All right.

466
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,586
_

467
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,013
_

468
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,573
_

469
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,152
_

470
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:44,338
Oh, my God,
it's gonna be so awesome.

471
00:21:44,372 --> 00:21:45,806
I'm so pumped!

472
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:50,811
What do you want to base it as?

473
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,146
Like a muted green.

474
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,882
Our paint scheme is inspired
by the sugarbush protea.

475
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,951
Green is not something
I'm used to using.

476
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:59,119
I think we can go
a little bit darker with it.

477
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:02,122
I'm just hoping it looks
natural and realistic.

478
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,962
So you don't have
any brushstrokes.

479
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:10,197
If you take a watered-down
white or cream color

480
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:13,801
and speckle that,
it'll push all those veins back.

481
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,058
Okay.

482
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:19,440
We start painting,
and we know immediately

483
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:21,008
that this is going
to take a long time.

484
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:22,676
We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

485
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:25,279
Anthony and Logan right now,
they're moving pretty slow.

486
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:27,681
And I'm worried
about the paint job,

487
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:30,384
because they have
a pretty intense cowl.

488
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:34,088
I just hope they can finish.

489
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:40,561
When everything's done
with some black,

490
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:42,997
hit inside these holes,
even create a couple more,

491
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:46,300
just to kind of
take your eyes off those.

492
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,302
You're starting
on the detail painting,

493
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:49,770
but you still have
a lot of patchwork.

494
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:54,041
The edges on Alan and
Stephanie's face aren't perfect.

495
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,276
There's an edge there.

496
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,911
Get those all squared away

497
00:22:57,946 --> 00:22:59,480
before you start airbrushing.

498
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:01,048
There is so much
paint work to do

499
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:03,550
on top of all of the patching.

500
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:04,685
They may run out of time.

501
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,531
Ten minutes, everybody.

502
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:10,244
You guys gotta close your kits.

503
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:15,262
Are you gonna bring out
more highlights in the face?

504
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:18,065
We're running out of time, and
we don't have any hair on it,

505
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,833
and it's really dark right now.

506
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:21,068
We need to lighten up the face,

507
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:24,304
so it doesn't get
washed out onstage.

508
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:25,539
That's time!

509
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:27,541
At this point,
it would be a miracle

510
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:30,010
if this makeup is safe.

511
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:39,498
Let's do this.

512
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:42,067
It's last looks.
Me and Logan have one hour left.

513
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:44,236
And we immediately
start painting

514
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,773
like there's no tomorrow.

515
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:50,242
My sole job
is to lay all the hair,

516
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:54,012
but it's not hair, it's hemp,
so I use hot glue

517
00:23:54,047 --> 00:23:56,281
to create beads
on the end of the hemp,

518
00:23:56,316 --> 00:24:02,654
so the latex of the cowl
has something to adhere to.

519
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,289
This is the fun part.

520
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:07,059
Jamie starts gluing the teeth
in, it's a scary piece,

521
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:09,428
and Jamie and I
are just ecstatic

522
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:11,763
to see this creature
come to life.

523
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:17,169
This thing has
got to look scary,

524
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:19,338
and that makes the paint job
very important,

525
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,173
but it's looking
a little too yellow,

526
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:23,542
so I take him down
with a bit of a green tinge.

527
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:24,843
15 minutes.

528
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:36,588
That's time, everybody!

529
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:38,090
- Good job.
- You look awesome.

530
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:40,492
- Looks cool.
- Oh, man.

531
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:42,594
My only concern
is the paint job.

532
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:45,197
It's not as finished
as I wanted it to be

533
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:47,099
and I start to worry

534
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:49,067
I could be going home
for this makeup.

535
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:05,017
<i>Welcome to
the Face Off reveal stage.</i>

536
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:09,388
Now, as you know, one of you
will be going home tonight,

537
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:11,490
but before we see
your creations,

538
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,859
let's say hello
to our series judges.

539
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:16,228
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening, guys.

540
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:18,063
Hi.

541
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:20,232
- Ve Neill.
- Hey, everybody.

542
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:21,366
Hi.

543
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,769
- Neville Page.
- Hi, guys.

544
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:26,038
Hello.

545
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:28,674
And, as promised,
joining us tonight

546
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:32,211
<i>is one of the stars
of The Hunger Games films.</i>

547
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:36,014
Please give a very warm welcome
to Josh Hutcherson.

548
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:39,851
Hey, guys, no, no, no.
Clap for you.

549
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,687
I'm just here to judge.
You guys did all the hard work.

550
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:44,256
It's great seeing
Josh Hutcherson,

551
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,691
and it's really exciting,

552
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:47,359
because now he get to see
our creations.

553
00:25:47,393 --> 00:25:49,661
Josh, thank you so much
for being here tonight.

554
00:25:49,696 --> 00:25:51,263
Of course, yeah.
I'm very excited.

555
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:53,932
So you and Ve spent
a lot of time on set together.

556
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:55,934
How was it to have her
do your makeup?

557
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:57,436
It's the best.
Ve's the best.

558
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,438
Nothing's a big deal,
everything's laid-back,

559
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:00,706
and she has fun with it,

560
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,541
and that's a good vibe
to have on set.

561
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:04,710
And makeup genius
on top of it all.

562
00:26:04,744 --> 00:26:07,145
- You're making me blush.
- Aw.

563
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,314
So Ve tells us
you're a big fan of the show.

564
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:10,882
I am.
I binge watch, actually.

565
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,384
I'll sit down, and all
of a sudden, five hours later,

566
00:26:12,418 --> 00:26:16,021
<i>I'm like, "Oh, my God,
that was a Face Off afternoon."</i>

567
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:18,957
All right, well, this week,
your spotlight challenge

568
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:22,094
was to create a hybrid
animal/plant predator

569
00:26:22,128 --> 00:26:23,962
<i>inspired by films like
The Running Man</i>

570
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:26,265
<i>and, of course,
The Hunger Games.</i>

571
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:27,733
Josh, would you like
to take this one?

572
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:28,934
Absolutely.

573
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:30,469
Let's take a look
at your creations.

574
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:55,661
I couldn't be happier.

575
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:59,931
He fits the bill
of the massive character.

576
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:19,885
The only thing
I'm concerned about

577
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,787
is the way that
she's holding her weapon.

578
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,756
And if that's my main concern,
I'm good.

579
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:48,213
I'm really proud
of what me and Darla created.

580
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:51,049
This thing
is menacing-looking.

581
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:12,237
I'm pretty happy.
Only issue is,

582
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:15,107
makeup seems a little bit
brighter and greener

583
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:16,108
than we anticipated.

584
00:28:16,142 --> 00:28:18,143
Maybe we should have changed it.

585
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:41,433
To see what it looked like
at the lab

586
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:43,769
and to see what it looks like
now, it's really rewarding.

587
00:28:43,803 --> 00:28:45,504
Out of everything
we struggled with,

588
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:48,173
it worked out.

589
00:29:06,926 --> 00:29:10,295
He just looks yellow,
and I start to worry,

590
00:29:10,329 --> 00:29:12,197
because that's not scary.

591
00:29:31,918 --> 00:29:34,519
He is a scary-looking guy.

592
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:37,789
Colors are popping, and
everything is just so awesome.

593
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,991
It's great seeing
this creation come to life.

594
00:29:45,598 --> 00:29:49,067
Judges, it's time to take
a closer look at our predators.

595
00:29:56,409 --> 00:29:58,977
- Wow.
- That's cool, man.

596
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:01,346
Look, here's the floral detail
up here.

597
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,316
That's kinda cool.

598
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,517
Pretty frightening.

599
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:06,718
I like that the eyes
are really wide.

600
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:08,653
It kind of gives it
that warthoggy feel.

601
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:13,091
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

602
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,460
- Dink, dink.
- Hey, now.

603
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:17,028
I like the paint.

604
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:20,031
It's accurate for what it is
that you're trying to say.

605
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,433
Just, actually, side view
for a second, if you don't mind.

606
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:22,968
Oh, the side view's good, too.
Yeah.

607
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:24,703
You can see
the plant influence there

608
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:26,872
- with the different ruffles.
- Oh, yeah.

609
00:30:26,873 --> 00:30:27,873
Thanks.

610
00:30:30,943 --> 00:30:34,045
Oh, it's so cool, this
cutaway, you can see through it.

611
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,947
Can you turn
all the way around?

612
00:30:35,982 --> 00:30:37,782
- Yeah.
- That's cool, man.

613
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:40,118
Resembles bone and a horn.

614
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,420
That form language
is totally unique.

615
00:30:42,455 --> 00:30:45,557
Thank you.

616
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,025
It's a batichoke.

617
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,529
He's not as scary
as the others that I saw.

618
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:52,497
The judges are really
examining our makeup,

619
00:30:52,532 --> 00:30:55,600
and the color doesn't look
scary enough.

620
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:58,370
At this point, I'm just really
hoping that we're at least safe.

621
00:31:05,002 --> 00:31:07,336
The shapes are great, but
the color choices are strange.

622
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,639
He's not as scary
as the others that I saw.

623
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:12,174
The paint job
is looking too blotchy,

624
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,143
and he doesn't look
scary enough.

625
00:31:14,177 --> 00:31:15,711
I'm just hoping
that we're at least safe.

626
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:19,482
Thank you.

627
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:21,217
She is creepy
and scary-looking.

628
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:24,587
That's a really, really
good job using the hyena form

629
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,756
to create something
that's almost demonic.

630
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,525
The jaw's power is, like,
all the way back there, too.

631
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:34,196
Top to bottom,
really good palette.

632
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:35,865
The unfortunate thing
about this

633
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:38,601
is a lack of detail
in the paint job

634
00:31:38,635 --> 00:31:40,836
and the softness of the skull

635
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:46,208
make it exactly
what I asked them not to do.

636
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:48,244
That's pretty impressive.

637
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:50,246
I like how the jaw
comes out like a real piranha,

638
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,547
kind of, like, aggressive jaw.

639
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:54,183
Open your mouth for me.
Cool.

640
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:57,019
- Groovy.
- Thank you.

641
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,295
So, Josh, what did you think
of tonight's makeups?

642
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,697
They were all so cool,

643
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:11,467
and I feel like
I would run from that on set.

644
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:12,868
Very creepy.

645
00:32:12,903 --> 00:32:15,071
And I have to say
congratulations to the coaches.

646
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:17,740
I mean, your presence is
definitely making an impact.

647
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:22,244
- Really.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

648
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,413
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

649
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:25,848
so let's find out
what they thought.

650
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:29,018
Logan and Anthony.

651
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:31,754
Daniel and Kelly.

652
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:34,123
Rob and Jamie.

653
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:36,125
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

654
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,928
and can head back
to the makeup room.

655
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:40,663
Thanks.

656
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:47,570
The rest of you were the best

657
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:49,505
and the worst this week.

658
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:52,508
The judges would like to
find out more about your work.

659
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:55,377
Emily and Regina,
if you'd please step up.

660
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:02,284
Tell us about your character
and who did what.

661
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,854
We incorporated the plant
into the texture

662
00:33:04,888 --> 00:33:06,789
and used a little bit
of the plant color

663
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:09,225
and the silhouette of a hyena.

664
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:11,360
Emily built the front piece,
the back piece,

665
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:12,828
and did all the hair.

666
00:33:12,863 --> 00:33:15,664
I sculpted a little bit
of the face, she did, too,

667
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,833
and we worked on
the cowl together as well.

668
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,970
I think it's fantastic.

669
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:23,439
Using the size of your model,

670
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:26,408
you created a character
that's lithe and dexterous,

671
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:28,177
and that's what
makes it dangerous.

672
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:29,712
The proportions
are absolutely gorgeous.

673
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:32,047
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

674
00:33:32,082 --> 00:33:33,616
For me, you killed it.

675
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,752
You captured that predatory look
in this creation,

676
00:33:36,787 --> 00:33:38,454
and the colors
are just so organic

677
00:33:38,488 --> 00:33:40,790
and really fantastic-looking.

678
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:42,324
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

679
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,228
The concept feels cohesive,
as, like, this hybrid animal.

680
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:48,564
And I like how the chest comes
out like the ribcage of a hyena.

681
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:51,100
And, also, she looks like she
really enjoys being a predator.

682
00:33:51,134 --> 00:33:52,568
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

683
00:33:52,602 --> 00:33:55,070
No question, this is a
beautiful character head to toe.

684
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:57,606
The silhouette is marvelous.

685
00:33:57,641 --> 00:34:00,509
The use of the hemp
is so smart.

686
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:03,312
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

687
00:34:03,346 --> 00:34:05,347
Emily and Regina,
if you'd please step back.

688
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:13,522
Julian and Adam, you're next.

689
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:21,030
Tell me about
your plant/animal choice

690
00:34:21,064 --> 00:34:22,932
and who did what
on this creation.

691
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:26,635
We got a bat
and a sugarbush protea.

692
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,039
I drew a concept of
a sleek bat assassin warrior.

693
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:32,474
I sculpted the cowl

694
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:36,078
and fabricated the pieces on
the back as well as the arms.

695
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:39,682
Julian sculpted the face, and
we both tackled the paint job,

696
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:41,851
and we both did
a lot of the detailing.

697
00:34:41,885 --> 00:34:45,955
Looks like a psychedelic
artichoke with a bat face on it.

698
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,691
I think there's a little bit
too much plant in it for me,

699
00:34:48,725 --> 00:34:50,893
and if you wouldn't have
painted him lime green,

700
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:52,928
I think he would have been
much scarier-looking,

701
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:55,598
'cause the face is really good.

702
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:58,667
You have so much of the plant
already in the shape of the head

703
00:34:58,702 --> 00:35:00,502
and the shape of the back
of the head and the arms,

704
00:35:00,537 --> 00:35:02,271
that I think you maybe
could have gone

705
00:35:02,305 --> 00:35:03,839
darker with the color
on the face

706
00:35:03,874 --> 00:35:06,442
to get more of the bat involved.

707
00:35:06,476 --> 00:35:08,544
Thank you, guys.
Please step back.

708
00:35:08,578 --> 00:35:10,813
Thanks.

709
00:35:13,817 --> 00:35:15,384
All right,
let's talk to Ben and Darla.

710
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:17,519
Please step to the center.

711
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:23,459
Could you tell us what your
creature and your plant were

712
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,561
and kind of who did what
on the sculpture?

713
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:27,863
We had the ram and the cactus.

714
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:31,433
I primarily sculpted the face.
Ben primarily sculpted the cowl.

715
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,669
Ben did a lot of the ridge work,
and then I went through

716
00:35:33,703 --> 00:35:37,573
and did the striations
along all the horns.

717
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:40,676
- I think it's so cool.
- Thanks.

718
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,945
Looking into that face,
the darkness of the eyes

719
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:44,513
and then all the shapes
coming out,

720
00:35:44,547 --> 00:35:46,448
the technique on it
and the coloration,

721
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:50,653
the painting, everything is
so demonic ram-cactusy.

722
00:35:50,687 --> 00:35:53,088
It's pretty awesome.
I'm a big fan, for sure, yeah.

723
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:56,492
<i>This is my favorite makeup
I've seen on Face Off.</i>

724
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:57,760
Wow.

725
00:35:57,794 --> 00:35:59,461
You've done some things here
with the forms

726
00:35:59,496 --> 00:36:02,531
that could so easily
have gone south on you.

727
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,266
- I'm so impressed.
- Thank you.

728
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:08,370
This thing scares
the heck out of me.

729
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:09,672
He looks like something
that's been

730
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:11,006
out in the desert for years,

731
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:15,911
- and that paint job is awesome.
- Thank you so much.

732
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:18,013
Ben and Darla,
if you'd please step back.

733
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:27,056
Stephanie and Alan,
please step forward.

734
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:33,963
So tell us
about your plant/animal fusion

735
00:36:33,997 --> 00:36:35,564
and the division of labor.

736
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:39,101
Our inspiration was
the thorny dragon and cockscomb.

737
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:41,603
He's supposed to be
a stealth predator and venomous,

738
00:36:41,638 --> 00:36:43,405
that's the saliva,

739
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,908
and all the horns are actually
protruding venom.

740
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:48,410
Stephanie sculpted the face,
I sculpted the cowl,

741
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:49,912
she detailed the face,

742
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,314
and then we both shared
the labor on the paint.

743
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:58,887
It's too soft
and too devoid of texture.

744
00:36:58,922 --> 00:37:02,257
The masseter muscle
on the maxilla and mandible

745
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:06,061
feel goitrous
more than it does powerful.

746
00:37:06,096 --> 00:37:07,563
- Yeah, right in here?
- Yeah.

747
00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:09,398
Yeah, I was trying to go
for a venom sac.

748
00:37:09,432 --> 00:37:11,467
Okay, that explains it,
because that does feel

749
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:13,535
completely incongruous
to the rest of it,

750
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,271
but knowing that that probably
is the venom sac versus a muscle

751
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:19,074
is a good idea,
just not well-executed.

752
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:24,380
It's got almost an anime
cartoon aesthetic to it,

753
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:27,616
and that lends to
an unfortunate lack of ferocity,

754
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,785
which is what
we were looking for.

755
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:33,022
The fact that you made him
all yellow makes him not scary.

756
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,992
He just looks like
a little kid's candy pop.

757
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:38,994
Thank you both.
If you'd please step back.

758
00:37:45,602 --> 00:37:46,769
Thank you, guys.

759
00:37:46,803 --> 00:37:48,270
Please head back
to the makeup room

760
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:50,672
while the judges deliberate.

761
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:58,814
All right, judges,
let's start with your favorites.

762
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:01,083
How about
Regina and Emily's work?

763
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:03,185
Totally put together well.

764
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:05,954
Loved the hemp fibers
and the little grass treatments.

765
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:08,190
She was mean, sleek.

766
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:09,691
Because of also
the smaller model,

767
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:10,893
the proportions were great.

768
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:13,195
They did a great job
of striking that balance

769
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:15,330
of finding notes that say hyena

770
00:38:15,365 --> 00:38:19,468
without directly putting hyena
anatomy onto a person's face.

771
00:38:19,502 --> 00:38:21,070
I'm thrilled
with their approach.

772
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:23,238
All right, let's move on
to Ben and Darla.

773
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:25,074
I thought the face
was really great.

774
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,975
That thing was
so realistic-looking.

775
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,145
It had that dried out,
skeletal effect.

776
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,914
It was almost like a ghost ram.

777
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:35,751
Ben's sculpture of the cowl,
that back view...

778
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:37,786
- Oh, yeah.
- ...is so gorgeous.

779
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:40,022
All right, judges,
let's move on to the makeups

780
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,958
that didn't quite work
so well this week.

781
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:45,027
Why don't we start
with Julian and Adam?

782
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,129
The bat and the sugarbush.

783
00:38:47,163 --> 00:38:49,498
They did exactly what
we told them not to do.

784
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:53,102
They did a bat face with
the artichoke head in the back.

785
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:54,837
The color really killed them.

786
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:56,305
I think what you're saying
is absolutely right.

787
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:57,673
If you had put
some more darkness into it,

788
00:38:57,707 --> 00:38:58,874
made it look a little more evil,

789
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,242
that would have really done
a lot for me.

790
00:39:00,276 --> 00:39:02,511
All right, let's move on
to Stephanie and Alan.

791
00:39:02,545 --> 00:39:03,912
It wasn't scary-looking.

792
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:05,514
It was like
a little kid's lollipop.

793
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:08,317
It was just too sweet.
It was yellow...

794
00:39:08,351 --> 00:39:10,085
And you know what else,
I think it was a mistake

795
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,689
that Alan put those pouches,
those goitery-looking things.

796
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,591
Like, to add on,
like, venom sacs,

797
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,692
you got to make 'em venom sacs

798
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:18,861
and not blobule jowls.

799
00:39:18,895 --> 00:39:20,729
All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

800
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:22,064
- Yep.
- We're there.

801
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,999
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

802
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:34,776
Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

803
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:37,012
Emily and Regina,

804
00:39:37,046 --> 00:39:39,214
between the super cool
facial shapes

805
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:40,849
and all the fabrication,

806
00:39:40,884 --> 00:39:42,951
your character
really came together.

807
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:46,355
Ben and Darla,
we were all taken aback

808
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:49,391
by your bold concepts
and incredible shapes.

809
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:51,627
Okay, which team
came out on top?

810
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:53,028
Our top team tonight is...

811
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,525
Okay, which team
came out on top?

812
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,730
Our top team tonight is...

813
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:09,332
Ben and Darla.

814
00:40:13,104 --> 00:40:15,906
This is one of the most
incredible concepts

815
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,374
that we have ever seen
on the show.

816
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,010
There were such clever nods
to the forms

817
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:22,546
of both your animal
and your plant.

818
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,581
- Amazing.
- Thank you.

819
00:40:24,615 --> 00:40:26,416
Ben and Darla, excellent work,

820
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:28,452
but as you know,
we can only have one winner.

821
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:32,255
- Glenn?
- Tonight's winner is...

822
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,090
- Ben.
- Nice.

823
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:39,463
That cowl
was just awe-inspiring.

824
00:40:39,497 --> 00:40:41,531
I made a promise to myself

825
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,533
that if I ever won
a spotlight challenge,

826
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:45,268
that I'd propose
to my girlfriend.

827
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:50,707
So, Stephanie Rae Goreman,
will you marry me?

828
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:51,908
Ben, congratulations,

829
00:40:51,943 --> 00:40:53,977
and congratulations to you
as well, Anthony.

830
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:55,078
Thank you.

831
00:40:55,112 --> 00:40:57,747
All right, Ben, Darla,
Emily, and Regina,

832
00:40:57,782 --> 00:40:59,182
you're all safe
and can head back

833
00:40:59,217 --> 00:41:01,184
to the makeup room
with your coaches.

834
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:09,192
All right, guys,
that means the rest of you

835
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:12,596
are on the bottom this week, and
one of you will be going home.

836
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,131
Please step forward.

837
00:41:22,139 --> 00:41:24,975
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom teams.

838
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:28,678
Julian and Adam, while we
thought the face was menacing,

839
00:41:28,713 --> 00:41:31,248
the paint job
undermined your character.

840
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,049
Stephanie and Alan.

841
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:36,086
While the sweeping shapes
of the face and the cowl

842
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,421
were really cool,
the light color palette

843
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:40,957
made him feel friendly
instead of scary.

844
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:42,926
So who is going home tonight?

845
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,561
The person
going home tonight is...

846
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:51,501
Alan.
Such a tough night.

847
00:41:51,536 --> 00:41:55,539
None of the makeups were bad,
but ultimately the venom sac

848
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:58,842
negatively affected
the appeal of your character.

849
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:00,444
Alan, I'm so sorry,

850
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,779
but that means
you have been eliminated.

851
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,916
Julian, Adam, Stephanie,
you are safe this week.

852
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,218
You can head back
to the makeup room.

853
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,192
I've been there before, too,
man.

854
00:42:15,226 --> 00:42:16,660
So many times in auditions,

855
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:18,929
I've been told "Believe in
yourself" and then get told no,

856
00:42:18,963 --> 00:42:20,497
it's the hardest thing
in the world,

857
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:21,965
but you're an artist,
and you're gonna keep at it.

858
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,600
Thank you very much
for your honest opinions.

859
00:42:23,635 --> 00:42:26,670
I want you to go out of here
with your head held high, man.

860
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:29,439
Alan, if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

861
00:42:29,474 --> 00:42:31,208
- and pack up your kit.
- See you later, guys.

862
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:32,476
- Good luck, dude.
- Good luck, honey.

863
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,544
- Bye, Al.
- It's hard to leave now,

864
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:37,180
making it only this far.

865
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:38,915
I have no regrets.

866
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,684
I've gotten
a lot of experiences,

867
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:41,852
I've made a lot of new friends.

868
00:42:41,886 --> 00:42:43,654
Hey, thanks for picking me.

869
00:42:43,688 --> 00:42:45,155
Glad I picked you.

870
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:47,691
I've grown quite a bit as
an artist in this competition.

871
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:49,126
And I'm going to continue
to do makeup

872
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,560
till I can't do it no more.
