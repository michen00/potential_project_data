1
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:02,722
This is
an impressive first showing.

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:05,091
This is not a makeup
that works.

3
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:07,694
You're all my children now.

4
00:00:07,728 --> 00:00:09,362
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:10,997
16 artists arrived
in Los Angeles

6
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:12,866
for a life-and-death
final audition.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,235
- None of you are on the show yet.
- Oh, dear.

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,770
Dina's wood nymph
brought her the win...

9
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:17,971
Thank you so much.

10
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,907
But Scott and Gabby
did not make the cut.

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,077
14 artists survived.

12
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:25,579
<i>Face Off!</i>

13
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:28,815
And tonight, they will take on
their first spotlight challenge.

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,585
Each of these items represents
an actual gangster.

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:33,220
And though
many will struggle...

16
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:34,221
We're in trouble.

17
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:36,089
...one will snuff out
the competition.

18
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,724
Absolutely stellar makeup.

19
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:39,693
It was a poor idea.

20
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:41,695
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:43,230
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

22
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,299
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:48,568
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:48,603 --> 00:00:50,904
and $100,000.

25
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:55,275
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

26
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:29,071
Sync and corrections by n17t01

27
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:34,989
- Wow.
- Oh, wow.

28
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,191
- This is crazy.
- We arrive at the house.

29
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:38,359
And it's gorgeous.

30
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:41,195
- Whoa, no way!
- Yeah!

31
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,796
I can't believe
we're staying here.

32
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:43,797
The house is amazing.

33
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:46,066
- Ping-pong table!
- Wow.

34
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:47,501
I see photos of makeup

35
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:48,669
from previous cast members

36
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,237
representing life and death.

37
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:53,274
There's this koi pond
and a pool outside.

38
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:55,009
We are gonna have
an awesome time.

39
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:57,144
<i>Face Off!</i>

40
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:58,579
Whoo-hoo!

41
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:06,553
Today we get
to Universal Studios.

42
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:09,023
Oh, look.
A sweet dodge.

43
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:11,458
We're looking at all of
the buildings and all the sets,

44
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:14,628
and it's unbelievable.

45
00:02:14,663 --> 00:02:16,864
I see McKenzie down there,
and she's standing next

46
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:19,934
to peanuts and bananas,
and there's a big tuna.

47
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,369
This doesn't really
make any sense.

48
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:24,471
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

49
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:26,307
Welcome to New York Street,

50
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,943
here in the heart
of Universal Studios Hollywood,

51
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:30,911
home to one of the most
historic back lots

52
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,813
in the film industry.

53
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:35,516
Countless Oscar-winning
films were shot here,

54
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,751
including<i> The Sting</i>
and<i> Dick Tracy,</i>

55
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:41,956
which are both widely regarded
as classic gangster films.

56
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,725
From Scarface
to Sammy The Bull,

57
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,795
old-school gangsters often
took on colorful nicknames

58
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,965
that represented their
appearances or dirty deeds.

59
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,968
Films like<i> Dick Tracy</i>
and<i> Sin City</i>

60
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:55,436
took these nicknames
and used them

61
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,272
to inspire
their over-the-top makeups.

62
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:00,674
So in this spotlight challenge,

63
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,013
you will create your very own
over-the-top crime boss...

64
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:07,049
inspired by the nickname

65
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,617
of a real-life gangster.

66
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,185
- Awesome.
- I'm really thrilled

67
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,453
that we have this challenge,

68
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,122
because I'm a huge fan
of<i> Dick Tracy.</i>

69
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:15,557
Those characters
are so far out there.

70
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,926
Each of these items
represents the nickname

71
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,329
of an actual dead gangster.

72
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:23,165
Working in teams of two,
you'll choose one of these items

73
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,034
and use it to inspire
your character.

74
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,872
All right, guys, your randomly
assigned teams are...

75
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,340
Gwen and Drew,

76
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:33,842
Rachael and Vince,

77
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:36,345
Doc and Stella,

78
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:38,680
Barry and Sasha,

79
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,516
George and Cig,

80
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,519
- Dina and Jason...
- Awesome.

81
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:46,288
Keaghlan and Damien.

82
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:49,158
Go ahead and stand
with your new teammate.

83
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:53,362
Gwen and Drew,

84
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:54,730
you have first pick.

85
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:56,431
- Go ahead.
- Shark.

86
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:58,700
All right,
in honor of <i>Sharknado 2,</i>

87
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:01,236
which airs tomorrow night
on SyFy,

88
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,973
you chose
Michele "The Shark" Sindona.

89
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,075
Rachael and Vince.

90
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,377
Typewriter.

91
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,513
You have Charles
"The Typewriter" Nicoletti.

92
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,649
- Doc and Stella.
- Needles.

93
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:16,685
Leonard "Needles" Gianola.

94
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:18,453
- Barry and Sasha.
- Clock.

95
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:21,089
Allie "Tick Tock" Tannenbaum.

96
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,758
- George and Cig.
- The tuna.

97
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:26,395
- Tony "Big Tuna" Accardo.
- Yes.

98
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,497
- Dina and Jason.
- Peanuts.

99
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:30,966
John "Peanuts" Tronolone.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,234
Keaghlan and Damien.

101
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:33,569
All right,
we're gonna go with the truck.

102
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:37,673
You have
Opal "Mack Truck" Long.

103
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:40,342
Now I have a special surprise
for you.

104
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,945
I've brought someone
who knows gangster movie makeup

105
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,680
better than anyone else.

106
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,048
He won an Academy Award

107
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:48,550
for his innovative makeups
in<i> Dick Tracy,</i>

108
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:51,253
and he also won two Emmys
for his visual effects work

109
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:53,055
on<i> Battlestar Galactica.</i>

110
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:56,124
- No way.
- Please give a warm welcome

111
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,594
to the incredible Doug Drexler.

112
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,896
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

113
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,397
Whoo!

114
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:03,799
I'm a huge fan of his.

115
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,934
I watched<i> Dick Tracy</i>
so many times as a kid

116
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,769
that the tape wore out.

117
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,371
Oh, boy.
Wow, wow.

118
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:13,275
Doug will be joining us
on the reveal stage

119
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:15,577
- to give his final thoughts.
- Oh, I can't wait. Oh, boy.

120
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,880
What advice can you give
these guys?

121
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:19,948
The important thing to remember

122
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,550
is if it's too on the nose,

123
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,185
it probably
isn't interesting enough.

124
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,455
It has to be a turn of the screw
into fantasy.

125
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,857
But you don't want to take
your makeup so far

126
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,158
where people can't
relate to it.

127
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:32,027
That's fantastic advice.

128
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,362
Thank you so much
for being here today.

129
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:34,796
My pleasure.

130
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:38,000
All right, guys, I want you
to get started on your designs.

131
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:40,235
When you're finished,
go check out that lab.

132
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,104
Yeah.

133
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:43,272
My dad and I will be by
later on

134
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:44,606
to check in on your progress.

135
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:46,642
Good luck.

136
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,315
Definitely some big, like,
bruiser knuckles and stuff.

137
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:55,984
George and I got
Tony "Big Tuna" Accardo.

138
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,853
He should have a cigar
stuck in his fat wrinkle.

139
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,755
That would be cool.

140
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,323
We don't want to make
a straight fish guy,

141
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:03,025
so we give him
fishlike features.

142
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,694
And his bio says
that he was notorious

143
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:07,262
for using a baseball bat.

144
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:08,397
So we think it'd be really funny

145
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:09,531
if we switch out
the baseball bat

146
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:12,100
and he just kills people
with a giant tuna.

147
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:13,702
He's sleeping
with the fishes, see?

148
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:14,870
We got to play up on that.

149
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:17,205
He ratted people out
when he got caught.

150
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,907
Sasha and I have the clock.

151
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:22,978
And our gangster is
Allie "Tick Tock" Tannenbaum.

152
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,379
He was a stool pigeon.
He was a rat.

153
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:26,949
So I want to incorporate
that idea into it.

154
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:30,652
I really don't like rat makeup.

155
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:31,853
So are we good
with this direction?

156
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:33,255
Like a rat face?

157
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:34,423
No, because I kind of
love mine.

158
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:35,824
I have this idea

159
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,559
to make
this awesome grandfather clock.

160
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:39,394
We have to represent
a gangster.

161
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:40,896
Like, where's
the gangster element?

162
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,931
That's the evil face.

163
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:45,000
And the mustache
is the hands on the clock.

164
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:48,870
I don't think Sasha's concept
is very gangster,

165
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:51,606
so it's not gonna work.

166
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:54,810
Stella and I have
Leonard "Needles" Gianola.

167
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,212
Needles.
Kind of like when a porcu--

168
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,914
How a porcupine spikes.

169
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:01,016
We're thinking let's do
something with the hair.

170
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,517
Also, he is an assassin,

171
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:04,853
so let's have some sort of slit
in the fingers,

172
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,189
and these needles would come out
as his weapon.

173
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:09,491
For the hat,
we can get a fedora.

174
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,994
And then if we get a feather,
it'll represent a fin, you know?

175
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:13,929
Gwen and I decide to take
the shark's jaw.

176
00:07:13,963 --> 00:07:16,465
I have this really cool idea
for this shark guy.

177
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,500
He should have
really sharp features.

178
00:07:18,534 --> 00:07:20,669
And since our object
was the teeth,

179
00:07:20,703 --> 00:07:22,004
I decide that we should make

180
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:25,574
these really awesome shark jaw
dental appliances

181
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,642
so that he'll actually have,
like, the mouth of a shark.

182
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:29,878
This guy's like a monster.

183
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:33,648
Hey, everyone,
let's go check out the lab.

184
00:07:33,683 --> 00:07:35,217
We're leaving
to head to the lab,

185
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,453
and we decide to do
Barry's concept of the rat.

186
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:40,889
This isn't the direction
I would have gone,

187
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:43,091
but I just want to work well
with a partner.

188
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,160
Barry seems to really know
what he's talking about,

189
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:47,262
so I'm going to trust him.

190
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,564
To the lab!

191
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:56,805
Oh, man.

192
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,939
Oh, dude, we're here.

193
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,775
- Oh, radical.
- This is it. This is it.

194
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:01,043
- Yeah!
- Awesome.

195
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:02,444
We get to the lab
for the first time,

196
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,280
and it has everything I could
possibly ever want to use.

197
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:08,283
Wow.

198
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:09,618
The first thing that stands out

199
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,220
are the rainbow colors
of Kryolan.

200
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:15,857
I'm really stoked to use those.

201
00:08:15,892 --> 00:08:18,460
So we pick our models,
and it's time to get started.

202
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:23,031
So it's day one in the lab.

203
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,533
We have six hours.

204
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:27,936
And Gwen and I know that we need
to get the face done and molded.

205
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,271
First thing I sculpt

206
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:32,240
is the shape of the gums
onto the life cast.

207
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,542
I'm doing the cowl.

208
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:35,010
I want this guy
to be top-heavy,

209
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:39,014
like a shark who doesn't really
have shoulders.

210
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:41,083
Lettering is kind of
important, because it has to be

211
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,318
sort of like it's from
a machine, it's typewritten.

212
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:44,753
Charles "The Typewriter"
Nicoletti

213
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:46,054
is our real-life gangster.

214
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,224
Our concept is
this big, brute boxer

215
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:51,626
with these typewriter
brass knuckles

216
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,663
and the names of his victims
carved in his head.

217
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:57,732
Glenn, Neville,

218
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,635
- um, Ve, and Lois, right?
- Yeah, I like it. Yeah.

219
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,106
Our makeup will require
a lot of skin detail.

220
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,640
It's gonna be
really time-consuming,

221
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:08,510
so I'm hoping
that we can pull it off.

222
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:10,645
Movie magic.

223
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,813
I start blocking out the cowl

224
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:13,248
while George starts
blocking out the face.

225
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:14,716
What do you think of this
so far?

226
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,717
Yeah.

227
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,952
We really want to make
a badass makeup.

228
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:19,488
I can't wait to have
Doug Drexler look at it.

229
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,723
And I hope he doesn't
tear it apart.

230
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:23,158
If we have the head tilt,
which way do you think

231
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:24,726
it should tilt?
This way?

232
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,696
Our gangster's name
is John "Peanuts" Tronolone.

233
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,165
And he was
very greed-oriented,

234
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,967
so we want to bring that
into our makeup.

235
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:34,536
So Jason and I are going
to make the top of the head

236
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,838
more fantasy by giving it
a peanut texture.

237
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,007
We're gonna keep
the peanut shell open on top

238
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,710
and throw a bunch of jewels
and money up there

239
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:44,913
to show that he's
a flashy, sleazy kind of dude.

240
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:47,749
Well, I was gonna go
for, like, the venting,

241
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:49,417
like, on the side of that car.

242
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:51,253
Our real-life gangster
is Opal "Mack Truck" Long,

243
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:52,554
who was built
like a mack truck.

244
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:54,122
So Keaghlan and I
decide to create

245
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:56,725
a half gangster/half truck
hybrid.

246
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,394
We want to do four headlight
appliances on a hat,

247
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:02,731
a hood emblem on the collarbone,
as well as a face appliance.

248
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:07,836
How can you have a gangster
challenge without a dirty rat?

249
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,806
Concept is a dude
with really big ears,

250
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,408
reminiscent of rat,

251
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:16,311
but still have
a human anatomy going on.

252
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:19,281
Sasha's working on the face,
and I'm on the cowl.

253
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:23,411
Making the face pristine
takes away from it, you know?

254
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:26,047
I think we can come together
and make this work.

255
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,652
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

256
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:32,120
Oh, my God.
Michael Westmore is here.

257
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:33,788
How are you?

258
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:36,224
We get our first one-on-one
with Michael Westmore.

259
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:37,926
He's worked on countless films,

260
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,628
and I'm uber-worried
about what he's got to say.

261
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:42,864
So our guy was an assassin.

262
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:44,499
And the way
he assassinates people

263
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:46,468
is he will take the quills
from his head.

264
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:48,003
And then tomorrow
we're going to fabricate,

265
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,771
like, an actual
poison dart system.

266
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:52,240
If you actually incorporated
maybe these

267
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:54,542
into just little finger cups,

268
00:10:54,577 --> 00:10:56,811
that way it's just, hello, bam.

269
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:57,812
Okay.

270
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,247
This is the peanut inside?

271
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,482
Yeah, yeah.

272
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:03,351
Your paint job is gonna
be extremely important,

273
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:04,819
because you have to try
to sell the idea

274
00:11:04,854 --> 00:11:06,821
this is a peanut,
not a broken egg.

275
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,123
- Yeah.
- Right.

276
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:10,291
Tell us about what
you're doing conceptually.

277
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:12,861
Yeah. How are you working
the clock into your sculpture?

278
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:16,264
Well, we're actually doing
a ratlike character.

279
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:19,534
Um, another element
of the real person

280
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:20,635
was that he was a rat.

281
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:22,170
You've been given
a challenge...

282
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:24,906
- Yup.
- ...and it isn't here.

283
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:30,545
How does this really represent
the clock?

284
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:33,466
I don't know
how to answer that.

285
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,476
We are in trouble.

286
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,958
Now I'm actually
a little bit worried.

287
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,428
Coming up...

288
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:47,100
I totally screwed the pooch
on that. Shit.

289
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,301
We're screwed.

290
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:50,603
I really like your character.

291
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:53,639
You've got some serious issues.

292
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:01,766
How does this really
represent the clock?

293
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,734
It's day one
of our gangster challenge,

294
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:07,772
and Mr. Westmore isn't fond
of our idea.

295
00:12:07,806 --> 00:12:10,708
You've been given a challenge,
and it isn't here.

296
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:13,978
We don't see how the clock
really ties in with your makeup.

297
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,680
I don't know
how to answer that.

298
00:12:15,714 --> 00:12:19,116
Okay. If you put a time bomb
on him or something...

299
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,419
Something to incorporate
that idea.

300
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:24,288
But you need to sell
the idea of the clock.

301
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,523
- Okay.
- Okay. For sure.

302
00:12:25,557 --> 00:12:26,591
- We'll make sure we do that.
- All right.

303
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,659
- Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

304
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:30,695
Now we're trying to figure out
how to work in a clock.

305
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:32,230
He's a ticking time bomb.

306
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,332
We can make dynamite sticks.
I can do fabrication

307
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,667
to get, you know,
get it attached to him.

308
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:37,935
I really want
to do Barry's vision,

309
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,670
so whatever he's saying,

310
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:42,006
I'm just gonna really try
to work with it.

311
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,641
- We'll see what happens.
- Okay.

312
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:44,976
We picked typewriter,

313
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,944
and there's gonna be words
branded into his head.

314
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:49,146
He's also got brass knuckles
with letters on them.

315
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:50,581
You're gonna have to make
your letters

316
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,483
or your exclamation points
and things like that

317
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,352
very legible.

318
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:55,519
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

319
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:57,922
- Good-bye, everybody.
- Bye.

320
00:12:57,956 --> 00:12:59,957
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you.

321
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:08,366
I don't think
I have enough time to mold this.

322
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,167
No, you know what?
I'm gonna do it right now.

323
00:13:10,202 --> 00:13:12,303
Do it.
Run, run, run.

324
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,773
You make a mold by layering
a plaster-like substance

325
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:17,341
over your sculpture.

326
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,977
Once the mold hardens,
you clean it out

327
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,113
and you pour in foam
or silicone,

328
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,248
which will eventually become
your prosthetic.

329
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,025
There'll be
some lettering here.

330
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:38,296
I was hoping to get
the face molded today.

331
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,797
But we're running out of time,

332
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,866
so we're going
to mold it tomorrow.

333
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,734
I decide to make a stencil
for the names

334
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,504
so that the writing looks like
it's from a typewriter.

335
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:49,940
We'll go in and make incisions
where this letter should be.

336
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,375
But it's extremely
time-consuming.

337
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,010
I can't believe you're cutting
all this shit out.

338
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,979
You and me both.

339
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,148
All right, guys.
30 minutes left.

340
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:02,053
All right, start scraping.

341
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:06,857
Ten minutes, guys.

342
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:09,026
- Fuck.
- These are cool.

343
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,533
All right, everybody.
That's time.

344
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:20,171
It's the end of the day, and
I'm feeling a little frustrated.

345
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,573
I'm disappointed that we didn't
get to do any of the moldings,

346
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,442
and I'm feeling
a little nervous.

347
00:14:24,476 --> 00:14:27,311
We have a lot to do tomorrow
so that we don't fall behind.

348
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,221
- Yes.
- Yay, yay, yay, yay.

349
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:38,489
Whoo!

350
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:40,458
It's day two
of the gangster challenge,

351
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:41,826
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab.

352
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,127
That's cool.
I didn't get to see

353
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:44,628
the whole back half yesterday.

354
00:14:44,663 --> 00:14:46,764
What we have to do today
is finish the headpiece

355
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,867
and figure out some way
to incorporate poison

356
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:52,937
and get his actual weapon
incorporated into the makeup.

357
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,071
- All of this?
- Yup.

358
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,107
Mr. Westmore said
he would like to see

359
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,209
the needles come out
of the character's fingers,

360
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:00,845
and that's when I decided
to life-cast my fingers...

361
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,313
We're doing these two, right?

362
00:15:02,347 --> 00:15:03,781
- Yup.
- So we could sculpt on those

363
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:06,584
and create some type of
finger cup for needles to wear.

364
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:08,686
Let me know if there's anything
I can do with one hand.

365
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,820
Symmetry,
that isn't too important.

366
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:12,456
- We can adjust it.
- It looks fantastic.

367
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,959
Our big task today is getting
the chest sculpture completed.

368
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,428
As Keaghlan finishes up
the smaller pieces,

369
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,897
I start sculpting out
some more headlight details.

370
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:22,366
Once I'm done molding
all of our smaller designs,

371
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,635
we can both start tackling
this big chest mold

372
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:25,870
that we have to get done.

373
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,205
That looks good.
I like that.

374
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,741
This is perfectly jolly.

375
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:33,144
The foam piece fits perfectly
on the cowl,

376
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:34,545
so we just start molding that
right away.

377
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,213
So while George is doing that,

378
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,549
I foam-fabricate
the fat suit.

379
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:42,019
It's really important
to keep the proportions correct,

380
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:45,055
so it'll look like
a realistic big, fat tuna man.

381
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,126
On the neck,
a very visible spot.

382
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,494
You know, maybe this side.

383
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,530
So this morning there's
a lot of details to work out,

384
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:53,898
and we don't have
a lot of time.

385
00:15:53,932 --> 00:15:56,333
Stella, there are two Ls
in your name, right?

386
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:57,935
Yeah, baby.

387
00:15:57,969 --> 00:15:59,637
Rachael and I thought,
wouldn't it be cool

388
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:02,573
if the victims' names were also
some of the cast members' names?

389
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,811
I'm carving the names
into the cowl,

390
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:08,712
and Vince is doing the same
for the face piece.

391
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,815
We need to get this done
as quickly as possible,

392
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:12,883
because we have
to start molding.

393
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:15,986
We should texture this,

394
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:17,555
just take the sponge
and chip brush to it.

395
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:19,557
Dina and I have to finish
sculpting the cowl and the belly

396
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:20,891
as fast as possible,

397
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,693
so we can get the molds
ready for foam.

398
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:24,695
We have a lot
to get done today.

399
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:27,753
I am so happy.

400
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,354
We see that the face
lines up with he cowl.

401
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:31,434
So I don't have
to fix anything.

402
00:16:31,469 --> 00:16:33,270
It's good to have that weight
off of our shoulders.

403
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,971
It slopes down. We're not gonna
have any problems with that.

404
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:36,173
- I was so worried about that.
- Yeah.

405
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:39,242
We've refined the concept
a little bit

406
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:41,778
by adding a time bomb
with a clock.

407
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:45,882
So I'm really excited
to do my clock and not a rat.

408
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,684
I make a whole bunch
of sticks of dynamite,

409
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:49,186
and I'm gonna attach
a whole bunch

410
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,354
of complicated-looking
electrical cords.

411
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,257
I'm feeling a little better
about this situation.

412
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:57,360
We've finally got
a cohesive thing going.

413
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,396
Better late than never.

414
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:05,936
Fat suit's ready to test out.

415
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,237
Oh, shit.

416
00:17:07,271 --> 00:17:10,307
I go to check out
Cig's fat suit,

417
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,008
and it looks awesome.

418
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:13,610
Oh, yeah.

419
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:19,416
Who's gonna be sleeping
with the fishes?

420
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,451
It's a lot of fun,

421
00:17:21,485 --> 00:17:23,987
and I'm just excited
to show the judges.

422
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,117
- Beautiful.
- Nice.

423
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:37,384
No.

424
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:38,719
Jason and I are trying
to get our mold apart,

425
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:40,755
and it's stuck in there.

426
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,790
_

427
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,991
I'm on top of the table
holding the mold,

428
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:46,627
and Dina's trying
to pull that core out.

429
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:49,230
Oh, shit.

430
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,098
_

431
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:52,366
The bottom of the mold cracks.

432
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,437
If it completely breaks,
then we're screwed.

433
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,503
Oh, shit.
It's broken here.

434
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:05,204
It's day two
of our gangster challenge,

435
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,640
and Jason and I are trying
to get our mold apart.

436
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:08,908
But it's cracking.

437
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:10,610
If it completely breaks,
we're screwed.

438
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,678
- It's coming.
- It's coming? Yes!

439
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,213
Thank God.

440
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,415
We're gonna have
a pretty bad seam,

441
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,684
but hopefully
with all the textures

442
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,553
going on in the peanuts,
it won't be that noticeable.

443
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:22,588
Ow.

444
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,959
I need to make the shark teeth.

445
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:29,695
I use
a thermo-sensitive plastic.

446
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:32,031
It comes in little pallets,
and you put it in hot water,

447
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,532
and it melts
and becomes pliable.

448
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,234
And then you can shape it
into whatever you want.

449
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:45,110
I want to fabricate
a working cigar.

450
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:47,847
So I have the idea
to put a LED light

451
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,048
in the end of it.

452
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,616
I want to make it smoke too,

453
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,252
so I'm gonna take
what's called a bulb syringe

454
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,588
and load it up
with baby powder.

455
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:57,923
The model can give it a little
puff, and it'll just... whoo.

456
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,326
- Oh.
- Looks good to me.

457
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,161
Vince and I
took too much time sculpting,

458
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:04,096
so we're behind schedule.

459
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,432
It's really important to get
these pieces finished today,

460
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:10,202
because we don't want to have
to run our cowl in poly foam.

461
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,338
- Damien, do you have time?
- Yeah, a little bit.

462
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:13,706
Thanks.

463
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,307
All righty.

464
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:18,410
We have a lot of clay
stuck in our cowl mold.

465
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:20,846
And we have to be really careful
when removing it,

466
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,816
because there's so much detail.

467
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,417
If anybody's not doing nothing,

468
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:27,987
Vince and Rachael need help
cleaning their mold out.

469
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:29,094
We're getting down to the wire.

470
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,855
- How long do we have?
- About 20 minutes.

471
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:33,959
The mold is just grabbing
this clay and not letting go.

472
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:37,367
The clock is ticking, and we're
taking the clay out as fast as we can.

473
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:40,069
We need paper towels!

474
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:42,672
Everyone's helping
get these things clean,

475
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:44,407
and I am so grateful.

476
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:46,342
All right, good.

477
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:47,987
That's time, everybody.

478
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:50,413
- Blood, sweat and tears.
- Yeah.

479
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:53,149
All right, high five.

480
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:54,617
We get our molds done.

481
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,885
I'm concerned,

482
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,620
because Rachael and I
still have a lot to do.

483
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,656
So tomorrow is gonna be tough.

484
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:14,671
So it's application day,

485
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:16,105
and we have four hours
in the lab

486
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,574
and one hour at last looks.

487
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:20,610
The first thing I do is start
seaming that chest appliance.

488
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,178
And Keaghlan starts finishing up
other little things,

489
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:24,213
like the hat.

490
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:27,850
Oh.

491
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:30,019
Our cowl is a mess.

492
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,921
There are steam packets
everywhere...

493
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:33,022
Fuck.

494
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,257
And the seam is pretty bad.

495
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,359
So we need to trim that up
and patch it,

496
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:40,229
get it nice and smooth,
so it won't be so obvious.

497
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:47,136
- I'm Doc.
- What up, Doc?

498
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:52,342
Going down? Nice.

499
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,311
_

500
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,380
- Oh, sick.
- Yeah.

501
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:00,783
Our plan for application day
is to tag-team everything.

502
00:21:00,818 --> 00:21:02,518
So Sasha puts
a bald cap on him,

503
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,354
and I start seaming the cowl.

504
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,090
There's a little bit of damage
around the seam,

505
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:08,324
but once I glue it back down,

506
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:11,394
it's not gonna be too much
of an issue.

507
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:20,770
The first thing that we do
is Stella applies the face.

508
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:22,839
In the meantime,
I paint the headpiece.

509
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,273
Let's talk about this hair
one more time.

510
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:26,042
You want to just do
brown washes over it?

511
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,678
Yes. Brown washes.

512
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,616
I do a white stipple.

513
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:35,284
And you'll really see that
come through

514
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:38,021
once you start layering
other colors on it.

515
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,324
While Vince is starting
the paint job,

516
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:42,659
I need to make
these brass knuckles.

517
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:44,093
So I take L200,

518
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:45,762
which is
a soft fabricating foam,

519
00:21:45,796 --> 00:21:47,630
and start cutting out shapes,

520
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,923
trying to imagine
what it would look like

521
00:21:49,957 --> 00:21:51,291
if I were making real ones.

522
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:53,560
I'm not super happy
with the brass knuckles.

523
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:55,962
I wish I had a couple more hours
to spend on them,

524
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:57,964
because they're such an
important part of our concept,

525
00:21:57,998 --> 00:21:59,499
but they will have to do.

526
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:00,867
One hour, guys.

527
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,169
The beast is heavy.

528
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:06,106
Stella and I realize,
with the headpiece,

529
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,541
the edges on it
are pretty rough.

530
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:11,177
I think we should cut this
to a sharp line.

531
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,079
The edges are so thick,

532
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:17,117
it's gonna look like big blobs
of goo on his head.

533
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:20,120
So I decide to cut it,
make it a hard edge.

534
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:22,789
It looks lumpy,
but we're gonna just use it

535
00:22:22,823 --> 00:22:24,324
and whatever happens, happens.

536
00:22:24,358 --> 00:22:26,860
I totally screwed the pooch
on that.

537
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:32,365
Gwen and I have to get
his teeth in.

538
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:33,833
How's that feel?

539
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:35,568
He doesn't have
as much mobility with his mouth

540
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:36,936
as I was hoping,

541
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:41,207
but they look badass,
so that's all we care about.

542
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:42,475
While Dina's throwing down
some flesh tones,

543
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,377
I go ahead
and start hot-gluing

544
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:46,146
all the jewels and poker chips
inside the peanut head.

545
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,748
We tried as best we could
to clean up all the seams,

546
00:22:48,782 --> 00:22:50,049
but it's still bugging me.

547
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:51,451
I'm not sure where we stand.

548
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:54,821
I think it all depends
on how last looks come together.

549
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,659
I'm keeping the hair
super sparse over here,

550
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:02,962
because hair doesn't really grow
on skin this damaged.

551
00:23:02,997 --> 00:23:05,131
Barry started the detail work
with the paint,

552
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,633
while I lay the hair.

553
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:10,003
This is not my best work,
but I'm just rushing,

554
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:13,239
because it's better to have
the whole head covered in hair

555
00:23:13,274 --> 00:23:14,607
than only half of the head.

556
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:16,309
He can look ratty.
He's a rat, right?

557
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:18,778
- Yup.
- Guys, that's 15 minutes.

558
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,215
That's gonna have
headlights on it.

559
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,288
This edge on the hair
looks really stupid.

560
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:30,089
And, quite frankly,
I'm worried.

561
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:32,425
I think we should bring
a little shading in here.

562
00:23:32,459 --> 00:23:34,994
I need this paint job
to sell this piece.

563
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:39,032
That's time, guys!

564
00:23:39,066 --> 00:23:42,368
I don't know that we're gonna
pull it together in last looks.

565
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:44,370
Coming up...

566
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:45,772
We're painting like crazy,

567
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:47,540
but I don't think
we're making it look better.

568
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:50,577
I'm really concerned
about how dark our paint job is.

569
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,645
I'm not fond of this makeup.

570
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,314
This is a great idea.

571
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:56,416
It cuts a striking figure.

572
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:05,731
All right,
we have the latex out.

573
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,867
- That should be, like--
- It should be in the bin.

574
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:10,703
We have an hour in last looks.
We have got all the quills in.

575
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:11,704
Everything's ready to go.

576
00:24:11,738 --> 00:24:13,606
The only thing left to do

577
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,107
is add the wefts on top
of the hairpiece

578
00:24:15,142 --> 00:24:19,012
and glue on the quills
to the fingers.

579
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:21,748
Take care of the mouth,
I'll take care of the hands.

580
00:24:23,551 --> 00:24:24,851
Right away
I start airbrushing in

581
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:26,853
all those final little details.

582
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:29,889
And I'm really happy
with how it's looking.

583
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,360
Jason and I are just trying
to get everything done.

584
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:35,895
So we're painting like crazy,

585
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,699
but I don't think
we're making it look better.

586
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:42,669
The rat face is
a grayish skin tone,

587
00:24:42,703 --> 00:24:46,106
and now I'm concerned
how dark that paint job is.

588
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,241
All I can do is lighten it up,

589
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,743
but I don't think
it's gonna look

590
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:50,944
the way I had it in my head.

591
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:53,313
Ten minutes, guys.

592
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:57,951
Gums in.

593
00:25:01,522 --> 00:25:04,524
That's time, everyone!

594
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,093
I'm not happy with this makeup.

595
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:09,162
There's a great concept
inside there.

596
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:12,265
But Sasha and I just didn't
put it together.

597
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:15,468
All I can do is just hope
for the best.

598
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:28,047
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

599
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:31,517
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

600
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:35,021
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

601
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:37,523
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

602
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:38,524
Good evening.

603
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,725
- Hey.
- Hey, Glenn.

604
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,095
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

605
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:43,863
Good evening to you.

606
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:45,098
- Hey, Lois.
- Hi, Lois.

607
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:47,667
And creature and concept
designer, Neville Page.

608
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:48,835
How are you doing, gangsters?

609
00:25:50,537 --> 00:25:54,173
We are thrilled to welcome
back Oscar-winning makeup artist

610
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:57,977
and 17-year<i> Star Trek</i> veteran,
Doug Drexler.

611
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:02,415
It's great to be here.

612
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,283
And I can't wait to see
what you guys have come up with.

613
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:06,919
Okay, before we get started,
I need to let you know

614
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:09,589
that in keeping
with this season's theme

615
00:26:09,623 --> 00:26:11,357
of life and death,

616
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:15,528
the judges will again have
a one-time special immunity.

617
00:26:15,562 --> 00:26:18,664
They can use it at any time
to give you a second life

618
00:26:18,699 --> 00:26:21,200
when you would have otherwise
been eliminated.

619
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:23,035
That's really cool,
because even

620
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,937
a great artist could just have
a really bad week.

621
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:28,641
All right,
this week's spotlight challenge

622
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:30,610
was to create
an over-the-top crime boss

623
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:33,312
inspired
by the colorful nickname

624
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:35,615
of a real-world gangster.

625
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,250
Let's take a look
at your creations.

626
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,742
Gwen and I are both
really, really pleased

627
00:27:02,776 --> 00:27:05,111
with the way that this makeup
has come out.

628
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:08,247
And we think he looks badass.

629
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,869
I'm very disappointed.

630
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,406
He looks muddy,
but my bomb looks really cool.

631
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:55,083
It is a little bit flat.

632
00:27:55,117 --> 00:27:57,118
I'm a little bit nervous
about the paint job

633
00:27:57,152 --> 00:28:00,588
reading from afar.

634
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:21,142
I'm really happy
with our character.

635
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:22,777
You don't get
more truck-like

636
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:26,080
than having exhaust pipes
coming out of your face.

637
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,514
I'm pretty embarrassed.

638
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,083
This isn't the character
that I wanted to see onstage,

639
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:52,221
but hopefully it's good enough.

640
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:11,707
I was a little nervous.

641
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:15,077
But I think from far away
he looks kind of cool.

642
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,997
I am psyched.

643
00:29:35,031 --> 00:29:37,266
He has a perfect profile.

644
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,301
Yes! It looks great.

645
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,711
All right, judges,
it's time to take

646
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,146
a closer look at our gangsters.

647
00:29:57,787 --> 00:30:01,457
The blend's pretty nice from
the headpiece into the cowl.

648
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:04,193
Can you open and close again?

649
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:06,829
- That's really good.
- Yeah. It really is.

650
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:13,902
The paint is on the muddy side.

651
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,238
It sure is.
It's all just one color.

652
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,374
Needs something to punch it up.

653
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:21,477
- Somehow, it got lost.
- What about the prop?

654
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,381
I see that
I must have been hit,

655
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:26,883
and I think Neville's been hit.

656
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:27,997
_

657
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:29,952
You know what's cool about it?
It looks like they're supposed

658
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,887
- to be keys on the typewriter.
- Yes.

659
00:30:31,921 --> 00:30:34,289
Thank you.

660
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:37,726
If you were watching
<i>Boardwalk Empire</i>

661
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:39,194
and Nucky went to see the wiz,

662
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,697
this is what it would look like
in that world.

663
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:43,412
_

664
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,867
I do like the painting.

665
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:47,069
Yes. Thank you.

666
00:30:50,073 --> 00:30:53,294
Wow. What did they
sculpt it with, a hammer?

667
00:30:53,328 --> 00:30:54,962
I'm very worried now.

668
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:57,031
The judges are noticing
the bad seams,

669
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,066
and that's going to put us
on the bottom.

670
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:04,438
Who made your favorite
over-the-top crime boss?

671
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:07,575
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

672
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,072
Wow. What did they
sculpt it with, a hammer?

673
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:13,440
The seam is pretty bad,

674
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:17,044
so I will be potentially
going home.

675
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:21,215
I really like the face,
but this is so literal.

676
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,183
It looks like a swimming hat.

677
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:24,885
Although nice job
on making the quills.

678
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,921
- They look like quills.
- Yeah.

679
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:32,993
The placement of the weight
around the torso,

680
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,595
this is really well done.

681
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,131
There's just an overall
nice continuity in everything.

682
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:39,166
That's hilarious.

683
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:47,474
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations,

684
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:49,243
so let's find out
what they thought.

685
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:51,712
Gwen, Drew,

686
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:54,915
Keaghlan, Damien,

687
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:57,284
congratulations, because
you guys are safe this week.

688
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,553
You can head back
to the makeup room.

689
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:05,626
All right, the rest of you
were the best

690
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,228
and the worst this week.

691
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,097
The judges would like to speak
with each of you

692
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:11,532
to learn more about your work.

693
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:13,567
Doc and Stella,
please step forward.

694
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,076
Explain the idea
behind your makeup.

695
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,178
We got
Leonard "Needles" Gianola,

696
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:27,047
so we incorporated quills
into the hair.

697
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:29,116
Also, he was an assassin,

698
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,951
so we incorporated poison
to the fingers.

699
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:34,822
Doc sculpted the face,
and I worked on the headpiece.

700
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:37,091
I also made
all the poison vials.

701
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:40,394
The techniques in the face
are very well thought out

702
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,730
and successful.

703
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:45,265
But I feel like just because the
word "needles" is in his name

704
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,768
spiking his head like that
is too literal

705
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:50,838
with that one aspect
of the challenge.

706
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,206
I think the face
is very promising,

707
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,075
and the hand is intriguing.

708
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,777
But the hair looks like a hat.

709
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:59,947
Overall, I really like
the character.

710
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,915
- It's a cool makeup.
- Thank you.

711
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,117
Thank you.

712
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:06,353
Doc and Stella,
please step back.

713
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,860
Sasha and Barry.

714
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,002
Tell us the idea
behind your character.

715
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:25,939
Our gangster is
Allie "Tick Tock" Tannenbaum.

716
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:29,376
He was a rat who ratted out
many, many gangsters.

717
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:31,045
And he's a mad bomber.

718
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,914
He's had a few of his bombs
go off in his face,

719
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:35,916
and his ear is
a little bit damaged.

720
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,019
I'm not particularly fond of--
of this makeup.

721
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,723
Who did what?

722
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:45,893
The concept was Barry's.
We both sculpted.

723
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,828
I did the hair.

724
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:50,998
Barry painted it,
and I made the bomb.

725
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:53,801
There are just certain things
that aren't up to snuff.

726
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,035
Like with the sculpt,

727
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,306
I wasn't certain
if it was a rabbit or a rat.

728
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:03,911
Just having the ear
drop an inch below

729
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,246
the other ear
does not connote damage.

730
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:09,349
And it is
such a muddy paint job.

731
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:11,718
My favorite part of this makeup
is the clock.

732
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:14,354
Yeah, it's the prop
that makes him who he is.

733
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,723
You want people to be able
to look at a character

734
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:18,192
and suss out the story.

735
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:21,829
Unfortunately, your makeup
doesn't really do that.

736
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,331
Sasha and Barry,
please step back.

737
00:34:31,406 --> 00:34:34,341
Cig and George, you're up.

738
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:43,383
Tell us about the concept.

739
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:46,120
Well, we got
Tony "Big Tuna" Accardo.

740
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:48,856
He was notorious
for using a baseball bat,

741
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,325
so we changed the baseball bat
for a fish.

742
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,860
And it says "Good Night" on it,

743
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:54,561
because that's the last thing
you see before...

744
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:56,330
- you're sleeping with the fishes.
- You're sleeping with the fishes.

745
00:34:57,932 --> 00:35:00,100
I blocked out the cowl,
and he blocked out the face.

746
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:02,369
I foam-fabricated
the fat suit,

747
00:35:02,403 --> 00:35:03,604
and George laid all the hair.

748
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:06,240
This is great thinking

749
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:07,808
and a really good execution.

750
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:09,276
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

751
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,346
The gills/rolls of flesh

752
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,115
and using the jowls
as a fish mouth

753
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,485
makes this
that much more impressive to me.

754
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,888
The other thing
that is really remarkable

755
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,422
is the body suit.

756
00:35:22,457 --> 00:35:23,690
It's all this guy.

757
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:25,492
The sense of weight that it has

758
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:27,594
carries right from the top
of the head,

759
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:29,163
right down to the tips
of the feet.

760
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:30,497
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

761
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:33,233
This is
absolutely the catch of the day.

762
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:34,935
Yes!

763
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,436
I love the hair.

764
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,205
He looks wonderful in profile.

765
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,707
You should be
really, really pleased.

766
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:42,676
- Thank you.
- Thank you guys so much.

767
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,611
Cig and George,
please step back.

768
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:47,314
Good work, big boy.

769
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:51,697
Good job.
You guys rocked it.

770
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:52,665
Thanks.

771
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:56,002
Dina and Jason.

772
00:35:59,706 --> 00:36:02,074
Would you tell us
about your guy here?

773
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:04,176
This is
John "Peanuts" Tronolone.

774
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:07,280
He ran a bunch of gambling
and bookmaking operations,

775
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:08,814
and he has money,
poker chips, jewels, and stuff

776
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,116
up in his peanut cap.

777
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,920
I sculpted the face.
Jason blocked out the cowl.

778
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:15,187
I did some detailing on that.

779
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:16,822
I feel like
there's a disconnect

780
00:36:16,857 --> 00:36:18,858
between the cowl and the face.

781
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:24,497
And it also falls down
as far as the paint goes.

782
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:27,199
The peanut part
is very boldly painted,

783
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:29,268
while there's very little
painting on the face.

784
00:36:29,303 --> 00:36:33,072
If you bring one skin tone
against another,

785
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:35,942
it should look like
the skin tones belong together.

786
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,644
But the hands are just
the model's own hands.

787
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:41,714
This is just a peanut
on a guy's head.

788
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:43,616
It certainly doesn't have
a<i> Dick Tracy</i> feel,

789
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,254
and the face does not flow
into that cowl at all.

790
00:36:50,023 --> 00:36:52,458
Dina and Jason,
if you'd please step back.

791
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:01,367
Rachael and Vince.

792
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,342
Let's start with concept

793
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:12,044
and how each of you participated
in the creation of this makeup.

794
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,913
So our gangster is named

795
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,848
Charles "The Typewriter"
Nicoletti.

796
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:18,884
He bludgeons his enemies
with brass knuckles.

797
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:22,521
In addition, he memorializes
his victims in his skin.

798
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,057
I blocked out the cowl
while Vince sculpted the face.

799
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:28,027
Conceptually,
this is a great idea.

800
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:31,831
Love what you guys did
with the typewriter aspect

801
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:33,165
of your character.

802
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,034
- Thanks.
- With a tighter paint job

803
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:37,069
and a little tweak
to the sculpture,

804
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:39,772
this could have been
an absolutely stellar makeup.

805
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:41,540
Thank you.

806
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:44,076
I probably would have
punched the paint job up more.

807
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:46,445
Rings under the eyes,
some beard shadowing.

808
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,048
The face really
is begging for that.

809
00:37:49,082 --> 00:37:51,217
But it cuts a striking figure,

810
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:53,252
and I think that
you're really successful there.

811
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:56,155
Rachael and Vince,
if you'd please step back.

812
00:37:56,189 --> 00:38:00,353
- Thank you, guys.
- Thanks.

813
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:02,756
All right, guys.

814
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,291
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

815
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,792
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

816
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,228
while they make
their decisions.

817
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:16,736
All right, judges, so let's talk
about tonight's makeups.

818
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:18,282
Why don't we start with
Doc and Stella?

819
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:21,966
The treatment of the face
felt like it was right direction,

820
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:23,276
right world.

821
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:25,011
- It's a strong character.
- It is.

822
00:38:25,046 --> 00:38:26,580
I think they had a nice idea.

823
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:30,317
All right, let's move on
to George and Cig.

824
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:32,919
The distribution of weight
on this thing...

825
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,000
***

826
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,524
that the suit wouldn't collapse
in the wrong areas.

827
00:38:37,558 --> 00:38:39,893
What was wonderful is that
the weight in the makeup

828
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:41,861
and the face carried through.

829
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:44,598
And there were
some lovely little details.

830
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:47,801
I mean, there's dribble
hanging there perfectly.

831
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:50,804
All right, judges, let's
move on to Rachael and Vince.

832
00:38:50,838 --> 00:38:52,339
Rock-solid idea.

833
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,900
Very, really, really wise.

834
00:38:53,908 --> 00:38:56,610
And the execution
of the type in the head,

835
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:58,712
that was all
really, really good.

836
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,113
I love this idea.

837
00:39:00,147 --> 00:39:02,048
I love taking the typewriter

838
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:04,584
and just going straight
into the makeup itself.

839
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,254
All right, judges, let's
move on to Barry and Sasha.

840
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,490
I really dislike this one,

841
00:39:10,524 --> 00:39:12,726
and it doesn't satisfy
the challenge.

842
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,062
It was a poor idea
picked up and run with.

843
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:17,264
It never would have
occurred to me

844
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:18,498
that a bomb went off
in his face.

845
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:19,699
- I didn't get that at all.
- Nor I.

846
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,034
I was serious when I said

847
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:25,305
that the prop was the most
successful part of this,

848
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:26,806
because it is
the only thing that,

849
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:29,542
when you look at the character,
says, "Tick Tock."

850
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:32,879
All right, let's move on
to Dina and Jason.

851
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:36,216
I just think there's so many
other intellectual ways

852
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,818
to have approached
the peanut aspect

853
00:39:38,853 --> 00:39:43,623
other than sculpting a planters
peanut guy on top of his head

854
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:45,558
and then putting pearls
and chips in it.

855
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:48,194
The problem with it
is that it's too on the nose.

856
00:39:48,229 --> 00:39:50,535
- It's not clever.
- And you look at the painting.

857
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:54,377
They had one solid color,
with a bit of dark thrown into it.

858
00:39:54,635 --> 00:39:56,803
All right, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

859
00:39:56,837 --> 00:39:59,839
- We have.
- Let's bring them back out.

860
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:10,192
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

861
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:12,461
Actually, there's one makeup

862
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:14,697
that is vastly superior
to the rest.

863
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:22,263
Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

864
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,065
Actually, there's one makeup

865
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:26,567
that is vastly superior
to the rest.

866
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:32,640
George and Cig's Big Tuna.

867
00:40:32,674 --> 00:40:34,442
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

868
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,111
Your clever ideas,
world-class teamwork

869
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:41,449
and great technique made for
a stunningly successful makeup.

870
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,516
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

871
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:44,418
Cig and George, well done.

872
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:46,887
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

873
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,089
Glenn?

874
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:50,191
Without the construction
of that fat suit,

875
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:53,494
the makeup would not have been
as successful on the whole.

876
00:40:53,528 --> 00:40:55,229
So, Cig, you are our winner.

877
00:40:56,431 --> 00:40:57,305
Thank you.

878
00:40:57,306 --> 00:40:59,654
_

879
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:00,855
_

880
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:02,970
It feels really good to win.
It's just so exciting.

881
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,672
Cig, congratulations.

882
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:09,110
You, George, Doc, Stella,
Rachael and Vince,

883
00:41:09,144 --> 00:41:11,812
you're all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

884
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:19,587
Unfortunately, that does mean

885
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:21,188
the rest of you are
on the bottom this week.

886
00:41:21,223 --> 00:41:24,058
And one of you
will be eliminated.

887
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:26,460
Please step forward.

888
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:35,903
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

889
00:41:35,937 --> 00:41:37,371
Barry and Sasha,

890
00:41:37,406 --> 00:41:40,307
we appreciate that you tried
to be clever with your concept,

891
00:41:40,342 --> 00:41:43,444
but your character
just didn't capture the essence

892
00:41:43,478 --> 00:41:45,479
of your gangster's name.

893
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:47,014
Dina and Jason,

894
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:50,128
while we liked some things
about the face,

895
00:41:50,129 --> 00:41:53,750
your uninspired concept
sabotaged the makeup.

896
00:41:53,773 --> 00:41:55,774
So who is going home tonight?

897
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:58,577
The person going home
tonight is...

898
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:03,148
Barry.

899
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:06,518
The character was flawed
in many ways,

900
00:42:06,552 --> 00:42:07,986
and it seemed to us

901
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:10,355
that you were the driving force
behind it.

902
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,556
Barry, I'm so sorry,

903
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:14,159
but that does mean
you have been eliminated.

904
00:42:14,193 --> 00:42:17,295
Dina, Jason, and Sasha,

905
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,331
you're safe and can head back
to the makeup room.

906
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:23,235
No worries.

907
00:42:25,505 --> 00:42:28,707
I feel certain there is
a future for you in makeup,

908
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:30,142
and we wish you well.

909
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:31,309
Thank you so much.

910
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:33,111
Barry, thank you
for being here with us.

911
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:34,980
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

912
00:42:35,014 --> 00:42:37,282
- and pack up your kit.
- Thanks, guys.

913
00:42:37,316 --> 00:42:39,251
Worked so hard to get here,

914
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:41,553
and just to go home so soon,
it's such a bummer.

915
00:42:45,091 --> 00:42:47,926
- No, man!
- Aww!

916
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,528
I don't think
that this one challenge

917
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:51,229
represents me as an artist.

918
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:52,564
This is definitely not
the end of the line for me.

919
00:42:52,598 --> 00:42:55,834
I'll never be done
making creatures.

920
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:56,965
It's what I do.
