1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:02,133
It is amazing.

2
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:05,737
You've come up with something
that is triumphant.

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,772
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:07,806 --> 00:00:10,244
Dina's graceful goddess
wowed the judges...

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:10,982
Thank you.

6
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:13,411
...and Sasha was sent home.

7
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,880
Now only five artists remain,

8
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,783
and tonight,
Mother Nature meets fantasy

9
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:19,784
in an epic challenge...

10
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,853
Sounds easy, right?

11
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:22,887
No.

12
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:27,258
And for some,
the results are disastrous.

13
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,293
Do you really need that?

14
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,862
There's no room for error.

15
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:31,863
Hmm.

16
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:33,131
What happened?

17
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:34,632
I'm feeling really frustrated.

18
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,467
This is
a very beautiful makeup.

19
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:38,336
It just doesn't
get there for me.

20
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,405
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,173
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

22
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,842
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,779
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,681
and $100,000.

25
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:54,319
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

26
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:28,120
Sync and corrections by n17t01

27
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:30,755
- Good morning.
- How's it going?

28
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:33,491
All right.
I was in the bottom again.

29
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,159
Yay!

30
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,327
Doesn't that feel so good?

31
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,362
No.

32
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,430
Being in the bottom last time

33
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:40,898
was kind of a bummer.

34
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,834
I thought I did a really
good job with the makeup,

35
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:45,903
but at least I'm still here,
so that's all that counts.

36
00:01:45,938 --> 00:01:47,071
Final five.

37
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,173
Top five is the way
I like to see it.

38
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,942
- Yeah, that's even better.
- Yes.

39
00:01:50,976 --> 00:01:53,277
The next challenge,
I really have to just bring

40
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,746
everything I've got.

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,882
It would be awesome
if we made it to the finale.

42
00:01:57,916 --> 00:01:59,150
That would be amazing.

43
00:01:59,184 --> 00:02:02,120
I made it to the final five,
which feels incredible.

44
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:05,256
I didn't think I would
make it this far.

45
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,125
The person who got me
into makeup art

46
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,028
is Anthony Kosar,
the season four champion.

47
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:14,198
I should probably thank Anthony
for pushing me to come here.

48
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,601
I would be proud to go
to the finale with you, Dina.

49
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,004
Same here.

50
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,251
Oh, my God.

51
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:34,819
Holy fuck.

52
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,187
This looks terrible.

53
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:38,289
We arrive at Universal Studios,

54
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:42,160
and there's a plane torn
in three parts,

55
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,262
smoke blowing
all over the place,

56
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:45,630
destroyed houses.

57
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:48,766
I'm thinking
it's postapocalyptic.

58
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,301
I have no idea what
this challenge is gonna be.

59
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,373
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

60
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,708
Welcome to
the Universal Studios back lot.

61
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:02,480
This plane is an actual 747,
and the set around us

62
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:05,015
was built for Steven Spielberg's
<i>War Of The Worlds.</i>

63
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,851
- Awesome.
- That's amazing.

64
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,253
I'll tell you
why we're here in a bit,

65
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:12,690
but first, let's talk about
your next spotlight challenge.

66
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:16,260
Let me transport you
to the fantastical world

67
00:03:16,294 --> 00:03:18,763
of a playful,
mischievous creature

68
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:20,664
that has appeared
in audience favorites

69
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,700
like<i> Peter Pan, Harry Potter,</i>

70
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:25,269
and<i> True Blood.</i>

71
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:26,270
Fairies.

72
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:31,709
Fairies?

73
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,978
Uh, okay.

74
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:36,547
Everything I make is oozy
and snotty and gross,

75
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:40,151
so my excitement level
definitely crashed.

76
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:42,953
Some believe that fairies
are beautiful spirits

77
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:45,055
associated
with the four major elements.

78
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,592
Fire, water, earth, and air.

79
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:50,461
So your spotlight challenge
is to create

80
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:53,130
your own beautiful
elemental fairy.

81
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:54,832
Nice.

82
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:55,966
Sounds pretty easy, right?

83
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,067
No.

84
00:03:57,102 --> 00:03:58,335
Yeah, well, of course it's not.

85
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,271
In this case,
Mother Nature has gone awry,

86
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,039
unleashing her elemental power

87
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:04,408
and destroying everything
in her path.

88
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:06,477
Spread
throughout this plane wreck

89
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:07,912
are five monitors,

90
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:10,781
each one featuring
a disaster scenario

91
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:14,251
caused by Mother Nature's
unparalleled power.

92
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:15,686
You'll each choose one of them

93
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,490
and create a beautiful fairy
born from its destruction.

94
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:21,058
All right.

95
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:23,761
I've never made
anything pretty before,

96
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:27,364
and to incorporate disaster
into a pretty makeup,

97
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,099
that scares the hell out of me.

98
00:04:29,134 --> 00:04:30,501
On my go,

99
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,269
I want you to run
into the wreck

100
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,472
and choose
one of the disasters.

101
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,240
Then you can work
on your sketches

102
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,741
before heading back to the lab
to get started.

103
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,076
I'll come by later on
with my dad

104
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,011
to check in
and see how you're doing.

105
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:42,480
All right, good luck.

106
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,948
Ready,

107
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:45,082
set,

108
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,784
go!

109
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,186
Aah!

110
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:50,387
What's that one?

111
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,089
It's avalanche.

112
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:53,624
Ooh.

113
00:04:57,829 --> 00:04:59,363
Yeah.

114
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,433
Wildfire.

115
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:09,240
I pick earthquake
for my natural disaster.

116
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,876
So I decide she lives
under the crust of the Earth,

117
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,011
and she comes out
whenever there's an earthquake

118
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:16,981
to fix all the damage
that the earthquake has caused.

119
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:19,016
I'm gonna build up
one of the model's shoulders

120
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,417
and have it all cracked off,

121
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,086
so she can sort of lift it
a little,

122
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,021
and it'll look like
a fault line.

123
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:27,391
I might paint her
in, like, browns and tans

124
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:31,362
and then bright red,
glowing lava in the cracks,

125
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:34,098
but, honestly, this is so far
out of my realm,

126
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:36,734
I'm just guessing
at this point.

127
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:41,305
I'm making a wildfire fairy.

128
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:45,009
Her job is to spread fire
and then inspire regrowth.

129
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,677
The top part of her's on fire,

130
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:50,781
but the bottom is leaves
and grass and flowers.

131
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:54,151
I'm not sure
how I'm going to achieve this,

132
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:55,819
but the only thing
I can think of

133
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:58,522
is to sculpt flames on her
somehow.

134
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:05,229
My natural disaster is flood,

135
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:09,400
and my concept is that the flood
washed away the land,

136
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,702
and this new fairy
was born from it.

137
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,637
She's bringing elements
from the flooded land

138
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:14,838
back to life.

139
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,774
Floodwater is brown,

140
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:19,677
but I don't want to just cover
her head to toe in mud.

141
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:22,279
I also want to bring some greens
and blues into it

142
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:26,450
to brighten it up a bit.

143
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:32,723
My beautiful fairy
uses her magic

144
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:34,425
to clean up the oil spill.

145
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,727
She is doused with oil.

146
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:39,630
She's got rocky, crystalline
formations on her body

147
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,332
to represent the Earth.

148
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:44,234
It's gonna look like
a high-fashion runway piece.

149
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:51,709
My concept is, this fairy
got caught up in an avalanche.

150
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,010
She almost froze to death,

151
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:54,445
but her fairy magic
kept her alive,

152
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,246
and now she's
like an ice fairy.

153
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:59,016
I have never done
a beauty makeup,

154
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,918
so that's got me worried.

155
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,786
But then I start thinking
of this

156
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,022
more as, like,
a beautiful piece of art,

157
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,557
rather than a beautiful makeup,

158
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:07,958
and that's kind of helping me.

159
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm drawing these big ice wings

160
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,663
and ice spires coming
off her shoulders and her head,

161
00:07:12,697 --> 00:07:16,900
and I think it looks
pretty cool.

162
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:21,572
Hey, everyone,
let's go back to the lab!

163
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:22,573
What'd everybody get?

164
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,541
- Earthquake.
- Avalanche.

165
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:25,876
- Wildfire.
- Flood.

166
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,945
Awesome.

167
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,385
We get back to the lab,
and we have six hours.

168
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,754
We pick our models,

169
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:38,422
and the first thing
I start working on

170
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,091
is the face sculpt.

171
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,992
I need to focus on the nose,
the chin,

172
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:44,028
and at the same time,
I start working

173
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,963
on my chest and shoulder piece.

174
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,531
I'm a little worried
about this design.

175
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:50,134
I don't know
if what I want it to look like

176
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,603
is beautiful.

177
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,873
I get right to work
on the cowl,

178
00:07:55,907 --> 00:07:57,942
and I'm drawing inspiration
from, like, glaciers

179
00:07:57,976 --> 00:07:59,210
and how they form,

180
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,379
and it's very hard edges
and jagged lines,

181
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,315
so I'm trying to sculpt
this cowl and shoulder piece

182
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:07,218
that resembles ice spires
growing out of someone's body.

183
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,366
Hey, guys, we're here
to check in on you.

184
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,467
Hi there.

185
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,102
All right, so tell us
about your fairy.

186
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,837
Okay, so my fairy rises

187
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,439
through an oil spill
in the ocean.

188
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,941
So she's going to be
very sandy and rocky,

189
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:32,643
and these rocky elements
enhance her brow

190
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:33,978
and her cheekbones.

191
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,347
You might even be able
to extend the nose

192
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:37,882
just a little bit more

193
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,550
to give a fairy look to it.

194
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,352
Yeah, I thought about giving
her slight upturn at the end.

195
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:42,420
- That's good too.
- Yeah.

196
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:43,788
- Very good.
- All right.

197
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,223
I heard you guys
have been taking selfies.

198
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:47,291
- Oh, yeah.
- We need to take one.

199
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:48,759
I think--
Is this your first selfie?

200
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,060
I think so.

201
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,730
This is my dad's
first selfie, everybody.

202
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,165
Ready?

203
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,966
Nice.
Thanks, guys.

204
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,501
First one, nice, dad.
You did it.

205
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,336
Good job.
It was a good one.

206
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,172
She's kind of like
an ice fairy.

207
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,173
Okay, that's what
this is gonna be then.

208
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,441
This is ice, all right.

209
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,009
What's your thought
with the makeup now?

210
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,677
Well, I've never done
a beauty makeup before.

211
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:07,812
You know, the thing is, listen,

212
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,447
you know how to shade
and whatever.

213
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,714
I did a whole beauty makeup
with an airbrush one time,

214
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:11,749
and you can do that.

215
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,584
Just remember to keep
everything soft,

216
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:17,054
- and you'll be fine.
- Okay.

217
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,356
I want to do, like,
very delicate flames

218
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:20,458
around the face.

219
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:22,193
And then the cowl
is gonna be like

220
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,861
wind is blowing
the flame backwards.

221
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,729
Great. You know,
what's gonna help to make it

222
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:26,931
is your painting.

223
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:29,533
I wouldn't be concerned
so much with black,

224
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,169
because this is supposed
to be a really beautiful makeup,

225
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,971
and getting too much black
into it

226
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:36,974
- would be a problem.
- Okay.

227
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,244
I'm thinking of all the things

228
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,447
that you would find
in, like, a flooded river area.

229
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,849
I know this is probably crazy.

230
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:48,185
I was thinking about covering
her face in sand.

231
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,487
But it has to be very subtle.

232
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,422
They actually have
in the supplies here

233
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:52,857
- gelatin crystals.
- In the back room.

234
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,226
In the back room
that you could use for that.

235
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,227
- Okay.
- Good.

236
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,394
- Excellent.
- Cool.

237
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,464
Did you get it?

238
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,399
I got earthquake.

239
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,068
She is all cracked up.

240
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:06,770
This is gonna be a chest piece
over her heart.

241
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:07,771
Now, with the face here,

242
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,106
it's so thin in areas,

243
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,810
I don't know if foam latex
would go that thin.

244
00:10:12,844 --> 00:10:13,978
Okay.

245
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:15,579
You might need to do that
in silicone

246
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,081
if you're gonna go
with the whole face like that.

247
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:18,282
And then in here,
you're gonna paint...

248
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,918
Yeah, this is
all gonna be reds and yellows

249
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,786
to make it look
like the Earth blood,

250
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,288
the magma, and stuff like that.

251
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:25,656
Do you really need that?

252
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,425
It's going to look like
somebody sliced your fairy open.

253
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,127
Yeah, like, bloody.

254
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,463
Hearing Mr. Westmore tell me
that there are things

255
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:35,199
that won't work with my makeup
stresses me out.

256
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,868
Your whole fairy
has to be attractive.

257
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,770
We're down to the final five,

258
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:41,672
and there's no room for error.

259
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:43,173
I can't make a mistake,

260
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,677
or I'm gonna go home.

261
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,312
Coming up...

262
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,548
I'm gonna have to come up
with another strategy.

263
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,016
I'm feeling really frustrated.

264
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,317
Aw, come on!

265
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:54,852
It's not very inventive.

266
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:56,604
It's absolutely stunning.

267
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:06,186
This is all gonna be reds
and yellows.

268
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:08,255
Your whole fairy
has to be attractive.

269
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,858
It's day one of
our elemental fairy challenge,

270
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:12,826
and Mr. Westmore's telling me

271
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,895
there are things that won't work
with my makeup,

272
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,530
and that's very stressful.

273
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:18,265
- It's going to look like--
- Gore?

274
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,299
- Gore, muscle.
- Horror, yeah.

275
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,300
It could be blood or something.

276
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:21,435
- Gotcha.
- Yeah.

277
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:22,436
Do you think
it would be a better idea

278
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,338
to just stick
with Earth colors?

279
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:25,339
I think so.

280
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:26,707
I need his advice.

281
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:28,375
I'm really stuck at this point.

282
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:29,510
All right, so to recap,

283
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:33,480
we got nose, chin, nix the red.

284
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,282
And also, I think your cheeks

285
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:36,817
might be able to use
a little bit more...

286
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,752
- The-- the--
- Yeah, yeah.

287
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:41,622
- Can I get a picture of that?
- Yeah.

288
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:44,158
- Oh, you're beautiful.
- Ah.

289
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:46,894
Everybody's got a great
direction in this challenge.

290
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:47,961
Keep it up.

291
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:48,962
- Thank you, guys.
- Good job, guys.

292
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:49,963
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

293
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:52,399
- Thank you.
- Bye.

294
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:53,667
So after the walk-through,

295
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:56,870
I completely scrap
the whole magma concept.

296
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:59,473
And now she's gonna be
mossy and green

297
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:02,976
in all the cracks to show
rebirth and regrowth.

298
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,445
Plus, she's gonna have
a happy Mr. Westmore smile.

299
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,948
He does have
some good apple cheeks, right?

300
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:10,350
He actually invented
apple cheeks.

301
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:16,523
Today, I have to figure out
how I'm gonna create

302
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:18,759
this oily look
for the body make-up.

303
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:21,495
So I decide
to do some experimenting.

304
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,232
I start by mixing
powdered gelatin, glycerin,

305
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,701
sorbitol,
and zinc oxide powder.

306
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,536
I think this is working
really well.

307
00:12:29,571 --> 00:12:32,739
It's really looking
like crude oil.

308
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:34,508
I get it all melted up
in the microwave

309
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:36,343
and start painting it
on my mannequin

310
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:40,380
and making these really cool
drips and runs and smears.

311
00:12:40,381 --> 00:12:42,510
_

312
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:44,518
- Uh-huh.
- Smart.

313
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:50,490
After I finish sculpting
the cowl for my flood fairy,

314
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,893
I start working
on some blender pieces.

315
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:54,761
I'm trying to think
of things that

316
00:12:54,796 --> 00:12:56,363
would be mixed up
in that water--

317
00:12:56,397 --> 00:12:59,666
sand and pebbles
and twigs and bark.

318
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:01,602
I'm trying to incorporate
all of those things

319
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,238
into my makeup.

320
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,241
So I get my face
to a good place,

321
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,276
and now I'm ready to mold.

322
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:14,348
I'm gonna be casting my face
out of silicone,

323
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,917
and silicone's kind of finicky,

324
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:18,252
so I need to make sure

325
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,721
that I make
the best mold possible.

326
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:22,990
The flashing overflow area
that I build up

327
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:24,791
has to be perfectly smooth

328
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:26,793
so that when the mold
is actually opened,

329
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:28,295
it all comes out nicely

330
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,231
rather than catching
on textured areas and ripping.

331
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,237
I'm ready to mold the face,

332
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:40,474
and I know that molding this
will be difficult

333
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:43,143
because of all of the shapes
in the flames,

334
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:46,113
but I figure
if I'm really careful,

335
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,181
it should look pretty good.

336
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:55,822
Hmm.

337
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:59,459
I may need to reengineer this.

338
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:00,794
Halfway through the application

339
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:02,396
of the gelatin
on this mannequin,

340
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,464
I realize that
this is gonna become a mess.

341
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:08,869
Hey, guys, that's time.

342
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:10,537
There's gonna
be logistical problems

343
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:13,573
with my model living
in this makeup for a few hours,

344
00:14:13,608 --> 00:14:16,176
like going to the bathroom,
being comfortable,

345
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,311
being able to sit.

346
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:18,845
This really sucks,

347
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,781
because now I'm gonna have to

348
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:23,050
come up with another strategy.

349
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:32,893
Yes!

350
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:36,964
Today's the second day
of our fairy challenge,

351
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:38,565
and we have 9 1/2 hours.

352
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,767
Yeah, that broke.

353
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:43,704
None of the flames
that I sculpted on the face

354
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:45,739
filled with foam,

355
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:48,141
so now I have to bake it
again overnight.

356
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:51,945
I don't even know
how to rescue that.

357
00:14:57,385 --> 00:14:58,919
I'm starting
to like this character

358
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:01,922
a lot more than I thought,
being a fairy challenge.

359
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,790
And I've always wanted to do
and ice makeup,

360
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:06,426
so it's looking pretty cool.

361
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:08,161
Since I need to fabricate wings,

362
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,596
I don't want to spend
too much time

363
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,099
finishing out the details
on either sculpt.

364
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,735
I'm gonna do these wings that
are big and spire-y and all.

365
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,169
Kind of heat-form them
a little bit,

366
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:17,270
so it looks like ice

367
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:18,905
and probably airbrush
on top of them.

368
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,241
Beautiful.

369
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:31,118
I realize that I can't work
on the friggin' bodysuit again

370
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:32,586
until application day,

371
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,087
because I have to have wings,

372
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:36,957
otherwise, my makeup's
not gonna read as a fairy.

373
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:39,793
So I find a sheer fabric,

374
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,828
and it looks
like dragonfly's wings,

375
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,497
which is exactly what I want,

376
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:46,533
and I see
these peacock feathers,

377
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:49,469
and I attach them to
this sheer, iridescent fabric,

378
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:52,105
and they look beautiful.

379
00:15:56,978 --> 00:16:00,814
The issues with the face
sculpt and mold means I know

380
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,717
I'm gonna have even bigger
issues with the cowl sculpt.

381
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:05,867
_

382
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,155
I'm making bigger flames,

383
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:10,223
much bigger than the ones
that are on the face,

384
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:12,325
because I have to match
the design,

385
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,995
and I don't have time
to change the whole concept.

386
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:17,027
_

387
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:19,699
So I cross my fingers,
and I hope for the best.

388
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:25,539
One thing I do know
about fairies

389
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,074
is that they're
supposed to have wings,

390
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,775
so I find foam noodle.

391
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,111
I take a heat gun,

392
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:32,946
and I scrunch it up
with my hands,

393
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,714
so it looks like bark,

394
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,883
and then I find
these giant banana leaves.

395
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,088
So I'm just gonna glue
those all together

396
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:43,830
and hope it doesn't
look like shit.

397
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:52,999
I really have to get
this mold open

398
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,367
and cleaned out today.

399
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:57,471
Otherwise, I'm going to have
to run in poly foam

400
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:58,772
on application day,

401
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:01,241
and I've never run a cowl
in poly foam before,

402
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,210
so the idea terrifies me.

403
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:05,078
Don't break.

404
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:07,414
There's all this clay stuck
in all of the flame points,

405
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:10,417
and I'm freaking out,
'cause I can't get the clay out.

406
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,252
And that's exactly
one of the things

407
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:13,753
I was worried about
with this mold.

408
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:15,322
Do you need another hand?
Are you good?

409
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:16,423
I'm just
gonna power-wash it.

410
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:17,757
Okay.

411
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,960
I've got to go outside
and spray it with the hose,

412
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:21,194
which I don't want to do,

413
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:23,797
because I'm going to end up
with a wet mold,

414
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:25,899
and I could get all sorts
of air pockets.

415
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:29,569
Aw, come on!

416
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:33,874
There's just, like,
two that won't come out.

417
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:36,843
I don't know if I'm gonna
pull this together.

418
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,145
Aw, come on!

419
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,414
It's day two in the lab,

420
00:17:44,449 --> 00:17:45,515
and I'm having
a really hard time

421
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,950
cleaning out my mold.

422
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:47,984
That won't come out.

423
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,586
I can't get the clay out.

424
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,121
I've got to spray it
with the hose,

425
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,222
which I don't want to do,

426
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:55,926
because I am going to have
a wet mold.

427
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,861
Typically what you'd want to do

428
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,529
is get all of the moisture
out of the mold

429
00:17:59,564 --> 00:18:02,666
before you would
ever put foam in it.

430
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:06,103
But I only have
about 20 minutes left,

431
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,597
so I don't have time for that.

432
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:11,608
So now I'm worried.

433
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:14,111
There's a chance that I could
get all sorts of air pockets,

434
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,378
and I'm really nervous

435
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,714
about what it's gonna
look like tomorrow.

436
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:25,889
I have a little more time left
in the day,

437
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:28,792
so I decide
to start experimenting.

438
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,364
I'm trying to figure out
the best way to make mud.

439
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:35,398
It has to be wet.

440
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,534
I can't just cover her in dirt,

441
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:40,704
so I actually find
some chocolate syrup in the lab.

442
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:43,406
I mix some cornstarch
into it and heat it up,

443
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,675
and it turns it
into, like, a jelly.

444
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,478
In special effects, you don't
really think of using food,

445
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:51,081
but I think it's gonna work
really well for this actually.

446
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,789
Look at this bitch now.

447
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:01,257
Oh, yeah!

448
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,359
That's time.

449
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,800
I'm so done with today.

450
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:08,164
So it's the end of day two.

451
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:10,367
I have everything
ready to go for application.

452
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:11,935
I have a lot to do,

453
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:14,037
but I'm really happy
with it so far.

454
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,740
Hopefully, when I get it
all put together tomorrow,

455
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:18,808
she'll be a beautiful fairy.

456
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,657
It's application day.

457
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,226
We have four hours in the lab

458
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,261
and one hour in last looks.

459
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:39,729
Oh, shit.

460
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:41,664
What happened?

461
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:44,200
The first thing I see
is my cowl.

462
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:46,936
Are you kidding me?

463
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:48,304
It is destroyed.

464
00:19:48,339 --> 00:19:51,074
Well, I'm going home.

465
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,210
All of the flame points
have broken off.

466
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:55,311
Oh, no!

467
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,980
They all ripped off.

468
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:59,182
It's okay.
You have time to fix it.

469
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,750
I have to patch it,

470
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,886
and there's a lot to patch.

471
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,022
At least the face
came out beautiful

472
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:09,025
the second time, but
if I don't get this cowl fixed,

473
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,227
then what do I have,
flames on a face?

474
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:12,295
That's not very interesting.

475
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,866
My foam looks pretty great.

476
00:20:16,901 --> 00:20:19,169
There's a couple rips
in the sides of the face,

477
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:20,437
but I can make it work.

478
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:21,604
Everything else looks good.

479
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,274
Now I just have
to get it all applied.

480
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,015
Hi! How are you?

481
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,316
How are you doing?

482
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,784
- Good to see you again.
- How are you?

483
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,052
- Great. How are you?
- I'm good.

484
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:38,488
I'm having
some technical difficulties.

485
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:41,024
I've never done
anything pretty before.

486
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,426
I'm happy that I listened
to Mr. Westmore's advice.

487
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,662
The silicone piece
looks pretty cool,

488
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:47,697
but I'm still
not feeling great.

489
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:49,132
This challenge, it's just--

490
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,834
It's not me.

491
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,937
I mean, everything looks
kind of like fairy parts,

492
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:56,639
but I don't even know what
that's supposed to look like.

493
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,044
Whoo.

494
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:10,386
I decided to put the oil
on a dress

495
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:12,555
instead of directly
on the body.

496
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,392
I just start carefully creating
the drips and runs

497
00:21:16,427 --> 00:21:19,896
to create
this oil spill couture, hmm?

498
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,631
I really think
this new approach

499
00:21:21,665 --> 00:21:23,166
will make it a lot easier

500
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,868
for my model
to wear this makeup.

501
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,536
- I like her.
- I love it.

502
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:31,841
There we go.

503
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:33,643
The paint job
on this application

504
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:34,911
is really important.

505
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:36,312
I am painting her
from head to toe,

506
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:38,615
and she's gonna be
covered in mud,

507
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:40,550
so I really need
to bring those colors

508
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,851
into my makeup.

509
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:44,220
If I don't do
a beautiful paint job,

510
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,589
she's not gonna be
a beautiful fairy.

511
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:53,863
Oil spills have
this rainbowlike effect

512
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:55,064
on the surface,

513
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:58,501
so I'm gonna start
with my flat white base,

514
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:02,171
and then I'm going over that
with pinks and greens and blues,

515
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,040
and then I go
over the whole thing

516
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,842
with Kryolan Aquacolor
and a sponge

517
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,211
to give it this really
beautiful, iridescent sheen.

518
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,480
Looks really pretty,
and it's perfect.

519
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,554
One hour, guys!

520
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,389
Shit, I just started painting.

521
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:20,657
Awesome.

522
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:22,091
Everyone else seems to be

523
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,160
almost done
with their paint job,

524
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:25,428
and I've just started,

525
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:28,431
so I know I'm in a bad spot.

526
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:35,672
On the head, I'm actually using

527
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:38,374
the chocolate
sort of gelatin that I made,

528
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:40,209
because I know
it'll set up well.

529
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:42,412
I'm actually having a lot of fun
with this challenge.

530
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:46,349
And she definitely looks
like she rose up from a flood,

531
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:48,384
so I'm feeling pretty good.

532
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,553
15 minutes, guys!

533
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:58,861
Oh, shit!

534
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,730
It's almost the end of the day.

535
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:02,999
I notice that there's
a really weird wrinkle

536
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:05,301
at the corner of her mouth.

537
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:07,036
That's time, guys!

538
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:10,340
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do

539
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:12,008
with this giant wrinkle.

540
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:15,011
Hopefully, I'll figure out
some way to fix it.

541
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:18,247
Because I've been in the bottom
the two challenges before this,

542
00:23:18,282 --> 00:23:20,483
if I don't do a perfect makeup,

543
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:23,319
I could be going home.

544
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:26,556
Coming up...

545
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,093
The edge on the face
is starting to crack.

546
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:32,061
I think
she's really delightful.

547
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,946
It just doesn't get there
for me.

548
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:45,158
- Oh, getting wobbly. Getting wobbly.
- Hi, honey.

549
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:46,192
All right.

550
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,560
I start painting immediately.

551
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:49,295
I think if I can get it
painted well,

552
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,697
I won't be so embarrassed

553
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:53,833
the foam came out so horribly.

554
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:58,438
I'm gonna add some eyelashes,

555
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:00,039
touch up her beauty makeup
a little more.

556
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:01,174
Awesome.

557
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,276
She looks exactly
like I envisioned it,

558
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,677
so that's good.

559
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,480
As I'm airbrushing white
around her eyes,

560
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,082
some of the white
stays on the eyelashes,

561
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,516
and it looks
like frosted eyelashes.

562
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:11,751
Cool!

563
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,853
I'm unintentionally
doing beauty makeup.

564
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:16,189
Yeah.

565
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:20,460
Time is flying,
and I have to figure out

566
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:21,894
what I'm gonna do
with that wrinkle

567
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,096
at the corner of her mouth.

568
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,464
Make it look like her face
is cracked.

569
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:25,632
Not a bad idea.

570
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,700
Megan, being
the awesome model that she is,

571
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,969
says, "Well, why don't you
make it another crack?"

572
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:32,271
It looks like a crack,
so I paint it like a crack.

573
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,440
It's not ideal,
but it's way better

574
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,075
than having a wrinkle there.

575
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,579
I'm realizing the edge
on the face

576
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:42,615
is starting to crack
a little bit.

577
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,584
Placing the edge there
to begin with

578
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:46,019
was a stupid, stupid choice,

579
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:48,621
but I'm hoping
that the overall beauty

580
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:51,624
of my makeup will overpower
that flaw.

581
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:52,625
Ten more minutes.

582
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:07,573
It's time, guys!

583
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,108
Cool.

584
00:25:09,143 --> 00:25:10,843
Time's up, brushes down.

585
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,679
I feel like I've at least
satisfied the challenge,

586
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:14,647
but there are
only five makeups.

587
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:18,017
For me to have this giant crack
on the side of the face,

588
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,552
maybe the judges will hate it,

589
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:22,321
but it's hard to tell.

590
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,899
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

591
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,369
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

592
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,739
First let's say hello
to our talented judges.

593
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:41,908
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

594
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:43,076
Glenn Hetrick.

595
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,844
- Good evening, guys.
- Hi, Glenn.

596
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:47,413
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

597
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:48,614
Hello, group.

598
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:49,849
Hi, Lois.

599
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,718
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

600
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:52,785
Hello.

601
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,020
Hi, Neville.

602
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,656
Okay, guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

603
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,158
was to choose
a disaster scenario

604
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:01,227
and a create
a beautiful elemental fairy

605
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:02,862
born from its destruction,

606
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,164
so let's take a look
at what you've come up with.

607
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:30,389
The shapes look cool.

608
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,125
The flames all have direction,

609
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,861
but I know up close,
it looks terrible.

610
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:54,714
I'm really kind of surprised,

611
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:55,848
'cause I thought
it was gonna be,

612
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:58,084
like, the worst makeup
I've ever done,

613
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:01,788
but it looks decent.

614
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:21,874
Seeing her in front
of the background

615
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,209
makes me
a little more confident.

616
00:27:23,243 --> 00:27:25,978
She really looks like she came
from that environment.

617
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:51,070
She looks high-fashion,
runway fairy oil spill madness,

618
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:53,973
and I love it.

619
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,128
She's all glittery and shiny
and glowing.

620
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,031
She looks really cool,
and I'm really happy.

621
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:27,340
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look at our fairies?

622
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,048
Why?

623
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,718
You're filled
all the way in with--

624
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:41,287
You're full up,
covered in prosthetics,

625
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:42,955
and you drop an inch
right there.

626
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,590
I don't understand.

627
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,393
It's a strange margin
across this bustier.

628
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:48,394
Yes.

629
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:49,662
I love the coloring,

630
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,931
especially around the eyes.

631
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,069
Wow.

632
00:28:57,104 --> 00:28:59,572
- Oh, this is lovely.
- Gorgeous.

633
00:28:59,606 --> 00:29:03,276
This paint on the chin,
on the arms,

634
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,977
I mean, it's still
all very connected.

635
00:29:05,012 --> 00:29:06,345
That's the great thing.

636
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,480
Could you move your arm out,

637
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:09,081
so we can kind of see that
close and open?

638
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:10,983
Come forward.

639
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,685
That's cool.

640
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,053
Really, really cool.

641
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,888
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

642
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,826
That's rad.

643
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:22,028
Yeah, it is.

644
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:23,729
This is so nicely done.

645
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,231
I like all the transitions.

646
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,433
Yeah.
Thank you.

647
00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:34,073
Why is that edge in the middle?

648
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,341
I do not know.

649
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,643
Would have been equally
successful under here,

650
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:40,079
plus it would have allowed you
to have the seam

651
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,847
surfacing all the way down.

652
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:45,284
It does turn it
into a Venetian carnival mask.

653
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:48,587
I have a horrible edge
across the middle of my face.

654
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,489
There's only five of us left,

655
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:52,558
and at this point
in the competition,

656
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:54,961
any mistake can ruin you.

657
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,364
We want to know what you think

658
00:29:58,398 --> 00:29:59,899
of tonight's transformations.

659
00:30:04,794 --> 00:30:07,229
As it stands,
why are there edges?

660
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,865
It does turn it
into a Venetian carnival mask.

661
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,966
Mm-hmm.

662
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:13,536
They should have come
down to the jaw.

663
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,604
I really want the judges to see

664
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,239
the overall
fashionable aesthetic

665
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,507
that I've gone for,

666
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:21,143
but I'm worried
that that horrible edge

667
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:22,845
across the middle of my face

668
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:26,282
could possibly send me home.

669
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:27,950
Gorgeous.

670
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:29,118
He's using warm tones

671
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:31,887
to make the coolness
of the eyes pop out.

672
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:34,823
Really smart decision
instead of going really dark.

673
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:37,993
These choices
of crystalline form

674
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:40,129
match with the wings.

675
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:41,830
It's very complete
form language.

676
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:42,865
Yes.

677
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,934
Could you turn, please?

678
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:47,770
I like the wings.

679
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,838
I think the wings
are absolutely brilliant.

680
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:53,142
Yeah, I agree.

681
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:55,477
Thank you.

682
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,917
Okay, the judges
would like to speak

683
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,886
with each of you to learn
more about your work.

684
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,888
George,
if you'd please step up.

685
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:13,329
George, tell us
how you allowed earthquake

686
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:14,897
to inspire
your fairy character.

687
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,765
I was thinking a fairy

688
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,767
who lives
below the Earth's crust,

689
00:31:18,802 --> 00:31:20,836
and when an earthquake happens,

690
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,306
she comes out to mend
and renovate everything.

691
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:27,076
I think the facial appliance
is absolutely beautiful.

692
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,644
Thank you.

693
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,113
And you didn't get crazy
with these shapes

694
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:32,114
and make it cartoony.

695
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:34,283
It's a very nice balance.

696
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:36,185
You've done a really,
really nice job this week.

697
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:37,419
Thank you.

698
00:31:37,454 --> 00:31:38,621
I absolutely loved your fairy.

699
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:40,723
I think that the use of the arm

700
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:43,125
was extremely skillful
and clever.

701
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,828
More than that,
the face reminded me

702
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,630
of some of the fairies
from Legend.

703
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:49,999
Wow.

704
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,200
Thank you.

705
00:31:51,234 --> 00:31:53,135
The face in particular
is captivating.

706
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:54,570
It's so well-balanced.

707
00:31:54,604 --> 00:31:57,306
You've managed to have
the perfect amount of point

708
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,174
and softness at the same time.

709
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,476
It's gorgeous.

710
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,744
Thank you.

711
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:04,513
George,
if you'd please step back.

712
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:08,417
Good job.

713
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:10,786
Stella, please step up.

714
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,228
Stella, please tell us
about your fairy.

715
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:22,798
I wanted her to be completely
encased in flames on the top,

716
00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:25,034
and then wildfires
inspire new growth,

717
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,537
so down below, I wanted her
to be full of new growth.

718
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,039
The concept is nice,

719
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,708
but it hasn't been fulfilled.

720
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:37,546
And the transition
from the charcoal burning

721
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,416
to the appliance itself
is so abrupt.

722
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,952
Had color transition been used,

723
00:32:43,987 --> 00:32:46,388
it would have a different feel.

724
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,991
I think that the overall image

725
00:32:49,025 --> 00:32:51,694
and the palette
is really quite beautiful,

726
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:52,928
and it does satisfy
the challenge,

727
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:55,664
but I would say
that it's not very inventive.

728
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:58,634
It's kind of like the first
thing you're going to think of

729
00:32:58,668 --> 00:33:00,903
for a fire character.

730
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,838
I know you're creative enough
to come up with something

731
00:33:02,872 --> 00:33:05,941
that would have been
more inventive as a concept.

732
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:09,411
The massive issue for me
is that she needs wings.

733
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,348
Ultimately,
it doesn't feel like a fairy.

734
00:33:12,382 --> 00:33:15,217
It feels like a fire elemental
or something,

735
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:17,052
but it just doesn't
get there for me.

736
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:19,188
Okay.

737
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:21,223
Stella,
if you'd please step down.

738
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,063
Dina, you're up.

739
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,172
So tell us how flood
influenced your fairy.

740
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:39,274
She was born
in a flooded forest.

741
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,110
A river overflowed
onto the land,

742
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,611
and she rose from it.

743
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,948
I thought I would incorporate
some driftwood, stones, sand,

744
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,416
you know, a mixture
of all things,

745
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,051
you know, water and land.

746
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:50,719
This is
a very beautiful makeup.

747
00:33:50,754 --> 00:33:51,887
Thank you.

748
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:54,923
You retained
the model's aesthetic,

749
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,492
but you didn't do it
in such a way

750
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:58,927
that you made it mask-y.

751
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:00,229
I really like this makeup.

752
00:34:00,263 --> 00:34:04,400
The subject matter calls
for the mud and the heaviness,

753
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:09,371
and yet you have managed
to capture the lightness.

754
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:11,106
You have quite a range
of colors here,

755
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:13,976
and the transitions
are handled so beautifully.

756
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,011
It's a beautiful makeup,

757
00:34:16,045 --> 00:34:17,713
and everything else
that you've designed,

758
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:18,914
including the prosthetics,

759
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:20,749
just highlight that makeup.

760
00:34:20,784 --> 00:34:22,217
Thank you so much.

761
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:24,019
Dina, please step back.

762
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:26,255
Thank you.

763
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,324
Yay. Good job.

764
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,492
Thanks.

765
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,561
All right, let's talk to Drew.

766
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,738
Drew, tell us
about your oil spill fairy.

767
00:34:42,772 --> 00:34:45,274
She is an Earth spirit fairy,

768
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:46,875
who lives in the ground,

769
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,544
and there was an oil spill,

770
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:51,680
and so she's using her powers
to clean up the mess.

771
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,115
What do you think
of your creation?

772
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:55,884
I like
almost every aspect of it,

773
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,487
except for my horrible decision

774
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:01,323
to cut the prosthetic
across her face.

775
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:03,926
If I had a time machine,
I would go back in time

776
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,727
and smack myself really hard.

777
00:35:05,762 --> 00:35:07,563
Yeah, absolutely.

778
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:10,732
That should have gone down
to the bottom of her chin,

779
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,067
so you bury that edge.

780
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:15,270
My other major complaint is,
there's a disconnect

781
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:18,340
in terms of the dress
into her face and everything.

782
00:35:18,374 --> 00:35:19,908
I think that you could have
added a little bit

783
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,844
by letting the oil
spill out of her mouth

784
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,745
and then have her neck
covered in black

785
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,181
and tying the oil together
in the rest of the body.

786
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:28,150
I think what is missing

787
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:29,418
is the gloss that's happening

788
00:35:29,452 --> 00:35:31,887
from the oil dripping down
across her chest--

789
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,655
there's none of that gloss
in her hands.

790
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,723
That would have helped

791
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,959
communicate the story
a bit better.

792
00:35:36,993 --> 00:35:41,296
The thing is that you've
gone for a nice iridescence,

793
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:42,764
but it would have worked better

794
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:45,100
had you gone
for dark round the eyes

795
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:47,402
coming up into the hair,

796
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,138
and then it would have been
a look that would have worked.

797
00:35:50,173 --> 00:35:51,340
Thank you.

798
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:54,743
Drew, please step down.

799
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:02,217
Cig, you're next.

800
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,859
Please tell us
about your avalanche fairy.

801
00:36:10,894 --> 00:36:13,228
My fairy was
a mischievous mountain fairy.

802
00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:15,764
Mother Nature sends
an avalanche to take her out.

803
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,567
She almost died,
but her fairy magic saved her,

804
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:21,069
so now she's imbued
with ice powers.

805
00:36:21,104 --> 00:36:23,405
I think
she's really delightful.

806
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:27,242
Can you tell me
how you made the wings?

807
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:28,577
I wasn't sure
if it was gonna work,

808
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:30,512
but I just cut out
clear vacuform plastic,

809
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,714
and I used a heat gun
and hand-warped it,

810
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:34,516
and I hot-glued
all the pieces together.

811
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:36,919
I think
they're exceptionally good.

812
00:36:36,953 --> 00:36:37,920
Awesome.

813
00:36:37,954 --> 00:36:39,054
I can't tell you

814
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:40,689
how well I think you've done.

815
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:43,392
It's really
excellent decision-making

816
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,160
in picking the ice,

817
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:48,797
using that to drive your
decision-making on your shapes,

818
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,132
and it's absolutely stunning.

819
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,168
With the headpiece and the body

820
00:36:53,202 --> 00:36:54,636
and the wings,

821
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,773
you've sustained
a harmony in form

822
00:36:57,807 --> 00:36:59,541
that is so consistent

823
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:02,277
that this character
feels very whole.

824
00:37:02,312 --> 00:37:04,179
Thank you guys so much.

825
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:05,847
Cig, if you'd please step back.

826
00:37:05,882 --> 00:37:07,783
Thanks.

827
00:37:11,721 --> 00:37:13,956
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

828
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,257
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

829
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,258
while they deliberate.

830
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:18,360
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

831
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,433
All right, judges,
let's talk about the looks

832
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:25,968
you like the most this week.

833
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:29,104
Why don't we start with George's
earthquake-inspired fairy?

834
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:31,607
It was
really quite accomplished,

835
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:32,741
especially the face.

836
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,009
The face was the best part.

837
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,011
I agree.
Beautiful facial makeup.

838
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,680
Beautiful points--
Well-colored, well-sculpted,

839
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:39,848
good use of silicone.

840
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,116
One of the best I've seen
on the show.

841
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,119
There was a grace
and a beauty there.

842
00:37:44,153 --> 00:37:47,956
I think it was the most fairy
of all of them.

843
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:49,191
All right,
let's talk about Dina.

844
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,961
She showed such grace
in her application,

845
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:54,363
keeping the face light

846
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,198
and figuring out
how to transition

847
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,300
from a bunch
of different dark colors

848
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:01,603
without the entire thing
looking muddy.

849
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,805
It was
absolutely the correct choice

850
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
to have a white face.

851
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:06,375
Dina's visual acuity

852
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,910
is a force
to be reckoned with here.

853
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:11,513
All right, let's move on
to Cig's avalanche fairy.

854
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:14,116
That was beautifully handled,

855
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,120
from the lip line to the way
the eyes were applied.

856
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:21,857
Everything about it
was exceptionally well done.

857
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:24,359
This super cool idea
for a makeup,

858
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:25,894
and then he added the wings,

859
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,663
and he knew that that would
bring it all together

860
00:38:27,697 --> 00:38:30,098
and allow it to succeed within
the parameters that we gave him.

861
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:33,268
All right, let's move on
to the looks you like the least.

862
00:38:33,302 --> 00:38:35,604
Stella's wildfire fairy.

863
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:39,441
The biggest problem for me
was the lackluster concept.

864
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:43,612
It felt solid and stiff
and cartoon-like.

865
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:44,880
She made a mistake

866
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:46,715
with a design that she
didn't fully understand

867
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:47,816
this week, I think.

868
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,884
All right, so what do you think

869
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:50,352
about Drew's oil spill fairy?

870
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:53,655
What makes it less than perfect

871
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,425
is simply
technical decision-making.

872
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,826
Mm.

873
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,261
He was heading
in the right direction,

874
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,096
but where he let himself down

875
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,364
was the way the edges are,

876
00:39:02,398 --> 00:39:04,933
the choice of color
round the eyes,

877
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,335
and not tying
his elements together.

878
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,704
All right then, judges,

879
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:09,871
have you made your decisions?

880
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:11,640
Yeah, we have.

881
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:14,342
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

882
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:23,518
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

883
00:39:23,553 --> 00:39:27,723
George, we love
the sophisticated alterations

884
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:29,357
to her nose and chin,

885
00:39:29,392 --> 00:39:31,059
and we thought
that the shattered shoulder

886
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:33,128
was a super cool way
to represent your disaster.

887
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,329
Thank you.

888
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:37,265
Dina, you did
an exceptional job

889
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,701
morphing one color
into the other,

890
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:41,737
and she was still beautiful,

891
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:44,706
despite the fact that she was
covered in flood debris.

892
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:48,443
Cig, focusing on the wings

893
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:50,679
to tell your fairy story
was brilliant.

894
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:53,782
And her soft,
almost angelic look,

895
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:56,251
very well handled.

896
00:39:56,285 --> 00:39:58,120
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

897
00:39:58,154 --> 00:39:59,988
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

898
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,204
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

899
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,806
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

900
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:17,145
Cig.

901
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:18,246
Whoo!

902
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,814
No way.

903
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:21,582
Yeah!

904
00:40:21,617 --> 00:40:24,686
She was picture-perfect
with her crystalline wings,

905
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,122
her icy crown,
and a beautiful color palette.

906
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:29,557
She oozed fairy.

907
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:30,658
Thank you so much.

908
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:31,926
That's awesome.

909
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,494
I've been on the top
so many times,

910
00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:35,330
and I just haven't got
my first individual win.

911
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:36,898
Now I get it
on a fairy challenge.

912
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:37,965
That feels even better,

913
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,500
because I went
out of my element,

914
00:40:39,535 --> 00:40:42,437
and I did something
that even surprised myself.

915
00:40:42,471 --> 00:40:44,238
Cig, congratulations.

916
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:45,707
Thank you.

917
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:48,209
You, George, and Dina can
head back to the makeup room.

918
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:49,553
- Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

919
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:50,586
Good luck.

920
00:40:54,516 --> 00:40:56,751
Unfortunately,
that means you two

921
00:40:56,785 --> 00:40:58,252
are on the bottom this week,

922
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:01,122
and one of you
will be eliminated.

923
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:02,123
Please step forward.

924
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:11,032
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

925
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:14,202
Stella, we thought
you very successfully captured

926
00:41:14,236 --> 00:41:15,837
the essence of your disaster,

927
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:18,339
but between
the abrupt transitions

928
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:20,241
and the unfinished paint,

929
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:22,343
it just didn't come together.

930
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,712
Drew, many parts of your makeup

931
00:41:24,747 --> 00:41:26,948
were on the precipice
of brilliance,

932
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:29,784
but all of its parts
didn't quite add up,

933
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:32,920
and it left us
feeling unfulfilled.

934
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:34,822
So who is going home tonight?

935
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:36,591
The person going home
tonight is...

936
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:41,929
Stella.

937
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:43,731
You had a tough week,

938
00:41:43,766 --> 00:41:46,968
and, unfortunately,
at this stage of the game,

939
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:50,471
even a tiny stumble is
something that you can't afford.

940
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,040
Stella, I'm sorry,

941
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:55,943
but that means
you have been eliminated.

942
00:41:55,978 --> 00:41:59,113
However, Drew,
you are safe this week

943
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:00,915
and can head back
to the makeup room.

944
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:02,248
Love you.

945
00:42:05,254 --> 00:42:07,054
Stella, you've done
remarkably well.

946
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,557
There's absolutely nothing

947
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,059
that you should feel
upset about,

948
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,796
and you leave here knowing
how much you've achieved,

949
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,963
and that's wonderful.

950
00:42:15,998 --> 00:42:17,064
Thank you.

951
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,633
Stella, it's really been great

952
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:19,867
having you here with us.

953
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:22,003
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

954
00:42:22,037 --> 00:42:23,070
and pack up your kit.

955
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,305
Thank you.

956
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:25,339
Thank you so much, guys.

957
00:42:25,374 --> 00:42:26,841
- Good luck, Stella.
- Good luck.

958
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,410
I'm feeling a little bit sad,

959
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:32,180
but I feel like
I've come really far

960
00:42:32,214 --> 00:42:33,981
in this competition
as an artist.

961
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:36,751
It's me.

962
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:37,752
Ohh.

963
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:38,853
Stella.

964
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:40,421
This experience
truly has taught me

965
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:41,556
what I am capable of.

966
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,925
Aww.

967
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:47,195
I know I still have
so much to learn,

968
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:50,131
but I plan on learning it.

969
00:42:50,165 --> 00:42:52,166
I love makeup,

970
00:42:52,201 --> 00:42:55,403
and I just want to do more.
