1
00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:03,533
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
season finale.

2
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:06,970
<i>Face Off!</i>

3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,706
Tonight, this season's
epic battle

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,642
of life and death
becomes an all-out war.

5
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:15,745
I have got several surprises
in store for you.

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,615
- Guys, come on out.
- Oh, my God!

7
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,384
And only three artists
remain in the fight.

8
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:23,486
It's so good
in so many different ways.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,822
It's absolutely horrific.

10
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,458
I just wanna constantly
make monsters, so bring it on.

11
00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:32,362
Dina, I know that you
decorate cakes for a living,

12
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:33,763
but I think you
might have found

13
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,331
your true calling in makeup.

14
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,834
If I win <i>Face Off,</i>
that would validate

15
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,702
me switching careers.

16
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:44,774
Everything about it
was extremely well done.

17
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:48,044
I have a one in three chance
of winning this thing,

18
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:49,078
and it's insane.

19
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:52,849
- I'm in panic mode.
- Watch as they strive

20
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,183
to overcome obstacles.

21
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:56,052
This needs some changes.

22
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,620
I have to rethink
my whole concept.

23
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:59,389
Wait, what the fuck am I doing?

24
00:00:59,423 --> 00:01:01,524
I just don't have time for this.

25
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:04,360
On their way to the biggest
clash in <i>Face Off</i> history.

26
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:06,896
Let the games begin!

27
00:01:12,903 --> 00:01:15,204
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

28
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:16,839
from Kryolan Professional
Make-Up

29
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:19,642
to one of their
85 international locations,

30
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:22,311
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

31
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:24,414
and $100,000.

32
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:30,319
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

34
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:09,425
Only one challenge remains
between one of you

35
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,694
and our grand prize.

36
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:18,334
And I have got several surprises
in store for you.

37
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:20,603
Without a pause for breath,

38
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,972
we're going from the last
spotlight challenge

39
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:24,607
straight into the finale.

40
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,609
I have no idea what
the challenge is going to be,

41
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,811
but the stage has been
completely transformed.

42
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:32,415
There's all these swords and all
these medieval coat of arms.

43
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,717
So I can't wait to see
what's in store.

44
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:38,321
Your final spotlight challenge
taps into one of the oldest

45
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:41,624
and most popular characters
in fantasy film history...

46
00:02:41,658 --> 00:02:43,726
Oh, God!

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,261
- Knights.
- Yes!

48
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:46,963
Cool.

49
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:48,998
I'm... What, seriously?

50
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:50,333
I love medieval times.

51
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:52,568
I love, like, knights
and chivalry.

52
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:55,604
I couldn't have asked for,
like, a better finale challenge.

53
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,006
Now, whether it's
the ringwraiths

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,140
in<i> The Lord Of The Rings</i>

55
00:02:58,175 --> 00:02:59,909
or the knights
from<i> Game Of Thrones,</i>

56
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:03,245
knights can represent
both good and evil.

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,983
So we will end this season
the way we began.

58
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:09,452
With life and death.

59
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:12,755
Your final spotlight challenge
is to create

60
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,658
two fantasy knights of your own,

61
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,160
one that is heroic
and embodies life,

62
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:21,130
and the other a villainous
knight embodying death.

63
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,932
Awesome.

64
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:24,333
Now, there's a lot
at stake here,

65
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:26,635
so you obviously are gonna need
a little bit of help.

66
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,837
Guys, come on out.

67
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,676
Hi!

68
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,779
You'll each get to choose
one of your former competitors

69
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:39,315
to join your team.

70
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,017
Drew, you're up first.

71
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,118
George.

72
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:46,155
Yes!

73
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:47,490
- Cig.
- Sasha.

74
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:52,795
And, of course, Dina.

75
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,264
- Stella.
- Yay!

76
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:57,066
- We've won one before together.
- I know!

77
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,502
Let's do it again.

78
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:01,137
I'm sure you're
probably thinking

79
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:02,671
you might need some more help,
right?

80
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:03,939
- Yeah.
- Well, don't worry.

81
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:06,842
I've got a few more artists here
to help you

82
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:10,046
who know exactly what it takes
to win<i> Face Off.</i>

83
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,047
Take a look.

84
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:16,719
Oh, my God!

85
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:19,155
- No way!
- That's right.

86
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:21,357
Each of you will also have help

87
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:23,959
from one of these former
<i>Face Off</i> champs.

88
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:27,963
Rayce,<i> Face Off</i>
season two champion,

89
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:31,967
Nicole,
our season three winner,

90
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:35,971
and Rashaad,
last season's champion.

91
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:38,707
Holy crap.
These are three amazing artists.

92
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:40,643
They've done this before.
They've been through it.

93
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:42,678
So it's nice to have someone
on our team

94
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:45,114
who can help us
get through this.

95
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:47,416
Welcome back, guys.
It's great to have you here.

96
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:49,218
- Good to be back.
- You ready to show these guys

97
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,120
- how it's done?
- Yeah!

98
00:04:51,154 --> 00:04:53,589
I'm very happy to be back.
I'm excited,

99
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:56,459
and whoever I'm paired up with,
I'm gonna give them my all.

100
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,928
Now, to keep things fair,
we've randomly assigned

101
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:01,831
one of our champions
to each of you.

102
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:04,433
So, Dina, you have Nicole.

103
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,168
- Hey.
- Hey, girl!

104
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,405
Let's win this thing.

105
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,274
Drew, you're paired with Rayce.

106
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,210
- Nice. What's up, dude?
- How you doing, Drew?

107
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:15,644
- Good to meet you.
- Congratulations.

108
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,046
- Thank you.
- Of course, that means,

109
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,749
Cig, you have Rashaad.

110
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:23,385
Now, regardless of whether
a knight was good or evil,

111
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,255
they always wore
a unique coat of arms

112
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,691
as a symbol of their allegiance
during battle.

113
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,559
Each of you will pull a sword
from a stone

114
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:33,629
to select one of these coat
of arms and use its symbols

115
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:36,765
and colors to inspire
your final knight makeups.

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,034
- Dina, you're up first.
- Awesome.

117
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:41,837
There's this really cool
aquatic-looking coat of arms

118
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:43,772
with an octopus wearing a crown.

119
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,841
So I'm going for aquatic.

120
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,344
Drew, you're next.

121
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:50,779
I've always been drawn
to the imagery of deer.

122
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:54,984
So I want the coat of arms
with the stag's head.

123
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,552
- Cool sword.
- Yeah, it is.

124
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:58,053
And lastly, Cig.

125
00:05:58,088 --> 00:05:59,622
I always wanted to do this.

126
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,524
I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna pull
a sword out of a stone!

127
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,359
Yes!

128
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:07,363
Cross that off the bucket list.

129
00:06:09,566 --> 00:06:11,734
Well, I can't wait
to see your creations.

130
00:06:11,768 --> 00:06:15,304
But what good is a knight
without putting him to the test

131
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,405
in a battle?

132
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,874
Each of your characters
will partake

133
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,976
in a fantastical
knight's tournament

134
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:25,147
complete with jousting
and an epic sword fight.

135
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:28,184
- Oh, my God!
- That's awesome!

136
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:31,787
Why don't you all head back
to the house and get some rest?

137
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,322
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

138
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:37,226
- Tally ho!
- I'm so excited!

139
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,233
It's day one
of our finale challenge.

140
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,402
And we have nine
and a half hours in the lab.

141
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:48,337
Let's do it.
We pick our models

142
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:50,105
and start sketching away.

143
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:53,309
Ah! This is so exciting!

144
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:56,078
To win<i> Face Off</i> would literally
change my life.

145
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:57,613
So I really want to win this.

146
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:58,614
And I'm pulling from
all the things

147
00:06:58,648 --> 00:06:59,982
that are on on the coat of arms.

148
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:03,586
I have gargoyles, a crescent
moon, and a couple stars.

149
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,555
Dark, we could go really
skeletal armor.

150
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,959
My death knight is gonna have
a very evil, gargoyle face,

151
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:12,861
and I want to fabricate
an entire suit of armor

152
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:14,230
that looks very skeletal.

153
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,432
And Rashaad
is a genius fabricator.

154
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:20,269
His fireman robot was one of
the best characters I've seen,

155
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:23,872
so I'm just gonna trust him
fully with any fabrication.

156
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:25,808
What do you think
about the good guy?

157
00:07:25,842 --> 00:07:27,443
I think some filigrees,

158
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,745
and, like, really regal,
refined.

159
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,447
Sort of beginning transition.

160
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:33,616
I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
with the life knight.

161
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,652
I'm toying with the idea that
they're a race of gargoyles,

162
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:38,220
and when they die
they become evil.

163
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,322
I'm just setting Rashaad loose
on sculpting.

164
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:42,057
And then we'll keep
conceptualizing

165
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,692
as we're moving along.

166
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:48,197
So we're looking
at our coat of arms,

167
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:50,299
and we're doing something
very aquatic.

168
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:53,135
And everything they're wearing
is gonna be from things

169
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,470
found under the sea.

170
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:55,971
I'm thinking,
for the death knight,

171
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,007
sort of a king crab crustacean.

172
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,310
And he's actually dead,
but he's brought back to life

173
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:03,012
by these electric eels.

174
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,114
So he'll be kind of zombified.

175
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:07,383
- For the good guy...
- Yeah.

176
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,484
...we should do something
a little more beautiful.

177
00:08:08,518 --> 00:08:10,786
A mermaid actually
gave my life knight

178
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,921
the ability to live underwater.

179
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:14,590
So he's gonna be this fish-man

180
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,458
with all this armor
from the sea.

181
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,627
That's, like, exactly
what I'm thinking.

182
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,297
Nicole is such
an amazing artist.

183
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:24,533
She's really good at beautiful
and creepy makeups.

184
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,635
So I'm really excited
to work with her.

185
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,504
If you wanna start maybe
on the fish guy...

186
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:29,538
- Okay.
- ...then I can start

187
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,373
- on this crab dude.
- Okay.

188
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:37,279
Do you want the hybrid at all?

189
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,148
Yeah. Based on
our coat of arms,

190
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:42,117
my concept is two
dueling factions

191
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:44,453
of woodland elf creatures.

192
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:47,489
The light race,
they are more perfect forms.

193
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:50,793
So the light character sort of
this beautiful cedar

194
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,494
with features of deer anatomy.

195
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,697
And the death character will have

196
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:58,500
deer-like forms
that have become overgrown.

197
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:59,968
You start blocking out
the cowls.

198
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:01,203
- Okay.
- You and I will start

199
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:02,338
on the faces.

200
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:04,406
I wanna get the faces
mostly done today.

201
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:12,614
Rayce is a genius
conceptual artist.

202
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,483
And he's really awesome
with paint work

203
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:16,618
and an amazing sculptor.

204
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,021
He's getting all
of these gnarled scars

205
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:23,125
and really cool wrinkle lines
into the face design.

206
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,693
I'm really, really stoked
to be working with him.

207
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,595
Your sculpting skills
terrify me.

208
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:29,765
- I'm mediocre at best.
- You shut your mouth.

209
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:35,070
Awesome.

210
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:36,105
So I have Nicole

211
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,439
working
on the good knight face,

212
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:39,174
and I'm starting
on the bad knight face.

213
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,343
Midway, we switch.

214
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:43,412
'Cause I want a hand
in everything that we do.

215
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:45,547
- I'll make it bigger.
- All right.

216
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:48,117
Stella has the starfish
blocked out,

217
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:49,885
wrapping around him,
protecting him.

218
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,887
We're gonna use it as armor.

219
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,823
Stella, I'll come and pipe
and you can mess with these.

220
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,291
- Okay.
- I actually do some

221
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,260
finishing touches on it
with some piping.

222
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,362
I just pipe all the little dots
onto it.

223
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:01,530
- Dina?
- Yes?

224
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:03,365
- It looks amazing.
- This?

225
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,700
- It does.
- Oh, my God.

226
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,470
- Hey, guys!
- Hi!

227
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:10,706
To stay with the theme
of our challenge,

228
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,075
I'm wearing the Westmore
coat of arms.

229
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:14,943
Over 100 years old.

230
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:17,346
All right, so tell us about the
coat of arms that you picked.

231
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,715
It has gargoyles,
and in the middle,

232
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:22,818
there's a black crescent moon
and three stars.

233
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:25,087
So these knights get cursed.

234
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:28,924
So anytime they die, they come
back as these gargoyles.

235
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,793
I'm gonna take some
of that bone structure

236
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,561
and subtly put it over here.

237
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:34,563
You have to be careful
that they both

238
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,365
- don't look too dark.
- True.

239
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,234
I think you need
to lighten his features.

240
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,103
Okay. It didn't really occur
to me before,

241
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:43,172
but the life character
is definitely snarly

242
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:45,140
and creature-esque,
so that definitely

243
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,810
makes me reconsider the face
for the life character.

244
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:49,845
- That's a good point.
- It is.

245
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,981
Our concept
is two battling races

246
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:55,451
of elfin fawn people.

247
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,252
How is your thickness
on this one here?

248
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,922
It's very thin underneath
the major emote areas.

249
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:02,658
In being so thin, I would say
get that nose anchored first

250
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,427
because these are gonna
be very difficult,

251
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:08,263
being as then as they are,
to get them placed.

252
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:10,199
- Yeah.
- So the octopus is the king

253
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,134
and these two were serving
under him.

254
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:14,236
We're doing kind of
a crustacean.

255
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,039
He was dead, but then some eels
wrapped around him

256
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:19,374
and their electricity
shocked him back to life.

257
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:23,412
In your coat of arms,
you had an octopus

258
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:25,547
- and you're doing a crab.
- Yeah.

259
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:27,282
- Why?
- Well, the octopus is actually

260
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:30,319
wearing a crown, so we were
thinking he's just the king,

261
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,321
and these are the knights
under the king.

262
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:34,690
- Hmm.
- This is the finale challenge.

263
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:37,426
And Mr. Westmore's not liking
what I'm doing.

264
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,594
This is a big problem.

265
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:41,196
I would add something into this

266
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:42,498
that's octopus-y,

267
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:45,400
because it's an element
of your coat of arms

268
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:47,202
that you're literally missing.
Yeah, very.

269
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:50,973
Oh, God. Now I have
to rethink my whole concept.

270
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:53,442
I'm just completely lost
and overwhelmed.

271
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:56,645
Coming up...

272
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,980
I'm in panic mode.

273
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:58,981
We're running out of time.

274
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,616
Wait, what fuck am I doing?

275
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,452
I just painted these pieces
the wrong frigging color.

276
00:12:03,486 --> 00:12:05,888
This is for
the whole enchilada.

277
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:07,155
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

278
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:17,084
I would add something
that's octopus-y into this,

279
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,720
because it's an element
of your coat of arms.

280
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,488
- That you're literally missing.
- Yeah, very.

281
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,157
It's day one
of our finale challenge,

282
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:25,659
and I have to rethink
my whole concept.

283
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:29,029
- This needs some changes.
- We're doing two characters

284
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:32,032
and I don't have time
to rethink everything.

285
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:35,903
So I'm just completely
freaking out.

286
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,674
- Good luck to everybody.
- Thank you.

287
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,743
Thank you.

288
00:12:42,777 --> 00:12:44,845
I'm feeling pretty down
right now,

289
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,247
and my team can see it.

290
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:49,650
_

291
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:50,918
Dina's really worried,

292
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:52,753
so I'm just gonna
be that voice of reason,

293
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:55,422
help figure out how
to incorporate that octopus.

294
00:12:55,457 --> 00:12:58,525
I'm trying to think.

295
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,696
What if we put the tentacles
hiding underneath the shell?

296
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,898
Nicole suggests that
instead of the eels

297
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,934
bringing him back to life,
the octopus crawls

298
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:08,869
into the head of our crustacean,

299
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:11,672
kind of controls his brain
with his tentacles.

300
00:13:11,673 --> 00:13:14,179
_

301
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,570
_ _

302
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,252
Okay, George,
I think it's ready for you.

303
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:27,220
- Okay.
- We get the faces finished,

304
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:29,422
and George has actually
volunteered

305
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:32,826
to be in charge
of all the molds.

306
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,295
He's not only really good at it,
he's really fast at it.

307
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:38,265
So while I am picking up
where George left off

308
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:40,133
on the light creature's cowl,

309
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:43,403
Rayce is sculpting
the dark creature's cowl.

310
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:46,673
My team is playing into
each one of our strengths,

311
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:49,476
and it's sort of running
like a well-oiled machine.

312
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,311
Yeah, that's already
more elfin.

313
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:55,482
It's towards the end of the
day, and Rashaad's sculpting

314
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:57,384
this great face
for the life character.

315
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:59,352
But it still just
doesn't feel right to me.

316
00:13:59,387 --> 00:14:01,288
It's time, guys.

317
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:04,057
My plan is to sleep
on the life character

318
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:06,293
and hopefully a brilliant idea
will come to me.

319
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:07,561
My brain hasn't let me down yet.

320
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,671
So it's day two.
We have nine and a half hours

321
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:19,105
- in the lab today.
- Nice.

322
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,575
Looks real good.

323
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,343
We have to finish
these cowls today

324
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:25,946
because I really wanna
start pre-painting tomorrow.

325
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,615
So I'm focusing more
on the death knight cowl,

326
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,884
and Nicole is working
on the life knight.

327
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:33,286
And Stella starts molding
the chest piece.

328
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,033
_

329
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,156
_

330
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,691
Gotta go with my gut
on this one.

331
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:38,859
I was able to sleep on it,

332
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:40,927
and now I have
a really solid story

333
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,329
for both of my characters.

334
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:43,763
Instead of having
the life knight

335
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,599
starting to turn
into a gargoyle,

336
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:49,202
I wanna take a chance and do
a human silicone makeup.

337
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:51,638
So I have to start over
from scratch.

338
00:14:51,672 --> 00:14:54,174
While I'm sculpting it,
Sasha is going to

339
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,909
finish the details
of the collar piece.

340
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:58,511
I'll have Rashaad
fabricating armor.

341
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:06,786
- Georgie?
- Yeah?

342
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:08,588
It's ready.
We get the light character's

343
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:11,291
cowl finished,
but the dark character's cowl

344
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:12,659
still needs a lot of work.

345
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:13,994
It has a lot more texture
and detail.

346
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,630
So Rayce and I decide to start

347
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:18,431
tag-teaming that sculpture
together.

348
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,400
I like it.

349
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,076
One hour, everyone!

350
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:31,478
I'm, like, in panic mode.

351
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,246
We can do it.
We can do it, we can do it.

352
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:35,148
We're running out of time
and I really need

353
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:37,751
to get both of these molds open
and cleaned out

354
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:40,387
- by the end of the day.
- Ooh!

355
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:43,156
So we open
the death knight's cowl,

356
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,958
and we start power washing that.

357
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:48,728
I don't think we're
gonna have time

358
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,397
to get the other cowl
open today.

359
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:51,665
There's just no way.

360
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:55,035
But Nicole is gonna
try to go for it anyway.

361
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:58,630
_

362
00:15:58,631 --> 00:15:59,631
_

363
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:01,474
- We have four minutes.
- Four?

364
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:04,277
All of a sudden, George
and Rayce and Drew walk out

365
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:05,745
with our life knight mold.

366
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,714
I just can't even believe
they're helping us out.

367
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:09,516
This is the finale.
It's so awesome of them.

368
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,651
Just tie it on. Just tie it.

369
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:13,053
- Done!
- Yeah!

370
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:17,157
We get it done.
It's unbelievable.

371
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:18,992
All right, that's time!

372
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:20,860
I love you guys!

373
00:16:20,895 --> 00:16:23,730
There's no way we could
have got both of those cowls out

374
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,732
- without their help.
- Whoo!

375
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,133
- Whoo!
- This is gonna put us

376
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,069
in a really awesome spot
tomorrow.

377
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,037
- Thank you guys so much.
- Yeah.

378
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:40,880
It's day three
of our knight challenge,

379
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,016
and we have eight hours
in the lab.

380
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,552
- That's so awesome. High five.
- Yes.

381
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:47,754
So today, Rashaad's gonna keep
trucking along

382
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,556
on both the life
and death armor.

383
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,258
Do your thing, Rashaad.

384
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,295
And Sasha is going
to start sculpting these

385
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:57,564
accented filigrees
for the life knight.

386
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:58,932
I'm definitely behind schedule,

387
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:01,868
and I need to get
the death cowl finished

388
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:04,104
and molded as soon as possible.

389
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:10,477
I'll do the arms.
You do the chest.

390
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:12,946
I'm really putting Stella
and Nicole to work today.

391
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,883
I have Stella starting the arm
pieces for the death knight.

392
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,085
I have Nicole start
the chest piece.

393
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,255
We wanna incorporate some fish
bones into our design as well.

394
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:25,291
So I start sculpting
the fish spine

395
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:28,928
that we're gonna use
to go over the chest plate.

396
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,469
Looks really good
with your beard.

397
00:17:36,504 --> 00:17:37,804
I know.

398
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:42,442
I think that the flesh
needs to be lighter

399
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:46,846
because I was envisioning, like,
dead, dry mummy skin almost.

400
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,548
Rayce is pre-painting
the death knight,

401
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,016
and I notice that a lot of grey

402
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:51,518
is getting worked
into his paint scheme.

403
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:52,719
That makes me really nervous.

404
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:55,655
I'm worried that
it's gonna get so dark

405
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,857
that there's no contrast
and nothing reads.

406
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:00,293
I don't think I'll
go much lighter than this.

407
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:03,430
All aspects of this makeup
going into this finale

408
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:04,864
have to be perfect.

409
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:07,700
If we don't get this paint job
completely dialed in,

410
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:09,769
it could sink me.

411
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:15,223
I think that the flesh
needs to be lighter

412
00:18:15,257 --> 00:18:18,259
because I was envisioning, like,
mummy skin almost, you know?

413
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:20,695
It's day three
of our finale challenge,

414
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,964
and Rayce is pre-painting
the death knight,

415
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,466
and I notice that a lot of grey

416
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,001
is getting worked
into his paint scheme.

417
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:28,136
I'm worried that it's just
gonna get so dark

418
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,105
that there's no contrast
and nothing reads.

419
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,710
I just don't want it to get...

420
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,241
_

421
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:34,476
- It won't be.
- The magic word.

422
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,911
But Rayce is the champion
of season two,

423
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:38,713
and really awesome
with paint work.

424
00:18:38,748 --> 00:18:41,983
So I know that he'll be able
to make something pretty sweet.

425
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,985
All right, I trust you.

426
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:52,527
- That's time, guys!
- I kind of love him.

427
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,797
He's absolutely beautiful.
Thank you so much.

428
00:18:55,831 --> 00:19:00,235
We have about 15 pieces
to apply tomorrow.

429
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,669
It's absolutely insane.

430
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:05,807
So sleeping tonight
is gonna be very hard.

431
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:15,550
We get back to the house,
and I'm completely exhausted,

432
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:18,086
and so is everyone else.

433
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:24,225
Oh, man! What?

434
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,861
I see my mom and my boyfriend.

435
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:28,930
Oh, my God, this is so amazing!

436
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,500
Hey, come here, guys!

437
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:34,803
I see my girlfriend, Randy,
and my mom.

438
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,672
It's making me teary-eyed,
and I'm, like...

439
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,574
If I blink, I'm gonna cry.

440
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,543
Give me some love!

441
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:43,311
My parents are two
of the biggest-hearted,

442
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:45,113
most supportive people ever.

443
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:48,216
So do you guys get to stay
for the whole thing?

444
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,785
Oh, my God!
But the fact that they're here

445
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,554
to support me,
it's an amazing gift.

446
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,522
- I have...
- Couldn't be prouder.

447
00:19:54,557 --> 00:19:57,258
- Grandpa's ring.
- Oh!

448
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:59,594
I wear it
for every spotlight challenge.

449
00:19:59,628 --> 00:20:01,896
Winning<i> Face Off</i>
while my parents are there

450
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:06,000
to watch it happen would be
the highest point of my life.

451
00:20:06,035 --> 00:20:07,469
Oh!

452
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,838
I've been trying
to work on my confidence

453
00:20:09,872 --> 00:20:10,900
since I've... yeah.

454
00:20:10,901 --> 00:20:12,148
_

455
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,130
_

456
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,210
I'm really proud of you.

457
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,377
We're just overwhelmed.

458
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:18,279
This is
the energy boost I need.

459
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:20,882
I wanna do, like,
the best makeup possible

460
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,085
so that my mom and Michael
can see me win this competition.

461
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,820
I just wanna make them
really proud.

462
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:28,623
This whole thing
has been so amazing

463
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:29,924
and crazy at the same time.

464
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,693
I know you're
gonna do 'em proud.

465
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:33,194
I knew you were gonna
make it to the end.

466
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,963
I did,
but no matter what happens,

467
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,831
I'm really proud of the things
I've done here,

468
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:39,234
and I can't wait
till you guys can see them.

469
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:41,503
- I know.
- You're a winner in my eyes.

470
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:43,438
Thanks, mom.
Seeing my loved ones,

471
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,440
I realize there's a lot
at stake here.

472
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:47,407
Like, this could change my life.

473
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,588
- There we go.
- Oh, boy.

474
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:02,157
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

475
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:04,025
We're on location
for the finale

476
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,227
at this incredible
equestrian center.

477
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:09,497
There's an arena.
There's horses and stables.

478
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:10,999
This place is huge.

479
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:12,467
This is the culmination

480
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,102
of everything we've
been working for.

481
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:15,737
This is for the whole enchilada.

482
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:17,472
So bring it on.

483
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,909
All right, here we go.

484
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:22,343
- All right.
- Here we are, guys.

485
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:24,512
We have four hours
of makeup time,

486
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:27,348
and one hour of last looks,
all on location.

487
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:29,851
- Hello.
- Hey, how's it going?

488
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:30,919
- Good.
- Drew.

489
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:32,720
- Tony.
- I'm applying the face to you.

490
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:35,456
I'm gonna let Sasha
take point on the silicone face

491
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:38,660
and I'm gonna tackle the
application of the death knight,

492
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:40,762
and I'm gonna set Rashaad
on the armor.

493
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:41,930
- Hey, Cig.
- Yeah?

494
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:43,965
- Check him out.
- Love it.

495
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,837
It's time to start sticking.

496
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:52,073
I'm gonna be applying
the death knight.

497
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:53,808
George will be applying
the life knight.

498
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:57,312
And Rayce is going to finish up
the life knight's armor.

499
00:21:57,346 --> 00:22:00,014
- Imagine those copper?
- Yeah.

500
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:01,983
Can you bang this out fast,
though?

501
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:02,984
- Yeah.
- Okay.

502
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:06,688
Pull this on like a shirt.

503
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,725
Yeah,
that's looking really cool.

504
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,660
So I get the face applied
to the death knight,

505
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:14,562
then I jump on painting
the life knight.

506
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:16,965
I'm taking a risk doing
this minimalist makeup,

507
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:19,701
so I really wanna take my time
and make this really good.

508
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,171
You think...

509
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:24,204
_

510
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:25,173
_

511
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:26,140
- You can miss it?
- Yeah.

512
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:28,109
Our models will be participating

513
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:29,344
in a medieval battle.

514
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,212
So we have to be really careful

515
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:33,314
about how we're gonna stick
the antler pieces

516
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:35,250
into both makeups.
If one of these antlers

517
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:38,386
does snag on something and
tear a chunk out of the cowl,

518
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,189
it's pretty much done.
So instead of going, like,

519
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:43,424
straight up and giving
the antlers height,

520
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:45,893
we're going back at an angle.

521
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:48,529
It makes the antlers less
likely to get knocked off.

522
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:51,633
Oh! Stop lifting.

523
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:52,867
The arm pieces that we sculpted

524
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:55,336
don't curve
around the actor's arms.

525
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:58,273
So we're having a hard time
getting those edges down.

526
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:00,375
I used the Pros-Aide
all over his body.

527
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,410
It's just the arms
that it's doing this.

528
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:05,413
We tried every adhesive,
and nothing's really working.

529
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,448
So the parts that are lifting
we're covering with moss

530
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:09,417
and seaweed so you can't
see those seams.

531
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:12,754
And then reinforcing it
with some rope.

532
00:23:12,788 --> 00:23:13,955
15 minutes, guys.

533
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,468
Hey, guys.
So you have one hour left.

534
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:30,138
- This is last looks.
- Thank you.

535
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:31,572
- Thanks, McKenzie.
- Thank you.

536
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:37,412
I have a lot of little pieces

537
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:39,180
that I need to add
to the death knight.

538
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:42,550
Some really cool mandibles
and fish spines.

539
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:43,751
But they just don't look right.

540
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:46,721
So we're just gonna scrap those.

541
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:49,624
I'm getting the copper color

542
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:52,627
painted over the life knight's
armor pieces.

543
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:54,996
Wait, what the fuck
am I doing? Am I drunk?

544
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,799
But I just painted these pieces
the wrong frigging color.

545
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,268
They're supposed to match
the silvery plate.

546
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:03,871
Idiot.
I just don't have time for this.

547
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:05,940
To really sell the knight look,

548
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:08,076
I was envisioning lots of armor,

549
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,144
and now I'm realizing
there's so much space

550
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:12,780
that just doesn't have anything.
It looks incomplete.

551
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:15,383
I'm running out of time, so I
just start ripping up fabric

552
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:18,419
and tying it around him
as if it was wraps.

553
00:24:18,454 --> 00:24:19,420
15 minutes, guys.

554
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,737
That's time, guys.

555
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:38,506
Yes!

556
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,508
- Do you love them?
- Yeah.

557
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,910
I can't believe
how much we got finished.

558
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:45,680
I'm still extremely nervous.

559
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:48,983
I've just worked my butt off
to get here and this is it.

560
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,552
I just wanna win so bad.

561
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:52,620
Coming up...

562
00:24:52,654 --> 00:24:56,124
Welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
season finale.

563
00:24:56,158 --> 00:24:57,191
My stomach's in knots.

564
00:24:58,894 --> 00:25:00,361
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

565
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,724
Good evening, everyone,

566
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,894
and welcome to the<i> Face Off</i>
season finale.

567
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,602
We will be transporting you
to another time and place,

568
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,606
where knights are locked in
a bitter life and death battle.

569
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,975
You will witness
their epic clash,

570
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,144
and then we'll crown a brand-new
<i>Face Off</i> champion,

571
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,582
right here, tonight.

572
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,317
Now, who better to choose
our winner

573
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:56,287
than our talented
and accomplished judges?

574
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,423
First we have the owner of Optic
Nerve Makeup Effects Studio,

575
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:04,195
Mr. Glenn Hetrick.

576
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,965
Oscar-winning makeup artist,
the lovely Lois Burwell.

577
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,405
And creature and concept
designer, our very own

578
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:19,610
Neville Page.

579
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:23,414
Okay, let's take a look at our
finalists' amazing creations.

580
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:27,084
Our first pair of knights
is from Cig.

581
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,258
I'm really proud of my team.
The death knight looks great.

582
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,893
The life knight is so well done

583
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,127
that it just looks
like his face.

584
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,562
Did I even do a makeup
on that guy?

585
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,230
I feel like I might
have a shot at this.

586
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,999
Yeah!

587
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,757
They look so cool,

588
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,960
and my death knight
looks like a badass.

589
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,629
I'm just so happy
for me and my team.

590
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,989
I couldn't be prouder
of these two makeups.

591
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,825
I can't believe the amount
of insane work

592
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,627
my team and I have managed
to pull off.

593
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:25,202
All right, guys, it's time to
put our knights to the test

594
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:29,640
in battle.

595
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,476
Let the games begin!

596
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:36,113
Let the games begin!

597
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,332
Oh, my God!

598
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,142
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

599
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,111
Oh!

600
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,467
_

601
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:39,930
That was amazing!

602
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:41,955
You guys like the battle?

603
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:49,062
Thank you, everyone,
so much for being here

604
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:51,798
with us this evening.
But the time has come

605
00:31:51,832 --> 00:31:54,601
for our judges to take
a closer look at the makeups

606
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:57,304
and deliberate in private.
Thank you again so much.

607
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:58,538
Have a good evening, everybody.

608
00:32:07,948 --> 00:32:09,849
Here we go.

609
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,151
That battle was so cool

610
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:13,386
and now it's time for things
to get serious.

611
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:15,021
My stomach's in knots.
I'm nervous.

612
00:32:15,056 --> 00:32:17,991
But at this point,
I've given everything I got.

613
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:21,061
So, hopefully, it's good enough.

614
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:27,834
Who made your favorite
life and death knights?

615
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:30,603
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

616
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:35,026
This is the culmination

617
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,628
of everything we've been
working for,

618
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:39,631
and this is such, like,
a crazy, emotional moment,

619
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:41,633
but whatever happens, happens.

620
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,235
I'm trying to figure out where
he ends and the makeup begins.

621
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,403
- That's a good thing.
- Yes.

622
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:47,138
- Yeah, it is.
- The silicone certainly

623
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:49,040
- is well done.
- Really amazing.

624
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:52,911
- I love the armor.
- The armor's fantastic.

625
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:55,380
And this area here
is really very nice.

626
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,153
The surface of this,
this scale, is spot on.

627
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:06,057
It's rather lovely, and I
love this collar going around.

628
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:10,728
Look at the sheer amount
of detail all over this thing.

629
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:14,132
- It's bloody fantastic.
- It's screen ready.

630
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,535
I love the way the arms are.
It's just wonderful.

631
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:22,941
This is really nice,
natural looking makeup.

632
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:24,976
I love these subtle
color transitions.

633
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,879
This nose and cheekbones
are all that it took

634
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:30,148
to convey that it's stag-like.

635
00:33:34,753 --> 00:33:37,722
There's some really beautiful
character design,

636
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:40,191
this kind of slash
through the lip.

637
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:42,694
- It's very well done.
- I absolutely love

638
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:45,530
the arrangement of the horns
on the top of the crown.

639
00:33:45,564 --> 00:33:46,531
Thank you.

640
00:33:52,104 --> 00:33:54,205
So judges, what do you think
of tonight's makeups?

641
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:57,609
It's a phenomenal amount
of work to have accomplished,

642
00:33:57,643 --> 00:34:00,979
and even more impressive
was how each and every makeup

643
00:34:01,013 --> 00:34:04,248
withstood the test of battle.
Well done.

644
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:06,084
Thank you.

645
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:07,619
All right, guys,
the judges would like

646
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,220
to hear from each of you.

647
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:12,323
So, Cig, explain
your concept to the judges.

648
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:16,527
So my life knight
is a part of these crusaders

649
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:19,497
bound by honor to protect
the realm from themselves.

650
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:23,434
And they come across this tribe
that ends up cursing the knights

651
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:27,071
so that when they die, they come
back as these gargoyles.

652
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,506
The more of them that die,

653
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,142
the stronger
the darkness force grows.

654
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:33,811
Regarding
your good life knight,

655
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:37,081
the silicone piece
is absolutely gorgeous.

656
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,783
The edges are
almost nonexistent.

657
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:42,754
I really appreciate that you
went with a character makeup,

658
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,023
hyperreal silicone
on your life guy,

659
00:34:45,057 --> 00:34:48,459
and then went crazy monster,
very orc-ish

660
00:34:48,494 --> 00:34:51,663
on your death knight.
Great conceptual work there.

661
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:53,965
- Thank you.
- I particularly liked

662
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:57,869
your dark knight's sculpt.
Some lovely forms,

663
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:00,438
and great paint work.
Well done.

664
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,540
- Thank you.
- Great characters.

665
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:04,108
They really complement
one another.

666
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,078
The head sculpt
of the dark knight,

667
00:35:07,112 --> 00:35:10,214
you really retained
the proportion so well

668
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:12,450
- that it remains really heroic.
- Thanks.

669
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:13,785
So it's a beautiful piece.

670
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:16,421
As a team, you've really
done quite well.

671
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:19,090
Thank you.

672
00:35:19,124 --> 00:35:20,558
Okay, Dina, you're next.

673
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:22,493
There is this octopus king,

674
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:25,329
and him and his army have been
sinking ships for years.

675
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:27,865
The octopus sends
his squid minions

676
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,635
to crawl into the corpses
from these ships

677
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:32,203
to control their bodies.

678
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:33,738
That's where this guy
comes from.

679
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:37,041
And my good knight
was actually a victim

680
00:35:37,076 --> 00:35:38,543
of one of these ship attacks,

681
00:35:38,577 --> 00:35:41,879
and a mermaid gave him armor
from sea life

682
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:45,349
to help him defeat
these crustaceans.

683
00:35:45,384 --> 00:35:48,553
The overall vision
is exemplary.

684
00:35:48,587 --> 00:35:49,954
Thank you.

685
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:53,491
I absolutely adore
your dark knight.

686
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:57,628
The color is marvelous
and the chin is excellent.

687
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,530
I'm very impressed by it.

688
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:03,267
With your good knight,
I like the way the shapes

689
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:06,237
and the colors merge
and yet stand out.

690
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:09,006
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

691
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,943
Your concept is so good
and so courageous

692
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:15,246
that I really want
to applaud you.

693
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,015
- How was the starfish done?
- Stella sculpted it

694
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,418
and then I piped
all the little dots on there.

695
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:22,453
It's a crazy amount
of work to try

696
00:36:22,488 --> 00:36:24,622
for one element of your makeup.

697
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:27,759
The detail on both
of these makeups is astounding.

698
00:36:27,793 --> 00:36:30,661
That's the kind of thing
we're looking for in a finale.

699
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:34,031
Thank you so much.

700
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,701
- Drew.
- These are the leaders

701
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:40,972
of two warring sects
of elfin cedar people.

702
00:36:41,006 --> 00:36:43,808
The guardians of life
protect the forest

703
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:46,177
from evil necromancers

704
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:48,079
who have embraced the power
of death.

705
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:51,015
So it's a constant battle
between life and death

706
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:53,217
trying to overtake one another.

707
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,655
These two work so well together.

708
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,290
They feel like they're
in the same world,

709
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:01,826
yet they are divided enough
in their aesthetic

710
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,261
to feel independent.

711
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,130
And the nuanced stag features,

712
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:08,900
- done so well.
- Thank you.

713
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:11,302
They very much feel
like they belong in a fantasy,

714
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:13,671
medieval world,
and that death knight,

715
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:16,841
you guys killed it.
That character's gorgeous.

716
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:20,478
Not just the sculpture,
but the paint job.

717
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,079
So well done.

718
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,116
Well, I think that
you've done exceptional work.

719
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,120
And they complement each other
superbly well.

720
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:31,455
- Thank you.
- All right, guys.

721
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,758
Could you please head backstage
while they deliberate

722
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:36,360
and decide who'll become
this season's champion.

723
00:37:46,905 --> 00:37:49,974
All right, judges. So we've
seen some great makeups tonight.

724
00:37:50,008 --> 00:37:53,644
And you definitely have a tough
decision ahead of you.

725
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,546
- Why don't we start with Cig?
- When you were watching

726
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:58,082
all of them fighting,
his death knight character

727
00:37:58,116 --> 00:37:59,851
- really stuck out.
- There was some really

728
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:02,320
beautiful sculpture work
in the death knight's face.

729
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:06,190
The paint work,
the multi layers of metallics,

730
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:08,326
was so beautiful.

731
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,761
I'm just not sure
about the good knight.

732
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:12,697
I think it had
some quality work,

733
00:38:12,731 --> 00:38:15,800
but I don't feel that
he really pushed the character.

734
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:18,102
We were clearly looking
for something more than just

735
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:20,304
a silicone sculpture face.

736
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,274
Well, I think that Cig's done
some remarkable work

737
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:24,876
throughout the series.

738
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,211
There was
the big fish character.

739
00:38:27,246 --> 00:38:30,047
There was the dark water
creepy clown.

740
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:31,415
That work was lovely.

741
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,252
His makeups have been
some of my favorites.

742
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:35,453
Let's move on to Dina.

743
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,421
It's quantity and quality.

744
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:40,524
It is a massive amount of work,

745
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,095
and every piece
is beautifully detailed.

746
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:46,197
Her death knight is gorgeous.

747
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:48,900
It looks like a finished,
ready for film makeup.

748
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:51,302
It didn't feel as if there
were three people

749
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:53,738
- working on an idea.
- Absolutely.

750
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:55,506
It was...
What's the Japanese phrase?

751
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,175
<i>Itai doshin--</i>
many in body, one in mind.

752
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,845
- It was that.
- But there's a disparity

753
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,380
in the different
design elements

754
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,282
- of the life knight.
- Yeah.

755
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:08,419
She has created some of
my favorite makeups on <i>Face Off.</i>

756
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:10,388
From the praying mantis

757
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:14,058
to the Greek goddess,
it's hit after hit.

758
00:39:14,092 --> 00:39:16,494
These are the types of designs
that get you jobs.

759
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,629
All right,
let's move on to Drew.

760
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:23,401
These two fulfill the fantasy
knight element the best.

761
00:39:23,435 --> 00:39:28,873
What a wonderful way to realize
that fawn-cedar-pan-like makeup.

762
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:31,676
They really were
the ying and the yang.

763
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,111
They belonged together
and they were opposite.

764
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:37,148
Both designs were simple
and elegant.

765
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:38,716
For example,
on the death knight,

766
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,319
the sculptural work
in the cheeks,

767
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:43,821
that was so well done,
when you scrutinize it up close.

768
00:39:43,855 --> 00:39:45,089
Beautiful. And actually,

769
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:48,292
I think the shape of the helm
was amazing.

770
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:51,128
But the hair on the face
takes it down a notch.

771
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:52,930
I completely agree, actually.

772
00:39:52,965 --> 00:39:56,334
He's done some amazing things
all season long.

773
00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:58,369
Incredibly realistic makeups.

774
00:39:58,403 --> 00:40:00,204
This is one of the toughest
neck-and-necks

775
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:01,739
that I've ever seen
on the show.

776
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:04,709
- This is really hard.
- It is.

777
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:07,378
Judges, have you decided who
will become our next champion?

778
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:09,780
We have, but it was not easy.

779
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:11,582
All right then,
let's bring them back out

780
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:13,484
and crown our winner.

781
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:19,123
All right, you guys, one of you
is about to become

782
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,859
the winner of<i> Face Off.</i>

783
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,498
Glenn, tell us about
tonight's makeups.

784
00:40:27,532 --> 00:40:32,103
Cig, we truly appreciate
the bold conceptual choices

785
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:33,671
that you made and the armor,

786
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:35,573
as well as the face,
of your death knight

787
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:37,575
were both fantastic sculptures.

788
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:41,145
Dina, the swing for the fences
volume of work

789
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:43,581
was only outshined
by your incredible detail

790
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:47,785
and your paint job,
particularly on the crab cowl.

791
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:51,589
Drew, your knights really
screamed fantasy to us

792
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:54,225
and we loved how harmonious
they were with one another,

793
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:56,861
both in terms of style
and palette.

794
00:40:56,895 --> 00:40:59,797
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner

795
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:01,065
of<i> Face Off?</i>

796
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:03,267
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

797
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:16,592
All right, Glenn,
who is the winner

798
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:17,860
of<i> Face Off?</i>

799
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:19,528
The winner of <i>Face Off</i> is...

800
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:27,336
Dina.

801
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:48,090
This is such
an amazing feeling.

802
00:41:48,124 --> 00:41:51,427
- I can't even describe it.
- You did it!

803
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:53,796
I took a huge risk coming here.

804
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:55,531
I quit my job.

805
00:41:55,565 --> 00:41:57,666
I came with very little
experience.

806
00:41:57,701 --> 00:42:00,836
And I made it to the finale
and I won.

807
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:04,173
It's mind-blowing.
I can't believe it.

808
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:09,378
Here are the keys
to your new car.

809
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:12,314
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God!

810
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:14,650
I can't be upset.
An amazing artist

811
00:42:14,684 --> 00:42:16,085
won<i> Face Off</i> season seven.

812
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,553
Just because it's not me

813
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:20,322
doesn't mean that
the right person didn't win.

814
00:42:20,357 --> 00:42:22,257
I'm proud of everything
that I've done here.

815
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:25,394
I had a blast doing it and
that's the biggest win for me.

816
00:42:25,428 --> 00:42:27,496
You haven't seen the last
of Cig Neutron.

817
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,732
Everybody, come on over
and congratulate her.

818
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:32,868
Family, come over.

819
00:42:32,902 --> 00:42:36,171
Winning <i>Face Off</i> is completely
gonna change my life.

820
00:42:36,206 --> 00:42:39,641
I get to do what I love now.
That's the grand prize.

821
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:43,045
I'll bake cakes once in a while,

822
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:46,749
but yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's out of my life for now.

823
00:42:46,783 --> 00:42:49,284
Thank you all at home
for watching us tonight.

824
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,788
Join us in January
as the next season of<i> Face Off</i>

825
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:56,091
kicks off with a big twist.
Good night.
