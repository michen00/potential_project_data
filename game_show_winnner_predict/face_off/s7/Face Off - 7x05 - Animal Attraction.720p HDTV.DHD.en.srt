1
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:02,487
It's quite awe-inspiring.

2
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:06,424
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

3
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,393
The 12 artists paired off

4
00:00:08,427 --> 00:00:11,763
and brought twisted trees
to life.

5
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:14,532
Jason's beautiful bark
gave him the victory,

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,468
but Vince's flawed concept
sent him home.

7
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,472
Now 11 artists remain,

8
00:00:21,507 --> 00:00:24,208
and tonight they'll spawn
an exotic mash-up.

9
00:00:24,243 --> 00:00:25,843
Why don't you follow me?

10
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,312
Oh, my God.
What is it?

11
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:29,047
But some can't handle
the pressure.

12
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:30,840
- This is dumb.
- That sucks.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,915
_

14
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:35,520
- It is exquisite.
- It's, sadly, a mess.

15
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:36,988
In the end, only one

16
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:39,490
will win a VIP trip
from Kryolan Professional Make-Up

17
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:42,460
to one of their
85 international locations,

18
00:00:42,494 --> 00:00:45,229
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

19
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:47,098
and $100,000.

20
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:51,302
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

22
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:33,044
Your beard takes a lot of work.

23
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:36,314
It does. To look this good,
it's a whole lot of grooming.

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,787
Sucked having
your partner go home.

25
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:44,655
I've been in the bottom
twice so far.

26
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,457
I feel like I haven't really
gotten a chance

27
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:47,925
to show
what I'm capable of doing.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,828
I got to redeem myself...
again.

29
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:52,296
You just have to keep pushing.

30
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:54,899
I definitely feel like it's
time to bring my "A" game.

31
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:01,205
We're gonna go
see some "aminals."

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,473
We're walking up,
and we see the sign

33
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:04,342
for the wildlife
learning center,

34
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:06,778
and I'm getting excited
'cause I love animals.

35
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:12,083
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

36
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:15,019
Welcome to the Wildlife
Learning Center in Los Angeles.

37
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:17,054
Now, this natural environment

38
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:19,590
is home to actually
70 exotic species

39
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,326
of rescued
and zoo-born wild animals.

40
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,262
But I do have a special
surprise for you today,

41
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,664
so why don't you follow me?

42
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:31,235
McKenzie leads us into
the Wildlife Learning Center.

43
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,670
Oh, my God, monkeys.

44
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:34,872
We're passing monkeys
and big cats.

45
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:35,940
Look.

46
00:02:35,974 --> 00:02:37,475
Mama, oh, you're--

47
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:39,277
- I have no idea
what's about to happen,

48
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:43,448
but I'm just hoping to pet
some furry things.

49
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:44,916
Well, this is Danielle.

50
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,519
She's one of the biologists here
at the Wildlife Learning Center.

51
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:50,788
So why don't you tell these guys
a little bit about the center

52
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:51,823
and its mission?

53
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:53,257
We are an animal sanctuary.

54
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,326
We provide homes to animals

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,861
that don't have
anywhere else to go.

56
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,930
So we do give them
a permanent home here.

57
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:01,632
All right, guys, well, as you
probably can guess by now,

58
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,402
the exotic animals here
at the wildlife learning center

59
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:07,572
are the basis for your next
spotlight challenge.

60
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,540
All right,
and who do we have here?

61
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:12,443
So this is Kingston.
He is a baby squirrel monkey.

62
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:13,878
So I'm actually
gonna hand that--

63
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:16,147
and then just hold it
just like that.

64
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,982
Perfect.

65
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:20,551
Danielle is pulling out
all these animals.

66
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:21,886
There's an armadillo.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,188
They can actually completely
close up into a ball.

68
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:25,456
- Wow.
- So scaly.

69
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,992
- There's a porcupine.
- Hey, little guy.

70
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:31,162
She actually has
30,000 quills underneath.

71
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:33,764
All these animals
are super adorable and awesome.

72
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,832
Whoa.

73
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,468
This is Delilah.
She is a red fox.

74
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:38,903
She is an omnivore.

75
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,205
So she'll go for almost
anything that she can find.

76
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,107
This is called a coatimundi.

77
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:45,042
They're found
in Central and South America,

78
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:46,878
and that is a tawny owl.

79
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:48,946
So they are found
in Europe and Asia.

80
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:51,449
Watch your face.

81
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:54,385
His eyes are, like,
staring into my soul,

82
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,922
and I realize
how awesome animals are.

83
00:03:57,956 --> 00:04:00,057
So,<i>Clash Of The Titans,</i>
<i>Sharktopus,</i>

84
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:03,528
and the Harry Potter films
feature unique animal hybrids,

85
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:04,795
where different animals

86
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,332
have been combined to create
an entirely new species.

87
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:12,103
Your spotlight challenge is
to choose two different animals

88
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,338
from the Wildlife
Learning Center

89
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:18,175
and mash them up to give life
to your very own hybrid species.

90
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,578
- Yes!
- Wow.

91
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:22,346
I'm gonna leave you here
to pick your animals

92
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:23,548
and work on your designs.

93
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:25,082
When you're done,
head back to the lab,

94
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,817
and I'll stop by later on
with my dad

95
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,352
to see how you're doing.

96
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:30,187
Okay, go.

97
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:39,330
Going with a bobcat owl.

98
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,698
These guys are awesome.

99
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:42,767
I definitely want to stray
away from any fur

100
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:44,602
or, like, muzzled creature.

101
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:45,603
All right.

102
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,204
I see that the armadillo

103
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:49,106
and also the alligator
is up for grabs,

104
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:51,409
and instantly
my brain's like, "armagator."

105
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:53,644
So after everybody
makes the selections,

106
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,146
we sit down
and sketch our designs.

107
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,681
- Did you do the same thing?
- Oh, my God.

108
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:59,050
- Oh, come on, dude.
- No way.

109
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:00,284
I see George.

110
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,387
He has the same
armadillo-and-alligator combo.

111
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:04,822
- Imagine that.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:07,725
So we're gonna conceptualize
close to each other

113
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,627
to make sure that we're not
doing the same thing.

114
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,462
I'm gonna make
an "armagator."

115
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:13,397
They're like super soldiers

116
00:05:13,432 --> 00:05:15,733
that utilize the armor
of the armadillo

117
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,669
and the ferocity
of the alligator.

118
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:21,772
He's good.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

119
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,779
I have to do a hybrid
of a bobcat and an owl,

120
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:31,215
which can easily be a Furby.

121
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,783
Look at him.
He's so cool.

122
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,852
Well, and their eyelids
have feathers on them too,

123
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:35,953
which is really cool.

124
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,356
I decide to make this
witch character

125
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,625
that wanted the nine lives
of a cat

126
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,627
and the flight of an owl.

127
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:47,798
I'm gonna do cat nose
and mouth with owl eyes

128
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,231
and then maybe the cat ears
as well.

129
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:56,741
I have the red tail hawk
and the fennec fox.

130
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,176
This is the beak of the hawk
and that kind of hawk brow

131
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:02,246
into these almost bat-like ears
that the fox has.

132
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,216
I'm trying to avoid making
a full set of wings

133
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,651
or having to lay too much fur.

134
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:08,486
Wings always come out
looking kind of haggard,

135
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,654
and judges hate fun fur.

136
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:10,821
Tell 'em about the fennec fox.

137
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:13,691
Their big ears
are their main characteristic

138
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,393
that makes them stand out
from other foxes.

139
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,528
I'm going to use the ears
of the fennec fox,

140
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,263
the coatimundi face,

141
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,198
and coatimundi tail and paws,

142
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:24,902
and I'm gonna try and bring in
the fennec fox's coloring.

143
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,106
Doing animal hybrids--
definitely a little scary.

144
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:32,076
There's always a risk
of going too goofy with it,

145
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,711
not going far enough.

146
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:36,147
I chose the eurasian lynx
and the kinkajou.

147
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:39,216
My concept
is an escaped experiment

148
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:41,852
from a biological-engineering
facility.

149
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,487
I want to do big eyes,

150
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:45,423
but then go
with the lynx coloring

151
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:47,692
and then take
the kinkajou's nose shape

152
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:51,162
and then incorporate maybe
some fangs with that as well.

153
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:54,065
I picked the coatimundi
and the tawny owl.

154
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,599
I'm gonna try to keep
the coatimundi nose

155
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:57,702
maybe with, like,
an under beak from the owl,

156
00:06:57,736 --> 00:06:59,437
and I really want to do
the big owl eyes.

157
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:00,638
I'm scaring myself,

158
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:02,440
because I think
I'm gonna have to do wings.

159
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:05,042
So I'm really trying to focus
on my design work

160
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:07,712
and make sure this animal
is going to look like an animal

161
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:10,548
and not just a person
in a furry costume.

162
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:12,650
Hey, guys,
let's get back to the lab.

163
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:20,291
Whoo!

164
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,026
We have 5 1/2 hours in the lab,

165
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,731
and everyone
starts sculpting immediately.

166
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:31,068
I have the serval wildcat
and the kinkajou.

167
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:34,672
The concept is that these
two animals are scavengers,

168
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,941
and through the process
of evolution,

169
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,677
they become one animal.

170
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,645
I'm trying
to put the cat nose in

171
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,381
and then the head shape
of the kinkajou,

172
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,317
which is really, really round,

173
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:48,552
so this should be interesting.

174
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:55,493
- "Armagator."
- "Allidillo."

175
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:56,894
- "Armagator."
- "Allidillo."

176
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,363
I'm doing an allidillo,
which is an armadillo,

177
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:00,664
plus the alligator.

178
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,133
I want to do a quadruped,

179
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:06,370
so I sculpt the top of the head
on the back of the model's head

180
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,240
and then the lower jaw
over the model's face.

181
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:10,775
I'm taking a huge risk,

182
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:13,878
and if it doesn't work out,
it could be my ass on the line.

183
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:17,414
♪ Nothing is greater
than sculpts of a gator ♪

184
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:23,788
- What'd you get, Dina?
- Prairie dog and fox.

185
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:25,022
Oh, that sounds cute.

186
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,625
My red fox and prairie dog
are both diggers,

187
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,895
so I decide this animal
is basically a miner.

188
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:33,297
For the face, I'm gonna use
the prairie dog,

189
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:34,732
and I want to give him
the red fur

190
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,901
and the pointed ears
from the fox.

191
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:40,237
I'm pretty nervous
about doing a fur suit,

192
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:42,273
but, you know, I'm gonna try.

193
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:44,742
These prairie dogs...

194
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:47,044
they're so goofy.

195
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:49,113
Hey, guys, we're here
to check on your work.

196
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:50,414
- Hi.
- How are you?

197
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,249
All right,
so you have the bald eagle

198
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:53,317
and a squirrel monkey?

199
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,319
Something in flying monkey.

200
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:57,721
We'll put the eagle talons
down at his feet,

201
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:58,956
we'll give him
the monkey hands.

202
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,624
Maybe he has,
like, a bomber-type jacket.

203
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,494
I like what you've done with
your nose here and the muzzle.

204
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:04,762
It's very simian,
which is great.

205
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,263
All right.

206
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:10,267
So I'm using the overall body
shape of the squirrel monkey,

207
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:11,702
and I picked the red fox

208
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:14,538
specifically so that I could use
his fur patterning and color.

209
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:17,041
I come up with this idea
that if a monkey

210
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,810
and a fox were to come together,
they would be a perfect beast

211
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:23,180
that has the quick hands
of a monkey

212
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:25,316
and the sly cleverness
of a fox.

213
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,586
The monkeys do have a round
head, but the foxes don't.

214
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,754
The fox is a straight back
that comes through it.

215
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:32,556
- Yeah.
- You might even take this out.

216
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:33,858
- I like that idea a lot.
- Good.

217
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:36,727
I chose a coatimundi
and a fennec fox.

218
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:39,463
He's looking very foxy,
to where you're not gonna

219
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,532
really see the blend
of the two together.

220
00:09:41,566 --> 00:09:43,834
The nose is very distinctive,

221
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,736
and don't be afraid
of bringing that out.

222
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,904
Okay.

223
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:48,505
The top half is on the back
of the head,

224
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,507
and the lower jaw
is covering the face,

225
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,810
so it's gonna look
like he's opening his mouth up.

226
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:55,813
To me, it looks more like
a prop than it does a makeup.

227
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,015
The anatomy
on both of these animals

228
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:00,417
is so much different
than human anatomy.

229
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,986
You're taking a big risk,

230
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,222
but it's a beautiful undertaking
you're doing, so good luck.

231
00:10:05,257 --> 00:10:06,590
Yeah, thank you.

232
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:10,661
I'm having difficulties
with this model's face,

233
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,963
trying to fit it
under animal features.

234
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:14,999
You have to think
more into the nose.

235
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,735
The nose is wrong.

236
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,771
There is more detail

237
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,940
that comes around
through the nostrils.

238
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:25,376
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- You're just missing it here.

239
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,777
I don't understand

240
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:29,179
why I'm having
such a hard time with this,

241
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,482
and now I need
to resculpt the nose

242
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:33,550
and bring it further
out of the face.

243
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:35,853
That is not good.

244
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,187
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

245
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:39,857
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

246
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:44,261
Even as I'm trying
Mr. Westmore's advice,

247
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:45,596
it still looks stupid to me.

248
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,997
This is dumb.

249
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:48,299
I don't like this at all.

250
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,466
I'm not happy with it.

251
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:51,335
Ugh.

252
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:53,037
I just feel really lost...

253
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:57,474
and I don't know how I'm gonna
get through this challenge.

254
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,311
Ugh.

255
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:01,490
Coming up....

256
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:03,200
If it works it'll be
a fucking miracle.

257
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:04,782
I don't know
if this is gonna work or not.

258
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:05,849
This sucks.

259
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:07,451
My makeup
could be a catastrophe.

260
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,619
This is unacceptable.

261
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:09,820
I think it's amazing.

262
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:12,456
I don't think it works.

263
00:11:17,447 --> 00:11:19,148
I'm really lost.

264
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:21,750
I'm trying fit the features
of the kinkajou

265
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:24,586
and the wildcat together,
and I can't figure it out.

266
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:25,587
Ugh.

267
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:26,989
I hate what I've sculpted.

268
00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:29,625
I really have to, like, settle
on a shape of this face...

269
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,860
If I spend any more time
resculpting this,

270
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:33,295
I'm not gonna get
anything else done.

271
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,498
I can't do this anymore.

272
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,770
As I'm sculpting the face,
I'm really liking this.

273
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:43,071
Like, this is the first time

274
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:45,474
I actually got to do some kind
of creature-esque thing,

275
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,409
and I really like how it looks.

276
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:49,645
So I'm going to get it molded.

277
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,255
The kinkajou have
these really big, goofy eyes.

278
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,692
So I use plastic vacuform domes

279
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:06,395
to create the kinkajou
eye shape,

280
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,230
and then I cut them out

281
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:10,666
and incorporate them
into my sculpture.

282
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,403
I feel good about the direction
I've taken with my concept.

283
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,690
_

284
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:21,310
I'm molding the face,

285
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,745
which I'm hoping
to get ready for foam latex,

286
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,014
but it's taken a lot longer
than I thought it would,

287
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,116
and I'm cutting it down
to the wire,

288
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,152
but if you try and pull
a mold open to early,

289
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:32,321
you run the risk of cracking
the mold right down the center.

290
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:34,022
How much we got left?

291
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,559
11 minutes.

292
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,796
So I decide it is not
worth the risk

293
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,633
of trying to open too early
and not have a piece.

294
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,237
Time is up.

295
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,439
Ooh.

296
00:12:50,473 --> 00:12:51,807
That sucks.

297
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,009
It's upsetting that I have
to eat it for the day

298
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:55,844
and open it tomorrow.

299
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:57,713
So I'm extremely worried
at this point,

300
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,915
because I'm gonna be behind
for day two.

301
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,890
Aah!

302
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:11,059
It's day two
of the animal-hybrid challenge,

303
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,061
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab.

304
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:17,299
So I have resculpted this face,

305
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,701
and I'm still not happy
with it.

306
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:24,506
So I decide that since I hate
it so much, just get rid of it.

307
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,874
Just, no.

308
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,777
'Cause I rip off the entire
bottom half the face,

309
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,679
I'm going to sculpt it again.

310
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:33,148
I'm trying so hard
to figure out

311
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:35,684
how to put these features
on this man's face,

312
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:39,621
but I'm so behind, and it's
getting really frustrating.

313
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,061
I know I've lost a lot of time
on day one,

314
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:49,865
so I've got to get
the cowl done insanely fast.

315
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:52,067
I'm coming off
of being in top looks.

316
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:54,336
So this time, I want to win.

317
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,112
I need to get my face
finished and just start molding.

318
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,148
It's kind of a risk
to sculpt feathers,

319
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,983
because they're not gonna move
like feathers.

320
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:09,518
They're gonna be foam,

321
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,353
but I have a strong feeling
about this,

322
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:13,188
so I'm gonna take the chance.

323
00:14:13,222 --> 00:14:16,391
That's one nifty-looking owl.

324
00:14:16,426 --> 00:14:19,227
I sculpt the cat nose again.

325
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:22,464
I've got the wildcat eyes
and the nose.

326
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:25,701
The tip of the nose
that I sculpt is the kinkajou.

327
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,102
I don't know
if it's a good idea,

328
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:29,438
but I don't have any choice
at this point,

329
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:30,939
I just have to keep going.

330
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,575
Hopefully, the extra time
I'm taking on this sculpture

331
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:35,243
will pay off.

332
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:41,516
I need to get the cowl sculpt
finished as fast as I can.

333
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,452
The top half of the sculpt,
where the plates are,

334
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:44,853
is much more armadillo,

335
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,755
but I decide to go with gator,

336
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:49,691
like, scale-type patterns
on the gullet and the neck area.

337
00:14:49,726 --> 00:14:50,926
I'm having a blast.

338
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,971
This is a challenge
that I was waiting for.

339
00:14:54,797 --> 00:14:56,598
Since I waited till today

340
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,667
to get my fun fur
from the wardrobe room,

341
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,269
there is only
white fun fur left.

342
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:05,073
So this sucks,
because my fox is red,

343
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,442
and I know there's
a really awesome red fur

344
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,478
that Drew is using.

345
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:11,313
I feel bad
I used all this fur, but--

346
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,481
It's all right.

347
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,049
So I'm layering up
this white fun fur

348
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,484
with several different colors.

349
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:17,786
I'm going in with yellows
and browns and reds,

350
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,689
and I'm really trying to capture
that red-fox color.

351
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,592
_

352
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:23,813
_

353
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:24,515
_

354
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:25,158
_

355
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,062
I'm still worried about how I'm
gonna bring it into the cowl,

356
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:30,132
but I'm happy with the way
it's looking.

357
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:36,671
It's time to start working
on this fur/feather body suit.

358
00:15:36,706 --> 00:15:37,906
And what I'm gonna be doing

359
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,308
is barge-cementing
all these feathers

360
00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:42,878
and all this fur
to a spandex suit.

361
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,146
I'm really intimidated working

362
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,214
with both of these materials
for the first time,

363
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,550
but I'm really liking the way
it's coming along now,

364
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:52,654
and I'm feeling a lot
more confident in my work.

365
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:57,692
I need to make this body suit
now that all my molds are done.

366
00:15:57,727 --> 00:16:01,930
And I can cut this L200 foam
to get what I need.

367
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:03,298
L200's really nice stuff.

368
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:06,735
It'll stick together
in a pattern that is really nice

369
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:10,071
for doing scales
or hard-edged creatures,

370
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:12,674
and once I get the suit
to a point that I'm happy with,

371
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,777
I get it painted,
and I have to put it on--

372
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:18,547
part for fun and part
just to make sure that it works.

373
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,051
I can't see it,
'cause it's on the back of me,

374
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:26,421
but from what people tell me,
it seems to be pretty good.

375
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:29,024
Yeah, it's fun.

376
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,828
I have the cowl sculpt
completed,

377
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,296
so it's time to mold it.

378
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,164
It's gonna take me
quite a bit of time,

379
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:39,501
so I decide that I'm going
to make a hydrocal mold.

380
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:42,537
Hydrocal sets really fast,
but I've never done it before.

381
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:44,239
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

382
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:45,740
When you do
these hydrocal molds,

383
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,109
do you just make them extra,
extra thick on the outside?

384
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:49,911
You're supposed
to do hydrocal in one batch

385
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:53,315
- because it can delaminate.
- Oh, brother.

386
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:55,650
I start panicking
because I've already used

387
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:58,186
about three different batches.

388
00:16:58,221 --> 00:16:59,955
So now it might delaminate,

389
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:02,357
which is when the layers
of stone just come apart.

390
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,292
And this is already set
back here.

391
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:05,594
This is fucked.

392
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:06,862
This could be really bad,

393
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:08,597
and there's just no way
of knowing

394
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,232
if this is gonna work or not.

395
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,804
_

396
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:20,477
It's day two
of our animal-hybrid challenge,

397
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:23,447
and on this particular mold,
I'm doing hydrocal

398
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,349
because it sets much faster
than ultracal does.

399
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:28,552
This is fucked.

400
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:31,154
If my cowl mold falls to pieces

401
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:33,723
because I did
some silly molding technique

402
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:37,160
that I've never done before,
it will be a disaster.

403
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:39,754
If it works it'll be
a fucking miracle.

404
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:48,104
Now that I have my mold done,

405
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,073
I'm doing a little bit
of fabrication.

406
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:52,709
The kinkajou
has these really long fingers

407
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:54,478
that they use to climb trees,

408
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,147
so I take these rods
made from L200,

409
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,649
and I melt them
and form them into shape.

410
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:04,454
And then I want to paint
the kinkajou eye

411
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,389
to look like the lynx eye.

412
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:08,558
So I take the domes

413
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:11,995
and airbrush paint
on the inside.

414
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,964
I test them for a while.
They look pretty cool.

415
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:18,902
But it all comes down to how
all the pieces fit together.

416
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:20,937
All right.

417
00:18:20,972 --> 00:18:22,506
I go back to pop the mold open,

418
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,310
hoping it won't break in half
or into a million pieces.

419
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:29,613
I'm worried
I completely ruined this mold,

420
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,948
and because of that,
the sculpt is ruined as well.

421
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:34,029
_

422
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:42,225
All the stone seems pretty hard,
nothing breaks,

423
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,560
nothing falls apart.

424
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:45,228
Whew.

425
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:48,331
So it seems
like I'm gonna be okay.

426
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,337
It's almost the end of day two,

427
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,907
and I've only got one
of my legs finished.

428
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,209
It's one of those things where
you're just rushing so fast,

429
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:02,612
and there's not enough time.

430
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:06,149
All right, guys, that's it.
Time's up.

431
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,717
Now I have to run
the second leg

432
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:09,185
on application day.

433
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,688
I won't get to spend
as much time as I want painting

434
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:13,390
and getting everything
to look right.

435
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,191
This makeup
could be a disaster.

436
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:27,437
It's application day.

437
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,873
We have four hours in the lab
and one hour in last looks.

438
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,975
I get the foam piece,
and it looks great,

439
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,209
but it's a little heavy,

440
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:35,545
so I have to hog out a lot
of the foam

441
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,917
so that the actor isn't crushed
by 20 pounds of foam latex.

442
00:19:40,952 --> 00:19:43,853
I'm getting excited, and I can't
wait to get the face on.

443
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:55,198
- Hey. I'm Sasha.
- Hi.

444
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,067
- Good to see you. I'm good.
- How are you?

445
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,369
Hi.

446
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:02,038
Oh, my God.

447
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:04,674
My biggest concern
for application day

448
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,243
is that I have to get
the second leg poly-foamed

449
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,079
because I didn't get it done
on day two.

450
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:11,982
So I get everything ready to go,
pour the foam in.

451
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:14,317
I turn it upright
and let it sit,

452
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,386
and in the meantime,
I'm gonna meet my model,

453
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,455
check in on my cowl,
check the face.

454
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,556
It's a lot to do,

455
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,125
and time is just
tick, tick, ticking away.

456
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,267
It's weird
that Telesis hurts your skin.

457
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:32,302
Yeah.

458
00:20:32,336 --> 00:20:34,804
My model is allergic
to Telesis--

459
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,140
the preferred glue
for something like this.

460
00:20:37,174 --> 00:20:39,843
So I have to use another glue
called Pros-Aide,

461
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,745
which isn't quite as sticky,

462
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:43,947
and if he sweats,
it's gonna fall off.

463
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:47,183
So I'm definitely worried.

464
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:50,987
I get my suit off the mannequin

465
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:52,155
and get it on my model.

466
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:54,124
- Hey, it fits. Cool.
- Sweet.

467
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:56,092
It looks really,
really good on her.

468
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:57,594
She has a dancing background,

469
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:00,697
so she's doing lots of really
elegant modeling movements.

470
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:03,066
I'm really, really pleased
with the way it came out.

471
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,269
Go like this.
Cool.

472
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:10,140
Keep your eyes closed.

473
00:21:14,145 --> 00:21:15,945
Okay, cool.
There's the belly.

474
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,947
Yay!
I love your belly. Okay.

475
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:21,117
I pull the shirt on,
and it looks really awesome.

476
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:23,620
I'm gonna have you put
brown leggings on.

477
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:26,890
But I don't really have feet
for her.

478
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:29,959
I just have leggings.

479
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:32,362
This could mean
that I didn't do enough.

480
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:36,299
Now I'm worried, because
you can make a small mistake,

481
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,069
and it can just send you home.

482
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:48,712
The color scheme I'm going for
is actually the eurasian lynx.

483
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:53,216
Their fur is generally white
with black and browns.

484
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,886
It's definitely hard to make
foam latex look like fur,

485
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:00,223
so I'm hoping that I can blend
the colors from my face

486
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:02,125
into the fur itself.

487
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,027
It's pretty much
a head-to-toe creature,

488
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:06,396
and it's a lot to paint,
and so I want to make sure

489
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,565
that all of those details
are added in.

490
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,700
I'll darken that up.

491
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:13,403
Ten minutes.

492
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,746
I'm gonna put your shirt on.

493
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,148
I put the shirt
on that I made for him.

494
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:28,017
Yeah, it doesn't match your skin
at all, lovely.

495
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,385
The problem is,

496
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,588
is that I didn't really think
about the paint job,

497
00:22:31,622 --> 00:22:35,592
and the flesh tone doesn't match
the flesh tone of the shirt.

498
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:38,461
All right, guys, that's time!

499
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:43,466
Oh, crap.
What am I gonna do?

500
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:48,772
I'm panicking at this point,

501
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:50,340
because I only have an hour,

502
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:53,143
and I don't think
I'm going to be able to fix it.

503
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:57,647
Coming up...

504
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:59,816
In addition to everything
that I still have to do,

505
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,351
my model's face is falling off.

506
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:03,486
I run out of airbrush color.

507
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,255
I cannot finish his face.

508
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,790
This really works for me.

509
00:23:06,824 --> 00:23:09,692
It sadly turned out
to be a mess.

510
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:21,578
Oh, there you are.
Hey.

511
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,270
_

512
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,014
- Can I steal your gaff tape?
- Yeah, go for it.

513
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,150
We get to last looks,
and I've got one hour left.

514
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:29,919
In addition to everything
that I still have to do,

515
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:31,588
my model's face is falling off.

516
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:35,358
So we're gaff-taping
this back on.

517
00:23:35,392 --> 00:23:37,293
I still need to, like, wrap
them and everything.

518
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:39,295
I need to get her hands done.

519
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,131
I attach the fingers using tape,
cotton, and latex.

520
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,435
It's a down-and-dirty technique,
but they won't fall off.

521
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:46,769
Does it feel
like it's sticking?

522
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:49,606
- Yeah.
- That's 30 minutes, everyone!

523
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:55,778
I run out of my brown
airbrush color.

524
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:58,047
I can't finish painting
his face,

525
00:23:58,082 --> 00:23:59,682
so I move on to hair work.

526
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:00,884
I'm very worried at this point.

527
00:24:00,918 --> 00:24:03,186
I just want to get
out of here alive.

528
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:09,792
That's time, guys!

529
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:12,595
Time's up,
and I'm extremely worried.

530
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,430
My character is covered in fur,

531
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,532
and I don't have a lot
of makeup showing.

532
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,401
Freaking me out.

533
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,313
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

534
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:33,750
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

535
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:36,019
Let's say hello
to our talented judges.

536
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:39,055
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

537
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:41,257
- Good evening, guys.
- Good evening.

538
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,960
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

539
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:46,329
- Hello, chaps.
- Hi, Lois.

540
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:48,998
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

541
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:50,700
- Hi.
- Hi, Neville.

542
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:52,602
This week
your spotlight challenge

543
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:55,071
was to choose
two exotic animals,

544
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:58,775
mash them up, and give life
to an entirely new species.

545
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:01,010
So let's take a look
at your creations.

546
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:23,933
He has the color.
He has the body.

547
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,203
He looks exactly
like a fox monkey.

548
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:45,321
I think my makeup
is too cartoony

549
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:47,190
for this animal-hybrid
challenge,

550
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:49,859
but hopefully
I'm not on bottom looks.

551
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:08,745
The eyes are definitely

552
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,613
the most prominent thing
about my makeup.

553
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:13,549
Whether that's gonna help me
or hinder me, I'm not so sure.

554
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,335
I love it. It looks exactly
like what I wanted,

555
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:37,306
and he definitely has a presence
and looks really imposing.

556
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,190
She looks really elegant

557
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,259
but also
very animalistic onstage.

558
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:59,128
I'm really hoping
that the judges like it.

559
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:15,611
I know that it's not
my best work.

560
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:17,613
There is a risk
that his entire face

561
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:20,116
could fall off
and go plop on the stage.

562
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:38,901
I really did
an awesome sculpture,

563
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:41,904
but those leggings--
I can't even look.

564
00:27:58,021 --> 00:27:59,422
The face--
it looks pretty good.

565
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:01,491
The paint's still not
what I want it to be.

566
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:04,627
I'm kind of really not sure
where I stand.

567
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,843
I'm so embarrassed.

568
00:28:20,878 --> 00:28:22,945
I'm trying to make peace
with the fact

569
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,715
that I might be going
home today.

570
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:46,068
The tail's not finished.
The feet look kind of janky.

571
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:48,571
It's not a polished piece,
by any means.

572
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:06,189
I'm not in love
with this makeup.

573
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:08,291
I would hate to go home
for something

574
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:10,293
that I'm not really proud of.

575
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,600
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

576
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:18,968
at our brand-new animals?

577
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:26,209
There's some
really beautiful forms

578
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:28,077
- happening throughout there.
- Yeah.

579
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:33,749
These giant bubble gum balls
over the eyes--

580
00:29:33,784 --> 00:29:35,051
it just never works.

581
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:37,987
It is the opposite
of painted beautifully.

582
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,225
I really like the way

583
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:44,560
that the main shapes

584
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:46,929
come from this
really large head.

585
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:49,465
It's got a nice prompt tissue
of an alligator.

586
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,834
These secondary shapes
are really nice too.

587
00:29:55,906 --> 00:29:58,407
Look how this blends in.
I love that.

588
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:02,545
The dead, soulless gaze
of just colored orbs--

589
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:04,447
it's not so distracting to me here.

590
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:09,185
Way too big of an idea.

591
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,420
I appreciate swinging
for the fences,

592
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,289
but just no time for painting.

593
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:15,825
There's glue
all around the eye.

594
00:30:17,894 --> 00:30:20,329
A huge amount of sculpture
to attempt.

595
00:30:20,364 --> 00:30:22,164
And the other thing
she's done so well

596
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:24,267
is combine
the owl and pussycat.

597
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:29,605
There's a shocking lack of form

598
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,407
all down the side of the face.

599
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,675
Oh, it's insane.

600
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:35,911
I know I'm going
to be on the bottom.

601
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:37,446
It's not a good makeup.

602
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:40,149
I can't watch this.

603
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:44,987
We want to know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

604
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:47,957
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

605
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:52,294
- These hard ridges?
- Oh, it's insane.

606
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:53,796
I'm so embarrassed.

607
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:56,465
I know I'm in trouble.
It's just bad.

608
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:00,903
It looks like he's just
got stitched up

609
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:03,639
in one problem after the other,
and none of them got resolved.

610
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:13,149
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

611
00:31:13,183 --> 00:31:15,551
Sasha...

612
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:17,653
Keaghlan...

613
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,822
Damien...

614
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:21,824
Doc...

615
00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:23,993
Stella...

616
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:26,762
Cig...

617
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,798
you were the best
and the worst this week.

618
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:33,169
The rest of you are safe and can
head back to the makeup room.

619
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:40,309
All right, the judges would
like to speak with each of you

620
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:42,144
to learn more about your work.

621
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,881
Sasha, you're up first.

622
00:31:52,022 --> 00:31:55,257
Tell us about your approach
to combining these two animals.

623
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:58,394
Well, she is a bobcat
and a tawny owl.

624
00:31:58,428 --> 00:31:59,762
She was this witch,

625
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:02,364
and she wanted to have
the nine lives of a cat

626
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,467
and the power of flight.

627
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:08,337
How do you feel you did in
terms of your success this week?

628
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:11,907
I don't really like what I did.

629
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:15,177
The leggings are pretty bad.

630
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,446
Do you know
what I think it lacks most?

631
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:19,682
Your confidence.

632
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:21,484
I think it's amazing.

633
00:32:21,518 --> 00:32:25,588
You had phenomenal control
over color placement.

634
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:27,790
There's a lot
of great decision making,

635
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:31,026
supported by a lot
of amazing artistic skill.

636
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:32,461
Thank you.

637
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:35,531
You looked so worried when you
were saying about the leggings.

638
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:38,968
What I thought was,
"She used her time wisely,

639
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,003
and the eye goes
to where it counts."

640
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:43,739
- So, well done.
- Thank you.

641
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:45,474
What's extremely impressive

642
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:47,943
is the sculpting
of the feather work.

643
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:49,812
It works very, very well.

644
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:52,581
Thank you so much.

645
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:56,619
- Sasha, you can step back.
- Thank you.

646
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:02,258
Keaghlan, you're next.

647
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,265
Tell us about your character.

648
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:13,936
My character is
a eurasian lynx and a kinkajou.

649
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,139
She is a experimental animal

650
00:33:17,173 --> 00:33:19,875
from a bio-engineering lab.

651
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,645
I don't think the paint works.

652
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:26,982
The color is flawed.

653
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:31,353
That's the major reason
why I don't like this makeup.

654
00:33:31,388 --> 00:33:33,155
I do really like
the facial forms,

655
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:35,991
but the lack of detail
in both texture

656
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:39,461
and especially the paint
is a failure.

657
00:33:39,496 --> 00:33:41,664
For me, it's lack of realism.

658
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:45,100
It's inappropriately cartoony
for this challenge.

659
00:33:45,135 --> 00:33:48,370
I agree.

660
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,205
Keaghlan, you can head back.

661
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,048
Damien, please step up.

662
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:08,424
Tell us about your hybrid
and the "consequenting" design.

663
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,725
My two animals

664
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,927
were the tawny owl
and the coatimundi.

665
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,229
I wanted to incorporate
the big owl eyes,

666
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:15,864
as well as the tiny sharp beak.

667
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,001
This really works very well
for me.

668
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:22,237
You have balanced a design
head to toe

669
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:24,907
in shape, form, palette.

670
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:26,875
You've really showcased
what you're about.

671
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,611
Thank you so much.

672
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:30,646
Is that the first time
you've done something like that?

673
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,482
Yeah, it's the first time
I've ever done fur or feathers.

674
00:34:33,516 --> 00:34:34,984
It is exquisite.

675
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:36,952
Thank you so much.

676
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,988
I like the way
that there are feathers

677
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:40,723
introduced into the fur.

678
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:44,193
The feather transition
on the arm is a lovely touch.

679
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:46,662
- So, well done.
- Thank you so much.

680
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:48,831
Damien, you can head back.
Thank you.

681
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:51,533
Awesome.

682
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:58,407
Doc, you're next.

683
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:00,109
Please step forward.

684
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,518
Tell me how your animals
inspired this makeup design.

685
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:12,688
Well, I got the bald eagle
and the squirrel monkey.

686
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:15,958
I wanted to create
a flying monkey.

687
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:17,059
It's a good idea,

688
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:21,730
but it is
a completely illegible concept.

689
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:23,332
How do you feel
about your work this week?

690
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:24,466
Awful.

691
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,068
I don't know.
I just lost it.

692
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:28,737
It's very refreshing to see
that you have the perspective

693
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:30,973
to go, "This is not
what I wanted to do,"

694
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:33,008
instead of defending it.

695
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:36,211
The shape of the face
could be there.

696
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:40,149
It sadly turned out
to be a mess.

697
00:35:40,183 --> 00:35:42,217
The paint is so muddy.

698
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:44,720
The foundation's there
but none of the finish.

699
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:46,422
It's a little heartbreaking.
Sorry, man.

700
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,792
Doc, would you please
step back?

701
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,500
Stella, please come forward.

702
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:06,241
Tell us about your
two animals, please.

703
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:10,079
I chose the kinkajou
and the serval wildcat.

704
00:36:10,113 --> 00:36:11,714
These two creatures

705
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:14,149
became scavengers together
and evolved,

706
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:15,884
taking on
each other's features.

707
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:19,354
But I definitely felt lost
during the whole challenge.

708
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:21,190
It's interesting
you would say that,

709
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:25,294
because I don't think it works.

710
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:29,431
My feeling is, you didn't work
to your strengths,

711
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,800
which is choice of colors

712
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:36,138
and the application
of the paint.

713
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:40,175
This is completely devoid
of anatomical sensibility,

714
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,677
particularly in the face.

715
00:36:41,711 --> 00:36:45,581
I don't even see the two animals
represented here.

716
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:48,951
This is an unacceptable makeup.

717
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:51,019
Stella, please step down.

718
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:53,116
Thank you.

719
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:59,762
Cig, please come forward.

720
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:07,803
Tell us about the two animals
that inspired this concept.

721
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:10,072
I got the armadillo
and the alligator,

722
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:11,507
so I made an "armagator."

723
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:14,176
They're experimental,
amphibious infantry units.

724
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,580
There are some really,
really beautiful forms.

725
00:37:18,615 --> 00:37:22,284
Around the jawline, his mouth,
and the gullet,

726
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:26,121
those three areas
are beautifully handled as form.

727
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:28,257
It reminds me
of some of the choices

728
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,992
that Cannom made with Dracula.

729
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:32,795
See the really big shoulders
and the bigger head,

730
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,797
and then is comes down
to these bunched claws.

731
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:37,232
- I think that's awesome.
- Awesome.

732
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,369
- Cig, you can step down.
- Thanks.

733
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:46,975
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

734
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,111
If you would please head back
to the makeup room

735
00:37:49,145 --> 00:37:51,513
while they deliberate.

736
00:37:53,016 --> 00:37:54,783
All right, judges,
let's start with the looks

737
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:55,784
you liked the most.

738
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:56,952
Why don't we start with Sasha?

739
00:37:56,986 --> 00:37:59,321
It's so clearly cat
in the lips,

740
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:01,356
and I think that was
the right place do that.

741
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:04,259
And she nailed the challenge.
It was the best hybridization.

742
00:38:04,294 --> 00:38:07,429
She's got the eye
and the ability.

743
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,765
It's her confidence
that needs to be worked on.

744
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,533
All right,
let's move on to Damien.

745
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:13,535
I loved the character.

746
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,839
You would swear
that he has a lot of experience

747
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,408
making feather/fur costumes.

748
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:20,642
It's his first time.

749
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:22,978
When he put the feathers
all around the face

750
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:24,446
and dropped really light colors

751
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,281
on top of those feathers
to break them up,

752
00:38:26,316 --> 00:38:28,884
that's complex,
artistic decision making.

753
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:30,552
All right,
let's move on to Cig.

754
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:33,655
It's really got
some gorgeous forms.

755
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,892
I absolutely love the profile
and the straight-on silhouette.

756
00:38:36,926 --> 00:38:39,428
The throat round here--
I mean, all those things,

757
00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:41,663
the component parts
were so good.

758
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:43,232
All right, judges,

759
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:44,900
let's move on to the looks
you liked the least tonight.

760
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,602
Why don't we start
with Keaghlan?

761
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:49,705
It's so cartoony,
and it's so stuffed animal.

762
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:53,075
I liked the overall sculpt,
just the blocking in,

763
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:55,510
but the paint
was so amateurish.

764
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:57,512
All right,
let's move on to Doc.

765
00:38:57,547 --> 00:39:01,149
The paint job
has no definition.

766
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:02,784
There was no dimension to it.

767
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:05,254
The form--
there was promise there,

768
00:39:05,288 --> 00:39:07,389
but every decision
was dreadful.

769
00:39:07,423 --> 00:39:09,491
All right,
let's move on to Stella.

770
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:13,195
It feels like a solid idea
for a paint job

771
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:14,930
was completely given up on.

772
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:18,267
I neither saw the kinkajou
nor the wildcat.

773
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:21,336
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

774
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:22,838
Yeah, we have.

775
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:25,073
Let's bring them back out.

776
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:34,983
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

777
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:38,387
Sasha, your character's head
was a true standout,

778
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:41,156
and you nailed the hybridization
of your two animals.

779
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,459
Damien, you made
some great choices,

780
00:39:44,494 --> 00:39:47,329
and we really appreciated
that you moved so far

781
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:48,864
out of your comfort zone.

782
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:52,634
Cig, there's some beautiful
forms in your sculpture,

783
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:54,503
particularly in profile,

784
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:56,538
and it really captured
the shapes

785
00:39:56,572 --> 00:39:57,973
from both of your animals.

786
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:00,342
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

787
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:02,744
Tonight's winner is...

788
00:40:07,557 --> 00:40:09,524
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

789
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,027
Tonight's winner is...

790
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:16,898
Damien.

791
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:22,037
You gave us a great makeup,
great fabrication,

792
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:25,207
and, more importantly, we felt
like for the first time,

793
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,475
your true talents
were on display tonight.

794
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,311
Me too.

795
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,112
This is my first win so far
in the competition.

796
00:40:31,147 --> 00:40:32,380
It feels very much

797
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:34,216
like a weight has been lifted
off my shoulders,

798
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,685
and I don't need to worry
as much from now on.

799
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,186
It's so exciting.

800
00:40:38,221 --> 00:40:39,654
Damien, congratulations.

801
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:43,491
You, Sasha, and Cig can head
back to the makeup room.

802
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:44,475
Thanks.

803
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,387
Thank you.

804
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:53,835
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

805
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,503
are in the bottom this week,

806
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:58,039
and one of you
will be eliminated.

807
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:59,507
Please step forward, guys.

808
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:10,352
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom looks.

809
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:12,187
Keaghlan,
we thought your makeup

810
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:13,989
was pretty rough
around the edges,

811
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:16,391
and its cartoonish styling

812
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:18,860
just made it a mismatch
for this challenge.

813
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:23,331
Doc, we did not see your concept
in the final product,

814
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:25,700
and the execution
of the painting and sculpting

815
00:41:25,735 --> 00:41:27,369
was quite poor.

816
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:30,872
Stella, you admitted that you
got lost during this challenge,

817
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:31,873
and it showed.

818
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,441
We had a really hard time

819
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:36,645
finding evidence of your two
animals in your makeup.

820
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,446
So who is going home tonight?

821
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:41,082
The person
going home tonight is...

822
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:48,223
Doc.

823
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:52,294
It is crystal clear that nothing
went your way this week,

824
00:41:52,328 --> 00:41:54,696
but it's great
that you're hyper-aware

825
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,299
of the problems
with your makeup.

826
00:41:57,333 --> 00:42:01,202
Doc, I am so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

827
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:03,738
That means,
Stella and Keaghlan,

828
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:05,874
you're both safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

829
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:08,009
- Have fun, guys.
- I'm sorry.

830
00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:10,211
It's okay.

831
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:16,384
Doc, you have talent.
You have passion.

832
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:18,787
So the only thing you're
lacking right now is experience,

833
00:42:18,821 --> 00:42:20,055
and that's great news.

834
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:23,024
- Don't let this be a setback.
- Thanks, guys.

835
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,226
Doc, it's been
great having you here with us.

836
00:42:25,261 --> 00:42:27,295
If you please head
back to the makeup room

837
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,663
and pack up your kit.

838
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:29,964
- Thanks, guys.
- Good luck.

839
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:32,167
Good luck, Doc.

840
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:33,501
And I've spent
3 1/2 years trying,

841
00:42:33,536 --> 00:42:35,403
and I've auditioned
for every season,

842
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:39,708
and then to finally do it,
and, you know, I made it,

843
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:41,409
you know,
further than I thought.

844
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:43,878
- It's me.
- Oh, dude.

845
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:46,959
To come this far,
I can finally just move on

846
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,141
nd say, "Hey, I was
on Face Off".

847
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:51,939
I said I would do it.

848
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,876
I did it.

849
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,618
And it's been an
amazing experience.

850
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:57,273
And it's something I'm
definitely not gonna forget.
