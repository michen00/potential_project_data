1
00:00:01,195 --> 00:00:04,896
The winners of this challenge
get to go to the finale.

2
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:09,034
To make it this far
is just unbelievable.

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,069
There's only three people
standing between me

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:12,404
and 100 grand.

5
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,239
This is the last chance

6
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:16,475
to show that I have
what it takes.

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,210
In a season of life and death,

8
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:19,878
four artists have thrived.

9
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:22,914
But which three
will keep the dream alive

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,766
and make it to the finale?

11
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:26,618
Don't hold anything back.

12
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,720
- So much to do.
- Yeah, right.

13
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:31,823
All aspects of this makeup
have to be perfect.

14
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:33,625
The worst foam in the world.

15
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:35,594
- You have a lot of work to do.
- Ew!

16
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,496
I bit off more than I can chew.

17
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:40,749
I've got several surprises
in store for you tonight.

18

19
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:50,508
- What's happening?
- I don't know. What is this?

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,560
We show up to the studio,

21
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:55,263
and we're walking through
all these different sets.

22
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,115
And I have no idea
what's going on.

23
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,551
Oh, God.
Oh, creepy.

24
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:00,835
Every ten feet,

25
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:03,388
it's like you're
in a different world almost.

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,523
- Weird office or something.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,575
I'm confused.

28
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:09,961
We get to this elaborate
courthouse set,

29
00:01:09,997 --> 00:01:12,530
and at the end of the walkway,
there's McKenzie.

30
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:14,933
What?

31
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:17,135
I'm super excited.
There's a newsstand.

32
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,371
And the newspapers
have all of these

33
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:22,107
really sensational headlines.

34
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:24,676
- What the hell is a Yeti Crab?
- I don't know, but I love it.

35
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:27,112
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

36
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:30,048
Welcome to DC Stages
in downtown Los Angeles.

37
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,284
This location and its massive
variety of standing sets

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,321
has been featured in dozens
of films and television shows,

39
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:40,325
like<i> Alias, X-Files,</i>
and<i> Iron Man 2.</i>

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,960
Cool.

41
00:01:41,995 --> 00:01:43,561
Now, you're next
spotlight challenge

42
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:46,614
is inspired by two infamous
movie monsters

43
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,233
that made a name for themselves

44
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:51,336
destroying some of the world's
most recognizable skylines.

45
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:54,539
Are any of you Godzilla
or King Kong fans?

46
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:56,408
- Yeah.
- Of course.

47
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:59,461
Now, Godzilla and King Kong
are forever associated

48
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:02,313
with iconic buildings
like the Tokyo Tower in Japan

49
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,616
and the Empire State Building
in New York City.

50
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:07,719
Each of these newspapers
features a bold headline--

51
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,922
an image of a famous landmark
that's been devastated

52
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:13,875
by some type
of monstrous creature.

53
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,628
So your spotlight challenge
is to choose

54
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:19,314
one of these newspapers
and use its headline

55
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,219
and imagery as inspiration
for your very own giant monster.

56
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:26,955
Yes! Yes!
I love giant monsters!

57
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:30,041
I am ecstatic.
This is like a dream challenge--

58
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:31,810
to get to make a giant monster.

59
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,195
I gotta calm down. I'll pass out.

60
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,116
All right.
So our headlines are...

61
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:40,785
"Yeti Crab Crushes Kremlin,"

62
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:44,155
"Giant Sloth Slashes Shanghai,"

63
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,357
"Mantis Preys On Paris,"

64
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:48,927
"Deadly Squid Destroys Dubai,"

65
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:51,996
and "Taj Terrorized
By Pterodactyl."

66
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,832
All right, guys, I want you
to choose carefully,

67
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,367
because this is your last chance
to show the judges

68
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:59,137
that you are capable of earning
a spot in the finale.

69
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,239
This is dream come true.
I've always wanted

70
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,124
to make a giant monster,

71
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:06,111
but I am terrified,
because I just need

72
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,412
to get the spot in the finale.

73
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:08,947
- Dina.
- Oh, God.

74
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,984
I'm gonna do this.

75
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,919
Cig, you're next.

76
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,806
I don't know. I'm gonna go
with Yeti crab.

77
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:21,192
- Ah!
- Squid.

78
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:24,896
- I'm going with the sloth.
- All right.

79
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:28,500
All right, guys, I have
an exciting surprise for you.

80
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:31,136
I want to introduce you
to a very special guest.

81
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:34,072
He's starred in dozens
of hit films,

82
00:03:34,107 --> 00:03:37,041
like<i> Star Trek, Capote,</i>
<i>Traffic,</i>

83
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:39,611
and appropriately
for today's challenge,

84
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:41,946
Guillermo del Toro's
<i>Pacific Rim.</i>

85
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:45,099
Please give a warm welcome
to Emmy-nominated actor

86
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:47,402
Clifton Collins, Jr.

87
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:51,856
Clifton Collins, Jr.
has done a lot of productions

88
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:54,626
with makeup effects
and especially giant monsters.

89
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,127
So I'm stoked to see him here.

90
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,495
- Hi.
- Hi. Thank you so much

91
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:58,813
- for being here.
- Thanks for having me.

92
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,582
- I'm a big fan.
- I should also tell you guys

93
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:03,501
that Clifton will be joining us
on the reveal stage this week

94
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:05,236
to see your final makeups.

95
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:07,071
So, as one of the stars
of<i> Pacific Rim,</i>

96
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:09,440
you've seen your fair share
of giant monsters.

97
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:10,892
- I have.
- What do you think it is

98
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:12,177
that gets the audience
so excited?

99
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,311
For me, it's, like,
the nostalgia.

100
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:14,445
Having grown up on, like,

101
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:16,130
big, giant robot or Godzilla

102
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,465
or any of these monster movies,

103
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,984
to become an adult
and see these creatures

104
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:23,221
brought back to the screen
is just a great time.

105
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:25,173
What are you gonna be looking
for in their final creation?

106
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:27,008
I'm gonna be looking
for originality

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,510
and attention to detail.

108
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,861
I think, as a character actor,

109
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:32,230
I'm always hunting
for those minute, little details

110
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:34,032
- that make the difference.
- Very cool.

111
00:04:34,084 --> 00:04:35,500
Thank you so much.

112
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:38,286
All right, guys, it's time
to get started on your sketches.

113
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,905
And remember,
don't hold anything back,

114
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,207
because it's now or never,

115
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:43,541
if you want to prove
to the judges

116
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:45,944
that you belong
in the final three.

117
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:47,996
See you later on at the lab.
Good luck.

118
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:49,914
Good luck, guys.

119
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,656
I got
"Mantis Preys On Paris."

120
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:00,191
The cool thing
about praying mantises

121
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:03,745
is the females actually eat
the heads of their mates.

122
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,298
So my concept
is she ate tons of them

123
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:10,134
and grew into a giant monster.

124
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,755
I have to do wings, face,
cowl, arms, legs,

125
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,823
and then they have this
whole lower body part

126
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:17,508
that I'm probably gonna have
to fabricate.

127
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:19,944
I have to just go all out
in this challenge.

128
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,747
I want the judges to see that
I don't just do pretty things.

129
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,767
I can do creepy.

130
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,320
I like sloths.

131
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,906
They're real stupid
and slow and cute.

132
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,075
So it's gonna be fun
trying to take that

133
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,794
and transform it
into a hideous, scary monster.

134
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,564
My concept for my giant sloth
that destroys Shanghai

135
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,800
is an ancient,
forgotten creature

136
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,536
that has been brought
to the modern world

137
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:47,672
and basically just goes crazy.

138
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:51,509
So he's gonna have longer arms
with really long claws,

139
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:54,712
some sparse hair,
and shortened legs.

140
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:56,898
I'm not holding anything back
this time.

141
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,567
Like, it's a monster challenge,
a giant-monster challenge.

142
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:02,854
So I'm going giant monster,
all the way.

143
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:05,523
- How's your squid monster?
- It's a squid man.

144
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,791
Yeah?
Let me see.

145
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:09,694
My concept is this
radioactive mutant squid.

146
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,863
The squid is growing
bigger and bigger,

147
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:14,198
until he goes on a rampage
in Dubai.

148
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,833
They're all soft and squishy,

149
00:06:15,869 --> 00:06:17,502
except for this big,
bad-ass beak

150
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:20,438
that can just, like,
rip apart Dubai, apparently.

151
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:22,740
I think I'm gonna put the mouth,
like, on his chest.

152
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:25,460
- Cool.
- How's your Yeti crab?

153
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:27,512
It's gonna have, like,
Yeti face

154
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,414
and, like, carapace going back.

155
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,049
- That's cool.
- And then it has, like,

156
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,433
big forearms.

157
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:34,519
So my story is that
the Yeti crab

158
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:37,522
is actually a mutant byproduct
of the Chernobyl disaster.

159
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:39,457
And the Russian government
captured it,

160
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,359
but it's too strong,
and it breaks out.

161
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:44,162
Now it's just pissed off, so it
just starts crushing the city.

162
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:46,681
- So much to do.
- Yeah, right.

163
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,384
Hey, guys.

164
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,469
Let's go back to the lab
and start our monsters.

165
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:52,737
Yeah.

166
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,280
It's day one of our
giant-monster challenge,

167
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,816
and we have six hours
in the lab.

168
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,652
So much to do.

169
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:10,688
I'm on Cloud Nine.
I get to make a giant monster.

170
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:13,024
I'm gonna sculpt a cowl
and a face piece.

171
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,560
Then I'm gonna try to fabricate
an entire creature suit

172
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,396
that ends in crab claws
and have, like, armored plates

173
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,264
all throughout.

174
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,950
I start with just
the basic ape sculpt,

175
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:26,137
and add some other stylized
elements into the gorilla face.

176
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:28,389
It's a monstrous amount of work.

177
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:36,080
The mantis eyes are, you know,
on the side of its head.

178
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:38,866
So I find these giant,
plastic half globes

179
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:40,068
that are perfect for its eyes,

180
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,253
so stick those right
into my sculpt.

181
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:46,174
And then I'm gonna try to hide
my model's eyes in the nostrils,

182
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:50,011
so I start working on the face
and the cowl at the same time

183
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:52,130
because it needs
to match perfectly,

184
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:53,464
or this is not gonna work.

185
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:03,958
All right, this is
my fourth bag of clay.

186
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,126
What are you making there--

187
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:06,611
- chest piece?
- Yeah.

188
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:10,181
A squid is not all that scary,
just this gross, slimy thing.

189
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:13,601
So I start sculpting
this big, thick beak

190
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,154
right in the center
of my model's chest,

191
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,189
with all these rings
and spikes.

192
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:20,591
The beak's gonna look like
it can destroy a whole city.

193
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:23,428
Got to just be a pit
of destruction in its chest.

194
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,463
It's gonna sell
the scary aspect.

195
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,451
Do you like him?

196
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:33,221
Yeah.
I love sloths.

197
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:36,541
It's like, they're adorable.
What can they possibly do?

198
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,044
I'm spending a lot of time
trying to make sure

199
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:42,046
I don't go too sloth-y,
which will just turn out

200
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:45,683
to be a giant cute monster,
so I'm spreading out the eyes

201
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:48,486
so that he's still
sort of dopey and cute-looking,

202
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,221
but also somewhat menacing

203
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:52,874
and more like
a giant, scary sloth.

204
00:08:56,896 --> 00:09:00,031
Hey, guys.
We're here to check in on you.

205
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,866
- Hey, George.
- Hey, how are you?

206
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,201
- Good. How you doing?
- Hi, George.

207
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:05,169
- Good to see you.
- All right, so you have

208
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:07,505
- "Deadly Squid Destroys Dubai."
- Yeah.

209
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,008
So I'm gonna have these
giant eyes and the face split,

210
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:14,579
and these will blend into
the tentacles that are his arms.

211
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:18,282
And then the beak
is gonna be on his chest.

212
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:19,750
What about color now?

213
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:21,669
The paint job is the thing
I'm most looking forward to.

214
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,921
Tans with some, like,
blue spotting

215
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:25,640
and patterns
and stuff around it.

216
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,391
Well, you don't want
to get muddy either.

217
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:28,493
- No.
- When you talk about tans,

218
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:29,644
you don't want to,
all of a sudden,

219
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,362
start to shade
and get it too dark.

220
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:34,098
Octopus and squid, you find reds
and blues and purples.

221
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,200
- Mm-hmm.
- So you can easily work those

222
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:38,469
- into your shadows around there.
- Yeah.

223
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,838
All right, so remind us
what you chose today.

224
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:43,174
"Mantis Preys On Paris."

225
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,942
- That's right.
- I like your face.

226
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:46,811
Should I white
her eyes out maybe?

227
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:48,062
No, I wouldn't whiten them,

228
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:49,730
'cause that's gonna pop
right out.

229
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:51,349
If anything, bring your shading
all the way through here

230
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:52,984
and really just go
all the way down

231
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,635
- with the aqua color plus...
- Yeah, yeah.

232
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,555
'Cause it'll last,
and then take a black pencil

233
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:00,057
and do the table of the eye
to get rid of any pink

234
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,526
- that's in there.
- Right.

235
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,660
So, yeah, here he is.

236
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:04,362
I'm trying to change
the silhouette

237
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,932
so that he has a wider,
like, stockier head, basically.

238
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,717
Mm-hmm.
Since you are so thick here,

239
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,553
score it from the inside,
before you put it on him,

240
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:13,838
- so it'll bend.
- Okay.

241
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,273
In fact, I would even,
with this one here,

242
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,141
so he could get more of that,

243
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,843
would be to literally
tear some out.

244
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:19,977
Score it and tear some
out of it,

245
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:21,179
'cause then
it will have something,

246
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,230
you know, to fold into.

247
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:24,048
- Okay.
- All right.

248
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,385
So you got
"Yeti Crab Crushes Kremlin."

249
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,154
Yep. I thought that no
collection of giant monsters

250
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:32,707
would be complete
without a simian-esque monster.

251
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:35,593
So I'm gonna make
the overall look very apelike...

252
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:36,861
Mm-hmm.

253
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:39,597
...with the carapace
and exoskeleton of the crab.

254
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:41,232
- Uh-huh.
- This is gonna look like

255
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:44,485
- a gorilla in a crab costume.
- Mm-hmm.

256
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,070
I was really happy
with the face.

257
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:48,539
But this is definitely
a wrench in the gears.

258
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:51,309
It'd probably be a good idea
to sell a little bit more crab

259
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:53,077
in the face
so it isn't all simian,

260
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,528
you know,
really tie the two together.

261
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:57,248
- Okay.
- You have a lot of work to do.

262
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,933
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck.

263
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:01,419
Thank you.

264
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,721
Fuck. I want to take
Mr. Westmore's advice

265
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:04,989
to sell the crab more,

266
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,657
but I'm not sure
what I'm gonna do with the face.

267
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,492
I don't know.
I'm not seeing it.

268
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:09,911
I don't have time
to be thrown off,

269
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:11,329
because I have to still
fabricate

270
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:13,514
an entire creature suit,
so it's really frustrating.

271
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,734
But at this point, I just have
to walk away from it.

272
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,269
Coming up...

273
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,604
What the fuck?

274
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,505
At the end of the day,
there's gonna be one person

275
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,708
that's gonna be sent home,
and it's nerve-racking.

276
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,810
So, I think it's
a very successful makeup.

277
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:27,011
I struggle with this.

278
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:29,356
I appreciate
your swinging for the fences.

279
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:38,440
Fuck.

280
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:39,858
It's day one of our
giant-monster challenge,

281
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,144
and I'm nervous because
I'm running out of time today,

282
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,313
and Mr. Westmore said
that I really need

283
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:46,365
to sell the crab more,
which I definitely agree with.

284
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,318
But I'm not exactly sure
what it is about the face

285
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:51,020
that's not really
coming together.

286
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:53,822
I'm thinking crabs
have these really long antenna.

287
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:55,758
So that gives me an idea
to put antenna

288
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:58,560
coming off the side of the face,
and have them hang down.

289
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:01,030
That's very
old-school monster.

290
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:03,532
- It's got antenna.
- Yeah.

291
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,624
I get my face sculpt done,

292
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:15,021
and I'm going to start getting
this thing molded.

293
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:17,797
I just need to finish
the face today,

294
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,515
'cause it needs to match up
with the cowl

295
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:22,585
so it looks like one
cohesive head.

296
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,173
Ten minutes.

297
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,329
One thing that's sort of looming
over me still

298
00:12:33,365 --> 00:12:35,665
is how I'm gonna make
these hands and these claws.

299
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,734
Otherwise,
it's not gonna read as sloth,

300
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:40,453
and it won't read
as a giant monster.

301
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:47,410
Hey, guys, it's time.

302
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,914
The other thing
that's looming over my head

303
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,600
is the amount of hair work
that I'm gonna have to do.

304
00:12:53,635 --> 00:12:55,218
It's gonna be
sort of a daunting task

305
00:12:55,253 --> 00:12:58,187
to get all of these things
finished on day two.

306
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:10,283
Whoo-hoo!

307
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,335
So, it's day two
of our giant-monster challenge,

308
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:14,387
and we have nine
and a half hours in the lab.

309
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:16,539
This thing is, like,
barely cooked.

310
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:19,675
My chest piece
isn't completely cured.

311
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,177
I'm squishing the beak,
and it's just--

312
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,479
my fingerprints are staying
in the foam.

313
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:25,765
It's totally distorting
what I sculpted,

314
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,517
and it's pretty much ruined.

315
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:30,102
I need to figure out
something else to do.

316
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,691
Ew.
It's creepy.

317
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,394
I have a very long list
of things to do today.

318
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:40,196
I need to finish my cowl.

319
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:41,864
I started sculpting a butt

320
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,034
for the insect that I need
to get finished and molded.

321
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:48,271
Then I need to, like, fabricate
some wings and some legs

322
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:50,790
and a bunch of blender pieces,

323
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:53,459
so I have a lot to do.

324
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:59,749
My chest piece is so thick,
it didn't get baked.

325
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:01,350
Weird.

326
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,288
Since my chest piece wasn't
baked all the way through,

327
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,541
I'm gonna run the chest mold
with polyfoam.

328
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:10,376
But polyfoam's
a lot more rigid,

329
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:13,262
so I'm pretty sure
it's not gonna come out

330
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:15,348
as nice as I would like it to.

331
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,417
But I have to get something.

332
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,024
I pop open my face mold,
clean the clay out.

333
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,375
It looks great.

334
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,977
Now it's time
to jump on the cowl.

335
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:29,645
I decide to put
some more spikes on it

336
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:32,048
and detail it out a little bit.

337
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,549
I'm feeling a lot better
this morning.

338
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:36,152
I'm ready, I have a direction,
and I'm running at it.

339
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,774
- Ew. Look at his little ears.
- Aren't they gross?

340
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:43,075
They're really gross.

341
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:46,195
I have to get the cowl
sculpture completely finished,

342
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,780
and then
I have to get it molded.

343
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:50,283
I'm not the fastest mold maker
in the world.

344
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:51,534
So I know that
that's gonna take up

345
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:52,835
a chunk of time in my day,

346
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,572
and I still have to get
these sloth gloves made.

347
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:57,940
It's a ton of work,

348
00:14:57,976 --> 00:15:00,760
and in a challenge this far
along in the competition,

349
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:03,329
you have to do every step
of the process justice

350
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,847
and give it the attention
that it deserves,

351
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,349
or else it can bite you.

352
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,343
It's time to start
on the creature suit,

353
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:19,996
and I'm designing
as I'm putting pieces on.

354
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:21,864
I just grab some couch foam,

355
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,384
and I wrap it in a shape
that creates my understructure,

356
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,904
and from there, I'm going
to cut out segments of L200

357
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:32,758
and actually layer them
on top of each other.

358
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,511
I just keep layering them and
standing back and looking at it.

359
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:38,180
There's no time to waste.
I'm just going.

360
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:45,087
The arms I'm fabricating
are gonna extend my model's arms

361
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,255
almost two feet,

362
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,791
so I want them
to be very long and creepy.

363
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:51,093
It's just gonna add
the giant factor to her.

364
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:52,545
So I decide to take some foam

365
00:15:52,597 --> 00:15:54,797
and roll it up
into a cone shape.

366
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:56,515
I want to add as much texture
as I can,

367
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:57,850
'cause I don't want it
to just look like

368
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:59,268
a piece of rolled-up foam,

369
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,937
because praying mantises have
tons of little, like, spikes

370
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,572
at the end of their arms.

371
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:06,442
So I'm cutting spiky shapes
out of foam,

372
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:07,543
gluing them on.

373
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:09,211
Then I make a piping bag

374
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:12,431
out of some wax paper I find
in the lab and add silicone.

375
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,250
Piping bags are used
in cake decorating

376
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:15,768
to pipe frosting onto cakes,

377
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,137
so I feel like
I'm back at the bakery.

378
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,509
I have to fabricate two gloves,

379
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:26,562
get them painted, then get hair
laid all over them

380
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:27,963
before the end of the day.

381
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,298
- You like?
- Yeah, it looks cool.

382
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,750
Yeah, I got to get
the hair on there.

383
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:33,336
I'm doing hair
because he is a sloth,

384
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:35,254
and they are hairy creatures.

385
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:38,257
But it has to be
really well done,

386
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:41,344
or else it's not gonna do
my makeup justice

387
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:44,230
and I'm not gonna make it
to the finale.

388
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,297
I need to get
this whole bodysuit fabricated

389
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,832
in...

390
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:06,402
way less time than I need.

391
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:09,355
I'm realizing that I bit off
way more than I can chew.

392
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,124
Every new thing
that I put on this suit

393
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:14,677
just kills me inside.

394
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:16,662
I don't really want to be
in this position

395
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:18,264
this far into the competition.

396
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:22,251
This isn't the type of work
I want to represent myself with.

397
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:25,020
I'm not all that proud
of this makeup,

398
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:28,858
and it's gonna suck
if I go home.

399
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,509
So it's day two
of our giant-monster challenge.

400
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,563
And I realize that I bit off
way more than I can chew.

401
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:43,964
Fuck!

402
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,368
So, at this point, I just start
throwing paint at it.

403
00:17:47,403 --> 00:17:50,854
I'm hoping that my paint work
and some of my finishing work

404
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,292
can pull it all together,
but it's starting to worry me.

405
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,783
So, down to, like,
30 minutes left in the day,

406
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,553
I get enough hair laid
on the first glove

407
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,388
that I have to move on
to the second one,

408
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,256
and I just don't have time
to do that.

409
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:12,610
I make a snap decision, instead
of doing fur on both sides,

410
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:15,796
I'm gonna incorporate
a burn makeup on the other side.

411
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:18,566
It will add another layer
of information to the character

412
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,534
so that it becomes
a little bit more interesting.

413
00:18:20,586 --> 00:18:24,271
So I mix up some gelatin
and then start laying that

414
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:25,606
on the other glove.

415
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,441
The way that I'll work this
into the story

416
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:31,645
is the armed forces
are shooting fire at him.

417
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,686
I'm really happy with how
the paint job is coming out.

418
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,404
The stomach's looking
really creepy.

419
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,189
So I'm starting to think
that I'm going

420
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:43,507
in the right direction.

421
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,794
Hopefully, everything will come
together in application.

422
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:49,463
- That's fucking crazy, dude.
- I did all of this today.

423
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:51,966
You're completely insane.

424
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,901
- All right, that's time!
- Whoo.

425
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:57,638
Even with implementing
this burn makeup,

426
00:18:57,673 --> 00:18:59,039
I feel like, at this point,

427
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:01,175
this makeup is gonna turn out
to be silly.

428
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,910
It's a giant sloth monster.

429
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:05,879
- How do you feel?
- Like a zombie.

430
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:08,782
It may or may not work,
and that worries me.

431
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:21,395
We get back to the house,
and we're all exhausted.

432
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,881
This was a crazy challenge.

433
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:25,699
Dead.

434
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:29,436
Nobody has any energy at all.

435
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:30,938
I think we're all
a little worried.

436
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,057
Only three of us are gonna be
in the finale.

437
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,542
And so this
is a really important challenge,

438
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:36,777
and it's really weighing on us.

439
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:38,028
Oh, man.

440
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:40,064
Did everyone finish
everything they wanted to?

441
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,016
- Not even close.
- No.

442
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:43,550
At the end of the day,

443
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:45,436
there's gonna be one person
that's gonna be sent home,

444
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:46,770
and it's nerve-racking.

445
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:49,139
Let's eat, kids.

446
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,191
Okay.

447
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,904
It's application day.

448
00:20:03,906 --> 00:20:08,075
We have four hours in the lab
and one hour at last looks.

449
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,193
Foam come out?

450
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:10,644
It's pretty good--
a few bubbles.

451
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,646
Mine came out
really, really nice.

452
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,365
Ew!
What the fuck?

453
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,719
My foam piece has a lot
of microbubbling on the cowl.

454
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:21,021
Hooray for the worst foam
in the world.

455
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,573
I have to figure out a way
to make these work,

456
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,924
which sucks.

457
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:25,709
Seriously?

458
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,769
- How are you?
- Great!

459
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:37,755
- Hey, man.
- Good to see you.

460
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,675
Whoop!
Oh, no!

461
00:20:41,711 --> 00:20:43,343
I'm trying to, like,
work as fast as possible,

462
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:46,046
but the bald cap
is just not working out.

463
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:48,132
Oh, crap. Okay. So I guess
we have to take it off.

464
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:49,950
I'm freaking out.
I don't have a lot of time.

465
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,819
So I just run and get a cap,

466
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,037
and I throw it on her.
Hopefully, it'll be okay.

467
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:55,956
Yeah, that's better.

468
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:02,863
The foam's sort of rough
this time.

469
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:06,834
I realize that the microbubbling
is on the burn-makeup side.

470
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:10,053
It's gonna be covered up anyway,
so that's not that troubling.

471
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,505
But I'm worried

472
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:14,057
because all aspects of this
makeup have to be perfect

473
00:21:14,093 --> 00:21:15,976
because this is the last chance

474
00:21:15,978 --> 00:21:18,662
to show the judges
that I have what it takes

475
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:19,813
to be in the finale.

476
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:25,302
The first thing I need to do
is hose down my bodysuit

477
00:21:25,354 --> 00:21:27,454
with crystal clear,
which is an acrylic

478
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,123
that will make it
a little bit glossy.

479
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:30,808
See if we can get you
into that shirt.

480
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:33,844
Now I need to get my actor
in the top half

481
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,395
of my bodysuit.

482
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,601
And that's
a pretty big challenge.

483
00:21:40,636 --> 00:21:42,970
- Are you in the sleeves sort of?
- Kind of.

484
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,471
It doesn't want to bend.

485
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:45,656
It's like wrestling,

486
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,674
trying to get him
into this suit.

487
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,777
Here, bend forward.

488
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:51,345
There you go.

489
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,980
I hear people laughing.

490
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:54,148
There you go.

491
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:55,566
And for a second,

492
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:58,085
I'm relieved of all this
pressure and stress

493
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:01,004
- from the finale.
- It's so ridiculous.

494
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,757
But only for a second.

495
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:10,647
So all my pieces
are applied and steamed.

496
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:12,933
Now it's time to start painting,
which is my favorite part,

497
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:15,018
'cause painting it
brings it to life.

498
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:17,387
I want the face
to be very gorilla,

499
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,857
but with accents
of the crustacean.

500
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:22,993
So I base the face out
in light flesh tone,

501
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:25,128
and over the top of that,
I start stippling

502
00:22:25,164 --> 00:22:26,680
different alcohol colors,

503
00:22:26,715 --> 00:22:29,516
like reds, whites,
yellows, browns

504
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:32,469
to do the break-up and
make it look like realistic skin

505
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:35,122
rather than a foam piece.

506
00:22:36,342 --> 00:22:38,492
They brought me in
for questioning?

507
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:41,762
I'm 3,000 feet tall.

508
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:49,303
I need to make these eyes
look like bug eyes,

509
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:51,071
so I cut a square of mesh,

510
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:53,440
and I place it
over the eyeballs,

511
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:54,808
and I airbrush right over it,

512
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:58,795
and it's gonna give the illusion
of praying mantis eyes.

513
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:03,300
I keep looking
at the hair glove

514
00:23:03,335 --> 00:23:06,803
and how terrible
the hair looks.

515
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,023
I want you to start tearing
the fur off of that glove.

516
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,191
Get all of it off of there.

517
00:23:11,243 --> 00:23:13,093
That way,
Lois won't bitch me out

518
00:23:13,095 --> 00:23:14,645
about terrible hair work again.

519
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:17,497
I make a decision
to carry this burn makeup

520
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:20,417
onto both arms,
because it's gonna save me

521
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:22,653
from having to put horrible
hair work onstage

522
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,805
in this really,
really crucial challenge.

523
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,506
Oh, come on.

524
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:29,293
15 minutes, guys.

525
00:23:38,337 --> 00:23:41,221
- That's time, guys!
- All right.

526
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:45,776
It's my last chance
to show the judges

527
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:47,311
that I have what it takes
to make it to the finale.

528
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,378
High five.

529
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:49,630
I'm looking at my makeup,

530
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:51,265
and the decision
to lose the hair

531
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:55,102
could either win this for me,
or it could sink me.

532
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:58,839
Coming up...

533
00:23:58,874 --> 00:24:00,240
I'm not gonna make it
to the finale.

534
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,808
I'm really worried
about the tentacles.

535
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:03,110
Everything's so well executed.

536
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:04,745
He just bit off
more than he could chew.

537
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,480
I really like this character.

538
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:16,650
We have one hour in last looks,

539
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:18,418
and I'm just doing
whatever I can

540
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,454
to get this character done.

541
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:23,373
So I'm just painting
like crazy.

542
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:26,126
I'm so close at this point,
if I don't make it,

543
00:24:26,161 --> 00:24:28,278
I would be
incredibly disappointed.

544
00:24:31,967 --> 00:24:34,935
Is it okay if I glue some of
this stuff over this edge here

545
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:36,303
so it doesn't look like shit?

546
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:38,038
I'm moving lightning fast.

547
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,873
I get the black burns
all glued down,

548
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,709
and I finish the burn makeup
with some K-Y jelly,

549
00:24:42,745 --> 00:24:44,945
which makes it look like
the burns have started

550
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,413
to ooze a little bit.

551
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:48,248
This makeup has to be spot-on,

552
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:50,317
or else I'm not gonna make it
to the finale.

553
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:52,819
You can hunch
the shoulders forward.

554
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:56,290
Can you pull them up?

555
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:58,892
I need to get the pants on
and get all the pieces

556
00:24:58,894 --> 00:25:00,310
to the body blended together.

557
00:25:00,362 --> 00:25:01,762
You look like squid Elvis.

558
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:05,565
But everything
from the neck down looks hokey.

559
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:07,651
So the main thing I'm worried
about is the tentacles.

560
00:25:07,703 --> 00:25:10,203
The problem is there's
this giant cowl piece

561
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,439
and these hanging antenna

562
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:14,474
that are gonna have
to come through the suit.

563
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,361
So I have to reach in there
and guide the cowl through.

564
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:20,113
Then all of a sudden,
the suit pops on.

565
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:21,498
Ta-da!

566
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,983
And I'm thinking,
"This is awesome.

567
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:24,117
He's a giant monster."

568
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:26,053
Keep your eye closed
for a second.

569
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,507
15 minutes, guys.

570
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,850
All right, that's time!

571
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:41,251
Thanks, dude.

572
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:43,053
- Give me some claw.
- Yeah.

573
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:46,990
At this point,
I'm hoping that somebody else

574
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:48,809
messes up worse than I have.

575
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:03,056
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

576
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:05,058
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated,

577
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,728
and three of you will earn
your place in the finale

578
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,396
to compete for the VIP trip

579
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,231
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

580
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:13,934
to one of their
85 international locations,

581
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,903
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

582
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:19,856
and $100,000.

583
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:22,109
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges--

584
00:26:22,144 --> 00:26:24,611
owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

585
00:26:24,646 --> 00:26:26,146
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hi, guys.

586
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:27,347
Hi, Glenn.

587
00:26:27,383 --> 00:26:29,716
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

588
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:32,019
- Good luck, all of you.
- Thanks, Lois.

589
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:34,554
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

590
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,822
Hello, guys and lady.

591
00:26:35,824 --> 00:26:37,357
Hi, Neville.

592
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,292
And joining us again tonight

593
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:42,245
is Emmy-nominated actor
Clifton Collins, Jr.

594
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:45,215
How you guys doing?

595
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,901
Welcome back, Clifton.
You ready to see some monsters?

596
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,836
Yeah.

597
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:52,572
All right, guys, this week
your spotlight challenge

598
00:26:52,624 --> 00:26:54,941
was to use a dramatic
newspaper headline

599
00:26:54,977 --> 00:26:56,243
and imagery as inspiration

600
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:58,912
for your very own
giant monster.

601
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:02,733
So, with only three finale spots
on the line,

602
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:04,851
let's take a look
at your monsters.

603
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,978
I am proud of this makeup,

604
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,531
and I'm thinking this
could get me into the finale.

605
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:59,239
There's a giant monster
standing in front of me.

606
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:00,974
Even if the judges hate it,
I'm happy,

607
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:03,243
because I got to make
a giant monster.

608
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:25,398
My squid walks out onstage,

609
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:27,300
and I think he fits
the challenge,

610
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:29,169
but I know
that it's not my best work.

611
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:52,442
I'm starting to get nervous.

612
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:53,927
If the judges
don't like the way

613
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:55,695
that I've approached
the burn makeups,

614
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:57,364
then I'm
gonna be really screwed.

615
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:05,805
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look

616
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:07,440
at our monsters?

617
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,415
The coloring is lovely.

618
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:18,118
I like the teeth
and the patterning on the eyes.

619
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:19,653
It's just one of the few times

620
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:22,489
that an eyehole does not really
feel like an eye hole.

621
00:29:22,524 --> 00:29:24,257
- Yeah.
- I love the incorporation

622
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:26,209
- of the mantis's camouflage.
- Yeah.

623
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:28,328
- It's really beautiful.
- Thank you.

624
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:35,719
From the front, it's a unique,
interesting Yeti-type face.

625
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:38,121
It's from the side that you
really see the crab.

626
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:39,506
- It's a good shape.
- Yeah.

627
00:29:39,507 --> 00:29:42,607
_

628
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:44,411
The fact that he was able
to do all this

629
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:47,297
is fascinating
and intriguing to me.

630
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,987
He doesn't look happy, does he?

631
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:56,306
These things were,
in Japanese cinema

632
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:57,974
around the '60s, very hokey.

633
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,292
I think he was going
for that feel.

634
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:01,528
I like the nostalgia
of the old Japanese,

635
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,413
'60s throwback.

636
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:06,733
Can you turn around for us?

637
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:09,069
- It's not a bad side view.
- Yeah.

638
00:30:09,104 --> 00:30:11,037
You never know what the judges

639
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,539
are gonna like
or what they're gonna hate.

640
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,140
And we're so close
to the finale.

641
00:30:14,176 --> 00:30:16,109
It freaks me out
just thinking about it.

642
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:19,579
Which three artists

643
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:20,997
do you think will make it
to the finale?

644
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:24,217
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

645
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:28,440
I kind of like the transition

646
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,142
into the mouth
and then down to the shoulder.

647
00:30:30,177 --> 00:30:32,077
That's an interesting idea.

648
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:35,030
I'm not feeling great,
but I'm hoping that the judges

649
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:37,265
at least like
how I did the cowl.

650
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:39,284
Thank you.

651
00:30:42,089 --> 00:30:44,890
I like
that he just went right--

652
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:46,658
"I've got a sloth head,
sloth hands."

653
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:48,660
Then the rest he just made up
just to keep moving.

654
00:30:48,695 --> 00:30:49,828
It's a good sculpt.

655
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:53,431
Sloths are silly-looking
characters and cute.

656
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:54,766
There's no getting around it.

657
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,702
- He's very appealing, isn't he?
- Yeah.

658
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:59,487
I think there's some really
nice paint textures

659
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,674
going on here--
simple, quick, but broken up.

660
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,676
Thank you.

661
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:13,518
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

662
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:15,420
to learn more about your work.

663
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:17,339
Drew, you're up.

664
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:25,463
Drew, tell us about
your giant-sloth character.

665
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:28,533
He was brought to the mainland
as a zoo attraction,

666
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:29,834
sort of like King Kong,

667
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,203
and he broke loose

668
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:33,538
and started destroying
and going crazy

669
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:35,106
on downtown Shanghai.

670
00:31:35,158 --> 00:31:38,159
They tried to fight him off
with flamethrowers,

671
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:39,611
and his arms caught fire,

672
00:31:39,663 --> 00:31:42,147
so that's why the burns
traveled up his arms

673
00:31:42,182 --> 00:31:44,649
and on to the sides of his head
and to his chest as well.

674
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:46,701
You've created something
that feels successful

675
00:31:46,753 --> 00:31:48,553
within this challenge.

676
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:50,889
I love the combination
of techniques,

677
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:54,392
both in your painting approach
and the overall fabrication.

678
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:56,461
I just think
you could have handled the burn

679
00:31:56,496 --> 00:31:58,830
- with greater finesse.
- Thank you.

680
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:01,900
I really like this character,
I have to say.

681
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:06,187
It was a wise decision to go
for the hands and the head.

682
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,473
I think it's a very successful
makeup this week.

683
00:32:08,525 --> 00:32:11,443
I don't get the sense
that you've modified

684
00:32:11,478 --> 00:32:15,347
the physicality
to accommodate gigantism.

685
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:19,100
But the way the sculpture
and the design

686
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:23,121
sustains the character is what's
really beautiful about this.

687
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:24,339
Thank you.

688
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:27,659
The sloth face
is just so real-looking.

689
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:30,478
- I love where your head's at.
- Thank you very much.

690
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,681
- Drew, please step back.
- Thanks, Alex.

691
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:38,820
Cig.

692
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,978
So what can you tell us
about the Yeti crab?

693
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:51,283
He was a mutant byproduct
of the Chernobyl disaster,

694
00:32:51,318 --> 00:32:53,068
and the Russians
discovered him,

695
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:55,303
but he couldn't be controlled,
and he busted out,

696
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:57,322
and he starts crashing
through Russia.

697
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,858
There are some elements
within this

698
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,895
that are absolutely lovely,
particularly the face.

699
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,564
Could you turn sideways?
Thank you.

700
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:07,983
When we see him in profile,

701
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:10,585
I think it works
exceptionally well.

702
00:33:10,637 --> 00:33:12,454
- Well done.
- Thank you.

703
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:14,272
There are some great forms
in that face.

704
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:16,241
Where I struggle with this

705
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:19,544
is I don't see much
of the crab aesthetic happening.

706
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,880
That feels more like
a bumblebee,

707
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:23,448
and that is a subjective thing,

708
00:33:23,483 --> 00:33:25,500
so don't take that too much
to heart.

709
00:33:25,552 --> 00:33:27,752
I totally get
what you're saying.

710
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,421
I love what's going on.

711
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,690
I love the shadows,
and I really like the mix

712
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,792
of fur and shell on the back.

713
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,827
- You did a pretty sweet job.
- Thank you.

714
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:38,113
Cig, you can step back.

715
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,298
Thanks, guys.

716
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:45,820
George.

717
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,644
George, tell us
about your giant creature.

718
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,213
He's based
in the city of Dubai,

719
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:57,315
which is kind of known
for their excess.

720
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:59,768
So they had the biggest zoo
in the world,

721
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,905
where all the animals
were genetic experiments,

722
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:05,540
and this guy was the biggest,

723
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:09,127
and he broke out and then went
on a rampage in Dubai.

724
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:11,463
Where I think
you've really succeeded

725
00:34:11,498 --> 00:34:14,199
is particularly in profile
with the head.

726
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:16,201
That's the George
that we've come to know,

727
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:19,170
'cause you're
a pretty fantastic sculptor

728
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:21,473
- and technician.
- Thank you.

729
00:34:21,475 --> 00:34:23,641
The color work makes it
feel a little playful

730
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:26,745
- and less of a threat.
- Mm-hmm.

731
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,279
It takes me back
to my childhood.

732
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:29,614
I remember the squid monsters

733
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,183
and big giant robot
and things like that.

734
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,953
- So thank you.
- Thanks.

735
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:37,722
I'm heavily approving of
the sarlacc pit of the stomach

736
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:38,757
that you built.

737
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:41,042
Like, it's a really great idea.

738
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:42,377
I appreciate your enthusiasm

739
00:34:42,412 --> 00:34:44,362
and that you were swinging
for the fences.

740
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:45,497
Thank you.

741
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,899
George, please step down.

742
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,975
Dina, you're up.
Please step forward.

743
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:04,082
Hey, Dina. You want to tell me
a little bit about mantis?

744
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:06,584
She is a praying mantis
who really had a taste

745
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,153
for the heads of her mates,

746
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:10,455
so she ate tons of them,

747
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,990
and to satisfy her hunger,

748
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,259
she worked her way up
the food chain to the big city,

749
00:35:14,294 --> 00:35:17,796
where there are thousands of men
for her to feast on.

750
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:20,799
Really blown away
at the detail.

751
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:23,818
The head's really beautiful
and the detail in the eyes,

752
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,904
I love just looking at her.
Good job.

753
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:27,155
Thank you.

754
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,975
I really do love
the model's eyeholes.

755
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:33,261
Feels completely part
of the head.

756
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:36,931
- My goodness, I really like it.
- Thank you so much.

757
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,951
Everything is so fitting
and so well executed.

758
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:43,421
Every square inch
has been addressed in some way.

759
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:46,925
- I love it.
- Thank you.

760
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,477
Dina, please step back.

761
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:53,298
Good job.

762
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,667
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

763
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:57,469
If you please head
back to the makeup room

764
00:35:57,471 --> 00:36:00,221
while they decide
who will move on to the finale.

765
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:02,090
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

766
00:36:08,348 --> 00:36:10,315
All right,
so the question at hand is,

767
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,750
whose monster helps secure them
a spot in the finale?

768
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:16,020
So why don't we start
with Drew's sloth.

769
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:18,323
I feel like he spent
all his time on the head.

770
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:20,258
The expertise really showed.

771
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:23,144
I mean, the head
was almost close to perfect.

772
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,030
The problem is he gave us
a really nice sloth head

773
00:36:26,066 --> 00:36:27,765
and some really nice
sloth claws,

774
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:30,034
and then
not-so-good burn makeup.

775
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,488
I do think the burn makeup
is disappointing.

776
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:36,741
It could have been
more proficiently expressed.

777
00:36:36,776 --> 00:36:38,076
Absolutely.

778
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:40,728
So I'm on a fence
about Drew, honestly.

779
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,548
All right, let's move on
to Cig's Yeti crab.

780
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:48,453
He chose to do
a literalized "Yeti meets crab."

781
00:36:48,488 --> 00:36:50,355
I happen to not like that look.

782
00:36:50,407 --> 00:36:53,641
But it not only feels like
a Japanese giant monster,

783
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:56,761
it actually feels Japanese
in its design.

784
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:59,030
So, for this challenge,
I love it.

785
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:02,217
The thing that I really
enjoyed was that samurai look,

786
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:04,402
particularly around the face.

787
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,204
The guy's just so at home.

788
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,506
He clearly loves
Japanese monster movies.

789
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,509
All right, let's move on
to George's squid.

790
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:14,312
The form language on the head
is a standout on the makeup.

791
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:17,315
You can see the elegance
that George possesses.

792
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,816
I'm very fond of it.

793
00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:22,420
He looks as if he's a plaything
from<i> Doctor Who.</i>

794
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:25,790
And there's something
so delightful about it

795
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:28,693
that I've sort of forgiven
the fact

796
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:30,562
that it isn't well executed.

797
00:37:30,597 --> 00:37:32,196
He just bit off
more than he could chew

798
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:35,550
because he wanted it
to be amazing and big.

799
00:37:35,585 --> 00:37:39,404
When he chose to tackle
the eight tentacles,

800
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,940
I think he just went south
really fast.

801
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:44,909
All right, let's move on
to Dina's praying mantis.

802
00:37:44,945 --> 00:37:46,945
The most impressive thing
is the fact

803
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,847
that every square inch
of this character

804
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:51,249
has been addressed.

805
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:54,652
Yeah, that color, the shape,
the sculpt through here--

806
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:56,087
I mean, it's lovely work.

807
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:58,957
And think
about the actual surface area

808
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:00,191
that she had to paint.

809
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:02,126
- The painting's beautiful.
- Yeah!

810
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:04,512
I mean, granted,
it could have done

811
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:07,265
with maybe a little bit
more variation in color.

812
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,183
But that is really
just a bonus.

813
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,052
All right, judges,
so have you decided

814
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:12,670
who should move on
to the finale?

815
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:15,356
- I think we have.
- Excellent.

816
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:18,192
Well, Clifton, thank you so much
for being here with us tonight

817
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:19,510
and helping us
select our finalist.

818
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,095
Thanks for having me.
I had a blast.

819
00:38:21,147 --> 00:38:22,513
All right, well,
let's bring them back out

820
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,949
and award some finale spots.

821
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:29,520
I just like the fire.
There's fire!

822
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:31,756
We walk out onstage,

823
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:35,159
and there's swords and torches.

824
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:37,245
I don't know what's going on.

825
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,262
Oh, God.

826
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:40,131
Welcome back.

827
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:42,550
As you can see,
I've done a bit of redecorating.

828
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:44,802
- It's lovely.
- Now, the things you see

829
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:48,673
around you are related
to our finale challenge.

830
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:52,143
Before I can tell you more,
you need to earn your spot.

831
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:55,246
So let's find out
who is moving forward.

832
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:58,449
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge

833
00:38:58,485 --> 00:39:00,902
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

834
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:03,621
The first person joining us
in the finale is...

835
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:10,990
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge

836
00:39:11,025 --> 00:39:13,075
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

837
00:39:13,111 --> 00:39:14,677
The winner
of tonight's challenge

838
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:17,013
and the first person
joining us in the finale is...

839
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:21,684
Dina.

840
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,387
Yes!

841
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:26,522
Yes!

842
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:27,723
Thank you.

843
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:29,392
We would have been happy
with your mantis

844
00:39:29,427 --> 00:39:31,327
if two people
would have worked on it.

845
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:34,697
So the amount of success
that you achieved by yourself

846
00:39:34,732 --> 00:39:36,165
is all the more impressive.

847
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,001
Thank you so much.
Aah!

848
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:40,336
Holy crap.
Me?

849
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:41,854
The first week I was here,

850
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:44,040
I didn't think I measured up
to anyone,

851
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:45,975
so this feels so amazing.

852
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,577
- Dina, congratulations.
- Thank you.

853
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,263
You've earned the first spot
in the finale.

854
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:52,898
Yes!

855
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:55,418
Thank you.

856
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,421
All right, Glenn,
who is the next person

857
00:39:58,423 --> 00:39:59,855
to make it to the finale?

858
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,090
The second person

859
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:03,492
that will be joining us
in the finale is...

860
00:40:05,596 --> 00:40:06,612
Cig.

861
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:09,081
Whoo!

862
00:40:10,768 --> 00:40:13,803
We loved the throwback nature
of your concept,

863
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:15,738
especially in profile.

864
00:40:15,773 --> 00:40:18,274
The striated edges
were a really great way

865
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:19,925
to show off the crab aspect.

866
00:40:19,978 --> 00:40:21,544
Thank you guys so much.

867
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,629
I honestly didn't think
I was gonna make it this far,

868
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:25,047
and now I'm in the finale.

869
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:26,449
Like, this is amazing.

870
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:28,067
Congratulations, Cig.

871
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:31,103
You've earned the second spot
in our finale.

872
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,325
All right,
we have two artists left

873
00:40:36,327 --> 00:40:39,045
and only one spot.

874
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,498
So, Glenn, who has
the final spot in our finale?

875
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,084
Here I am, almost at the end.

876
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:47,169
I can see that $100,000.

877
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:49,772
Being eliminated right
before the finale

878
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,223
would be devastating.

879
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:53,342
I want to be a finalist, and
I think I deserve to be there.

880
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:55,911
The last person moving on
to the finale is...

881
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,116
Drew.

882
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:04,587
- Drew.
- Oh, my God.

883
00:41:04,622 --> 00:41:06,222
Thanks, George.

884
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:10,126
You made a very smart decision
to focus on the sloth elements

885
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:12,128
of your character,
which gave you the time

886
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:14,163
to deliver
a very successful sculpture

887
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:16,098
- and a beautiful paint job.
- Thank you.

888
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,533
Congratulations, Drew.

889
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:19,402
You've earned the last spot
in the finale.

890
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:20,903
Thank you so much, guys.

891
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:21,987
I'm dumbstruck.

892
00:41:22,023 --> 00:41:24,557
Being a finalist is beyond

893
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:26,025
what I'd ever hoped for,

894
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:31,063
and I'm so happy and so grateful
to have this opportunity.

895
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:33,949
Unfortunately,
that means, George,

896
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:37,436
you have been eliminated.

897
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:39,939
George, you can't get
too down on yourself

898
00:41:39,974 --> 00:41:41,724
for making it this far.

899
00:41:41,726 --> 00:41:45,061
You have delivered some amazing
makeups this season.

900
00:41:45,063 --> 00:41:48,981
Unfortunately, this week
you just weren't up to the work

901
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:51,267
- of your peers.
- Yes.

902
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,769
George, it's been so great
having you here with us.

903
00:41:53,821 --> 00:41:56,105
But if you would please head
back to the makeup room

904
00:41:56,157 --> 00:41:57,640
and pack up your kit.

905
00:41:57,675 --> 00:41:58,724
Thanks, guys.

906
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Good luck, George.

907
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,383
I'm out!

908
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,753
I'm pretty disappointed,

909
00:42:10,788 --> 00:42:13,756
but I've done some work
that I'm really proud of.

910
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:16,659
I got to make 13 monsters.

911
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:18,060
That's really cool.

912
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:20,396
I love doing
this stuff so much.

913
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,465
So I'm gonna go back
to my house,

914
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,701
finish building my shop,
and keep making monsters.

915
00:42:29,073 --> 00:42:33,375
Only one challenge remains
between one of you

916
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:34,643
and our grand prize.

917
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:35,895
Oh, God.

918
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:38,581
We will end the season
the way we began--

919
00:42:38,582 --> 00:42:41,443
with life and death.

920
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:45,158
And I've got several surprises
in store for you.

921
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:48,087
Oh, my God.
Without a pause for a breath

922
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:49,803
we're going straight
into the finale.

923
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:51,398
Shit!

924
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:52,491
Oh, God.
