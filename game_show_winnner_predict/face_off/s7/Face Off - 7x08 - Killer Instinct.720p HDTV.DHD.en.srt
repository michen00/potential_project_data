1
00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:01,752
It is a gorgeous sculpt.

2
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:05,208
To me, this looks
like <i>Teen Wolf.</i>

3
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:06,443
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:08,645
Ten artists journeyed
into Wonderland.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,114
Dina's flying monkey
stole the show,

6
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:12,683
and Jason was sent home.

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,187
Now nine artists remain,

8
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,556
and tonight's challenge reveals
a special surprise.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,957
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,125
This is good.

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,860
For some, this is a dream
in the making.

12
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,963
But others will be haunted
by its results.

13
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:28,231
Damn it.
This is a big problem.

14
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:31,168
It's just so poorly executed.

15
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:33,370
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

16
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:35,005
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

17
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,741
to one of their
85 international locations,

18
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:40,377
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

19
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:42,346
and $100,000.

20
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,650
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,488
Aah! Shit!

23
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,591
Oh!

24
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,593
Hey, whoa! Whoa!
I'm just--

25
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:31,161
Leave me to my perch.

26
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:32,529
I'm gonna get the girls.

27
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,064
- Huh!
- Huh!

28
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:36,166
That was pitiful.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,667
- You guys ready?
- Yeah!

30
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:45,375
- Ooh-ooh!
- Whoa!

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,977
Spooky!

32
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,011
So we walk into the lab,

33
00:01:48,045 --> 00:01:49,646
and it's all foggy and dark,

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,916
and McKenzie's standing there
next to a mirror,

35
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,218
and it's definitely
creeping me out.

36
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,454
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

37
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:00,690
Let's talk about this week's
foundation challenge.

38
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,325
It's inspired
by an urban legend

39
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,162
of a female figure
so terrifying

40
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:06,630
that it's been used as a basis

41
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:09,599
for films like<i> Candyman</i>
and<i> Paranormal Activity.</i>

42
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:11,067
She's been described
as everything

43
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:13,537
from a corpse to a witch,

44
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:16,573
but no one knows
what she really looks like.

45
00:02:16,607 --> 00:02:18,175
Oh, my God.

46
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,444
They call her "Bloody Mary."

47
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:21,878
Yeah!

48
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:24,214
Now, according to the legend,

49
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,615
if you say her name three times

50
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,217
while looking into a mirror,

51
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:29,252
you may never live to tell
anyone about it.

52
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:31,822
So why don't we try it?

53
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:32,823
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

54
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:34,257
No, I don't want to.

55
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,926
I refuse.

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,294
I know better.

57
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,930
That is a whole bag
you don't want to get into.

58
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:42,732
Bloody Mary.

59
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,468
Bloody Mary.

60
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:45,969
Bloody Mary.

61
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:50,140
Aah!

62
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:51,908
Creepy.

63
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:54,377
Oh, my God.
That's so cool.

64
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,284
All right, now that
I am thoroughly creeped out,

65
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,453
let's just move on
with this challenge.

66
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,055
As you may have guessed,
your foundation challenge

67
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:08,458
is to create your very
own version of Bloody Mary.

68
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:10,093
- Cool.
- Nice.

69
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,629
We get to make up
what Bloody Mary looks like?

70
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:13,830
This is awesome!

71
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,532
Your judge
for today's challenge

72
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:18,568
won an Emmy for her work
on<i> Buffy The Vampire Slayer</i>

73
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:20,237
and has been nominated twice

74
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:23,640
on the critically acclaimed
HBO series<i> True Blood.</i>

75
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,310
Please welcome
Brigette Myre-Ellis.

76
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:31,047
I'm a huge <i>True Blood</i> fan,

77
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:32,482
so this is awesome.

78
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:35,318
Hello. Thank you
so much for joining us.

79
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:36,486
It's a pleasure to be here.

80
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,555
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

81
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:39,823
I know you're hard at work

82
00:03:39,857 --> 00:03:41,258
on the final season
of<i> True Blood.</i>

83
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:42,859
- How's that going?
- It's insane.

84
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:44,361
It is an epic body of work

85
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:45,962
that I've been
so proud to work on,

86
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:47,664
and I think we've outdone
ourselves this year,

87
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:48,798
if you can believe it.

88
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,234
Now, you obviously
have a ton of experience

89
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,802
with supernatural characters.

90
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:55,305
What are you gonna be looking
for in their final makeups?

91
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,307
Ultimately, I want you guys
to scare me.

92
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,942
Not easy to do
after the career I've had.

93
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:01,678
The winner of today's challenge

94
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:04,714
will earn immunity and cannot
be eliminated this week.

95
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:07,651
You have two hours
for this challenge.

96
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:08,718
Good luck, guys,

97
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:13,123
because your time starts now.

98
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:14,424
That's fine right there.

99
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,559
I'm Keaghlan.

100
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:17,127
I'm actually gonna
run some tubes

101
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:18,495
that will pump blood through,

102
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,330
and it will look
like you're crying blood.

103
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:22,699
My original Bloody Mary
has been taken to Hell,

104
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,169
and then the forces of Hell
make her appear in mirrors

105
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:27,771
and drag other people to Hell.

106
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:29,573
We got to get messy today.

107
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:33,276
So I made some pieces.

108
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,744
I'm gonna try to get,
like, some glass shards

109
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:35,912
all over your face.

110
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:38,048
My Bloody Mary bursts
through the mirror,

111
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:39,783
and she's gonna
be eating people

112
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:40,951
that she sucks back in.

113
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:43,053
And she's gonna have
really nasty blood

114
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,589
dripping down from her mouth
and everything.

115
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,061
I want really
disgusting-looking blood

116
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:52,729
for my Bloody Mary,

117
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,998
and my concept is
she's a baby snatcher.

118
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:56,766
This is your bottom lip.

119
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,969
I found these
really cool horn shapes

120
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,470
that I'm gonna make
her mouth out of,

121
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:03,707
so she's got this beak
that helps her eat the baby.

122
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:05,108
I love these horns.

123
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,348
_

124
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,483
My Bloody Mary
wants to scare you

125
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:15,018
into taking your own life,

126
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:17,487
and I'm actually extending
her mouth down

127
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:20,790
to give her a really creepy
elongated face.

128
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:28,865
I'm doing a Bloody Mary
who steals faces,

129
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,735
so I lined slit throat pieces
all around her head

130
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,336
to make incision marks.

131
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,572
It's a little freaky,
but she looks very beautiful.

132
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,076
You got 10 minutes left!

133
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:49,886
That's it, guys!
Brushes down!

134
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,222
Time's up.

135
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:54,057
All right, so tell us
about your Bloody Mary.

136
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:56,993
She was just obsessed
with being beautiful,

137
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,330
and when she couldn't reach
the level that she wanted,

138
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:01,965
she actually killed herself
in the bathtub.

139
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:03,600
The color red that you chose,

140
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,301
I feel like, is very accurate.

141
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:06,369
Mm-hmm.

142
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,370
But I would just
consider next time

143
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,838
blending her little edge
right there.

144
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:10,173
Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,375
What did you use
to create the scarring?

146
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,643
Those are big neck pieces.

147
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:15,845
I enjoy your use of veins
coming up the neck, too,

148
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,614
to tie it all together.

149
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:18,948
You see the beauty in her,

150
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,417
and you see the horror.

151
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:21,217
Thanks.

152
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,552
So this is my Bloody Mary.

153
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:25,155
Her job is to claim your soul.

154
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,323
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- There it is!

155
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,958
I was so worried!

156
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:30,226
I know, right?

157
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,995
Where's the blood?
Here it is.

158
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,496
Really good job.

159
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,498
I look around the room,
and everybody's got

160
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,399
some awesome makeups.

161
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,934
There are so many
great artists left

162
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:39,169
in this competition,

163
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:41,571
and any one of these guys
could knock me out.

164
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:44,641
So, Brigette,
what do you think?

165
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:47,043
I'm really impressed
by your work today, you guys.

166
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:48,244
Thank you.

167
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,480
So who created
your favorite looks today?

168
00:06:50,514 --> 00:06:51,481
Rachael...

169
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:54,050
I loved the way
that you took the incision

170
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:55,418
all the way around her face.

171
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:57,053
The whole concept
of how she stole faces

172
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,154
just creeped me out.

173
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:59,489
- Good job.
- Thanks.

174
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:02,358
Drew, to use a blood tube
was very daring

175
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:03,993
and very original.

176
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:06,162
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

177
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:08,331
All right, Brigette,
who is the winner

178
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:09,332
of this challenge?

179
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:11,835
The winner
of this challenge is...

180
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,738
Rachael.

181
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:16,272
All right!

182
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:17,440
Thank you.

183
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,642
You not only made her
absolutely beautiful,

184
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:21,778
but absolutely creepy.

185
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,080
- That is Bloody Mary.
- Congratulations.

186
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:27,250
You have earned immunity
and cannot be eliminated

187
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,818
in the next
spotlight challenge.

188
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:30,887
It's awesome to win immunity.

189
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:32,922
I can't wait to see
what the next challenge is.

190
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:34,057
I want to go crazy.

191
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:35,792
I will see you later tonight

192
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:38,027
to tell you about
your next spotlight challenge.

193
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:39,763
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

194
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:41,097
Thank you.

195
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,206
Uh-oh.

196
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,808
- I'm scared.
- What is happening?

197
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:53,676
We are at Universal Studios,

198
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:56,212
and it is really spooky.

199
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:57,413
Oh, shit!

200
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,582
Standing in the distance
is McKenzie

201
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,384
and this huge lit-up marquee.

202
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:03,286
"Universal Studios
Halloween Horror Nights."

203
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,287
What?

204
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:05,989
I knew it was gonna be spooky!

205
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:08,057
Horror challenge!

206
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:10,727
This is amazing.

207
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:14,230
Welcome back to the incredible
Universal Studios back lot.

208
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:16,699
This week's spotlight challenge

209
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:20,436
taps into one of the most
timeless forms of advertising--

210
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:22,438
movie posters.

211
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:26,075
Movie posters must capture
the essence of a film

212
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,044
in just a single glance.

213
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:30,580
Posters in most genres
tend to showcase

214
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:33,316
either the handsome hero
or the beautiful starlet.

215
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,952
But horror-movie posters
tease us

216
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,854
with only mysterious images

217
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:40,990
or taglines about
their villainous stars.

218
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,493
So your spotlight challenge

219
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:46,462
is to choose one
of these original movie posters

220
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:49,532
and use the imagery, title,
and tagline

221
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:53,403
as inspiration to create
its villainous lead character.

222
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:54,470
- Sweet!
- Yes!

223
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:56,739
I'm a huge horror-movie fan.

224
00:08:56,774 --> 00:08:58,141
This is definitely my element.

225
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:00,877
So your options are <i>The Cloven,</i>

226
00:09:00,911 --> 00:09:02,345
"It was too hot in Hell."

227
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,781
<i>Bone Appetit,</i>
"Dinner is served."

228
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:07,283
<i>The Trophy Room,</i>
"It's hunting season."

229
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:10,420
<i>Bonnie and Cyanide,</i>
"A toxic romance."

230
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:13,656
<i>Homecoming Scream,</i>
"Save the last dance."

231
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:16,259
<i>Buzzcut,</i>
"Just a little off the top."

232
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:18,995
<i>We Met Online,</i>
"There's no escape key."

233
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:22,332
<i>The Second Chumming,</i>
"Swim at your own risk."

234
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,635
And <i>Axe Girlfriend,</i>
<i>"Breakups can be hell."</i>

235
00:09:26,937 --> 00:09:28,238
Stella, you get first pick.

236
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:31,274
<i>The Trophy Room.</i>

237
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:32,275
<i>Homecoming Scream.</i>

238
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:33,743
<i>Bonnie and Cyanide.</i>

239
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:34,744
<i>Bone Appetit.</i>

240
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:35,778
<i>Cloven.</i>

241
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:36,779
<i>We Met Online.</i>

242
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:37,947
<i>Buzzcut.</i>

243
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:38,982
<i>Axe Girlfriend.</i>

244
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,149
<i>Second Chumming.</i>

245
00:09:41,952 --> 00:09:43,620
Now, to tell you more,

246
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:45,388
please welcome
the creative directors

247
00:09:45,422 --> 00:09:47,657
of Universal Studios
Halloween Horror Nights

248
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,893
in Hollywood and Orlando,

249
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,095
John Murdy and Mike Aiello.

250
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:56,532
These guys are the big bosses

251
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:57,700
from the Halloween
Horror Nights,

252
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,068
so this is super exciting.

253
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,136
- Hello.
- Hello.

254
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,671
Good to have you guys here.

255
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:02,772
Fantastic being here.

256
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:04,474
Universal Studios
Halloween Horror Nights

257
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:06,309
is the nation's premiere
Halloween event.

258
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:08,778
We combine
movie-quality sets

259
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:10,580
and award-winning
makeup artists

260
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,415
all together
into a haunted maze

261
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:14,817
to bring our guests'
nightmares to life.

262
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:16,119
Nice.

263
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:17,987
All right, now,
there's a major prize

264
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,355
on the line this week.

265
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,490
Oh-ho.

266
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:21,958
What?

267
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:24,427
This is good.

268
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,262
Coming up...

269
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:28,231
Ugh. The design
is just not working.

270
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:29,866
Guys, stop messing
with the wigs.

271
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:32,368
Hats off to you.

272
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,570
This looks like a ton of work.

273
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:44,275
There's a major prize
on the line this week.

274
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,309
Oh-ho.

275
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,944
What?

276
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,146
For the first time ever,

277
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,249
both parks are featuring
the best makeup

278
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,750
from all prior seasons
of<i> Face Off...</i>

279
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,318
- Awesome.
- Very cool.

280
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,220
Including the winner
of this challenge.

281
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,221
Wow!

282
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,890
To see a creature
that I have made

283
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,358
in Halloween Horror Nights

284
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,026
would be, like,
one of the coolest things.

285
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,029
Now, there are very few people
in show business

286
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,398
that can scare a crowd
like you two.

287
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,500
What advice do you have
for the contestants?

288
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,502
When John and I are
translating a horror property

289
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,371
into a haunted maze,

290
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,206
we've got to look
at every single detail,

291
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,641
so I encourage you
to do the same

292
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,675
with your movie posters.

293
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:18,976
Find that small detail,

294
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,378
because sometimes
they tell the best story.

295
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:22,980
Thank you again so much
for being here.

296
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,615
Thanks for having us.

297
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,484
All right, well, the time has
come for you to start working

298
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,652
on your designs.

299
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,487
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you.

300
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,255
- Good night.
- Thanks, guys.

301
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,428
My poster is <i>Homecoming Scream,</i>

302
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,865
and my killer is
a 1950s homecoming queen,

303
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,834
so I decide
to do a grayscale makeup,

304
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,802
because I really want this
to be reminiscent

305
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,005
of a B horror movie
from the 1950s.

306
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,909
She is the victim
of a tragic senior prank,

307
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,244
where she breaks her neck,

308
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,546
and now her head
is facing straight,

309
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,782
but the rest of her body
is backwards.

310
00:11:57,816 --> 00:12:00,318
Beautiful,
but really dark and twisted.

311
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,058
I'm so stoked
for this challenge.

312
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:08,392
I get<i> The Second Chumming,</i>

313
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,328
and the tagline is
"Swim at your own risk."

314
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:14,198
I get the idea to do
this salty old sea captain

315
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,100
made of chum.

316
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,935
I'm planning a cowl
that also incorporates

317
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,270
the bottom the jaw,

318
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:20,571
and then I'm gonna do
a face piece

319
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,975
that incorporates the tongue
and the top of the head.

320
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,776
I'm worried this time
I might be biting off

321
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,945
more than I can chum.

322
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,383
So my movie is <i>Buzzcut.</i>

323
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,519
The tagline is
"Just a little off the top,"

324
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,020
and I'm getting really excited

325
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:39,323
that I can maybe create
some kind of psychotic doctor

326
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,925
that's going around
scalping people.

327
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,828
I'm going to actually make
some silicone scalps

328
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,496
and take them and put them
on his head.

329
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,465
And I want to put lots
of, like, slime in there.

330
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:51,435
So, when he peels it back,
it's really stringy and gross.

331
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,907
I chose <i>We Met Online.</i>

332
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,709
The tagline is
"There's no escape key."

333
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,613
I like the aesthetic
of this creepy weirdo

334
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,148
on the other end
of a chat line,

335
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:07,018
who tricks these girls
into meeting him

336
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,353
and ultimately eats them.

337
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,124
I picked<i> Bonnie and Cyanide,</i>
"A toxic romance."

338
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:16,260
What I decide to do
is make Bonnie this woman

339
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,263
who's been poisoned
by her husband,

340
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,599
and she built
this arm contraption

341
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,935
that takes the poison
out of her veins,

342
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,303
then she can inject

343
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,471
the poisonous blood
into other people.

344
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,210
All right, guys,
let's head home.

345
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,245
Dude, that sketch is badass.

346
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,479
He's a cannibal.

347
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,692
- Whoo!
- Yeah, let's get started.

348
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,826
It's the first day

349
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,761
of our Halloween
Horror Nights challenge,

350
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,763
and we have six hours
in the lab.

351
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,298
The poster I pick
is<i> Axe Girlfriend,</i>

352
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,833
"Breakups can be hell."

353
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,935
So my character's
a jilted mistress

354
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,004
who was shot in the head
by her lover.

355
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:02,139
Now she's back from Hell,

356
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,442
wielding this axe
to seek vengeance.

357
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,714
So I'm sculpting
a big gunshot wound to her face.

358
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,482
I'm gonna cast it in silicone,

359
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:12,817
because it moves more realistic

360
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,019
than any other appliance
material that we have.

361
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,457
You're going goat, right?

362
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,491
I'm going deer.

363
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,726
Oh, that's right.

364
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,227
I forgot.
You're doing reindeer.

365
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,329
I end up picking <i>The Cloven,</i>

366
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,831
"It was too hot in Hell,"

367
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:30,067
so my first thought is
a demon reindeer

368
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,937
Santa sent him to Hell
for torturing the elves,

369
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:34,572
but it's too hot
in Hell for him.

370
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,707
- Are you gonna make antlers?
- Yeah.

371
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,645
I've never really sculpted
anything like this before,

372
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,647
but I'm hoping
this will come together.

373
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,948
Don't look so excited.

374
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:45,883
My movie poster
says<i> Bone Appetit,</i>

375
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,419
and "Dinner is served"
is my tagline.

376
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:51,355
I come up with this
cannibalistic baroness idea.

377
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,158
I definitely want to do
an old-age makeup on the face,

378
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,927
but I also want to have her
eat people

379
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,733
with a mouth stomach.

380
00:14:58,734 --> 00:14:59,760
_

381
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,500
Creepy.

382
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,903
I chose <i>The Trophy Room,</i>
"It's hunting season."

383
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,905
My character is a hunter.

384
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:10,808
Whenever people encroach
upon his hunting grounds,

385
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,977
he kills them
and cuts their head off

386
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,478
and mounts them on their wall.

387
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:18,182
He's inbred and was born
with facial deformities,

388
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,685
so his head is really swollen
on one side,

389
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,820
and he's got a cleft palate.

390
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:25,356
It's disturbing.

391
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,957
- That's a good one.
- Yeah.

392
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,928
I look like I work
at a video store.

393
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:32,697
Yeah, an adult video store.

394
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,764
Oh, God.

395
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,766
Hey, George,
can I borrow your pick?

396
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,150
You guys are making it hard
for me to work next to you.

397
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,405
Guys, stop messing
with the wigs.

398
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,809
Really, we need to be working.

399
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:45,976
I'm sorry.

400
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,079
No more funny business.

401
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,961
I have no idea what I'm doing.

402
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,129
Ugh.

403
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,665
Sculpting a deer face
on a human form

404
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,868
is really difficult.

405
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,770
It's not
a reindeer/human hybrid.

406
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:13,904
It's a reindeer.

407
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,206
If it was a hybrid,

408
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,707
I think I would have
a much easier time,

409
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,509
'cause I could incorporate
some of the human forms

410
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:21,679
into the deer forms,
but I'm going straight reindeer.

411
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:22,913
Oh, God.

412
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,882
I just feel like
it's getting worse and worse.

413
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,484
This is the first time
where I felt like

414
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,719
the design is just not working.

415
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,822
Come on, man, I need this.

416
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,057
This is a big problem.

417
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:34,992
Oh, damn it.

418
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:41,744
Oh, damn it.

419
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:44,380
So it's day one of our
Horror Nights villain challenge.

420
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:46,282
I'm just having
a really hard time.

421
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:49,084
Sculpting a deer face
is really difficult.

422
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,286
- Cat.
- But I don't think it's--

423
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,687
Cat.

424
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:54,490
It doesn't look like a deer.
It looks like a cat.

425
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:55,524
Ugh.

426
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,185
So I kind of, like,
just give up.

427
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:58,360
_

428
00:16:58,361 --> 00:16:59,395
I know.

429
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:03,165
And I mold it,
because I have no other choice.

430
00:17:08,004 --> 00:17:10,272
- What are you making?
- I'll make some fingers.

431
00:17:10,307 --> 00:17:12,942
My villain keeps trophies
from her kills.

432
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:14,710
She cuts off their ring fingers

433
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:16,078
and makes a necklace
out of them.

434
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:17,580
So I use alginate,

435
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,748
which is a seaweed-based
impression material,

436
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:20,683
to make a mold.

437
00:17:20,717 --> 00:17:21,951
Go for it.

438
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:22,952
Within ten minutes or so,

439
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:24,420
it sets up into this gel,

440
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:28,257
so I pour platinum silicone
directly into the mold

441
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,759
so it's a easy way of making
silicone body parts

442
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,261
and things like that.

443
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,296
So creepy.

444
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:36,098
30 minutes, guys.

445
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:42,905
So I need to fabricate

446
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:45,541
my hair transplant
surgeon's skullcap.

447
00:17:45,575 --> 00:17:47,376
So I start
with the vacuform machine,

448
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,811
then try to figure out
the right size.

449
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:49,845
Nope.

450
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:52,581
That one's too small.

451
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,417
Finally, I get the exact size
that I need.

452
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:56,719
No, actually,
that's pretty good.

453
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:57,686
- Is it?
- Yeah.

454
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:58,787
That's time!

455
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:00,923
So at the end of the day,

456
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:02,825
I got my scalp completed
in time.

457
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:05,761
Tomorrow I have to get veins
and hair laid on it,

458
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,830
as well as sculpt and mold
my cowl,

459
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:10,132
so there's a lot to do.

460
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:20,042
It's day two of our Halloween
Horror Nights villain challenge.

461
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:21,744
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab,

462
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:23,979
and I have to finish my torso,

463
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:27,449
and I'm really paying attention
to anatomy,

464
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:30,185
because my homecoming queen
is twisted and mangled.

465
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,554
It needs to read
like a back on the chest

466
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,223
and a chest on the back,

467
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:36,392
so I want to make sure that
I do it as perfectly as I can.

468
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:43,799
So today I need
to sculpt my hooves.

469
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,135
I definitely need
these hooves on my makeup,

470
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:48,871
because the movie poster
has a hoof

471
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:50,305
coming out of the ground.

472
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,009
So, hopefully, they'll turn
out better than the face.

473
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:57,346
My cowl's done,
so I need to mold it.

474
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,381
It's a pretty big mold,
so it's gonna take some time,

475
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,917
so I'm trying to get that done
as soon as possible,

476
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,819
because I still have to sculpt
more chummy bits

477
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,655
'cause there's a lot
of surface area to cover.

478
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:11,160
I am working on the face,

479
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:13,062
and I'm not used
to old-age makeup,

480
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,863
so I'm taking my time
with the sculpt.

481
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:16,298
Just because I have immunity

482
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:19,068
doesn't mean I want to make
a crappy piece.

483
00:19:24,574 --> 00:19:25,908
What is all this shit?

484
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,910
Ha!
Mad science.

485
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:30,779
The idea of these arm weapons

486
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:33,549
is that she can push out
the poisonous blood

487
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,851
into her victims.

488
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:39,988
So I take plastic tubing
and inject neon colors in,

489
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:42,624
because the poison has altered
the color of her blood.

490
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,827
I've never fabricated anything
like this before,

491
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:48,497
but I feel confident
that it's gonna look cool.

492
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:51,400
Really cool.

493
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:57,840
It's so good.

494
00:20:01,377 --> 00:20:04,713
My villain keeps heads
mounted on a wall,

495
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:07,316
so I want to make
a separate head for him.

496
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,952
So I pour up a latex face,

497
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:12,621
find a styrofoam head,
pin it into place,

498
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,223
and hot-glue the wig
into place,

499
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:16,792
and I have
this awesome severed head.

500
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:23,766
All right, everybody,
that's time.

501
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,000
Whoo-hoo!

502
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:26,502
Well, all my pieces are done,

503
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:29,638
but I have an insane amount
of work to do tomorrow.

504
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:30,839
Man.

505
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:33,342
There's a lot
of surface area to paint,

506
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:35,778
and this is probably
the most appliances

507
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:38,947
that I've ever applied
on a single person ever,

508
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:41,250
so that has me worried.

509
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,726
- Let's do this.
- It's application day.

510
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,561
We have four hours in the lab

511
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,163
and one hour in last looks.

512
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,667
Let's see it.

513
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:02,638
It's not terrible.
Thank God.

514
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,208
- Morning.
- Hi.

515
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:07,810
- You're giving me the finger.
- Yeah.

516
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,078
Your veins are, like, neon.

517
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:11,914
Can you lean your head back?

518
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:14,316
I need to apply
this face piece,

519
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,385
and the thing with silicone
is it's so heavy,

520
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:18,954
so I need to recline her back
on the chair.

521
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,789
If I were to apply it
with you upright,

522
00:21:20,824 --> 00:21:22,624
it would all stretch down
by your cheeks

523
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:25,060
and wouldn't really be the way
I sculpted it.

524
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:37,506
The mouth looks awesome.

525
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,808
I think this stomach
is probably my favorite thing

526
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:41,443
I've created
in this competition,

527
00:21:41,477 --> 00:21:44,746
and I am really excited
to present it to the judges.

528
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:47,583
Cool shit.
I like it.

529
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:49,151
He's the bubble-gum monster.

530
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:50,652
When I paint gore,
I base everything out

531
00:21:50,687 --> 00:21:51,920
in a bubble-gum paint,

532
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:54,389
because when you put
the other colors over that,

533
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:56,925
it really sells the gore.

534
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
It looks really funny at first,

535
00:21:57,994 --> 00:21:59,494
but I know where
I'm going with it,

536
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:00,562
so I'm not worried.

537
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:03,765
You're gonna get
gummed to death.

538
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:07,402
Ohh!

539
00:22:09,973 --> 00:22:12,007
Okay, and then flip.
I'm gonna get the top, yeah.

540
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,176
I'm trying to do veins here.

541
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,245
Oh, this is terrible.

542
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,513
But this is not veins.

543
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:22,150
They're not looking realistic
or convincing at all,

544
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:25,888
and I really don't know
how to make this better.

545
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:27,756
Ten minutes, guys!

546
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,164
That's time, guys!

547
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,299
It's good.

548
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,600
You're beautiful.

549
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:40,802
I am so disappointed in myself.

550
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:41,904
It's just not very good.

551
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:43,839
I don't want to go home,

552
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:48,043
but I really don't know if
I have enough time to fix this.

553
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:49,278
Coming up...

554
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:50,979
I don't know how to apply
this stuff.

555
00:22:51,014 --> 00:22:52,414
- It's taking forever.
- Ha, ha!

556
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:54,182
I'm really worried
that I might be going home.

557
00:22:54,217 --> 00:22:55,918
- It's great fun.
- I love all of that.

558
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:58,754
This is not your best work.

559
00:23:04,477 --> 00:23:05,844
There it is.

560
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:08,680
We get to last looks, and
I got a lot to do in one hour.

561
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:10,549
I don't even know
how to apply this stuff.

562
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,718
I need to cover the entire thing
in blood.

563
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:13,885
It's taking forever,

564
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,454
and I'm starting to regret
the decision

565
00:23:15,488 --> 00:23:17,756
to make an entire chum bag.

566
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,992
I still have to add
neon colors to the veins

567
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:22,661
and attach the arm weapons.

568
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,062
I really don't know
if I have enough time.

569
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:26,765
I need to dry off your teeth.

570
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,233
All right, you ready for this?

571
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,634
It just needs some blood.

572
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,169
I want to make her
adequately bloody,

573
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:34,406
but not overly bloody--
just some accents of blood.

574
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,475
You're very, very creepy.

575
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:38,210
Yeah!

576
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:39,277
Ha, ha!

577
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:40,679
You're disgusting!

578
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:44,249
I get the sash on
and splatter blood head to toe

579
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:45,517
slap my hand.

580
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:49,588
I love her.
I think she looks so creepy.

581
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:51,123
I'm worried about this makeup.

582
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:52,491
The hair is awful.

583
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:54,226
The face sculpt is bad.

584
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,527
I'm not happy with anything.

585
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:57,162
15 minutes, guys.

586
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:08,573
Time, everybody!

587
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,308
Yeah.

588
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:13,578
My makeup's not near
as good as anyone else's.

589
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:17,082
I'm just so mortified
right now.

590
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:29,027
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

591
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:33,165
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

592
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,836
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges--

593
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,971
owner of Optic Nerve
Make-Up Effects Studio,

594
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,106
Glenn Hetrick...

595
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,041
- Good evening, guys.
- Hi, Glenn.

596
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,410
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell...

597
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:46,812
Evening, all.

598
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,346
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Lois.

599
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:50,782
And creature and
concept designer Neville Page.

600
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:51,983
Hello, everyone.

601
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:53,452
- Hi, Neville.
- Hi, Neville.

602
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:55,420
This week
your spotlight challenge

603
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,923
was to select
a horror-movie poster

604
00:24:57,957 --> 00:24:59,558
and use it as inspiration

605
00:24:59,592 --> 00:25:01,626
to create its villainous
lead character.

606
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:03,762
The winning makeup
will be featured

607
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:05,831
at Universal Studios
Halloween Horror Nights,

608
00:25:05,865 --> 00:25:08,400
Hollywood and Orlando.

609
00:25:08,434 --> 00:25:12,137
Let's take a look
at your fear-inducing creations.

610
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:34,159
My villain
looks really awesome.

611
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:35,861
I'm really stoked
that my character

612
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:38,330
came out the way it did.

613
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:57,782
My reindeer from Hell
does not look scary at all.

614
00:25:57,817 --> 00:26:01,353
I might be going home
for this one.

615
00:26:17,103 --> 00:26:20,105
The sculpting
is really not good.

616
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:21,940
The veins
don't look convincing.

617
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:23,742
It just looks like a joke.

618
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,761
He is a giant chum bag,

619
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:46,331
and I think I have a really
good shot at winning this.

620
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,882
I think this is a solid makeup,

621
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,218
and I'm proud
of the realism aspect.

622
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:09,354
It's really everything
that I could have wanted.

623
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:26,538
I think my character
is really creepy,

624
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:28,306
and he looks gross
and villainous

625
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:30,308
and very scary.

626
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:52,697
Suddenly I realize
that my homecoming queen's sash

627
00:27:52,732 --> 00:27:54,065
is on backwards.

628
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,335
It definitely defeats
the illusion.

629
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:15,720
I think my baroness
looks awesome.

630
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:18,857
I just made
a really cool piece.

631
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:36,374
I love my creepy character,

632
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:39,177
and I feel great
about this makeup.

633
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,473
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

634
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,941
at our horror villains?

635
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:54,548
There's an interesting detail.

636
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:55,882
Oh, yeah, there we go.

637
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,084
Oh, that is so juicy.

638
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:58,785
That is juicy.

639
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,987
Oh, yeah.
That's good stuff.

640
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,389
Thanks.

641
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,494
Ooh. Without those horns,
this is a pig.

642
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:11,465
Nice delineation in the paint
going on into the hoof.

643
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,066
Yeah.

644
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:15,902
I assume it's meant
to be veins.

645
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,137
Yeah.

646
00:29:17,171 --> 00:29:18,805
It looks as if someone's
just gone mad.

647
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,941
I'm so upset
that they have to look

648
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,609
at this terrible makeup.

649
00:29:22,643 --> 00:29:24,511
I think it looked better
from farther away.

650
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:25,879
Yeah, real far.

651
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:26,980
I know that I messed up,

652
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:31,084
and I could absolutely
be going home.

653
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,587
Who made your favorite
horror villain?

654
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,957
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

655
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:44,095
I'm so upset that the judges

656
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,232
have to look at
this terrible makeup that I did.

657
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:49,467
I can't imagine them
liking anything.

658
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:55,106
Will you turn to the side
for us?

659
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:58,143
Let's see you open and close
your fake jaw.

660
00:29:58,177 --> 00:29:59,644
It's a cool idea.

661
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,279
We've never seen
this done before.

662
00:30:01,314 --> 00:30:03,014
No, it's very smart.

663
00:30:05,318 --> 00:30:06,685
I like the fingers.

664
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:09,521
Yeah, it's really horrible
in a good way.

665
00:30:09,555 --> 00:30:11,523
Yeah.

666
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:12,757
Oh, it's a great mouth.

667
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:15,427
But it's just a face
with boils on it.

668
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:18,029
There's not much more
going on than that.

669
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:19,564
Thanks.

670
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:25,203
- I think this is the spine...
- That's the vertebrae.

671
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:26,771
If you wouldn't have said that,

672
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:27,872
I wouldn't have known.

673
00:30:27,907 --> 00:30:29,374
It's overambitious.

674
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:34,612
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's creepy.

675
00:30:34,647 --> 00:30:35,880
This is such a cool idea.

676
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:38,016
I want there to be a story
that explains this.

677
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:43,021
I really do love
the forms on this.

678
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:44,923
Great pear head shape--

679
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:46,391
very hillbilly mutant,

680
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,959
- very successful.
- Yeah.

681
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:56,134
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

682
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:57,569
so let's find out
what they thought.

683
00:30:57,603 --> 00:31:00,105
Stella...

684
00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:03,074
Drew...

685
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:06,911
Damien...

686
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,980
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

687
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:10,815
and can head back
to the makeup room.

688
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,484
Thank you.

689
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:21,426
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

690
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,162
Now, the judges would like
to speak with each of you

691
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:25,730
to learn more about your work.

692
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:27,966
Rachael, please step up.

693
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,673
Tell me about the process,

694
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:37,942
how you went from the poster
into a makeup.

695
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:40,545
I had <i>Bone Appetit,</i>
so I thought, "Feast."

696
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,213
This is my baroness.

697
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:44,149
She throws these crazy, big,
wild parties,

698
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:45,517
and what the people don't know

699
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:46,985
is that she's actually a demon

700
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:49,454
feeding these people
other people.

701
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:53,425
I have to tell you
that I'm really impressed.

702
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:56,194
The mechanism in the chest
is really inspired.

703
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:58,696
This is
a wonderfully unique way

704
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,432
to have handled
the subject matter.

705
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:01,633
Thank you.

706
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:02,934
I like the tummy teeth,

707
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:07,038
but I think to actually
make it more into a mouth,

708
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,274
it needs to be
more moist looking.

709
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:12,477
This chest reveal,
conceptually,

710
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:14,078
I think is pretty compelling,

711
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:17,615
and I think that the animation
is so good.

712
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,517
I think this is
a successful character.

713
00:32:19,552 --> 00:32:22,574
Rachael, please step back.

714
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:29,360
Dina, you're next.

715
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:35,933
Tell us about the character
you've created.

716
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:38,469
The poster I chose
was <i>The Cloven,</i>

717
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:41,706
and this is
my outcast reindeer,

718
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,475
who loves torturing elves.

719
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,244
It misses the mark.

720
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,680
I can't get past the concept,

721
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:53,985
and although it's a reindeer,
it looks a very piggy reindeer.

722
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:57,488
The problem is
that the face is lacking

723
00:32:57,523 --> 00:32:58,923
in the detail department,

724
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:01,325
and this is<i> The Cloven.</i>

725
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,394
This is about the hoof.

726
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:04,529
It doesn't look like a hoof.

727
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:07,532
It feels like it could be
some kind of a vegetable

728
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:09,901
or a different creature,
like a crab claw or something.

729
00:33:09,935 --> 00:33:11,469
This concerns me.

730
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,772
Dina,
if you'd please step down.

731
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:23,414
- All right, let's talk to George.
- All right.

732
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:28,352
Tell us which poster you got

733
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:31,055
and the resulting character
you designed.

734
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:34,192
I chose <i>Axe Girlfriend,</i>
"Breakups can be hell."

735
00:33:34,226 --> 00:33:37,728
She was the mistress
of a rich man,

736
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:39,363
who popped her in the head,

737
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:41,999
so there's an entrance wound
over on this side,

738
00:33:42,034 --> 00:33:43,968
and it came up
and through her face

739
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:46,103
and blew all this nastiness
all over.

740
00:33:46,138 --> 00:33:48,739
I do like the character
head to toe.

741
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:51,676
The precision
that you've achieved

742
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,778
with the exit wound is great.

743
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:54,946
Thank you.

744
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,214
I think that you used

745
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:57,448
a really nice,
realistic approach--

746
00:33:57,483 --> 00:33:58,850
the silicone piece--

747
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:01,839
and you exercised
a lot of restraint.

748
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,341
Instead of trying to put
holes all over her,

749
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,511
just one wound,
which is telling your story.

750
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,480
I love all of that.

751
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,281
George, you can head back.

752
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,553
Good job.

753
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:18,155
Keaghlan, please step forward.

754
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,029
Tell us what movie poster
you chose.

755
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,931
I chose the <i>Homecoming Scream.</i>

756
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,801
She is a victim
of a senior prank

757
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,170
where she is pushed
off of bleachers

758
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:37,541
and breaks her neck and
twists her head halfway around.

759
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,445
It doesn't visually
communicate what your intent is.

760
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,015
Her breasts
are on her back, correct?

761
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,183
Yeah.

762
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,751
So her face needs
to be facing that way.

763
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,287
And then shouldn't
the "Homecoming Queen" banner

764
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,421
be on the other way too?

765
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,556
That was a mistake.

766
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,224
There's a lot of them.

767
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,493
Lois deciphered
what was going on.

768
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:58,896
I didn't know till she told me.

769
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,964
Hats off to you

770
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:04,434
for attempting something
so difficult,

771
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:09,597
but I don't like the sculpting.
That kind of blank full head

772
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:11,065
is neither here,
there, nor anywhere.

773
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,834
Keaghlan, you can step down.

774
00:35:19,975 --> 00:35:21,809
Cig, please come forward.

775
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:30,050
Tell us how your creature
comes from the poster.

776
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,552
I got <i>The Second Chumming.</i>

777
00:35:31,586 --> 00:35:33,621
There's
this salty old sea captain,

778
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:35,189
and the crew hates him,
so they kill him

779
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:37,157
and put him in the chum barrel,

780
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:40,828
where he fuses with the chum
and becomes a chum bag.

781
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:43,464
I think it's great fun.

782
00:35:43,498 --> 00:35:47,001
Using the chin as the tongue
is a very clever thing.

783
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:48,636
I've never seen it before.

784
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,671
This looks like a ton of work.

785
00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:54,441
There's a lot
of purposeful texture in there,

786
00:35:54,476 --> 00:35:56,777
and I'm really impressed
with your time management.

787
00:35:56,811 --> 00:35:57,845
Thank you.

788
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:00,447
Cig, please step back.

789
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:06,287
Sasha, please step up.

790
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:11,692
Hi, Sasha.

791
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,294
Tell us about your poster

792
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:15,429
and the character
that you designed.

793
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:18,332
The poster I chose
was <i>Bonnie and Cyanide.</i>

794
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:21,335
Bonnie has been poisoned
by her husband,

795
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:24,371
and she built these tools,

796
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:28,042
and she can stick the poison
into other people.

797
00:36:28,076 --> 00:36:31,645
Um...

798
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,515
It doesn't look anything
like what it is

799
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:37,451
that you were trying to do.

800
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:38,919
The veins are a disaster.

801
00:36:38,954 --> 00:36:42,656
It's as if you've never
seen a vein before in your life.

802
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:46,293
I understand
these engorged veins.

803
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:47,461
I get the concept,

804
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:50,497
but it's just
so poorly executed.

805
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,266
This is not your best work.

806
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,405
Sasha, you can head back.

807
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:04,845
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

808
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:06,513
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

809
00:37:06,548 --> 00:37:07,448
while they deliberate.

810
00:37:13,154 --> 00:37:14,455
All right, judges,
why don't we talk

811
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,557
about the looks you liked
the most this week?

812
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:17,992
Let's start with Rachael.

813
00:37:18,026 --> 00:37:19,426
- Big idea.
- Yeah.

814
00:37:19,461 --> 00:37:20,861
Done so well.

815
00:37:20,895 --> 00:37:23,297
Her greatest success is
that she looked at this poster,

816
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:26,100
and she pulled out
very creative visual cues.

817
00:37:26,134 --> 00:37:27,835
That's what this challenge
was all about.

818
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:29,103
Let's move on to Cig.

819
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:31,405
It was a huge amount of work.

820
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:32,873
There were some nice touches,

821
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:35,876
like that lovely skull detail
on the shoulder.

822
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,945
And it was such a cool idea

823
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:41,548
to make his lower jaw
stabilized by the chest

824
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,751
so that he could use
his head movement.

825
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:45,786
It's not been done
on this stage before.

826
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,421
Okay, let's move on to George.

827
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:50,190
The color painted
on the silicone appliance

828
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:51,392
looked really good.

829
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:53,193
And even though
it was a bloody character,

830
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:56,463
he did not pour gallons
of blood over the hair,

831
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:58,265
and that restraint shows

832
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:00,934
an advanced type of approach
to makeup effects.

833
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,936
All right, judges,
so before we move on

834
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:04,338
to the looks
you liked the least,

835
00:38:04,372 --> 00:38:06,040
I just want to remind you
that you do have

836
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:09,143
that special immunity
available to save somebody

837
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:10,911
to see some more of their work.

838
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:12,212
Let's move on to Dina.

839
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:15,282
This was not
a successful makeup.

840
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,818
I'm very concerned
how it illustrated

841
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:20,020
her lack
of anatomical knowledge.

842
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:21,889
And the sculpt of the deer head

843
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:23,924
and the cloven hooves--

844
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,527
none of it was good work.

845
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:27,961
All right,
let's move on to Keaghlan.

846
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:30,898
I wish more detail
had been spent on the face.

847
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:33,901
It became stone
rather than monochrome.

848
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:36,303
Having the vertebrae
in the front

849
00:38:36,337 --> 00:38:38,305
and the breasts on the back,
that's fine,

850
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:41,341
but the sculpture
of those two elements

851
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:43,243
was so soft and vague.

852
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:44,545
Let's move on to Sasha.

853
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,247
There was clearly
an apparent lack

854
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:48,982
of cardiovascular knowledge.

855
00:38:49,017 --> 00:38:51,418
It looked like a child
with crayons on the wall,

856
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:52,586
and that concerned me,

857
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,888
because she is
so much better than that.

858
00:38:54,923 --> 00:38:56,857
I just think
she was completely lost.

859
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,193
All right, then, judges,
have you made your decisions?

860
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:00,127
We have.

861
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:02,429
Let's bring them back out.

862
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,004
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

863
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,075
Rachael, we really liked
your character's backstory,

864
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,543
and we were particularly fond
of the way

865
00:39:16,578 --> 00:39:19,446
that you rigged the mouth
to your character's chest.

866
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,349
George, your villain
was definitely

867
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:24,813
one of the most realistic
makeups out there tonight,

868
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:27,020
and it was incredibly
well suited

869
00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:28,827
to your film poster.

870
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:31,596
And, Cig, we love
that you embraced

871
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:33,999
a gloriously gory concept,

872
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:35,500
and we were really impressed

873
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:37,602
with everything
that you were able to get done.

874
00:39:37,637 --> 00:39:39,871
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

875
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:42,607
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

876
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,153
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge?

877
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,589
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

878
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:56,559
George.

879
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,061
Yes!

880
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,697
Finally got one.
It means a lot.

881
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,333
We think your villain
was spot-on for this challenge,

882
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:05,935
and we can easily envision
her scaring people

883
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,171
at Universal Studios
Halloween Horror Nights.

884
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,173
- Great job.
- Thank you.

885
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,409
This is my first win.
It feels great.

886
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,611
People are gonna pay
to be scared by my makeup.

887
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:15,779
That's really cool.

888
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,480
George, congratulations.

889
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,882
Your makeup will be featured

890
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,984
at Universal Studios
Halloween Horror Nights,

891
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,887
Hollywood and Orlando.

892
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,524
You, Cig, and Rachael, can head
back to the makeup room.

893
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,733
Unfortunately,
that does mean the three of you

894
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,168
are on the bottom this week,

895
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,737
and one of you
will be eliminated.

896
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,540
If you'd please step forward.

897
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,082
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

898
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,618
Dina, we get that you wanted
to do something different,

899
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,253
but this was
a horror challenge,

900
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,589
and there's nothing scary
about your makeup.

901
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,826
Keaghlan,
it was a valiant effort,

902
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,361
but it was just too much work

903
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,130
with the timeline
for this challenge,

904
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,065
and that showed
in your final work.

905
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,568
Sasha,
between the poor sculpting

906
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,370
and the bizarre
paint decisions,

907
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,172
we really struggled
to find something

908
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,041
about this makeup
that we liked.

909
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,809
So who is going home tonight?

910
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,146
The person going home
tonight is...

911
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,817
Sasha.

912
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,286
We had a really hard time
understanding

913
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,622
where it was you were going
with this character.

914
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,624
It didn't work for us
on any level.

915
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,392
Sasha, I'm sorry,

916
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,661
but that means
you have been eliminated.

917
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:42,365
Dina, Keaghlan, you are safe

918
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,401
and can head
back to the makeup room.

919
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,376
Sasha, we really like
some of the work

920
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,111
that we' seen from you
in the past,

921
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:57,213
and we all know
that you're very talented...

922
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,114
Thank you.

923
00:41:59,115 --> 00:42:01,337
...which is precisely why
we've decided to use our

924
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:03,682
special immunity and save you
from elimination this week.

925
00:42:03,683 --> 00:42:05,490
Ahh!

926
00:42:05,491 --> 00:42:07,243
Me?

927
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:08,843
You.

928
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:11,709
You went way off
the rails this week,

929
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,544
but we know that you
are capable of much better work.

930
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:17,534
So, show us an amazing
makeup next week!

931
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,997
I promise so much.

932
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:21,046
I'm gonna make
something really good.

933
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:23,744
Good. Pull your socks up
next week.

934
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:24,745
My socks?

935
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:26,385
Oh, it's an expression.

936
00:42:26,386 --> 00:42:28,152
Put socks on,
then pull them up.

937
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:30,478
Okay, I will pull my socks up.

938
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:34,324
All right, Sasha, that means
you are safe this week.

939
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:36,465
You can head
back to the makeup room.

940
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:37,666
Thank you.

941
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,002
- Good luck.
- Ooh!

942
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,516
- Don't fall.
- Don't fall.

943
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,751
I won't fall.

944
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:44,491
I can't believe they saved me!

945
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:46,115
This is so awesome!

946
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:47,709
I was saved!

947
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:51,230
The save is gone,
and I am so focused now.

948
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:52,248
Welcome back!

949
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:54,397
I'm going to prove
to the judges

950
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:56,121
that they saved me
for a reason.
