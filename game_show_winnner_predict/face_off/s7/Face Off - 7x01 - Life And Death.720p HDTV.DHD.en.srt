1
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:06,795
This season on <i>Face Off,</i>

2
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:08,730
contestants will have to fight
for their lives

3
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:11,482
in an epic battle of life...

4
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:15,303
and death.

5
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:17,071
I'm so excited!

6
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:18,706
I hope I'm living
and not dying.

7
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:20,675
And it all starts off
with the biggest twist

8
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,611
- in<i> Face Off</i> history.
- Oh, dear.

9
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:26,548
We've never seen anything
like this on <i>Face Off</i> before.

10
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:29,250
I can't wait to see
what kind of freakish makeups

11
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:31,119
you guys come up with.

12
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:32,520
Challenge after challenge...

13
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:33,788
Oh, boy.

14
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:35,690
...they'll try to climb
their way to the top...

15
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:36,991
I quit my job to do this.

16
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:38,493
...and conquer their rivals.

17
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:40,995
I want this so bad.

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,730
There's no room for mistakes.

19
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:44,098
This is crazy.

20
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,433
It's life or death.

21
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,368
But to make it to the end,
they'll have to contend

22
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:49,204
with our award-winning panel
of judges...

23
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:50,238
It's beautiful.

24
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:51,806
Including our new series judge,

25
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,474
Oscar winner Lois Burwell.

26
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:56,144
I really like it.

27
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:59,480
Find out who survives now.

28
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:00,982
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

29
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,954
This season is gonna be nuts.

30
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,798
Boom.

31
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:20,401
We walk into this huge,
incredibly intimidating hall.

32
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:24,339
One side is black.
The other is white.

33
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:27,008
The makeup stock
is out of this world.

34
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:28,409
I'm just blown away by it.

35
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:29,644
Holy cow.

36
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:31,246
- There's the vacuform machine.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,314
It looks look like they
brought most of the lab over.

38
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:34,649
Look who it is.

39
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:36,584
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,319
McKenzie's standing
at the head of the room.

41
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:40,521
I'm like,
"This is really happening."

42
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:43,658
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

43
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,666
This is
the Vibiana event space--

44
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,968
formerly the cathedral
of St. Vibiana

45
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:57,772
and the site of countless
baptisms and funerals.

46
00:01:57,806 --> 00:02:01,175
That's why we are here today.

47
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,979
This season of<i> Face Off</i>
is all about life...

48
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:06,848
and death.

49
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:09,684
- Yes.
- And this starts right now.

50
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:14,088
Because none of you
are actually on the show yet...

51
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,189
Oh, no.

52
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:17,158
Oh, boy.

53
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,359
I'm sorry, what?

54
00:02:18,394 --> 00:02:22,263
Today will be
your final audition.

55
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:25,300
I'm not even a contestant yet?

56
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:27,769
I think I'm going to throw up
in my mouth a little bit.

57
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:30,371
You'll be fighting
for your life

58
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:32,106
in a sudden-death challenge

59
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,742
to earn a spot on this season
of<i> Face Off.</i>

60
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:39,380
We only have room
for 14 of you,

61
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:41,950
which means that two of you
will be eliminated

62
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:43,952
before ever moving
into the house

63
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:46,788
or stepping foot into the lab.

64
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:49,657
I actually quit my job
to be on the show.

65
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:52,927
So, if I go home now,
I have nothing to go home to.

66
00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:56,631
You will have four hours
to create a character

67
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:59,500
that represents
either life or death

68
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:02,637
while showcasing who you are
as an artist.

69
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:06,708
On my go, I want you to pick
a life or death workstation.

70
00:03:06,742 --> 00:03:09,010
On each is a box
with an item inside

71
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:11,512
that you must use
in your makeups.

72
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:15,049
This is your only chance
to earn a spot on the show.

73
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,484
Is everyone ready?

74
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:18,252
- Yeah.
- Yes.

75
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:20,755
On your marks, get set,

76
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:22,090
go.

77
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:24,058
As soon as McKenzie says "Go,"

78
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:25,860
everyone's
falling over each other.

79
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,595
- It's absolutely insane.
- Fuck!

80
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,130
I was going to stop and help,

81
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:31,232
but I was like,
"No, keep my eye on the prize."

82
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,233
Okay.

83
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:33,501
I open up my box,

84
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,903
and it's this
huge ripped-throat appliance,

85
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:37,772
so I'm thinking
she was murdered.

86
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:40,041
It looks like your throat
is gonna be ripped out.

87
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,409
I'm completely self-taught.

88
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:42,810
When I was 13 years old,

89
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:45,179
I started doing haunted houses
in my backyard.

90
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:47,415
I've never been
in a professional lab at all,

91
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:50,151
so this is really
the opportunity of a lifetime.

92
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:53,421
Ah, this is what I wanted.

93
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,722
My name is Keaghlan.

94
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:58,092
I am a freelance makeup artist
from Oxnard, California.

95
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:00,528
I fell into makeup
through musical theater

96
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:01,562
when I was in high school,

97
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:03,297
and it just ballooned
from there.

98
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:06,034
I love loud, beautiful,
crazy characters,

99
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,069
so I chose the life side.

100
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:11,139
I want to create a really
ethereal goddess-like character,

101
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:12,807
and I'm ecstatic

102
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,109
because the prosthetic
that I got is perfect.

103
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:17,311
That is gorgeous.

104
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:19,735
_

105
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,176
_

106
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:23,707
_

107
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:25,153
First, I fall down,

108
00:04:25,187 --> 00:04:26,988
and I don't make it
to the death side.

109
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:30,491
Now the neck prosthetic
in my box is scarred

110
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:32,927
as if someone was burned.

111
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:36,597
How am I gonna incorporate this
into a life makeup?

112
00:04:36,632 --> 00:04:37,899
My name is Scott.

113
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,367
About three years back,

114
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,203
my son and I took
special-effects classes,

115
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:43,738
rejuvenating the passion
I've had

116
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:45,506
since I was ten years old.

117
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,842
I hope<i> Face Off</i> will give me
the opportunity

118
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,011
to pursue a career
in special-effects makeup.

119
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:52,046
I got to make you
some eyeholes here.

120
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,581
Finally, I decide to turn

121
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,283
this neck piece
into a face piece.

122
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:58,119
You're gonna be
an intergalactic savior.

123
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:00,855
I may be down,
but I'm not giving up.

124
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:08,729
Let's see where these
fit on you.

125
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,765
I'm Drew, and I teach

126
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:13,201
at the Tom Savini school
of make-up effects,

127
00:05:13,235 --> 00:05:17,071
but my end goal is to work
in a shop or on set.

128
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:18,272
- Nice!
- Yeah.

129
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:21,142
There are actually
two prosthetics in my box,

130
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,894
so I put the tumor-y face piece
on his chin.

131
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:25,227
_

132
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:26,827
_

133
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,308
_

134
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:29,951
I decide that my character

135
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,686
is a foot soldier
from the underworld,

136
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,222
who comes to deal death
upon the living

137
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:37,024
through disease and pestilence.

138
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:40,461
All right, I guess
we're going a little tribally.

139
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:41,596
Okay.

140
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,598
Let's see how this goes on.
Cool.

141
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,032
I decide
to make my character...

142
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,668
♪ the life warrior ♪

143
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:48,870
You know, life's a struggle.

144
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:50,938
People have to fight
their way through it.

145
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:53,441
We're fighting off death,
which is creeping on you.

146
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,244
My name is Cig Neutron.

147
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:59,447
I'm originally
from New Castle, Indiana.

148
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,382
As soon as I graduated
makeup school,

149
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,851
I flew like a bat out of hell
across the country

150
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:05,353
and ended up in LA.

151
00:06:05,387 --> 00:06:08,689
I've been making monsters
for about five years now.

152
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:11,192
Hopefully, my kooky craziness
is going to take me to the end,

153
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,723
because I really want
to win this.

154
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:14,272
_

155
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,627
_

156
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:19,133
What are we going to do
with this guy?

157
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:23,538
My box has this brown nose,
upper-lip prosthetic,

158
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:26,741
and I have no idea
what I'm going to do.

159
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:28,075
And I see this jacket

160
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,378
that goes with the prosthetic
I have.

161
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:33,047
You're going to be
an elven pirate

162
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,850
that travels the seas
healing people.

163
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:38,786
I'm Barry, and I'm
a dental laboratory technician.

164
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,688
Making teeth pays the bills,

165
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:42,623
but my true passion
is making monsters,

166
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:45,693
so winning<i> Face Off</i>
would change my life,

167
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:47,461
not just my career.

168
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:49,263
I have a three-year-old son
at home.

169
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:51,065
Being able to put
just a little bit of money away

170
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,601
for his college
would mean everything.

171
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:56,971
I got these cool little tubes,
kind of, like, alien.

172
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:58,606
So you're gonna be mechanical
on the inside

173
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,041
and live forever.

174
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:01,976
I'm George,
and I've been a professional

175
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,178
special-effects artist
for eight years.

176
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:05,580
I've worked on big movies,

177
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:08,082
but I wasn't on set for them
or designing things.

178
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:09,617
I was just doing
what I was told.

179
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,786
So I'm still struggling,

180
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,188
but I'm hoping that<i> Face Off's</i>
gonna push my career

181
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:15,690
into a different level.

182
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:17,358
Could you imagine the headline?

183
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:22,230
"Winner of<i> Face Off</i> season 7
directs new sci-fi movie."

184
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:23,798
That'd be cool.

185
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:33,641
It's a pretty
gnarly piece here.

186
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:35,810
Inside my box,
I get bulging nerves,

187
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:38,479
so I put it on her neck
as some sort of bite wound.

188
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,581
I'm making
some kind of vampire.

189
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:41,582
Mm.

190
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:42,817
My name is Doc.

191
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,386
I've been special-effects makeup
for seven years.

192
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,988
My work has been
in theme parks,

193
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:48,990
but I would like to work
in film.

194
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,424
I've auditioned
for every season.

195
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,926
So to finally get here

196
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,761
and then immediately
McKenzie says,

197
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:56,931
"You're not on the show yet,"
is just gut-wrenching,

198
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,900
so I'm not taking no
for an answer at this point.

199
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:07,275
I don't even know
what to do with this.

200
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,843
My name is Gabby.

201
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:10,444
I'm a self-taught artist

202
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,713
doing special effects
on my own in Ohio.

203
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:15,049
I don't have a lot of access
to supplies.

204
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,185
I've had to make do with stuff
from the local grocery store,

205
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,821
so using professional makeup
is very exciting.

206
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,123
Stop shaking.

207
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:24,492
This huge boil-y prosthetic
doesn't fit

208
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:27,728
this more ethereal character
I wanted to do.

209
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:30,431
He's a creature that embodies

210
00:08:30,465 --> 00:08:33,868
those self-defeating thoughts
that everybody has.

211
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:35,703
Now that I've cut up
the prosthetic,

212
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,405
there's no going back
from that.

213
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,340
I have to make it work
for my design.

214
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:40,374
Ahh.

215
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,011
I'm Sasha.

216
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:45,746
I discovered my passion
for makeup

217
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,381
when I built life-size monsters

218
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,283
for ceramics class
in high school

219
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:51,986
and went directly to cinema
makeup school that summer.

220
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,221
Mother Raven, Maven,
that's your name.

221
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:56,157
My character haunts
the graveyard

222
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,125
where she was attacked
by a whole bunch of crows.

223
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,861
You kill people
that come into your graveyard.

224
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:03,831
But the mechanical eye piece
in my box

225
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,032
has nothing to do with death,

226
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,368
so I don't want to use it
on the eye.

227
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:10,638
I'm putting it on her hand
as a piece of jewelry.

228
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:11,906
This is a huge risk--

229
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,140
disregarding the piece

230
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,909
that I'm supposed to be using
on the face,

231
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:17,712
but I know that is gonna make
this makeup better.

232
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:23,184
Dina, did you come across
the wig cap anywhere?

233
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:25,820
Yeah, it was there
on the bottom.

234
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:26,821
My name is Dina.

235
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,289
I'm from Chicago, Illinois,

236
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:31,225
and I've been a cake decorator
for about eight years now,

237
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,661
but I decided
to change careers.

238
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,364
With cakes, I'm limited
with what I am able to create,

239
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:39,467
but with special effects,
I can create anything.

240
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,402
I had pointed ears in my box,

241
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:44,071
so I'm making my character
into a forest nymph.

242
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,744
My box had a pair
of monster hands in it,

243
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:52,713
so my character is gonna be
a harbinger of death.

244
00:09:52,748 --> 00:09:54,348
Man, it's been a while
since I've done this.

245
00:09:54,383 --> 00:09:55,683
I'm so rusty.

246
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:58,486
I won an Emmy in 1993
working under Michael Westmore

247
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,815
on<i> Star Trek, Death Space Nine,</i>

248
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,423
but I left the industry
15 years ago,

249
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:07,599
so my wife and I could raise
our family in San Diego.

250
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:11,036
I'm hoping that this competition
will be a second chance for me.

251
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:13,959
_

252
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,261
_

253
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:18,143
Everybody stop working!

254
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,946
Oh, no.
Now what?

255
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,282
There's another part
of this challenge

256
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:24,650
that I didn't tell you about.

257
00:10:24,684 --> 00:10:26,351
Oh, dear.

258
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:28,687
Oh, my God.
No.

259
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,688
Coming up...

260
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:30,956
Oh, my God.

261
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,324
I'm functioning on panic.

262
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,626
Don't fall.

263
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:36,628
- It's kind of amazing.
- Oh, man.

264
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:38,697
I've never been more nervous
in my life.

265
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:41,880
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

266
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:46,585
We're 30 minutes into
our life and death challenge,

267
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:48,821
which is actually
our last audition.

268
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:51,490
Two of us will be eliminated
right away.

269
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:52,858
It's terrifying.

270
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:55,894
Everybody stop working!

271
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,529
- Oh, dear.
- Come on over here.

272
00:10:57,564 --> 00:10:59,298
Oh, my God.
No.

273
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,567
And, of course, it's <i>Face Off.</i>

274
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:04,369
Twists are on their way.

275
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:07,306
Makeup artists must have
the ability to adapt

276
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,908
to the creative whims
of a producer, director,

277
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:12,277
and the ever-evolving script.

278
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,880
So I've brought something
for each of you

279
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:17,649
to incorporate
into your makeups.

280
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,785
But before I give them to you,

281
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:22,454
I thought I would bring
in an expert on life and death

282
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:24,356
who could give you
a little bit of advice here.

283
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,924
He's the star
of the upcoming films,

284
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,893
<i>Fear Clinic</i>
and<i> The Last Showing,</i>

285
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:29,561
and he's a horror icon,

286
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,698
known for his role in the
<i>Nightmare On Elm Street</i> films.

287
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:39,805
Please give a warm welcome
to Mr. Freddy Krueger himself,

288
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,240
Robert Englund.

289
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:45,344
Oh, thank you!

290
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:47,045
Oh, my God.

291
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,248
Robert Englund
had a huge impact on my youth.

292
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,750
It's just a complete honor
to even be in his presence.

293
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,519
You're all my children now.

294
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,889
All right, so, Robert,
what advice

295
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,925
can you give these guys
on creating a convincing makeup?

296
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,627
Pay attention to your model.

297
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,829
Look at his face
and build on that.

298
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:06,265
I think one of the successes
of the Freddy makeup

299
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,533
was that they kept some

300
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,002
of my own
facial structure there,

301
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,237
which I was able
to animate easier.

302
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,939
Freddy had the awesome hat.

303
00:12:13,973 --> 00:12:15,707
He had the bladed glove.

304
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:17,109
How do you feel those items

305
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:19,177
helped create the character
that he was?

306
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:21,680
Well, you know,
we actors love accessories.

307
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:24,182
I mean,
I was inspired by the claw.

308
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:27,252
I was able to use it
an evil extension

309
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:28,654
of Freddy's own madness.

310
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:29,821
That's so cool.

311
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,024
All right, well,
here are your items.

312
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:35,527
Remember,
this is life or death.

313
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:37,829
So come and get 'em.

314
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,831
- Good luck.
- Bye-bye.

315
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,401
Yes.

316
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:43,402
What the hell?

317
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:44,903
I'm Stella.

318
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,973
I just got this diamond broach,

319
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:51,343
but my character is
a fertility goddess for animals,

320
00:12:51,377 --> 00:12:54,913
so this broach doesn't fit
with my makeup at all.

321
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:58,517
Oh, this accessory is going
to be the death of me.

322
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:00,319
I'm 34 years old.

323
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:03,155
I feel like I've started makeup
really late in life.

324
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:07,593
I studied drama at NYU
but gravitated towards makeup.

325
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,528
Two years after I graduated,

326
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:11,763
I decided to do makeup
full-time.

327
00:13:11,798 --> 00:13:14,866
Last year I took second place
at IMATS, London,

328
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:17,135
which was
such a confidence booster,

329
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,372
but I definitely think
I'm going home at this point,

330
00:13:20,406 --> 00:13:22,507
because I don't know what I'm
going to do with this broach.

331
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,076
Figure it out later.

332
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,045
- Okay.
- I'll get you painted.

333
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,551
God, not what I'm going for.

334
00:13:32,585 --> 00:13:33,919
My name is Rachael.

335
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:35,587
I'm from Chapel Hill,
North Carolina.

336
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:38,523
I graduated from
make-up designory in New York

337
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:39,858
in 2012.

338
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:42,527
I have Southern sensibilities
with a New York edge.

339
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:47,332
I like refined things,
but I also have a lot of sass,

340
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,968
and I'm willing to put something
up in your face,

341
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,237
and I think
that's gonna give me an edge

342
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,372
over my competitors.

343
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:54,840
Close your eyes for me.

344
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:56,708
My original concept
was a sea goddess

345
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,945
because there were
two seashell pieces in my box.

346
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,314
Now I have to incorporate fur,

347
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:04,316
which has nothing to do
with a sea goddess.

348
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,586
Fortunately,
I find a wolf nose,

349
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,622
and I change my concept
to a land and sea goddess.

350
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:15,193
I don't think it's as strong
as it was, so I'm worried.

351
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,366
This just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

352
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,635
I'm Jason. I'm almost
completely self-taught.

353
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,672
I have my own very small line
of silicone props,

354
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:27,939
but my full-time job

355
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,008
is running one of
the busiest kitchens in Atlanta.

356
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:31,743
Ultimately,
I want to do makeup full-time.

357
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:33,145
This is a puzzle.

358
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:36,014
There was a tumor-y and veiny
forehead piece in my box,

359
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:37,683
so I decided to make
a cancer victim,

360
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:40,385
but now I got to incorporate
this spiky gauntlet,

361
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,087
so I need to change my concept.

362
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:45,023
I come across a shirt that looks
worn-out and very low-class.

363
00:14:45,024 --> 00:14:46,717
_

364
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:47,923
_

365
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,061
I think the gauntlets
work better

366
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,495
with a "medieval peasant

367
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,531
that's been rotting
in the sewers" concept.

368
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,499
It's very weak,
but I don't have a lot of time,

369
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,234
so I just kind of
keep moving along.

370
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,720
_

371
00:14:59,305 --> 00:15:01,373
How are things?

372
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:02,541
Oh, shit.

373
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,010
You sound like me.

374
00:15:05,044 --> 00:15:06,378
I'm Gwen.

375
00:15:06,412 --> 00:15:08,714
I've wanted to be in
this industry since I was six.

376
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:11,049
I was terrified of monsters

377
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:14,052
until my mom had me watch a show
on special effects

378
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,587
to see that monsters
aren't real.

379
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:17,756
Ever since then,
I wanted to be the person

380
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,725
to make those
terrifying creatures.

381
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,827
This isn't quite working out
the way I wanted it to.

382
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:22,961
That's okay.

383
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:25,397
My character
is the personification of death

384
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:27,199
as he moves through time.

385
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:30,302
I've already glued down the vein
prosthetic that was in the box,

386
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,370
and I was given bison teeth
as an accessory item,

387
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:35,307
and I'm thinking, "Yes, doesn't
affect the concept at all."

388
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:36,608
I'll just use them
as a necklace.

389
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:39,478
Maybe they're a trophy
that he gets.

390
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:41,313
One hour left!

391
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:46,184
Time is flying by,

392
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:47,953
and I'm trying to work
as quickly as possible.

393
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:52,591
So I make a piping bag
and pipe on water-type veins.

394
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,826
Maybe my cake decorating skills

395
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:57,696
will pay off
in this competition.

396
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,097
Oh, my God.

397
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:00,198
I'm functioning on panic.

398
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,768
He's not looking anything close

399
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,302
to what I want him
to look like.

400
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,439
I'm just hoping
I survive this one.

401
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:10,942
Ten minutes, everybody!
You got ten minutes!

402
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:12,811
Now it's starting to get there.

403
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:13,912
It looks badass.

404
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:18,569
Don't fall!

405
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:24,523
Time is up, everybody!

406
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:25,824
Brushes down!

407
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:30,228
_

408
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:31,830
I feel pretty good
about my character,

409
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:34,366
but there's some really tough
competition here.

410
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,668
I can tell everyone's
still really nervous.

411
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:38,904
Two people
are going to be eliminated,

412
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:40,105
and looking around,

413
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,108
I think I could be going
home today.

414
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:53,414
We're just really relieved
that that four hours is over,

415
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,783
but I can tell everyone's
still really nervous.

416
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:58,153
This is
a sudden-death challenge,

417
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:00,188
and two of us are going home.

418
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:03,158
Why don't we take a look
at your creations?

419
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:05,326
Let's start
with the life-themed makeups.

420
00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:20,942
I am really happy.

421
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:24,345
I think I filled my character
concept really well.

422
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,525
I'm very disappointed.

423
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,894
I'm hoping that
they will overlook

424
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,629
many of my mishaps.

425
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:57,445
She might not be covered
head to toe in paint,

426
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,681
but she is
a full, realized character.

427
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,194
I'm a little worried.

428
00:18:13,229 --> 00:18:14,662
It's an old-age makeup,

429
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:16,331
but it's also a robot makeup,

430
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:18,366
and I'm just hoping to God
it all works.

431
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,679
Since I did
his whole upper body,

432
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:33,581
I feel pretty good
about my character.

433
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:34,983
I think it looks cool.

434
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,063
I look at my model,

435
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:50,565
and I think
she's pretty gorgeous.

436
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,400
She really stands out.

437
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,413
I see a full character,

438
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:07,215
and I'm so proud of something
that I accomplished

439
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:08,983
in such a short period of time.

440
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:23,765
This was a brutal challenge.

441
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,200
All I want to be is safe.

442
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,438
Okay, it's time to check out

443
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:33,141
the makeups
from the death theme.

444
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:47,455
I like my character,

445
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,390
but I can't stop thinking
about the piece

446
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:51,392
that I'm supposed to be using
on the face.

447
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:05,306
My character
does have presence,

448
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:08,242
but it's not exactly as crisp
as I would have liked,

449
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:09,977
and I'm kind of bummed out
about that.

450
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:23,858
It's not great,

451
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,593
but it kind of showcases
who I am,

452
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:28,029
and I'm happy
with the way it looks.

453
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,043
I'm horrified.

454
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:45,146
It's an unacceptable makeup,
and I absolutely know it.

455
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:00,495
I think she really
speaks death,

456
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:01,796
but two of us are going home,

457
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,464
and I'm really hoping
that I'm good enough

458
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:04,766
to at least stay here.

459
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,646
From head to toe,
I love the look.

460
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,948
It has the feel of death.

461
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,017
I just hope that the judges
feel the same way.

462
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,264
I think it worked out.

463
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:38,232
I look at the character,
and I'm thinking,

464
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:40,301
"He looks pretty evil.
He looks scary."

465
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,715
I think my makeup captures
the death element,

466
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,384
but the makeup's not that good,

467
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,753
and I'm stressed out
about the double elimination.

468
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:03,591
I'm sure you're wondering

469
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,460
who's going to judge
your makeups.

470
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:06,727
- Yes.
- Yeah.

471
00:22:06,762 --> 00:22:08,796
Guys, come on out.

472
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:15,102
Hello.

473
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:17,605
Say hello to our incredibly
talented judges--

474
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,807
Glenn Hetrick and Neville Page.

475
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:21,142
Hi.

476
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:23,244
It's incredibly exciting
to see Glenn and Neville

477
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:24,645
for the first time

478
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,280
and also
incredibly intimidating.

479
00:22:26,315 --> 00:22:27,849
Well, I'm sure you're wondering

480
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:30,351
where our fabulous Ve Neill is.

481
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:32,153
She's actually working
on the set

482
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:34,088
of<i> The Hunger Games, Mockingjay,</i>

483
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:37,191
but she will be joining us
on the reveal stage tomorrow,

484
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:38,926
and she has a big surprise
for you.

485
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:40,695
All right, well,
I'm sure you guys

486
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:42,497
are eager
to check out the makeups,

487
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:44,532
so why don't you
take a closer look?

488
00:22:44,566 --> 00:22:46,267
Okay.

489
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:52,607
What is this in terms of life?

490
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:54,141
I don't know.

491
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:57,311
Watching the judges
is very stressful.

492
00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:59,947
Just slapping the fishnets
on the jacket

493
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:02,016
seems like a complete waste
of that element.

494
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,885
It's very important
that they find

495
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,722
some sort of good in my makeup,
otherwise I'm doomed.

496
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:13,394
Which group was
your favorite-- life or death?

497
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:15,963
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

498
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:21,419
Was this a purposeful choice?

499
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:22,854
Yeah.

500
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:24,722
I'm hoping that the judges see

501
00:23:24,757 --> 00:23:27,992
that I tried to be innovative
in altering the prosthetic.

502
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:31,829
- It's a cohesive idea.
- Yeah.

503
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:34,265
This I don't like.

504
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:36,534
Ooh.
Thank you.

505
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:38,636
This is extraordinarily
complete.

506
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,704
It's kind of amazing.

507
00:23:39,738 --> 00:23:42,407
It echoes the model's beauty.

508
00:23:42,441 --> 00:23:44,041
All right, here we go.

509
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:46,210
Well, that's a really cool way

510
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:47,945
to make a werewolf face
not a werewolf face.

511
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,147
Yeah.

512
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:52,884
What a massive amount of paint.

513
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,118
God, it's everywhere.

514
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:55,486
Thank you.

515
00:23:57,489 --> 00:23:59,657
Now, this cold blue thing
could look like death--

516
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,092
quite the opposite.

517
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:03,361
Yeah.
All right, guys. Thank you.

518
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:05,062
Let's take a look
at the death characters.

519
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,703
The rib-bone idea
is both brave and effective.

520
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:13,738
Yeah.

521
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,342
Oh, man.

522
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:21,012
I like the idea
of breaking it up,

523
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:22,980
but it's just black, blue.

524
00:24:23,015 --> 00:24:25,283
It's weird.

525
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:26,717
That's kind of
a cool paint job,

526
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:29,454
and then it just goes to mud
real quick.

527
00:24:29,488 --> 00:24:30,822
Thank you.

528
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:34,225
Bison teeth--
they're fantastic,

529
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:35,660
and to just turn them
into a necklace

530
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:37,361
is a serious lost opportunity.

531
00:24:37,396 --> 00:24:38,763
Thank you.

532
00:24:38,797 --> 00:24:41,999
Super-cool color choices.

533
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:44,735
It's a head-to-toe
complete package.

534
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:48,473
- Gear forehead.
- Where's that--

535
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:49,941
On the hand maybe?

536
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:52,376
Bingo.
Actually, that's pretty cool.

537
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,448
There's nothing unique
about the application,

538
00:24:57,483 --> 00:24:58,916
- and that's disappointing.
- Yeah.

539
00:24:58,951 --> 00:25:00,485
Thank you, models.

540
00:25:04,623 --> 00:25:07,024
All right, so how do you think
the artists did

541
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:08,493
for their final audition?

542
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:09,594
I was pretty impressed.

543
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:11,329
You guys did a really good job

544
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:12,930
first time
out of the gate here,

545
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:16,267
but there were a few
that really fell short.

546
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:20,304
Okay, guys, the judges and I
will see you tomorrow

547
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:21,873
on the reveal stage,

548
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:23,274
where they will decide

549
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:26,744
which 14 of you will move on
and compete for the VIP trip

550
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,179
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

551
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:31,415
to one of their
85 international locations,

552
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,252
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

553
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:36,254
and $100,000.

554
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:37,822
I really want to win.

555
00:25:37,856 --> 00:25:40,424
100 grand would be my ticket
out of the real world.

556
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:42,059
It would be a dream come true.

557
00:25:42,094 --> 00:25:44,929
Why don't you go back
to the hotel and get some rest?

558
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:45,963
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

559
00:25:45,998 --> 00:25:47,798
- Good night.
- See you, guys.

560
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,134
It's been a rough
and extremely stressful day,

561
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:52,003
and now we have to wait
until tomorrow

562
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:55,339
to see whose head's
on the chopping block.

563
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:17,728
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

564
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:21,031
Tonight 14 of you
will earn a spot on this season,

565
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:23,400
but two of you
will be eliminated.

566
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:27,138
You guys had the pleasure
of seeing Glenn and Neville

567
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,206
yesterday
at your final audition,

568
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:30,775
but let's give a warm welcome

569
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:33,611
to our Oscar
and Emmy award-winning judge,

570
00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:34,712
Ve Neill.

571
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:38,315
Whoo!

572
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,318
Yes.
Ve's awesome.

573
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:43,854
I've always had a great respect
for her and for her work,

574
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:47,491
and I think what she's done
is brilliance.

575
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,893
Thank you.

576
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,728
Now, I know you're working
on the latest films

577
00:26:50,762 --> 00:26:52,296
in the<i> Hunger Games</i> franchise,

578
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,899
and unfortunately,
you won't be able to join us

579
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:55,966
for most of the season.

580
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:57,401
Yes, that's right, McKenzie.

581
00:26:57,435 --> 00:27:00,104
I'm only going to be here
for a couple of episodes,

582
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,139
but you are going to be
in very good hands.

583
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:03,474
I assure you.

584
00:27:03,508 --> 00:27:04,975
I'm very disappointed.

585
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,877
I love Ve's opinions,

586
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:09,280
and I was really looking forward
to hearing

587
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:11,215
what she has to say
about my work this season.

588
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:13,617
Well, Ve,
you certainly will be missed,

589
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:16,487
and with that said,
I'm excited to say,

590
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:19,290
we're adding another talented
judge to our panel this season.

591
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:21,826
Her resume is filled

592
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,695
with some of Hollywood's
most iconic films,

593
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:28,265
like<i> The Fifth Element,</i>
<i>War Of The Worlds,</i> and<i> Lincoln.</i>

594
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,466
She also won an Oscar

595
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:33,003
for her unforgettable work
in<i> Braveheart.</i>

596
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,207
Please give a warm welcome
to Lois Burwell.

597
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,047
Hello.

598
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,015
So great to have you here
with us this season.

599
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,751
Thank you so much.
I'm delighted to be here.

600
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:49,687
Lois is
an amazing makeup artist,

601
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,689
and I am so excited.

602
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:55,759
I think she is going to have
some really great advice for us.

603
00:27:55,794 --> 00:27:57,828
Okay, let's get down
to business, guys.

604
00:27:57,863 --> 00:28:01,332
Now, Glenn and Neville have
brought the ladies up to speed,

605
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:04,602
and the judges have separated
you into two groups.

606
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:05,936
One group is safe

607
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:08,138
and has earned their way
on to the show.

608
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:09,306
The other group represents

609
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:12,710
the week's best
and worst looks.

610
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:15,980
Group one is Cig,

611
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:18,382
Rachael, Stella,

612
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:21,318
Damien, George,

613
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:23,654
Drew, Barry,

614
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:25,823
and Doc.

615
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:29,193
Now if I didn't call your name,
you're in group two.

616
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:31,061
If you please go ahead and stand
with your new groups.

617
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:40,571
The group
that has earned its way

618
00:28:40,605 --> 00:28:43,807
on to this season
of<i> Face Off</i> is...

619
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:47,912
Group one.

620
00:28:47,946 --> 00:28:49,546
Whoo!

621
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:55,252
I'm on the show!

622
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:56,453
That is awesome.

623
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:58,422
I'm so relieved.

624
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:01,659
It's on.
It is so on.

625
00:29:01,693 --> 00:29:03,193
Congratulation, you guys.

626
00:29:03,228 --> 00:29:06,030
Group one, you can head
backstage and celebrate.

627
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:08,465
Group two, the judges
would like to speak with you

628
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,134
before making their decisions.

629
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:12,069
If you would please join me
over here.

630
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:23,347
Kaeghlan, please step forward.

631
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:30,354
- Hi, Kaeghlan.
- Hi.

632
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:33,023
Tell us the idea
behind this makeup.

633
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:35,125
I wanted to do a creative muse,

634
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,962
so I made a character
that's an inspiration

635
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:39,897
behind all creativity.

636
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:43,867
This is an impressive
first showing.

637
00:29:43,902 --> 00:29:46,637
This feels like you incorporated
not just a goddess,

638
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:48,072
but something more specific,

639
00:29:48,106 --> 00:29:50,474
which is, like,
the Hindu pantheon.

640
00:29:50,508 --> 00:29:52,476
It's pretty exceptional
for the time that you had.

641
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,911
Thank you.

642
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:55,212
I think
she's absolutely beautiful.

643
00:29:55,246 --> 00:29:56,547
You made great use
of your model,

644
00:29:56,581 --> 00:29:58,482
and it's
a lovely color palette.

645
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,284
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

646
00:30:00,318 --> 00:30:04,555
I particularly like the way
the headdress looks like a halo.

647
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:05,656
- Thank you.
- It's lovely.

648
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,991
Thank you very much, Kaeghlan.

649
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:08,692
If you would please step back.

650
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,031
- Good job.
- Thank you.

651
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:16,266
Sasha, if you would please
step forward.

652
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:23,374
Tell me a little
about this character.

653
00:30:23,408 --> 00:30:26,343
This is Maven,
the mother of the raven.

654
00:30:26,378 --> 00:30:28,846
She died in a graveyard

655
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,382
and tells all the crows
to attack

656
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,017
whoever comes in her graveyard.

657
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:35,886
The main piece
is your gear forehead,

658
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,921
and you kind of ignored it,

659
00:30:37,956 --> 00:30:41,525
but the end result is you have
a nice, solid character.

660
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:44,795
To me, it works.

661
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:47,865
It's a striking character,
and it's well applied.

662
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:48,866
Thank you.

663
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,534
It's not extremely death,

664
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:55,372
but you managed to put together
a really beautiful character,

665
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:57,841
- so I think it's successful.
- Thank you so much.

666
00:30:57,876 --> 00:31:00,177
Thank you very much, Sasha.
Please step back.

667
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:07,351
Scott, please step up.

668
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:13,857
Begin by telling us
what you wanted to achieve

669
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:15,025
with this makeup.

670
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,327
He's a celestial soldier

671
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:19,963
who battles the infernal forces

672
00:31:19,998 --> 00:31:24,068
in order to regain the souls
that are taken by the demonic.

673
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:28,472
This is not a makeup
that works.

674
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:31,408
The use of the pieces
isn't that fabulous.

675
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:32,976
The color is off,

676
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:35,579
and this is not
a living makeup to me.

677
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:39,416
My main focus was supposed
to be the scarred-neck piece.

678
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:41,618
To me,
that didn't really emulate life,

679
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:43,754
so I constructed
the facial piece

680
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:45,722
using the neck piece.

681
00:31:45,757 --> 00:31:48,025
That's a loathsome use
of the neck appliance.

682
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:50,394
I think you should have put that
on the neck

683
00:31:50,428 --> 00:31:52,362
and then come up
with another backstory.

684
00:31:52,397 --> 00:31:54,565
Everything is just so wrong
about this.

685
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,034
I'm really disappointed.

686
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:58,635
Scott, please step back.

687
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,937
Thank you.

688
00:32:04,476 --> 00:32:07,177
Jason.

689
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:14,284
How does this character
represent death to you?

690
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,986
She is a well creature

691
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,289
and represents death
by eating her victims.

692
00:32:19,324 --> 00:32:21,592
I'm not really excited
about this makeup.

693
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:24,328
It's a very muddy paint job.

694
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:27,531
I think you kind of flunked out
on this one.

695
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:29,733
I appreciate the fact
that you were trying to use

696
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:32,202
as much makeup skill
as possible,

697
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:34,505
but she is not just covered--
she's buried.

698
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:35,672
Okay.

699
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:39,060
The form, from the eyes down,
is wretched.

700
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:40,962
If you would have just stuck
with that forehead,

701
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:43,164
I think it would have been
rather easy to accomplish

702
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:44,765
the idea that you have.

703
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,369
It's the cheeks
that throw everything off.

704
00:32:48,403 --> 00:32:50,037
Jason,
if you'd please step back.

705
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:51,138
Thank you, guys.

706
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,048
McKenzie,
we've actually already decided

707
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:04,251
on one of contestants
that will be going home tonight.

708
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:06,887
Okay.
Glenn, who is leaving us?

709
00:33:06,922 --> 00:33:08,789
The first person going home
tonight is...

710
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:10,591
I'm worried for my spot.

711
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,259
I've never been more nervous
in my life.

712
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:15,262
I'm terrified.
I'm hoping for a miracle.

713
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:21,280
The first person
going home tonight is...

714
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,017
Scott.

715
00:33:25,051 --> 00:33:26,785
Oh.

716
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,554
Unfortunately,
we just don't feel

717
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:31,190
like you're ready to compete
at this level yet.

718
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:33,926
Thank you very much
for the experience, though.

719
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,461
I'm surprised.

720
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,795
I don't think this makeup

721
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,698
represents my skill
as an artist.

722
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:40,799
Scott, I'm so sorry,

723
00:33:40,834 --> 00:33:42,434
but you won't be with us
this season.

724
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:45,337
We all wish you the best of luck
with your career.

725
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:46,939
Please head backstage.

726
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,189
Thank you much.

727
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,407
- Good luck, Scott.
- Bye bye. See you, guys.

728
00:33:50,482 --> 00:33:52,149
I'm very disappointed,

729
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:54,718
but being on<i> Face Off</i> gave me
a second chance

730
00:33:54,753 --> 00:33:56,954
to revisit the passion
that I have

731
00:33:56,988 --> 00:34:00,524
for special-effects makeup,
so I will continue pursuing it.

732
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:05,896
Dina, you're up.

733
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:13,103
- Hi, Dina.
- Hi.

734
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,838
Tell me about your idea.

735
00:34:14,873 --> 00:34:17,641
I wanted to bring
the whites and the greens

736
00:34:17,675 --> 00:34:19,543
from the set into her makeup,

737
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:22,846
so I decided to go for,
like, a forest nymph.

738
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:24,715
This design...

739
00:34:24,749 --> 00:34:28,085
screams life.

740
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,720
It has spring.
It's sprite.

741
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:32,122
I think you should be really
happy with what you've done.

742
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:33,423
Thank you so much.

743
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,058
She is a lovely character.

744
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:38,162
I love the little veining
you did on her arm.

745
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:39,396
What did you do that with?

746
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,332
I'm a cake decorator,
so I piped it on her.

747
00:34:42,367 --> 00:34:45,269
You seem to be
a very promising makeup artist.

748
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:47,171
That means a lot.

749
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:51,108
I really love that you chose
to pay attention to the set

750
00:34:51,142 --> 00:34:53,744
and bring it into the makeup.

751
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:56,413
- That's really smart.
- Thank you so much.

752
00:34:56,447 --> 00:34:58,515
Thank you very much, Dina.
Please step back.

753
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,655
Gabby, please step forward.

754
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:12,629
Can you tell us a little bit
about your character?

755
00:35:12,664 --> 00:35:15,165
I kind of wanted my character
to represent

756
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,301
the small passing thought
of, "I wish I was dead,"

757
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:19,236
and it went horribly wrong.

758
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,637
I had this neck piece,

759
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:24,842
so I started trying
to make it fit into my theme,

760
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:28,745
instead of adjusting my theme
to fit the piece.

761
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,147
Okay, well,
that's a bad decision

762
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:32,783
right off the bat.

763
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:33,917
That was the whole idea is,

764
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:35,352
you take what you have
in the box

765
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:38,088
and you design something
around that.

766
00:35:38,122 --> 00:35:40,724
Top half being blue and
the bottom half being black--

767
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:42,492
I always like when characters

768
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:44,328
have an element
of graphic design.

769
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:48,866
I don't think it's done well,
but the idea is good.

770
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,401
There's something
about the general application

771
00:35:51,436 --> 00:35:52,803
and the use of color.

772
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:58,215
It's incredibly confusing,
and it's not appealing.

773
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:00,384
Thank you, Gabby.
If you'd step back.

774
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:01,752
Thank you.

775
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:10,160
Gwen, you're up.
Please step forward.

776
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:15,132
So tell us about your piece.

777
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,201
I wanted to personify death,

778
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:19,570
so I just decided, "Let's try
to make him, you know,

779
00:36:19,604 --> 00:36:21,672
bubonic plague,
tumors, cancers."

780
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:23,373
So, if this guy
ever touched you,

781
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:24,708
you'd just
kind of disintegrate.

782
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:26,710
I think a lot of that
does come through,

783
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:31,281
but overall,
there's a muddiness happening.

784
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:35,319
The boils on the face
felt a little sloppy as well.

785
00:36:35,353 --> 00:36:39,189
Standing back from it,
you get a striking image,

786
00:36:39,224 --> 00:36:42,926
but the closer you get,
the more it falls apart.

787
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:44,261
Your bison teeth--

788
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:46,296
probably the coolest thing
you had to work with.

789
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,233
Why not stitch one
on the eye patch?

790
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:51,168
Yeah, I thought
about doing that at first,

791
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:52,869
but it would've just kind of
destroyed the whole eye patch.

792
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:54,538
If you were
that easily deterred

793
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:57,341
from ripping apart
a 50-cent eye patch...

794
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,042
I hope you get a lot more bold

795
00:36:59,077 --> 00:37:02,012
- in your decision making than that.
- Thank you.

796
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:04,514
Thank you, Gwen,
if you'd please step back.

797
00:37:09,654 --> 00:37:12,155
Vince, you're up.

798
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:19,096
So would you like to tell us
about your concept?

799
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:23,161
My concept
is a mutated zombie demon

800
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:24,763
who will travel
to another dimension.

801
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:26,164
Protruding from his cheeks

802
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,300
are rib bones
that serve as antenna.

803
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:30,903
I really think
that they are very good, indeed.

804
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:32,070
Thank you.

805
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:33,305
I like the colors.

806
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:34,806
I like the shaping
around the eye.

807
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:37,242
It's a very successful
overall look.

808
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:38,610
Thank you.

809
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:41,747
You allowed the pieces to help
you evolve your character

810
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:44,917
into a much more
complex entity.

811
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:46,752
- That's awesome.
- Thanks.

812
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:49,855
I think one of the best things
that you did was the red hair,

813
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:52,324
because that really presents
this makeup

814
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:53,959
in such a different light.

815
00:37:53,993 --> 00:37:55,460
Thanks so much.

816
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:58,830
Thank you very much, Vince.
Please step back.

817
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:03,802
All right, guys,

818
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,537
the judges have heard
what you have to stay.

819
00:38:05,571 --> 00:38:07,439
Will you please head back
to the makeup room

820
00:38:07,473 --> 00:38:08,607
while they deliberate?

821
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:11,171
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

822
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:16,014
All right, judges,

823
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:18,450
why don't we talk about
the looks you liked the most?

824
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:19,785
Why don't we start
with Kaeghlan?

825
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,353
It was a very big idea--

826
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:23,221
so many cultural elements
brought into one.

827
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:25,123
I thought she had
a lovely color palette.

828
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:26,692
It was a very pretty makeup.

829
00:38:26,726 --> 00:38:29,895
And I'd be intrigued to see
how she's going to progress.

830
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:31,663
All right,
let's talk about Sasha.

831
00:38:31,698 --> 00:38:33,732
It was such
a complete character.

832
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,067
I'm torn on this one.

833
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:38,537
It really doesn't visually
say death immediately,

834
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:40,572
but she produced
a pretty makeup.

835
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:42,941
All right, judges,
let's move on to Dina.

836
00:38:42,976 --> 00:38:44,242
What a stunning makeup.

837
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:46,178
That brow piece
is very nymph-like

838
00:38:46,212 --> 00:38:47,779
and beautifully executed.

839
00:38:47,814 --> 00:38:50,782
And those little veins--
that's extraordinary.

840
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:54,286
She's thinking outside the box
in a purely creative way.

841
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,688
All right, judges,
let's move on to Vince.

842
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:59,624
If we were just judging
who made the best use

843
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:01,526
out of the piece
that they had to integrate,

844
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:02,728
he'd be my winner.

845
00:39:02,762 --> 00:39:04,763
I love the fact
that he made the hair red.

846
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:08,467
Had it been not that hair
and that color red,

847
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,935
that could have turned
into a clown.

848
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:11,269
All right, judges,

849
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:13,505
why don't we move on
to the looks you like the least?

850
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:14,740
Let's start with Jason.

851
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:16,308
It failed him in the end,

852
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:17,843
but he was not afraid to use

853
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:20,879
all available
bits of rubber around

854
00:39:20,913 --> 00:39:22,547
and try and build
something interesting.

855
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:25,117
Huge chipmunk cheeks
that go down to a pointed chin,

856
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:26,785
with a
big bloated forehead--

857
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:27,986
it's not salvageable.

858
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:30,489
All right, judges,
let's move on to Gabby.

859
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:33,058
The craziest thing
about her makeup

860
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,826
was shoehorning an idea

861
00:39:34,861 --> 00:39:36,995
that does not work
with the choices she has.

862
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,598
I actually really admired
her honesty

863
00:39:39,632 --> 00:39:42,734
for knowing how wrong
her choices were.

864
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:44,336
All right,
let's move on to Gwen.

865
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,138
Her ideas are good.

866
00:39:46,172 --> 00:39:48,240
Her execution's terrible.

867
00:39:48,274 --> 00:39:50,842
She didn't have to put
those other prosthetics on him.

868
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:53,178
It's better to make
a really cool-looking character

869
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:55,347
than to stick something
on their face just to do it.

870
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:56,715
All right, judges.

871
00:39:56,749 --> 00:39:59,518
Have you decided who else
will be joining us this season?

872
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:01,553
- We have.
- Let's bring them back out.

873
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:09,428
All right, Glenn,

874
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:12,164
who is the winner
of this sudden-death challenge?

875
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:14,933
The winner
of this challenge is...

876
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:21,877
All right, Glenn,

877
00:40:21,912 --> 00:40:23,779
who is the winner
of this sudden-death challenge?

878
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:25,514
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

879
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:31,253
Dina.

880
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:33,823
Thank you.

881
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:36,826
What an astoundingly
complete makeup.

882
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,727
I know that you decorate cakes
for a living,

883
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:41,597
but I think you might have found
your true calling in makeup.

884
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:42,598
Thank you so much.

885
00:40:42,632 --> 00:40:43,599
I'm freaking out.

886
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:44,934
I'm just a cake decorator,

887
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:47,036
and I won the first challenge
on<i> Face Off.</i>

888
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,771
It's fucking awesome.

889
00:40:48,805 --> 00:40:50,539
Dina, congratulations.

890
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,908
You, Kaeghlan, Sasha, and Vince

891
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:55,478
have all earned spots
on this season.

892
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,179
You can head back
to the makeup room.

893
00:40:57,214 --> 00:40:58,180
Great job, you guys.

894
00:40:58,215 --> 00:40:59,715
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

895
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:06,388
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

896
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,857
are on the bottom this week

897
00:41:07,891 --> 00:41:11,026
and one of you
will be eliminated.

898
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,229
If you'll please step forward.

899
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:20,603
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

900
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:23,706
Jason, between
the droopy cheek appliances

901
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,474
and the lackluster paint job,

902
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,376
it really seems like this one
got away from you.

903
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,313
Gabby, the decision
to keep your original concept

904
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:34,216
even though your prosthetic
didn't go with it

905
00:41:34,251 --> 00:41:36,051
was ultimately your undoing.

906
00:41:36,086 --> 00:41:39,922
Gwen, while the visual
was fairly strong from afar,

907
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,458
we really wish you would
have taken some more chances

908
00:41:42,492 --> 00:41:43,993
with the items
that you were given.

909
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:46,929
So who is the last person
going home tonight?

910
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,532
The last person going home
this evening is...

911
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,471
Gabby.

912
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:58,274
There just wasn't much right
about your makeup,

913
00:41:58,308 --> 00:41:59,808
but we do respect the fact

914
00:41:59,843 --> 00:42:01,644
that you realized
how rough it was.

915
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,614
That means Jason, Gwen,

916
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,516
you have earned your spots
on this season of<i> Face Off.</i>

917
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:08,584
Thank you.

918
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:11,320
If you'll please
head backstage.

919
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:15,190
Thanks, guys.

920
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:16,926
It's been
an emotional roller coaster.

921
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,193
Going from happy to sad

922
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:19,762
and then to happy again
is exhausting,

923
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:22,064
but now I'm on Cloud Nine.

924
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:24,199
Gabby, thank you so much
for being here with us.

925
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:26,402
- We all wish you the best of luck.
- Thank you.

926
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:29,572
If you'd please head backstage.

927
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,974
- Bye, Gabby.
- Bye.

928
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:35,044
I really hate
that it turned out this way.

929
00:42:35,078 --> 00:42:38,514
The pressure got into my head,
and my makeup was a debacle

930
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:41,850
but<i> Face Off</i>
has given me confidence.

931
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:43,886
I'm good enough
that I got here.

932
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,087
I'm not going to stop.

933
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:46,388
I love it too much,

934
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:50,492
and I will continue
to get better and better.

935
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,361
So we're officially on <i>Face Off.</i>

936
00:42:52,395 --> 00:42:55,297
Season 7!
Yeah!
