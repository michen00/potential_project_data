1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,535
Absolutely brilliant.

2
00:00:02,112 --> 00:00:05,735
That's what I would want it
to look like coming out of my shop.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,060
<i>Previously on Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:11,308
Sasha's creepy cracked clown
brought her her first win.

5
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,208
And Damien was sent home.

6
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:17,270
Now seven artists remain,

7
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,597
and tonight they'll
head back in time.

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,786
Exactly!
Couldn't agree more.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,590
But some artists will
be schooled by the process.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,817
- George Smash.
- You've got to be kidding me.

11
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:30,686
They are shockingly awful.

12
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,255
It's a great character.

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,556
In the end, only one

14
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,092
will win a VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

15
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:39,061
to one of their 85
international locations,

16
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:41,964
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,169
and $100,000.

18
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:48,171
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

20
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,725
Being on the bottom sucks.

21
00:01:25,777 --> 00:01:28,211
I feel like I've been
putting everything

22
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,929
I've got into my work,

23
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:33,916
like that nose
on that stupid clown.

24
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,185
Being on the bottom
with Damien was terrifying.

25
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:38,154
I do not want to be
in that position again,

26
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,490
so I just have to make sure
that I'm making good decisions

27
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,377
and stay out of the bottom
the rest of the time I'm here.

28
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,078
- I really like yours as well.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,864
- I really liked yours.
- Thank you.

30
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,950
And apparently
so did the judges.

31
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:53,970
I did get three bottom looks
in a row,

32
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:55,972
and that still
have reign over me.

33
00:01:56,007 --> 00:02:00,710
I've only been either top
or bottom equal amounts,

34
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:04,080
so I don't know how to feel.

35
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:13,222
We are in a high school.

36
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,691
- Oh, that's cool.
- Oh, I see McKenzie.

37
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:18,344
Are those lockers?
Oh, my God.

38
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,046
Just the idea
of being back in high school

39
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,430
makes me a little nervous.

40
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:25,201
But I'll just suck it up
and deal with it.

41
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:26,953
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

42
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:29,889
Welcome back to high school.

43
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,540
Exactly!

44
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:33,926
While many films
have depicted all the drama

45
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:35,611
that comes with
being in high school,

46
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,147
fantasy films
like<i> Teen Wolf, Twilight,</i>

47
00:02:38,182 --> 00:02:41,150
and<i> Harry Potter</i> took things
to the next level,

48
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:44,220
proving that, even with
the athleticism of a werewolf,

49
00:02:44,255 --> 00:02:47,223
the strength of a vampire,
or even a wizard's spell,

50
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:50,259
it's still tough
being a high school student.

51
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:53,246
Now, with that in mind,
your spotlight challenge

52
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,166
is to create your very own
fantasy creature version

53
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,368
of a high school student.

54
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,870
This is my kind of challenge.

55
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:05,274
I love fantasy, and I can't wait
to bring comedy into my makeup.

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,793
The lockers next to me
each feature the name of a type

57
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:09,111
of fantasy creature.

58
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,448
Goblin, minotaur,
cyclops, and faun.

59
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,885
You'll each choose one
as the basis for your creation,

60
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:19,588
but no high school
is complete without its cliques,

61
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,490
so take a look
inside the locker

62
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:24,327
to find out which group
your character belongs to.

63
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:27,396
Sasha, you're up first.

64
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:28,998
Cyclops.

65
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,416
Awesome, cheerleader.

66
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:32,935
Goblin nerd. Yes.

67
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:35,371
Goblin, too.
Jock.

68
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:36,839
Oh, clearly.

69
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:39,125
Faun.

70
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,176
Emo kid.

71
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,228
Faun.
Cheerleader.

72
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,648
Minotaur.
Emo.

73
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:50,252
Minotaur.
Nerd.

74
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:53,072
Okay, guys, it's time
to get started on your sketches.

75
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:56,292
I'll see you back at the lab later
when I come by with my dad.

76
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:58,127
Class dismissed.

77
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:59,895
- Thank you.
- See you.

78
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,369
I don't want to be
back at high school.

79
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,304
I didn't like high school
that much.

80
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,638
I was a choir geek,

81
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:12,708
so I'm thinking I want to bring
a marching band element

82
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,410
to this character.

83
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:16,712
I'm also drawing inspiration
from my sister

84
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:21,684
and giving her a really bad perm
and super nerdy glasses.

85
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:23,652
Goblins have big noses
and big ears,

86
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:28,524
so I really want
to accentuate those.

87
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:31,293
Making an emo faun's
gonna be really fun.

88
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,263
I teach at the Tom Savini School
of makeup effects,

89
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,948
so whenever
I hear the word emo,

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,833
it always just makes me think
of my students,

91
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:41,637
'cause that's 90%
of my student body.

92
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:44,440
So my faun
is this gothy, sad kid

93
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:48,277
who falls in with the emo crowd
because he feels misunderstood.

94
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:52,381
He's got black eyeliner,
faun ears, hoofed hands,

95
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,151
and he wants to be an effects
artist when he grows up.

96
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,209
Cheerleader is hard for me

97
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,961
because it's such
a one-dimensional stereotype,

98
00:05:05,997 --> 00:05:07,229
pigtails and pom-poms.

99
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,298
In high school, that was not
the clique I was in.

100
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,617
I was a huge nerd,
and I'm still a huge nerd.

101
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,670
Because fauns have horns,
I definitely want to add them

102
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,640
along with ears
and some goat leg pieces.

103
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:23,946
In high school, I was
just kind of like the artsy kid

104
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:27,283
that didn't really fit in
but was friends with everybody.

105
00:05:27,318 --> 00:05:30,086
I was on the video
announcement team.

106
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,755
My character's name
is Manny Minotaurey.

107
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:34,256
He's super nerdy.

108
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:37,626
So I'm thinking people get
picked on for being redheaded,

109
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:40,262
so he's gonna have
ginger skin tone with pimples

110
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,864
and glasses.

111
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,266
People call him a "ginger-taur,"
and they give him

112
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,936
such an atomic wedgie
that he can't get out of it,

113
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:48,721
so it's like,
"You'll never find your way

114
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,240
out of your underpants,
Minotaurey."

115
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,177
When I was in high school,

116
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,546
I was more obnoxious
than I am now,

117
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:59,648
which I know is surprising.

118
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:01,150
This challenge
is stressing me out

119
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:04,403
because I know nothing
about the whole jock lifestyle.

120
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:07,106
So I start by sketching out
my goblin character,

121
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,258
and he's got
this big long nose.

122
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:11,193
He's got tiny creepy ears

123
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:14,430
and a big pointy head,
but to make this goblin a jock,

124
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:18,000
I need to give him
a big thick neck and a flat top.

125
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:20,453
That's all I've got
that screams jock.

126
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:23,672
Guys, let's pack up
and head back to the lab.

127
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,274
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

128
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:26,842
Give me a piggyback ride,
Cigarette.

129
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:27,843
Oh, God.

130
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,599
Oh, boy.

131
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,634
It's day one of our fantasy
high school challenge,

132
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,720
and we have six hours
in the lab.

133
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:42,691
We pick our models,
and we get right to sculpting.

134
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,760
I'm gonna make a face, a cowl,

135
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:47,630
and horns for my emo minotaur.

136
00:06:47,665 --> 00:06:51,066
Since a minotaur is
a bull's head on a man's body,

137
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:53,102
the female version
of a bull is a cow,

138
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:57,206
so I'm gonna put a cow's head
on a female's body.

139
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,374
Makes sense to me.

140
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:01,944
Style-wise I think black hair,
black lipstick,

141
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,546
black baby doll dress.

142
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:08,300
Basically, Winona Ryder
from<i> Beetlejuice.</i>

143
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:09,635
I really want
a full-on, like,

144
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:13,389
evil face because she's
the evil cheerleader bitch.

145
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:16,242
- Got it.
- I'm the only one with cyclops.

146
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:18,794
I'm kind of nervous
because I'd like to usually see

147
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:20,162
what other people are doing

148
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:23,165
to make sure I'm following
the challenge right.

149
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:25,968
Everyone knows cyclops
has just one big eye

150
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,469
in the center of the forehead,

151
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:29,872
but I want this cheerleader
to be interesting,

152
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:32,141
so I'm going crazy with this.

153
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:33,842
She has a whole bunch of eyes.

154
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:35,911
Her skin's gonna be pale blue.

155
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:38,814
She's going to have a really
awesome cheerleader costume,

156
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,850
and she's just gonna be
the cool girl in school.

157
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,211
The first thing I do
is sculpt the horns

158
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,798
for my faun cheerleader
and mold them right away.

159
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:01,637
Then I start to make life casts
of my model's ears

160
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:05,207
so I can sculpt ear appliances
that will fit her perfectly.

161
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,927
I find the silicone negative
of the model's life cast

162
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:10,613
and brush some Ultracal
in her ear area.

163
00:08:10,665 --> 00:08:13,816
After that sets, I'll be able
to sculpt the faun ears on top

164
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:15,434
of that Ultracal positive.

165
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,553
This is gonna end up
being a lot of pieces,

166
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:22,441
so I'm going to have
to manage time well.

167
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:24,093
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

168
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,028
Checking on you.

169
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,529
- Hey, Cig.
- Hey, how's it going?

170
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,081
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

171
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:30,199
Good to see you guys.

172
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,500
All right.
What did you pick?

173
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,937
I'm doing Manny Minotaurey,
and he's a nerd.

174
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,940
He's gonna have
pasty white skin and red hair.

175
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:38,941
I love it.

176
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,376
Be careful as far as trying

177
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:42,444
to make it all white when
you're doing your paint job.

178
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,679
Add some freckles across here.

179
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:44,830
That's what I was gonna say.

180
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,148
An auburn color,

181
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,150
a medium brown, little darker
brown across there.

182
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:50,052
- That's me in high school.
- Yeah.

183
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,988
I wanted to keep her
a little bit more human-like.

184
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,974
'Cause keeping the pretty in her
is going to be

185
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,191
really interesting.

186
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:57,760
Now, keeping her pretty--

187
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:59,662
you've got an expression
built in here--

188
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,697
Well, I want her
to be sort of mean.

189
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,232
Oh, okay.

190
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:06,969
Because that's how
I remember cheerleaders.

191
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,237
I want to do the flat top,

192
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:09,972
but what do you think
about this just kind

193
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:12,207
of peeking out the top
of the hair?

194
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,859
This is what bothers me,
is the peak.

195
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:17,179
You lose the whole idea
of the flat top.

196
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,982
So maybe just
sculpt a flat top.

197
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,350
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,253
- So I have an emo faun.
- I love it.

199
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:25,788
I said I was going
to make it look as much

200
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,922
like Glenn as possible.

201
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,190
That's Glenn as a faun.

202
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:29,775
Are you gonna add
that little goatee?

203
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,260
- Yeah.
- Keep it very sparse.

204
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:33,829
Because a lot of kids in high
school have just a semblance--

205
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:36,649
Yeah, I don't want it
to be fully developed yet,

206
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,317
because he's not, so...

207
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,252
I decided to go with band geek.

208
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:42,204
Band geek.
I love it.

209
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:44,807
Make sure you don't get into
too many wrinkles or anything,

210
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,910
because this could be
a witch real easy.

211
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:50,679
I have an emo minotaur,

212
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,948
and I'm gonna make her
overweight.

213
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,000
You need to add
a little more to the head.

214
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,820
So many overweight makeups
go up to here,

215
00:09:57,822 --> 00:09:59,655
and they forget about this.

216
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,273
It just doesn't work well.

217
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:02,458
Okay.

218
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,827
You have the cyclops
cheerleader, right?

219
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,328
- Cyclops cheerleader.
- Okay.

220
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,931
But I'm confused, though,
because cyclops has one eye.

221
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:12,401
Cyclops actually just
means "round eye."

222
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:13,635
Yeah, be careful with that,

223
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,938
because so much
of the great fantasy films,

224
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:17,072
there's only been one.

225
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,407
One, yeah.

226
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,509
I mean, I didn't think cyclops
when we walked up.

227
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,227
I'm worried
that their saying this is not

228
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,529
looking cyclops enough.

229
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,013
You think I should change?

230
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,815
I'm just concerned
with all the eyes

231
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,517
that you have going on
around there.

232
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,953
All I can think about is,
I don't have time

233
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,938
to start this character
all over.

234
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:35,824
This is gonna be a disaster.

235
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,727
Coming up...

236
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,762
I don't know what to do.

237
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,430
Things aren't going well
for me.

238
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:43,332
That puts you in a tough spot.

239
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,567
It's just like,
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

240
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,561
It's day one of our fantasy
high school challenge,

241
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:57,281
and Mr. Westmore says
that my cyclops cheerleader

242
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,999
is not looking cyclops enough.

243
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,634
I'm just concerned
with all the eyes

244
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,436
that you have going on
around there.

245
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:06,206
- I would have done a larger eye here...
- Oh, yeah. I could do that.

246
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:08,058
...and done away
with these.

247
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:09,226
So what if I just made--

248
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,745
- I would make these wrinkles
across here.

249
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,829
- I mean, this is--
- Oh, yeah.

250
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,298
- So you could see through--
- Yeah.

251
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,515
They can be very tight,

252
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,284
where they can just barely
see through them.

253
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,602
- Okay, awesome.
- Good.

254
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,687
Thank you so much.
I will make sure it's a big eye.

255
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,022
Good luck.

256
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,240
Mr. Westmore's right.

257
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:26,526
I have to make sure
that this reads cyclops,

258
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,729
or I could go home.

259
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:30,113
McKenzie and I
are going to leave.

260
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:32,299
- Good luck, guys.
- Bye.

261
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:34,267
Thank you.

262
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:38,338
I need to make sure
that I get this cowl right,

263
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:41,174
so I'm getting rid of some
of the eyes, changing the cowl

264
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,310
so the wrinkles
cover the model's eyes,

265
00:11:43,345 --> 00:11:45,879
and I'm making the center eye
a lot bigger.

266
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,831
I'm worried about being behind,

267
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:49,916
but I've just got
to push through.

268
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:55,789
He didn't like the pointy head?

269
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,024
Didn't like the pointy head,

270
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:58,492
and I want to give him
a big blockhead.

271
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,310
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

272
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:02,963
Mr. Westmore
always has awesome advice.

273
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:05,148
The head shape I've roughed out
is pointy on top,

274
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,567
and that's not gonna lend
itself well to the flat top,

275
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:10,337
and as soon as he tells me
to make the head more blocky,

276
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:13,156
the whole character just starts
unraveling in my brain.

277
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,741
George Smash.

278
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,943
I can see
how the neck muscles are going.

279
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:19,012
I can see how the head
has to be.

280
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:21,114
Sort of tells me how the rest
of the character

281
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,182
is gonna look like.

282
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:25,752
He's a big thick,
just dumb jock.

283
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:27,233
_

284
00:12:27,387 --> 00:12:29,186
_

285
00:12:38,984 --> 00:12:41,601
I demold my ears,
and they come out great.

286
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,937
That means
I can use that positive

287
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:45,939
to now sculpt on their ears.

288
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,240
I really want take the time

289
00:12:47,276 --> 00:12:49,242
and make sure
that this is really symmetrical

290
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,012
and that it reads faun.

291
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,880
30 minutes, guys.

292
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,556
God, I should make this look
as much like Glenn as possible.

293
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,624
I need to take my time
with this facial appliance

294
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,927
because I don't have many
prosthetics for this makeup,

295
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:09,012
and this one has to be
executed really well.

296
00:13:09,064 --> 00:13:12,566
- He's a goat man.
- He's a goat man, a faun.

297
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:16,136
- He's so sad.
- He's so apathetic.

298
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:21,108
I am focusing on sculpting
a thin, symmetrical, balanced

299
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,309
prosthetic for the face

300
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:25,779
so that my actor
can emote through the piece.

301
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:33,820
That's time, guys.

302
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:37,808
Coming off of the bottom,
it's time to start bringing it.

303
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,960
I'm ready to bust
into the winner's circle

304
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:43,413
and show that I've got what it
takes to make winning makeups.

305
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,509
Day two in the lab,
we have 9 1/2 hours.

306
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:58,211
I have so much to do.

307
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:02,883
I have to make sure I finish
my cowl and the shoulders.

308
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:06,086
I'm hoping that I have enough
time to get both of them molded.

309
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:08,438
You're gonna do both
in two hours.

310
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,725
Both in two hours.

311
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,947
Does this look fatter to you?

312
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,766
I'm looking at my sculpture
with fresh eyes,

313
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:24,054
and it's not as full
as I thought it was.

314
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,873
In fact,
it looks a little emaciated.

315
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,742
I'm gonna make
bigger neck rolls.

316
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:30,177
Yeah, right there.

317
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,279
And now I have to spend
extra time

318
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,598
that I don't have
refining the sculpture

319
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:38,552
and making it as full
as it needs to be.

320
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,137
Dina, are ours still brother
and sister?

321
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:41,304
Yeah.

322
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:42,389
- Nice.
- Meg and Doug?

323
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,057
- Meg and Doug.
- Meg and Doug Oblin.

324
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,860
I just picture this character
saying his own name

325
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,612
like some kind of idiot,

326
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:50,430
you know, "Doug Oblin."

327
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:52,549
"Anybody makes fun
my little sister,

328
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,684
I'm gonna pound 'em
like that--

329
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,104
that thing
that pounds stuff."

330
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,607
He's like the super cool
older brother,

331
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,008
but he's really stupid.

332
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:04,544
"Doug, why does my inhaler smell
like your butt?"

333
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:07,647
"Why does your bedroom smell
like books?"

334
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,899
They get along.

335
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,584
They don't really understand
each other.

336
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,986
He thinks she's some kind
of bookworm,

337
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:15,272
but he doesn't really know
what books are.

338
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:20,043
"How many nerds does it take
to score a touchdown?

339
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,562
A lot.
Doug goblin."

340
00:15:22,598 --> 00:15:24,130
He can't--

341
00:15:27,486 --> 00:15:30,503
- I want to figure out
a cool way to do leg extensions.

342
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,940
I'm actually going to include
the calf in my sculpt,

343
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:37,410
and I'm going to try to bring in
that double joint area

344
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:39,212
that the goat has.

345
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:41,414
I think it's going
to bring a really cool aspect

346
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,651
into my makeup, so it's really
important that I get this right.

347
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,726
Bulls have horns,
so I need to make some,

348
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:54,194
but I don't want
to make huge horns

349
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:56,663
because he's still supposed
to be young and in high school.

350
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:59,699
So I get the ethafoam,
and I take it to the belt sander

351
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:01,701
and start shaving down
the horn shape I need,

352
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,753
but the foam itself
doesn't hold its shape,

353
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:06,006
so I put armature wire
through the middle.

354
00:16:06,058 --> 00:16:07,290
Then I bend it
to where I want it,

355
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,376
and I hot glue the tips together
to get that point,

356
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,646
and it looks just like horns.

357
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,369
It's almost the end of the day,

358
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:21,588
and I've spent all this time
sculpting.

359
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,757
I don't have that much time
for molding,

360
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,426
so I've got to get in there
and get moving.

361
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:32,582
Everyone has already
opened their molds

362
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:36,937
and gotten them ready for foam,
but my mold's still damp.

363
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:40,941
It's got to cure
so that I can crack it open.

364
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:42,225
Oh, this fucking mold.

365
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:45,712
If it doesn't cure soon,
I'm in trouble.

366
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:55,518
It's day two of our fantasy
high school challenge,

367
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,888
and my mold's still damp.

368
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:59,856
If it doesn't cure soon,

369
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:02,492
I'm going to have
to run polyfoam tomorrow,

370
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:04,728
so I need this thing open.

371
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:07,597
This is literally the shittiest
foam I've ever made.

372
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,500
I roll it outside in the sun
in the hope

373
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:12,118
that the sun will help dry it.

374
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,536
This one takes the cake.

375
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,804
I'm just waiting.

376
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,540
I'm gonna open it
in the last 10 minutes

377
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:19,876
and hope
that it's good enough to open.

378
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:22,045
I don't know what to do.
I guess I just--

379
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,249
I got to come back out
when it's ready.

380
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:28,084
I love it.

381
00:17:33,592 --> 00:17:39,162
- Hey, come here.
- Yeah.

382
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:41,231
So I start sculpting
these glasses

383
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,933
because normal glasses

384
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:47,170
wouldn't fit my goblin nerd's
freakishly large ears and face.

385
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:49,839
So I sculpt them out of clay,
and then I vacuum form them,

386
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,476
and, you know,
they look pretty good.

387
00:17:53,478 --> 00:17:54,644
I think if they're a little big

388
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,146
that actually adds
to the character.

389
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,714
Whoo-hoo.

390
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:03,870
They make this look so easy
at Supercuts.

391
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:05,522
I find this great wig,

392
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:07,691
and I'm doing the thing where
you hold it in your fingers

393
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,009
and then you cut like this.

394
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:12,362
I really want him to be
like what was cool in the '90s.

395
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:13,930
- Like a mullet?
- Yeah.

396
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,598
I realize that this character

397
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,969
will look 10 times stupider
if he has a mullet.

398
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:21,955
Mullet flat top combo
is gonna give me the W.

399
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,006
That's the way to go.

400
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,709
Wow.

401
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:29,779
Well, I know my next haircut.

402
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:31,281
I go with hooves for his hands

403
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:34,668
because it's gonna reaffirm
sort of the goaty nature.

404
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:37,837
So I'm making foam hooves
and fabricating hoof pieces

405
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:41,091
to slide over his fingers
out of L200.

406
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,226
I'm really excited
to put this makeup all together

407
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,228
and to see this character
in action.

408
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:48,965
One, two, three.

409
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,353
I'm in a time crunch.

410
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:54,904
There's 10 minutes left.

411
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,356
Fuck.

412
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:57,891
I have no choice.

413
00:18:57,926 --> 00:19:01,745
I decide I'm just going to crack
it open and see what happens.

414
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,718
Beautiful.
Oh, my God.

415
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:12,288
The mold opens like butter.

416
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,024
You've got to be kidding me.

417
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,258
I don't even have to spend time

418
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,127
cleaning it,
'cause all the clay falls out.

419
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:18,995
It's amazing.

420
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,626
That's time, guys!

421
00:19:27,823 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm really glad that
I got this mold out in time,

422
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:33,226
so I'm feeling good
about tomorrow,

423
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:37,180
and I just hope
that application goes smoothly.

424
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:52,996
Whoo!

425
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,431
It's application day.

426
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,617
We have four hours in the lab
and one hour in last looks.

427
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,569
Oh, my God.

428
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,271
I look at my face cowl,

429
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:05,141
and I noticed tiny bubble holes
and air pockets,

430
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:07,677
like, right here by the nose
and right here on the cheek.

431
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,013
The dampness
from my wet mold created steam,

432
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:11,731
and the steam
created air pockets,

433
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,416
so there's a lot to patch.

434
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:15,585
That is going to be a lot
of cabo-patch.

435
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,488
Yay.

436
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,623
Good, how are you?

437
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,826
Just like
the quintessential dumb jock.

438
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,244
- Cool.
- Yeah.

439
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,362
I leave my model a note
that says I'm in the spray booth

440
00:20:26,415 --> 00:20:28,031
to make my horns.

441
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,365
I already started one
yesterday,

442
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,134
and I have to finish
the second one.

443
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,636
I take my two foam
blender strips,

444
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:38,208
and I attach them to foam cores
that have armature wire inside,

445
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,543
and I spray them
to make them nice and red.

446
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:42,579
Then I'm gonna apply them
to the wig

447
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:45,982
so that my model can wear it
without it pulling her hair.

448
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:48,017
Hi.
Did you get your note?

449
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:53,189
Really thick at the jaw.

450
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:55,024
As I'm gluing my face piece on,

451
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:58,194
I realize that I sculpted my jaw
too far back,

452
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,997
so the jaw actually covers,
like, most of the ear.

453
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,966
So I have to tear pieces away

454
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,768
to make that rounded shape
just before the ear.

455
00:21:05,804 --> 00:21:07,770
I'm just gonna do my best
to make it work.

456
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:08,938
Still not ideal.

457
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,807
Yeah.

458
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:15,412
_

459
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:16,596
The application on the face

460
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:18,681
and the ears
are taking longer than I wanted,

461
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:21,050
and I'm gonna have to spend
a lot of time on these edges.

462
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:23,837
I'm also really worried because
everyone else's characters

463
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:26,773
are really overt,
and mine's more subtle.

464
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:29,125
And I'm starting to wonder
if she's going to read the way

465
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:31,060
I want her to,
but I just have to move on.

466
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:34,647
Otherwise, I won't get any paint
on my model.

467
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:38,034
So I finally get
all the air bubbles patched.

468
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,102
I'm painting the face,

469
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:40,954
and the steam pocket
on the cheek

470
00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:43,656
is creating a wrinkle every time
I get it wet with paint.

471
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,708
I mean, it's right here
on the face.

472
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:47,544
I'm gonna open it up.

473
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:50,413
So I have to cut it open
and glue it down.

474
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:52,131
Probably just made it worse.

475
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,617
I can't spend too much time
on just this one area

476
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:56,669
because I still have
a lot to do,

477
00:21:56,705 --> 00:21:58,087
so it's time to move on.

478
00:21:58,123 --> 00:22:00,256
All right, it's better.
It's getting there anyway.

479
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:04,727
Mr. Westmore says
I'm really going to have

480
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:06,930
to sell the paintwork
when it comes to freckles

481
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:10,066
and that I should use multiple
colors rather than just brown.

482
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,218
So I go in
with the heavier stipple

483
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:13,653
with browns, yellows,

484
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:16,122
and reds to create
the actual freckles.

485
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,441
It's really looking
like freckly skin.

486
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:20,710
Perfect.

487
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:21,945
Hi.

488
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:23,363
I feel
like I'm ahead of the game,

489
00:22:23,415 --> 00:22:25,882
but I have to make sure
this hair works out right.

490
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,717
I've taken inspiration
from my sister.

491
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:31,004
She had, like, a bowl cut
with a perm, so it was like--

492
00:22:31,056 --> 00:22:33,339
She's just looking super nerdy.

493
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:34,724
It's really funny.

494
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,309
That's hilarious.

495
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,168
_

496
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,700
_

497
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,602
My makeup is very subtle.

498
00:22:45,637 --> 00:22:47,437
I don't have big prosthetics,

499
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:49,706
so application and paint
on this makeup

500
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,924
are really, really important.

501
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,709
I'm taking the colors of goats

502
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:54,477
and the color of deer
for my color scheme.

503
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:57,614
I want to go really light
through the center of the face

504
00:22:57,616 --> 00:23:00,516
and then blending out
to darker browns on the outside.

505
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,402
The faun aspects
are coming together,

506
00:23:02,437 --> 00:23:04,237
and after I get the wig on...

507
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:05,271
Oh, my God.

508
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:07,523
...the emo character
comes to life.

509
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,242
That's super emo.

510
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:11,194
20 minutes, everyone.

511
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,568
At this point, things aren't
really going so well for me.

512
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:22,105
The face is really blocky,
so I'm not happy with it.

513
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,891
- Time's up.
- Yes!

514
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:27,744
I've already gone
down the wrong path.

515
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,846
My only hope
is that there's somebody else

516
00:23:29,881 --> 00:23:34,183
who went down an even
more wrong path to rescue me.

517
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:36,202
Coming up...

518
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:37,487
Son on of a bitch.

519
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:39,756
This is the worst
I've ever felt onstage.

520
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,025
It's the high point for you
thus far.

521
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:43,626
For me, it doesn't work.

522
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:55,193
So we're actually going
to do wardrobe first.

523
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:57,378
We get to the stage
for last looks.

524
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,765
I only have an hour, so
I first get her in her costume.

525
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,034
I have a lot of details
I have to do still.

526
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:04,535
Okay.
Airbrushing.

527
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:08,940
Son of a bitch.

528
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:11,659
I dipped my pinky
into a different color

529
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,578
on the Kryolan
grease paint palette,

530
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,348
and I end up with this big
red blotch right over his lip.

531
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,317
So I now have to do
a skin layer

532
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,720
and then do a beard shadow layer
just to get it fixed.

533
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,777
I may have
to sacrifice these horns

534
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:31,312
because there's a lot
of weight,

535
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:34,365
and even though I adjust it,
it's still too heavy.

536
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,533
Oh, well.

537
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:36,834
So I'm going to have
to forgo them.

538
00:24:36,886 --> 00:24:38,736
They are important,
because fauns have horns,

539
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,738
but I'm out of time,
and I don't have a choice.

540
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,274
It's 15 minutes, guys.

541
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:57,922
That's time, everybody.

542
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:00,358
Nerd.

543
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:02,894
Time's up, and I'm not happy
with the makeup,

544
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:05,997
and I'm really disappointed
I didn't get to do the horns.

545
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:19,143
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

546
00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:21,896
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

547
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:24,732
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

548
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,617
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio

549
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:27,618
Glenn Hetrick.

550
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:29,387
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Glenn.

551
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:31,923
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

552
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:33,858
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello, Lois.

553
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:35,860
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

554
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:36,861
Good evening.

555
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:39,330
- Hello.
- All right, guys.

556
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:40,898
This week,
your spotlight challenge

557
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:43,601
was to make a fantasy creature
high school student

558
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:46,637
using a classic clique
as inspiration.

559
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,172
Let's take a look
at your students.

560
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:13,364
He's totally attitude-y.

561
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:17,368
He would totally be a student
at this mythical high school.

562
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:38,205
He's trying to pick out
the wedgie,

563
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:39,557
and even from where
I'm standing,

564
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:42,493
I can see that snot
glistening on his nose.

565
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:05,599
I didn't realize until now
that she's way too alien,

566
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:08,653
and aliens
was not the challenge.

567
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:30,057
This is almost, like,

568
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:32,560
so over the top
that I can't actually imagine

569
00:27:32,612 --> 00:27:34,745
someone being this nerdy.

570
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:57,268
It's not my best work.

571
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:59,120
I wish it could be
a little more goblin-y,

572
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,439
but he looks like a dumb jock.

573
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,260
I'm still wishing
I had those horns

574
00:28:23,262 --> 00:28:25,629
and that I had bumped up more
in the faun area.

575
00:28:25,665 --> 00:28:28,766
I'll be really disappointed
if this is what takes me home.

576
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:50,604
As I'm looking at it,
I'm feeling maybe it's

577
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:53,674
a little bit too cow
and not enough minotaur.

578
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:06,270
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

579
00:29:06,305 --> 00:29:08,139
at this year's class?

580
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:17,414
Wow, that application's
really clean.

581
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:20,184
That's one of the best noses
I've seen on the show.

582
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:23,053
And the hair looks sort
of stuck on, but then again,

583
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:24,221
so does mine sometimes.

584
00:29:24,273 --> 00:29:26,757
It comes with the look, so...

585
00:29:30,313 --> 00:29:32,196
I love that we're getting
some texture--

586
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,348
some real sculpted texture
that feels genuine.

587
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:37,551
Even the runny nose
is hilarious, and look,

588
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:39,336
there's even freckles
on the arms.

589
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:41,021
I think that's rather sweet.

590
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,857
Could you open your mouth?

591
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:54,351
Okay, how many eyes
does a cyclops have?

592
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:57,121
Generally one.

593
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:59,473
She looks like a space alien
walking around with pom-poms,

594
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:00,558
not a cheerleader.

595
00:30:00,593 --> 00:30:02,860
- Exactly.
- If you take this away...

596
00:30:02,895 --> 00:30:04,044
You don't know what it is.

597
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,462
...you'd never know.

598
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:06,630
I can't even watch.

599
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:07,832
I'm just so nervous.

600
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:10,351
This is the worst
I've ever felt onstage.

601
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:13,470
I'm so embarrassed.

602
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:16,891
Who made your favorite fantasy
creature high school student?

603
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:19,944
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

604
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:24,233
It doesn't even feel
like a cheerleader.

605
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:25,851
She doesn't fit in,

606
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:28,020
and she was supposed
to be the coolest girl here.

607
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:29,622
So I have a problem.

608
00:30:29,657 --> 00:30:31,040
The one positive thing

609
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:33,892
is the fact that it's blinded
where the eyes are.

610
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:41,483
I really love
the oversized scale

611
00:30:41,535 --> 00:30:43,435
of some of her proportions.

612
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:44,703
It's really cartoony.

613
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:46,538
I've definitely never seen
anything like it.

614
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:48,490
Need a little more
skin texture here, though.

615
00:30:48,526 --> 00:30:50,326
This is very, like, barren.

616
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:52,645
The braces on her teeth
are great.

617
00:30:52,697 --> 00:30:57,082
Yeah.
Thank you.

618
00:30:57,118 --> 00:31:00,286
I don't understand the shapes
at all.

619
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:01,553
He's just not taking advantage

620
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:04,189
of any of the visual cues
that would say goblin.

621
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,592
The whole thing
looks like a mask.

622
00:31:06,627 --> 00:31:07,960
Look at the ear.

623
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:09,828
What the hell?

624
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:15,567
The decision
to drop your blending edge

625
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:16,869
right there on the cheek,

626
00:31:16,904 --> 00:31:19,555
it makes it almost impossible
for her to succeed.

627
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,007
That, and the rough texture,
are really working against her.

628
00:31:22,043 --> 00:31:25,511
Where's the ears?

629
00:31:25,563 --> 00:31:27,696
Take a look at one other
detail, which is down here.

630
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:28,947
It's an interesting idea.

631
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:31,233
- It's just poorly executed.
- Looks rough.

632
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:33,435
Mm-hmm.

633
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:38,223
The application
around the eyes is very nice.

634
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:40,209
This spotting,
that's a nice moment

635
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:41,827
as it comes off
of that and fades

636
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:43,128
into another color.

637
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:44,997
I like how the nose
and the mouth are,

638
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,465
but then you come down to this.

639
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,167
That's really very elegant.

640
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,835
But it doesn't feel
like a bull.

641
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,704
That's because she's a girl.

642
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:02,314
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

643
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,183
so let's find out
what they thought.

644
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:06,919
Dina,

645
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:09,972
Sasha,

646
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:12,908
Stella...

647
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:15,494
Congratulations
because you are safe this week

648
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:17,563
and can head back
to the makeup room.

649
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:19,681
Nice work.

650
00:32:19,734 --> 00:32:20,783
I'm in shock.

651
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:22,368
I can't believe I'm safe.

652
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:25,054
I feel like
I just pulled off a miracle.

653
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:30,526
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

654
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,528
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

655
00:32:32,563 --> 00:32:34,229
to learn more about your work.

656
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:36,934
Drew, could you please step up?

657
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:43,222
Drew, tell us
about your character.

658
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:46,759
This is Devon Faunda,
the emo faun.

659
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:52,181
And he's emo because nobody
listens to what he has to say,

660
00:32:52,216 --> 00:32:56,518
so he's resorted to dark music
and sad times alone.

661
00:32:56,554 --> 00:32:57,686
This is a new zenith.

662
00:32:57,721 --> 00:33:02,541
It's the high point for you
thus far.

663
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:04,860
There's something
about his expression

664
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:08,397
that reminds me of
a specific oil painting of pan,

665
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:12,201
and to make it
so accurate is wonderful,

666
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:14,069
and it has your twist on it.

667
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:15,237
Thank you.

668
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:17,372
I think
it's extremely well done.

669
00:33:17,408 --> 00:33:20,909
I think the color palette
is extremely good.

670
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:24,213
The forms are so good
on his face.

671
00:33:24,248 --> 00:33:27,249
The focus is entirely where
it needs to be, so very nice.

672
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:28,984
Thank you.

673
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,519
Drew, please step back.

674
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:32,654
- Thanks, buddy.
- Oh, don't touch me.

675
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:37,409
- Great job.
- Thanks.

676
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,862
Rachael, please step
to the center.

677
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:47,653
Please tell us
about your makeup.

678
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:49,021
So this is Courtney Faunda.

679
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,140
She is the most popular girl
in school.

680
00:33:51,192 --> 00:33:53,675
She's a<i> Mean Girls</i> character,

681
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:57,029
and I actually had horns but
didn't want to add any weight,

682
00:33:57,064 --> 00:33:58,647
so I didn't choose to do that.

683
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:03,802
There are some things
about makeup that concern me.

684
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:06,488
The frown shape of the sculpt,

685
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:09,358
it makes her look
almost demon-like.

686
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:11,393
I'm curious about the ears.

687
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,128
They seem to be hidden.

688
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,297
Was that a choice,
or how it ended up?

689
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:16,698
No, it was just
how it ended up.

690
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:18,834
Yeah, that wasn't
really intentional.

691
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:21,553
For me, this week,
it doesn't work.

692
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:25,107
It's so simple conceptually.

693
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:27,976
It's hard to find the faun
in this.

694
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:30,145
I think I know maybe
where you were going with it,

695
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,830
but I just can't see it.

696
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:33,031
Got you.

697
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,750
The ears
I thought were gorgeous.

698
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:37,619
Unfortunately, I can't even
take that into consideration

699
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:40,255
because that hair
is so voluminous,

700
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:43,442
and it is burying
the only aspect of your makeup

701
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:44,560
that says faun,

702
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:46,562
and that puts you
in a tough spot.

703
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:47,996
Yeah.

704
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:49,765
Rachael, you can step down.

705
00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:56,805
Cig.

706
00:35:04,465 --> 00:35:06,848
All right, Cig, tell us
about your creation here.

707
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:09,418
This is Manny Minotaurey.

708
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,453
He is the epitome of nerd,

709
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,256
and everyone's favorite joke
to play on them is,

710
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,159
they give him an atomic wedgie
that's so high up,

711
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:19,027
they wrap it around his horns,

712
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:20,479
so that way,

713
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:22,864
"You'll never find your way
out of your underpants, Manny."

714
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:28,020
It's a great character.

715
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:31,306
The detailing up close
is also solid.

716
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,192
There's still stuff
to entertain visually.

717
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:38,830
You've done a great job creating
a really memorable character.

718
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:39,948
Thank you.

719
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,967
My favorite thing
about this makeup

720
00:35:42,002 --> 00:35:44,486
is the suggestion
of an expression.

721
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:47,005
This is not
the big inexpression

722
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,974
that we're always
railing against.

723
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:51,426
It can still move.
It can still perform.

724
00:35:51,462 --> 00:35:55,464
I think a lot of the humor
resides in that expression.

725
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:57,583
I like the way
you brought the skin tone

726
00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:59,167
down onto the arms,

727
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:01,253
that kind of,
you know, freckly feel.

728
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:06,458
But I really love the form
of the nose to the mouth,

729
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,712
and when he does
the "bleh" thing there,

730
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:11,697
it's lovely.

731
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:16,018
It's funny, and it works.

732
00:36:16,053 --> 00:36:17,619
So very well done.

733
00:36:17,655 --> 00:36:20,289
- Awesome. Thank you.
- Cig, you can step down.

734
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:26,828
- Congrats, man.
- Good work.

735
00:36:26,864 --> 00:36:28,664
George, you're up.

736
00:36:33,937 --> 00:36:36,204
George, give us the background
of your character.

737
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,206
So this is Doug Oblin,

738
00:36:38,258 --> 00:36:44,780
and he is the quintessential
meathead, jock goblin.

739
00:36:44,815 --> 00:36:45,998
What you think about this guy

740
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,633
now that you see him
standing here?

741
00:36:47,668 --> 00:36:50,986
I wish I had found an excuse
for some more secondary forms.

742
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:51,987
I'm not super psyched on him.

743
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:53,989
I'm gonna agree with you

744
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:58,844
and up your need for secondary
forms exponentially.

745
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:01,413
It is blocky.

746
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:04,032
Not only is it sculpturally

747
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:06,284
really far away from finish,

748
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,104
it's not communicating goblin.

749
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:12,874
He's ending up
more of a muppet then a makeup,

750
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,509
and that's a problem.

751
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:17,946
And you really have
to practice eyebrows,

752
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:22,467
- because they are shockingly awful.
- Okay.

753
00:37:22,503 --> 00:37:26,021
The whole thing is so abrupt
in the angles in the brow.

754
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:27,689
It's just like,
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,

755
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:30,459
and like the eyebrows
being an abomination,

756
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:33,962
the ears are equal to that.

757
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,681
Agreed.
Thank you.

758
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:37,566
George, please step down.

759
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:43,572
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.

760
00:37:43,607 --> 00:37:45,807
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you had to say.

761
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:47,642
Please have back
to the makeup room

762
00:37:47,678 --> 00:37:48,643
while they deliberate.

763
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,362
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

764
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:57,402
All right, so let's start with
the looks you like the most,

765
00:37:57,454 --> 00:37:59,321
since we do need
a class valedictorian.

766
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:01,723
You really seem
to like Drew and Cig,

767
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:03,075
so let's start with Drew.

768
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,593
This is definitely

769
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:06,628
the high point
of his career on<i> Face Off.</i>

770
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,563
The way he handled the color,

771
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,766
it all just swept up
and brought your eye right

772
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:14,202
into this beautifully handled,
professionally executed makeup.

773
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:15,404
I completely agree,

774
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:17,706
and I think the profile
was rather marvelous.

775
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:19,174
It's stellar work.

776
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:22,778
It's pretty damn close
to being a perfect sculpt.

777
00:38:22,813 --> 00:38:24,629
All right,
what are your thoughts on Cig?

778
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:25,680
This is hilarious.

779
00:38:25,716 --> 00:38:27,048
This may be the funniest makeup

780
00:38:27,084 --> 00:38:28,850
we've had on the show,
but it's more than that.

781
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:30,285
It's sculpted well.

782
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,954
It's painted well,
and it's applied really well.

783
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:36,358
One of the things that really
impressed me was the neck.

784
00:38:36,393 --> 00:38:39,261
The hanging weight felt like
a real heavy piece.

785
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:40,629
That's hard to do.

786
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:42,631
I think it's out and out funny,

787
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:44,699
and the nose is just marvelous.

788
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:47,502
This may be Cig's best makeup
on the show so far.

789
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:50,138
All right, let's move on
to the looks you like the least.

790
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,623
Let's start with Rachael.

791
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:53,325
This is
a pretty severe failure.

792
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:55,977
The missing horns,
missing paint job,

793
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:58,780
the edge glaringly laying

794
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,683
across the middle of the face,
it's not good enough.

795
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:05,036
It's missing the go-to points
that say faun.

796
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:08,924
And technically, I think she
was really under par this week.

797
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,225
- Yeah.
- All right.

798
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,560
Let's move on to George.

799
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:14,529
This is just horrible
because it's unfinished.

800
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:15,997
It looks like a muppet.

801
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:17,699
Well, we're in Q&A,
and he's kind of going,

802
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:19,401
"Oh, I wish I could have put
more wrinkles."

803
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:20,836
What it needed were the forms.

804
00:39:20,871 --> 00:39:25,140
I think where he tripped up
was in the whole goblin aspect.

805
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:26,808
He's thinking
that classic goblin

806
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,376
where you gonna put big pores
in the nose

807
00:39:28,412 --> 00:39:29,778
and wrinkles, et cetera,

808
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,813
but he couldn't because
it's a high school student.

809
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:34,533
All right, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

810
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:35,667
Yes, we have.

811
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:38,119
Let's bring them back out.

812
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,762
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

813
00:39:47,798 --> 00:39:51,166
Drew, we love the sculptural
forms of your face,

814
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:54,436
and this was
the quintessential goth vibe

815
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:56,404
that you got
with this character.

816
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,009
And, Cig, your minotaur
was absolutely hilarious,

817
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:03,979
and some of the painting,
particularly up close,

818
00:40:04,014 --> 00:40:05,780
- really impressive.
- Thank you.

819
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:07,916
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

820
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:10,785
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

821
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:19,105
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

822
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:20,974
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

823
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:27,080
Drew.

824
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:30,333
You've chosen a great time
to step up your game.

825
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:33,053
This was your best makeup yet.
Good job.

826
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:34,387
Thank you very much, guys.

827
00:40:34,423 --> 00:40:36,189
I win.
I'm the winner.

828
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,557
It's my first win,

829
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,626
and it feels awesome
to have won

830
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:42,562
with such a really fun,
cool makeup.

831
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:44,731
- Drew, congratulations.
- Thank you.

832
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:47,517
You and Cig can head back
to the makeup room.

833
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,063
Unfortunately,

834
00:41:00,098 --> 00:41:02,415
that means the two of you
are on the bottom this week,

835
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:04,818
and one of you
will be eliminated.

836
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,653
Please step forward.

837
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:14,661
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the bottom looks.

838
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:17,964
Rachael, the trick
with the legs was quite clever,

839
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,499
but the only other thing

840
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:21,368
that was faun-like
were the ears,

841
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:23,303
and they were buried
underneath the wig.

842
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:26,740
George, we appreciate what you
were going for with this,

843
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,142
but he ended up looking
more like a Frankenstein

844
00:41:29,177 --> 00:41:30,610
than he did a goblin.

845
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:32,512
So who is going home tonight?

846
00:41:32,564 --> 00:41:34,214
The person
going home tonight is...

847
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:40,787
Rachael.

848
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:42,722
If you're going
to go that subtle

849
00:41:42,758 --> 00:41:44,758
with all of your appliances,

850
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,628
then the application
must be exquisite,

851
00:41:48,664 --> 00:41:52,232
and tonight, yours was not.

852
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:56,403
Rachel, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

853
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:58,255
That means, George,
you are safe this week

854
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,173
and can head back
to the makeup room.

855
00:42:05,013 --> 00:42:08,448
There's no shame in getting
this far in this competition.

856
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,283
You've shown us
tremendous work,

857
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,385
and I cannot wait to see
what you do after the show.

858
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:13,720
Thank you.

859
00:42:13,755 --> 00:42:15,205
Rachel, it's been so great

860
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,640
having you here with us,

861
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:18,291
but please head back
to the makeup room

862
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,609
and pack up your kit.

863
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:21,194
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

864
00:42:21,196 --> 00:42:22,195
This has been a lot of fun.

865
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,496
We've enjoyed having you here.

866
00:42:23,532 --> 00:42:24,831
Okay.
Thanks again, guys.

867
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,083
- It's been an honor.
- Good luck.

868
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,201
Thank you.

869
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:30,620
The most difficult thing
about going home now is,

870
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:33,290
it's not my best work by far.

871
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:34,941
- It's me.
- Oh.

872
00:42:34,977 --> 00:42:36,443
- No.
- Yeah.

873
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:40,330
I'm just really glad to be where
I am and have gotten so far,

874
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:43,366
and I'm just really honored.

875
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:44,651
Love you guys.

876
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:47,037
This has been a really great
learning experience,

877
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:49,689
and I will always be
doing makeup,

878
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:51,958
because I love it.

879
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:55,061
This is definitely
a top ten experience of my life.
