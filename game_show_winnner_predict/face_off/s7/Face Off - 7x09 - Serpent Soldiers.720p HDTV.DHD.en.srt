1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,767
I have to tell you
that I'm really impressed.

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:05,248
I think it's great fun.

3
00:00:05,282 --> 00:00:06,983
- Bloody Mary.
- Aah!

4
00:00:07,018 --> 00:00:08,918
Previously on <i>Face Off--</i>

5
00:00:08,953 --> 00:00:11,454
George's gory villain
brought him his first win,

6
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,356
and Sasha was saved
from elimination.

7
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:15,425
We've decided to use
our special immunity.

8
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:18,294
I was saved!

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,296
Nine artists remain,

10
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:22,532
and tonight, they will take on
a real American hero...

11
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:25,301
- Oh, my God!
- I love this challenge!

12
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:28,271
But some artists will stumble
on the battlefield.

13
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:29,706
I'm totally
gonna blow the save.

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,275
Somehow it's just all gone
a bit mimzy.

15
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,711
In the end,
only one will win a VIP trip

16
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:36,446
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,748
to one of their 85
international locations,

18
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,584
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

19
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:43,887
and $100,000.

20
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:48,458
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

21
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:23,693
- Congratulations on...
- Yeah.

22
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:25,595
- ...your first win finally.
- Yeah, first one.

23
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:26,763
That's some beautiful makeup.

24
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:28,264
You should be really proud
of that one.

25
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,034
I'm the only person
who hasn't had a top look yet.

26
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:33,002
I've been safe
and on the bottom.

27
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:35,872
It's time to kick the door in
on this competition

28
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:38,174
and say, "I'm here,
and I'm ready."

29
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:40,777
I'm hopin' to turn it around.

30
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,884
That is a big ship.

31
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:51,187
Yeah. So we're walking up
the ramp of a huge battleship.

32
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,490
- Look at those guns.
- It's incredible.

33
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,959
It's humongous. We're all
just itching to find out

34
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:57,427
what it is
we're gonna be doing.

35
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,929
A lot of secrets
in those boxes.

36
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:02,065
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

37
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,567
Welcome to the battleship <i>Iowa.</i>

38
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,703
This colossal military marvel

39
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:09,439
served in both World War II
and the Korean War

40
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:12,442
before it was retired
by the US Navy in 1990.

41
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:16,346
It's now a public museum
right here in San Pedro.

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,415
- It's pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,351
All right,
well, let's talk about

44
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:22,752
your next spotlight challenge.

45
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,854
From action figures
and comic books

46
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:29,392
to animated series
and global blockbuster movies,

47
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:32,428
few brands have had the cultural
resonance and enduring appeal

48
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,830
of GI Joe.

49
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:35,632
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

50
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,901
I lose it
because playing with GI Joes

51
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:40,570
was big in my kid life,
so I'm ready for this.

52
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:42,972
Celebrating its
50th anniversary this year,

53
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:46,676
the GI Joe universe features
state-of-the-art technology,

54
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,344
highly skilled assassins,

55
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,447
and an array of uniquely
talented and heroic soldiers.

56
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:55,952
But beyond all that,
Snake Eyes and Cobra Commander

57
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,288
are evidence
of an overlying theme

58
00:02:58,322 --> 00:03:01,191
shared by
its most memorable characters--

59
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,892
snakes.

60
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:05,161
- Ooh.
- Hmm.

61
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:07,363
Inside these crates

62
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:10,400
lies a variety of exotic

63
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,368
- and even deadly snakes.
- Oh.

64
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:13,970
No.

65
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:15,371
Me and snakes are not friends.

66
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:18,708
They are creepy.
They will bite you.

67
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:20,410
And I want them
to stay away from me.

68
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:22,345
First we have

69
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,280
- a gaboon viper...
- Sweet.

70
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:25,815
- Oh.
- Nice.

71
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,251
The tiger rat snake...

72
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:31,154
- Yes.
- The hognosed snake...

73
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:35,191
Namibian coral cobra...

74
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:39,229
- What?
- Green tree python,

75
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:42,232
the Christmas tree
eyelash viper...

76
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:43,900
Now, those are cool.

77
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:47,470
The albino reticulated python,

78
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:51,207
the Brazilian rainbow boa,

79
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,409
- there's one more...
- Oh.

80
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:55,378
- Shut up.
- Oh, jeez.

81
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:58,448
The green anaconda.

82
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,316
- Oh!
- Whoa!

83
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,752
Oh, my God.
I think he's trying to get out.

84
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:04,887
- That is massive.
- All right,

85
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:07,757
your spotlight challenge
is to choose one of these snakes

86
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,260
and use it to inspire
your very own

87
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:12,462
GI Joe super soldier.

88
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:15,064
- Yes! I love this challenge!
- Cool.

89
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,667
Rachael, you're up first.

90
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,136
Green tree python.

91
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,671
Tiger rat snake.

92
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:24,507
The hognosed snake.

93
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,309
The gaboon viper.

94
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:27,644
Christmas tree eyelash viper.

95
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:29,545
Albino reticulated python.

96
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,947
The green anaconda.

97
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,449
Brazilian rainbow boa.

98
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,686
Namibian coral cobra.
Ugh.

99
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,721
Okay, guys,
I am happy to tell you

100
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,657
that there's
a very exciting prize

101
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,159
for the winner of this week's
spotlight challenge.

102
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:45,728
The winner will receive
a huge prize package

103
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,597
fill with special edition toys

104
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:51,434
from Hasbro's 50th anniversary
GI Joe collection.

105
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:53,469
- Awesome!
- I love toys.

106
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:55,705
I want this so bad.

107
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:58,007
I would have the most insane-o
GI Joe parties.

108
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:01,210
Like, every Sunday, come over,
let's have some battles.

109
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:03,713
All right, it's time to get
started on your designs.

110
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:06,749
Now, I've set up some Samsung
televisions at the lab,

111
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,785
so be sure to take
lots of pictures

112
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,753
with your tablets
so that you can mirror them

113
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,855
on the big screens
while you guys sculpt.

114
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,357
I'll see you later on
with my dad

115
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,359
- to check in on your progress.
- Thank you.

116
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:18,728
Bye.

117
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,963
What's up, dude?

118
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,968
An anaconda is the embodiment
of the super soldier.

119
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:28,838
It's just a solid tube
of muscle,

120
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:30,640
and I want to bring that
into my character.

121
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:33,209
So my character
is Nick Strangle--

122
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:34,977
code name "Manaconda."

123
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:37,213
You can just drop him off
in the jungle

124
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,882
and he'll kill everyone.

125
00:05:43,153 --> 00:05:46,155
I chose the green tree python.

126
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,591
My super soldier
is the jungle assassin

127
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,460
who works for Cobra Commander.

128
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:52,929
He is a green tree python
hybrid,

129
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:55,131
and I am thinking of
incorporating the scales,

130
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,933
a really wicked green color,

131
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,168
and these unusual
heat-seeking organs

132
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:02,472
that are all down the face.

133
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,678
I picked the Christmas tree
eyelash viper

134
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:11,247
because it has scales
that look like eyelashes.

135
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:14,083
I'm gonna do this
female ninja-esque assassin,

136
00:06:14,118 --> 00:06:16,119
and her code name is "Lashes."

137
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,959
I chose
the Namibian coral cobra.

138
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:24,761
Looking at the snake,

139
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:26,829
I noticed that
the scales on the head

140
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,998
look more like armor,

141
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:33,269
so my character is
this motorcycle chick

142
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:36,606
who wears this padded
motorcycle outfit

143
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,341
that looks like body armor.

144
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,376
I think I'm gonna stick with
the cobra theme

145
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,311
and make her
one of the bad guys.

146
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:44,447
All right, everybody,
let's head it back to the lab.

147
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:57,827
We have six and a half hours
in the lab

148
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,629
and I'm so excited
to start this.

149
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:02,465
But first, we have to
pick our models.

150
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:07,737
By the time it's my turn,
all the females get taken

151
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:10,773
and my concept is
a female character.

152
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,241
So I'm dumbfounded.

153
00:07:12,276 --> 00:07:13,943
I wasn't even considering

154
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,412
male body types or anything.

155
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:20,016
I see Matt and pick him.

156
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,051
You know, I'm just
gonna go from there.

157
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:24,520
I'm gonna need to do
some major rethinking.

158
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:30,660
We get in the lab,
and we have Samsung TV monitors

159
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:31,961
that mirror what we have
on our tablets.

160
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,930
So it's gonna
help me out a lot.

161
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:36,065
My super soldier is
a snake-human hybrid,

162
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,568
who used to be human and a Joe,

163
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:42,371
but was bound by Cobra and
injected with gaboon viper DNA,

164
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,640
and he's now an assassin
for Cobra Commander.

165
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:50,079
My snake is
the albino reticulated python,

166
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:52,548
and I want to make
a femme fatale character.

167
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,352
I want her to be transitioning
from a human anatomy

168
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,221
into snake.

169
00:07:58,255 --> 00:07:59,956
I don't really know
the GI Joe world,

170
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,824
because I was a Barbie girl,

171
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:04,160
so I'm nervous
about this challenge,

172
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,329
but I'm hoping
that I can make it work.

173
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:11,501
Since the judges gave me
the second chance,

174
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,102
I want to do something
really awesome,

175
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:15,104
and I want to get a win.

176
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:16,906
I picked the hognosed snake.

177
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,876
The hognosed snakes
use their snouts

178
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,111
to dig in the dirt.

179
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:26,015
So I'm making a ninja
that digs holes in the dirt

180
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:29,852
and jumps out of the holes
and attacks.

181
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,392
I'm not doing a full face,
I'm doing pieces.

182
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:38,461
I want to make
something different

183
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:41,030
than what everybody else
is doing

184
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:42,765
because I want to stand out
from the rest of the makeup.

185
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,967
So rather than
a snake-human hybrid,

186
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,303
I decide to design
a human super soldier

187
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:50,139
who has used body modification

188
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,708
to become more reptilian
or snakelike.

189
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:55,011
Instead of
a full facial appliance,

190
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm thinking I'll do
small facial prosthetics

191
00:08:57,714 --> 00:09:01,117
and snake scale tattoos
on the neck and face.

192
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,591
I end up with
the Brazilian rainbow boa.

193
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:12,028
And in GI Joe,
the female characters

194
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,564
are portrayed as really sexy,
strong types,

195
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:17,600
so I'm gonna make
a super-sexy sniper snake.

196
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:22,238
My snake has a lot
of consistent scaling,

197
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,940
and they're all pretty much
the same size.

198
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,042
So I grab a popsicle stick

199
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,611
and I carve it down
to the shape of the scale.

200
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:32,148
And I start, one by one,
putting all the scales in.

201
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,617
My boyfriend, Michael,
is an action figure collector,

202
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,653
so I really want to win
this prize for him.

203
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:42,625
I block out my forms,

204
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,760
but it's really hard
to make a snake

205
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:48,197
with this strange nose shape.

206
00:09:48,231 --> 00:09:50,933
It just-- Everything I keep doing
looks so stupid.

207
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:53,436
It's looking like a duck
or a pig.

208
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,404
And I'm just having
a lot of problems.

209
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:58,547
_

210
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:03,112
So I have to ask everyone
for help.

211
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,814
More, like, sleeker or slimmer.

212
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,248
You might want to bring it
all the way back here.

213
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:08,117
This line should come up.

214
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,353
I tried that.
It looks so weird.

215
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:13,356
I'm really lost at this moment.
I can't figure this out at all.

216
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,091
It's a complete disaster.

217
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,759
And it would be so bad
to go home

218
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:18,661
right after they saved me.

219
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,696
Coming up...

220
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,865
You really set a challenge out
for yourself.

221
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,300
Am I making
the right choice here?

222
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,369
Like nothing.

223
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:28,671
All of your choices
are perfect.

224
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,540
Everything I keep doing
looks so stupid.

225
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:40,544
It's day 1 of our GI Joe
super soldier challenge,

226
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:43,180
and I'm having a lot of problems
making a snake

227
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:45,449
with this strange nose shape.

228
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,217
That looks so weird.

229
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:48,886
I just keep pushing clay around

230
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,322
and I'm just having
a lot of problems.

231
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:53,324
I'm really lost at this moment.

232
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:56,694
I can't figure this out at all.

233
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:58,362
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

234
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,397
Dad and I are here
to check in on you.

235
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:01,966
- How are ya?
- Hey, guys.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,501
- What did you pick today?
- I picked the hognose.

237
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:06,670
He has, like, a pig nose

238
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,339
and the worst problem right now

239
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,040
is he--
he looks like a duck.

240
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,775
- I need a little bit of help.
- It looks like,

241
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,211
on the end of his nose here, it
kind of comes up a little bit.

242
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:16,447
- Yeah.
- That you don't have here.

243
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,949
Here you're all rounded off.
You need to add that on there.

244
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:21,418
Okay. Oh, that's cool.
That looks really cool.

245
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,620
And the snakes--
their look doesn't come out.

246
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,622
- You need to take this down.
- Yeah.

247
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,725
- So Mr. Westmore helps a lot...
- Good luck.

248
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,160
Thank you.
But I've lost a lot of time,

249
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:32,896
and I'm gonna have to sculpt
a little faster to catch up.

250
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:34,431
So I got the Christmas tree
eyelash viper.

251
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,501
Originally, I wanted to do
a female,

252
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:39,403
but I have a male model,

253
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:41,405
so now I'm going to do
a ninja assassin

254
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,108
that was part of
the Naga ninja clan

255
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:45,476
I like your sculpture.

256
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,444
Are you gonna have contacts on
underneath?

257
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,213
I was gonna see if I could
maybe put this over

258
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,281
- the vacuform.
- Put a light haze

259
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:53,384
on the inside of your plastic

260
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,753
and then paint their eyes black
behind it.

261
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,221
Yeah.

262
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,556
So I have
the green tree python,

263
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,726
and he has these fantastic
little, like, heat sensors,

264
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:05,195
so I'm definitely putting those
into my sculpt.

265
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,964
The side thing is so unique
to your snake.

266
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:08,866
- Yeah.
- Don't stop these here.

267
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,567
- I would keep going with this...
- Okay.

268
00:12:10,602 --> 00:12:13,270
...because that'll just overlay
on the cowl anyways

269
00:12:13,304 --> 00:12:15,239
when you go to put it on.

270
00:12:15,273 --> 00:12:17,941
Instead of doing
a human-snake hybrid,

271
00:12:17,976 --> 00:12:22,212
I'm doing a human who has used
the art of body modification

272
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:24,915
to change their features
to look more snakelike.

273
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:29,747
What your whole project is
going to boil down to

274
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,788
is a painting,

275
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:32,556
because you don't have
a lot more going on here.

276
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,125
You've really set a challenge
out for yourself.

277
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,928
- Right.
- Good luck.

278
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:38,630
Thank you very much.
Everybody else is sculpting

279
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:40,065
these massive
human-snake hybrids.

280
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:42,634
And I'm the only artist
who's sculpting

281
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,636
these small, delicate
facial pieces.

282
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,638
It's a little scary,
and I'm gonna take that risk,

283
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:48,707
but I'm thinking, am I making
the right choice here?

284
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:52,810
Her name is Lady Reticula.
She's an assassin.

285
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:56,013
And I really like the vents
that go around the mouth,

286
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:58,515
so I wanted to incorporate
that idea on the face.

287
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,219
Mm-hmm. You need to bring
more snake into it.

288
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:03,687
- Mm-hmm.
- And you've got eyes here

289
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,756
in the front,
as opposed to out here.

290
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,558
Yeah, okay.

291
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:09,526
All right, everybody,
we're heading out.

292
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,928
- It's looking good.
- Bye, guys. Thank you.

293
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:13,697
- Looking good.
- Thank you.

294
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:18,669
So I finish sculpting the face,

295
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:21,872
and I get ready to mold it.

296
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:24,642
I want to get this face molded
by the end of the day

297
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:26,310
so I can match it up
to the cowl

298
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:27,712
and hopefully
even pre-paint it.

299
00:13:27,746 --> 00:13:29,480
And I'm feeling pretty good
right now.

300
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:32,516
I really like my design so far.

301
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:35,653
30 minutes, guys.

302
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,797
At the end of day one,
I'm worried

303
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:49,433
after hearing
Mr. Westmore say

304
00:13:49,468 --> 00:13:51,135
that "I don't
see snake enough,"

305
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:52,970
I mean, that's one of the
biggest parts of the challenge

306
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,572
is your snake species.

307
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:57,575
Every second I can, I'm looking
back and forth at the snake

308
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,643
and trying to find more
attributes of the snake

309
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:02,546
to pull into my makeup.

310
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:05,282
All right, it's time,
everybody.

311
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:08,819
I've never done GI Joes
or snakes,

312
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:11,989
and I'm really hoping that
I can dream about my character

313
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:14,892
and get a little bit
of inspiration overnight.

314
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:27,872
- Whoo.
- Yay!

315
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:30,007
Whoo!

316
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,842
It's day 2
of our GI Joe challenge

317
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:33,310
and we have nine and a half
hours in the lab.

318
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:35,146
And since I didn't get
a female model,

319
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,414
that really threw me off
a little bit.

320
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:39,517
But I was able to sleep
on my concept,

321
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:41,552
and I get the idea
that it would be really cool

322
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:44,622
if he had these snake heads
as shoulder armor.

323
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:47,291
Since I have a clear direction,
now I'm just excited.

324
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:50,861
I'm back in the game, and I'm
ready to get this stuff done.

325
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:59,737
You're doing the whole cowl
like that, too?

326
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:03,007
- Yeah.
- Holy crap, girl.

327
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,142
For my cowl, I want to sculpt
individual scales.

328
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:08,913
I know that I've done
something like this before,

329
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:12,216
but I'm hoping that if I
paint it completely different

330
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,552
this isn't just gonna be
a repeat of my cat owl.

331
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:22,760
I'm scrapping my cowl
and just doing a wig.

332
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:26,063
There's just not enough time
for me to make a cowl,

333
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:28,232
so I decide to go with

334
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,934
a strawberry blonde wig,

335
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:32,002
'cause I want to tie the idea

336
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:34,104
of her being albino
into the makeup.

337
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,706
I'm gonna spray a lot of it
white and leave,

338
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,475
- like, the tips yellow.
- I love it.

339
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:47,084
After I spend
a good amount of time

340
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:49,887
finishing up the face sculpt,

341
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:53,624
I get to work sculpting out
my helmet cowl,

342
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:55,860
and then I get
totally surprised...

343
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:57,400
- Hey...
- Hi.

344
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:58,401
_

345
00:15:58,402 --> 00:15:59,430
What's that?

346
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:00,951
_

347
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:02,499
Oh, my God.

348
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,982
_

349
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:04,902
_

350
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,570
Okay.

351
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,118
_

352
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:10,541
I find out
that my model is sick,

353
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:13,110
and now I'll be getting
a new model

354
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:15,079
who has a much smaller face.

355
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:17,648
And my only choices
at this point

356
00:16:17,682 --> 00:16:20,718
are resculpt the face

357
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,920
or take a piece that's made
for someone else's face

358
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:24,655
and try to make it fit.
Okay.

359
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:27,157
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

360
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:28,692
Whatever.

361
00:16:35,551 --> 00:16:37,518
It's day two in the lab,

362
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,320
and I'll be getting a new model

363
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:42,023
who has a much smaller face,

364
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:43,558
and I'm a little bit uneasy

365
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:45,593
about how the prosthetic
is going to fit her.

366
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:48,830
I'm not gonna spend a whole day
resculpting a face.

367
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:50,331
So hopefully, it'll fit.

368
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,466
I don't have time
to resculpt the face

369
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,769
because I need to get
my helmet finished.

370
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:57,104
So I have to carry on.
There's no other choice.

371
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,382
An anaconda is just so thick
and solid,

372
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:11,419
so I know that I want to have
certain muscles accentuated

373
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,054
on my character,

374
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:15,690
so I need to design and
fabricate an entire bodysuit.

375
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:18,459
So I sketch out the specific
muscles that I want

376
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,194
on couch foam.

377
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:22,363
Once I get all my patterns
cut out,

378
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:24,799
I go to the belt sander

379
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,201
and I start refining them
and smoothing them out.

380
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,203
For never having done
a muscle suit before,

381
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:30,738
I think it came out
pretty cool.

382
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:33,107
Do you wanna go to the beach?

383
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,476
Like nothing.

384
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:44,051
I'm working on the cowl
and I'm not liking

385
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:46,220
where this sculpt is at all.

386
00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:48,723
But I don't have a lot of time,

387
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:50,758
and I really need
to get this cowl molded

388
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:54,228
or I'm not gonna have anything
for tomorrow.

389
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:56,797
One of my most important
features of the snake

390
00:17:56,832 --> 00:17:58,666
is his fangs.

391
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,968
So I find a set of these
really big, nasty ogre dentures

392
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:03,037
and clip
all the extra teeth off,

393
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:05,439
and then I paint it
with alcohol colors

394
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:07,875
and clear coat with
a Kryolan clear nail polish

395
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,543
just to keep that shine.

396
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:12,580
I think they're reading
like snake teeth perfectly.

397
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,918
So I finish the cowl

398
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:19,854
and I have to make a visor
for it.

399
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:22,490
So I take these round forms

400
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:25,226
and then I sculpt the visor
shape onto the round form

401
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,861
and vacuform it.

402
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:30,264
Then I will be using
that plastic piece

403
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,801
as the visor to my helmet.

404
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,603
One hour!

405
00:18:41,944 --> 00:18:43,678
So you're just gonna have two?

406
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:46,480
- Oh, no. He's gonna have ten.
- Oh, yeah, you got 'em all.

407
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:48,749
So I get this idea
to make claws.

408
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:50,551
The claws are sort of
an extension

409
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:52,687
of the tiger rat snake's bite.

410
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:54,422
And I take a razor blade,

411
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:56,257
and I start carving off
shavings of it

412
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,459
and then spray-paint them
with this really nice

413
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:00,795
metallic spray paint.

414
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:02,530
And they end up looking like
brushed steel,

415
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,799
and they look really cool.

416
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:08,836
I'm making some scales.

417
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,105
My character has exposed hands,

418
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:13,908
so I do need scales
to put on the hands.

419
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,811
So I just make a flat mold
of some scales

420
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:20,748
that I can kind of
piece together however I want.

421
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,817
- What's that time say?
- 15.

422
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:27,021
I'm feeling
a little frustrated.

423
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:30,391
I got both of my molds done, but
I feel like I rushed the cowl.

424
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:32,460
That time, guys!

425
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:36,063
I'm worried about application
tomorrow,

426
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:39,100
because I am not fond
of the things that I've done.

427
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:42,103
So now it's all about
the paint job.

428
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:51,846
- Whoo!
- ♪ The Manaconda ♪

429
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,515
So it's application day, and we
have four hours in the lab

430
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,917
and one hour last looks.

431
00:19:56,952 --> 00:19:58,986
I'm just having a blast here,
and I just want to win

432
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,922
the 50th anniversary
GI Joe set so bad.

433
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:05,960
How'd your pieces come out,
Rachael?

434
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:07,495
My cowl is a little messed up.

435
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:10,898
- Here they come.
- What up, dude?

436
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:12,533
So I got the albino python.

437
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,502
I gotta make sure
everything fits.

438
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:15,836
All right.

439
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,405
First thing I do is
fit my pieces on my new model.

440
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,874
And now, I gotta find noseholes
for you.

441
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:21,842
It's way too big for her face.

442
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:23,778
It goes all the way back
into her hairline.

443
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:27,481
Her bottom lip and chin
don't fit into the appliance.

444
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:30,184
I have to figure out how
I'm going to make it work.

445
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:34,622
Chin down.

446
00:20:34,623 --> 00:20:37,558
Tilt your head back
a little bit. Okay.

447
00:20:37,592 --> 00:20:40,094
I get the face and the cowl on,

448
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:42,396
and it's just not lining up.

449
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:45,933
I'm so nervous that
I'm totally gonna blow the save.

450
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,768
This is not turning out good.

451
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:50,309
_

452
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:52,339
This entire makeup rests
on application.

453
00:20:52,374 --> 00:20:53,774
It has to be perfect.

454
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,977
And my approach to this paint
job is all spatterwork.

455
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,480
Spatter creates
a really fine mist

456
00:20:59,514 --> 00:21:01,982
of thin, translucent colors,
and it's a very realistic,

457
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:04,085
believable way to paint skin.

458
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,053
What am I missing?
What am I missing?

459
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,988
Yellow.
Okay, that's good.

460
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:10,089
_

461
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:13,027
I finally fixed the face,
but the cowl's too big on her.

462
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:16,764
So I'm not sure
what I'm gonna do.

463
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:18,752
_

464
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:24,572
- Yours is looking really cool.
- Thanks.

465
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:26,707
It's really starting to look
like an action figure.

466
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:28,843
The coolest part about my snake

467
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:30,744
is the iridescent sheen

468
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:32,847
the scales give off
when the light hits it.

469
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,816
So I'm drybrushing pearl
onto the scales.

470
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:38,185
She's really coming to life.

471
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,188
I think the biggest thing
that I'm freaking out about

472
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:43,157
- is the transition right now.
- Yeah.

473
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:44,825
It's just really muddy.

474
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,161
I really don't like this cowl.
All I can see is green.

475
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:50,331
So I'm a little bit worried
about how I'm gonna break it up.

476
00:21:50,365 --> 00:21:52,933
Don't go white.
Don't do a sharp line.

477
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:54,869
I hope that I can pull it out
with my paint job.

478
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,871
- Spatter over it...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

479
00:21:56,905 --> 00:21:58,405
- To make it blend in more.
- Yeah.

480
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,341
Ten minutes, guys!

481
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:06,881
_

482
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:08,749
As I'm looking
at my overall piece,

483
00:22:08,783 --> 00:22:10,050
I'm a little nervous

484
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,019
that I didn't push the snake
far enough.

485
00:22:13,488 --> 00:22:15,589
All right, guys, it's time!

486
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,625
It's really missing something,

487
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:19,493
and I'm not really sure what.

488
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:22,763
I hope that that's not something
that's gonna send me home.

489
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,667
Coming up...

490
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:28,969
- I hate this headpiece.
- I'm still a little nervous

491
00:22:29,004 --> 00:22:30,671
that they're gonna be like,
"What the fuck is that?"

492
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:33,641
- It doesn't work.
- This idea is brilliant.

493
00:22:44,336 --> 00:22:47,004
Okay.
We have one hour in last looks,

494
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:49,473
and I hate this headpiece
so much.

495
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:52,877
It doesn't fit on her head.

496
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:54,512
So the first thing I do
is throw this helmet away

497
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:57,081
and style her hair.

498
00:22:57,115 --> 00:22:59,984
This could be
the biggest mistake.

499
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:02,953
I just need to get
the rest of your tattoos on

500
00:23:02,988 --> 00:23:05,422
and get your gloves made
and throw your hair up.

501
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,093
Okay.
I'm looking at my model's hair,

502
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,195
and I realize that
it's balding on the top,

503
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:13,264
so I decide to incorporate
some white hair

504
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:15,266
to give it more volume.

505
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,801
But at this point,
I really don't know

506
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:19,270
if I like this character
at all.

507
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:21,739
What do you think
about the eyes?

508
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:24,475
I'm looking at the eyes,
and I'm not sure if I like them

509
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,110
- or if I don't like them.
- I think

510
00:23:26,144 --> 00:23:28,212
- he looks better with 'em in.
- Mm.

511
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:32,716
I'm liking the way
the tattoos are coming along.

512
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,251
They have that faded,
self-applied look

513
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:35,719
that I really want.

514
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:38,122
Ten minutes, guys.

515
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,597
Guys, that's time!

516
00:23:46,631 --> 00:23:48,599
Any good?

517
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:50,534
My makeup is
drastically different

518
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,503
than everybody else's.
I'm still a little nervous

519
00:23:52,537 --> 00:23:54,205
that they're gonna be like,
"What the fuck is this?"

520
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:57,041
I need a top look
to show the judges

521
00:23:57,075 --> 00:24:00,177
that I have what it takes
to win.

522
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:12,790
Welcome to
the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

523
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:15,960
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

524
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:18,229
Let's say hello
to our talented judges--

525
00:24:18,263 --> 00:24:20,564
owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick...

526
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,933
- Good evening, guys.
- Hi, Glenn.

527
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:25,402
Oscar-winning makeup artist,
Lois Burwell...

528
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:27,204
- Evening, all.
- Hi, Lois.

529
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:29,173
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page...

530
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:31,475
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

531
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:34,144
All right, guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

532
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:36,947
was to choose a snake
and use it as inspiration

533
00:24:36,982 --> 00:24:40,050
for your very own
GI Joe super soldier.

534
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:41,785
And tonight's winner
will receive

535
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,321
a prize package filled
with special edition toys

536
00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:48,125
from Hasbro's 50th anniversary
GI Joe collection.

537
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,894
All right, let's take a look
at your serpent soldiers.

538
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:17,788
I think he looks awesome.
He looks like an action figure.

539
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:20,691
I created something
really cool.

540
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:43,347
There's no way to predict
what the judges are thinking.

541
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:45,716
But I feel really good
about this makeup.

542
00:26:05,536 --> 00:26:08,071
I'm pleased with the amount
of work I got done,

543
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:09,906
but I'm not happy
with my super soldier.

544
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:33,030
It reads like snake up close,

545
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:34,698
and it reads like snake
from far away.

546
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:36,967
I'm really proud of him,
and I think he looks

547
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:39,703
like a complete badass.

548
00:26:58,389 --> 00:26:59,890
It looks cool.

549
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:01,925
It reads super soldier,

550
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,995
and he looks like a GI Joe.

551
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,249
She's super sexy.

552
00:27:26,284 --> 00:27:28,218
She looks like a snake,

553
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:32,222
and she's just, like,
everything I wanted her to be.

554
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:54,277
This whole challenge
was one disaster after another.

555
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:56,113
So I just hope
that this is enough

556
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:58,448
to keep me at least safe.

557
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:21,605
It's not my best work.

558
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:23,607
And it would be so bad
to go home

559
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:25,742
right after they saved me.

560
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,665
She's not as imposing
as I would have liked her to be,

561
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,134
so I'm really just kind of
holding my breath on this one.

562
00:28:57,341 --> 00:29:00,076
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look at our soldiers?

563
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:11,588
Do you think
really great symmetry

564
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:13,023
- for something this size?
- Yes.

565
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:15,258
And look at the lovely makeup
he's done on the arms.

566
00:29:15,293 --> 00:29:16,960
Yeah, yeah.

567
00:29:16,994 --> 00:29:20,130
The color combination, too,
is very action figure.

568
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:22,365
It's really smart.

569
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:25,602
No biting.

570
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:27,871
The color is
pretty spectacular.

571
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:29,472
Yes, it is.

572
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:32,342
I really think it is
a refreshing change.

573
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:37,581
It's got all the components.

574
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:41,184
It's just lacking a good sense
of primary form.

575
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:42,452
_

576
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:43,920
I'm super disappointed,

577
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,156
because I regret some of
the sculptural choices I made.

578
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,757
His head feels a bit bulbous,

579
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:50,193
- and it doesn't feel like a snake.
- Yeah.

580
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:55,105
And it'll suck to go home for
something I'm not happy with.

581
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:58,875
Who made your favorite
GI Joe snake soldier?

582
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,745
Tell us on Twitter using
#FaceOff.

583
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:03,957
His head feels baboon-ish,

584
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:05,358
the way
it comes into the muzzle.

585
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:07,327
- It doesn't feel like a snake.
- Yeah.

586
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:10,296
I'm super disappointed in
some of the choices I've made.

587
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:13,967
So I'm just hoping to be safe.

588
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:16,069
- I'm glad we're seeing fangs.
- Yes.

589
00:30:16,103 --> 00:30:19,072
That's really pretty. I love
this treatment of the neck.

590
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:23,643
It looks better up close,
doesn't it?

591
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:25,745
Yeah.

592
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:27,020
_

593
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,184
Look at the iridescence
coming through.

594
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:33,286
- Yeah.
- It just gives it some life.

595
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,556
The precision and layout
of these scales

596
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,458
is incredible.

597
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:43,396
This is a female character,

598
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,132
and I like how small
the shapes are.

599
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,568
- Quite large scale patterns.
- Yes.

600
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:54,240
The scales feel
more feather-like.

601
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,808
There's something about it

602
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:58,111
that reminds me of the owl
she'd sculpted.

603
00:30:58,145 --> 00:31:00,513
There's some
nice coloring in here.

604
00:31:00,547 --> 00:31:01,781
Mm-hmm.

605
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:04,150
Thank you.

606
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:09,978
There's something very matte
and dead about the color choices.

607
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:11,647
The nose is the worst part,

608
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,715
because it doesn't feel
reptilian.

609
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:22,291
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations.

610
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:23,525
So let's find out
what they thought.

611
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,128
Stella.

612
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:28,764
George.

613
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:30,866
Damien.

614
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:34,770
Congratulations,
because you are safe

615
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:36,371
and can head back
to the makeup room.

616
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,240
Good luck, guys.

617
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:45,814
The rest of you were
the best and the worst.

618
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:47,716
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

619
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,419
to learn more about your work.

620
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,054
Cig, you're up.

621
00:31:57,026 --> 00:31:58,994
Tell us about your character

622
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:01,730
and how you integrated
the elements of your viper.

623
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:03,799
I picked the Christmas tree
eyelash viper.

624
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,734
This is the last remaining
Naga ninja.

625
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,236
And I just wanted
to make something

626
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,538
that I would want to own
as an action figure.

627
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:11,773
I'll take two,
one to keep in the package

628
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,582
- and one to play with.
- Awesome.

629
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:15,901
This is the quintessence

630
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,181
of the bold graphic
action figure style.

631
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:21,016
Really knocked this one
out of the park, man.

632
00:32:21,051 --> 00:32:22,618
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

633
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:25,521
I like the epaulets
particularly.

634
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:27,757
I like the color choices, too.
Well done.

635
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,925
- Thank you.
- The form development

636
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,261
on the face is so good

637
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:34,430
around the cheekbones,
the chin.

638
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:36,866
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you guys so much.

639
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,369
Cig, you can step down.

640
00:32:40,404 --> 00:32:42,538
Way awesome, dude.

641
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,407
Rachael.

642
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:53,482
Tell us about your snake
and the makeup.

643
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:55,418
I chose the green tree python,

644
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:58,120
so my makeup is based off
combining the snake

645
00:32:58,155 --> 00:32:59,388
with a human.

646
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,257
And how do you think you did
this week?

647
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,426
I don't think my forms
are very good,

648
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,895
and I don't think I did myself
any favors with my paint.

649
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:08,531
- I agree with you.
- Mm-hmm.

650
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:12,535
There is something peculiar
about the shape,

651
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:15,037
because here is too large

652
00:33:15,071 --> 00:33:17,273
and here is too saggy.

653
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:19,508
Particularly in overall form,
it does get a bit bulbous.

654
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:21,444
And with regard to the scales,

655
00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:24,246
they're so random.
It's not great.

656
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:25,548
Okay.

657
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:27,683
I think the time
that you allowed yourself

658
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:30,920
on the main forms was cut off

659
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:33,088
because you were rushing
to get to those scales.

660
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:35,891
That can never be at the cost
of the primary form.

661
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:37,359
- Mm-hmm.
- And the paint job

662
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:39,995
is very blocky because you
didn't give yourself time

663
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,965
to transition the colors.

664
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:45,201
Rachael, thank you.
You can step down.

665
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:46,969
Thanks.

666
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,774
All right, let's talk to Dina.

667
00:33:57,147 --> 00:34:00,483
So tell us about the snake
that you got and the design.

668
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:02,852
I chose
the Brazilian rainbow boa.

669
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:04,720
She's a Cobra soldier
who is a lead sniper.

670
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:08,090
Your choices are perfect.

671
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:10,559
The head shape
and your secondary forms

672
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:12,995
are so well-balanced,

673
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:14,897
and the scales are
incredibly well-laid-out.

674
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,465
I think you've done
an amazing job.

675
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,635
You've reached
a phenomenal equilibrium

676
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:22,404
between the action figure
aesthetic

677
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:24,707
and a prosthetic makeup
that would work onscreen.

678
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:28,077
It's an astounding amount
of work,

679
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:30,145
extraordinarily well done.

680
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,014
And you should be very pleased.

681
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:33,482
Thank you.

682
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:36,051
Dina, thank you very much.

683
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:40,623
_

684
00:34:40,624 --> 00:34:43,259
Drew, please step up.

685
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,430
Drew, tell us about
your character, would you?

686
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:50,666
I had the tiger rat snake,

687
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,569
so I chose to go with
a more human character

688
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:54,870
who's an assassin for hire.

689
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:56,572
He's used body modification

690
00:34:56,606 --> 00:34:59,208
to make himself more like
the tiger rat snake.

691
00:34:59,242 --> 00:35:01,810
This idea of going with
a minimal,

692
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:04,713
realistic silicone makeup

693
00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:07,216
was brilliant.

694
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,753
You've created a prosthetic
that could very much, on film,

695
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:11,987
bring one of these characters
to life.

696
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,522
Thank you.

697
00:35:13,557 --> 00:35:15,424
Can you please
take his hood off?

698
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,826
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

699
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:19,695
I really like this,

700
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:21,530
and well done on the skin tone.

701
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:24,833
I particularly like the tattoo
pattern coming down here.

702
00:35:24,868 --> 00:35:26,902
Excellent idea.
Very nice.

703
00:35:26,937 --> 00:35:29,805
- Thank you.
- I'm so pleased

704
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,441
that you did something
completely different.

705
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:34,643
It's intelligent,
and it's risky.

706
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:37,012
- So congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

707
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,914
Drew, you can head back.

708
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:41,550
Drew.

709
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,188
Sasha, you're next.

710
00:35:51,227 --> 00:35:52,895
So please tell us
about your snake.

711
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:55,197
I chose the hognosed snake

712
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,533
because they have
these funny noses that stick up

713
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:59,602
and they use them
to dig in dirt.

714
00:35:59,636 --> 00:36:02,137
But I ended up having problems
with the shape of the nose,

715
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:05,174
and it just threw me off
from that point.

716
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,810
I agree with you.
It's disappointing.

717
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,880
Your owl that you did
the other week

718
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:13,682
was coming back into this

719
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:16,986
because the sculpt of the scales
look feather-ish.

720
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,755
The overall shape of the head

721
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:21,490
is a bit too simple.

722
00:36:21,524 --> 00:36:23,659
It's just
this basic round head.

723
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:26,762
Sorry.

724
00:36:26,796 --> 00:36:29,064
Sasha, you can head back.

725
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,904
Keaghlan, please come forward.

726
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,981
Tell us about the snake
that you got

727
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:47,416
and the resulting character
you've designed.

728
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,785
I chose
the albino reticulated python.

729
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:51,754
Her name is Scarlet.

730
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:53,722
She was kidnapped
and experimented on

731
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,124
to become a Cobra.

732
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,192
I get what
you were shooting for,

733
00:36:57,227 --> 00:37:00,863
but it feels more like
a feline.

734
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:03,966
You diluted the snake forms

735
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,769
and details where
it's so less snakelike.

736
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:07,936
Okay.

737
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:09,405
You needed a contrast.

738
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:12,007
You need grays in there
to give depth.

739
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:14,143
It's just all gone a bit mimzy.

740
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:17,980
There's nothing punchy
about it.

741
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:19,248
Keaghlan, you can step down.

742
00:37:19,282 --> 00:37:22,051
Thank you.

743
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:27,456
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

744
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,525
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

745
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:31,860
- while they deliberate.
- Thank you.

746
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,401
All right, judges, so let's talk
about tonight's makeups.

747
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:41,704
Why don't we start with
the looks you like the most?

748
00:37:41,738 --> 00:37:42,838
How about Cig?

749
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:44,973
This could not have been
better fit

750
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:46,308
for this particular challenge.

751
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:49,378
- I like the colors, the form.
- This is a character

752
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:52,247
that ultimately would be
an action figure.

753
00:37:52,282 --> 00:37:54,616
Let's move on to Dina.

754
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:57,986
The forms were nuanced.
The detailing was superb.

755
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:01,156
One of the things I enjoyed
was that translucency.

756
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:02,591
I really thought
it was wonderful.

757
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,793
Everything highlights
and accentuates

758
00:38:04,828 --> 00:38:07,329
and brings you right back
to the gorgeous makeup.

759
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:08,897
All right,
let's move on to Drew.

760
00:38:08,932 --> 00:38:11,233
It's just
such a wonderful change.

761
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:14,103
I love the idea
of the implants on the cheeks.

762
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:15,771
And I love the tattooing.

763
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:18,207
When they make these types
of brave decisions

764
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:20,008
to go against
what everyone else is doing

765
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:21,376
and present their own makeup,

766
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:23,245
it defines "Artist"
on this show.

767
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:25,147
All right, why don't we talk
about the looks

768
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:27,616
you liked the least?
How about Rachael?

769
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,918
I think that
the overall view of it,

770
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:31,920
it was like a deflated balloon.

771
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:34,757
The shape was so bulbous,
and even the scales weren't done

772
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,925
with accuracy or definition.

773
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,194
All right,
let's move on to Sasha,

774
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:42,197
- who you guys had just saved.
- We did.

775
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,900
And I'm very disappointed
with this makeup.

776
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:47,503
There's a few things about it
that are good,

777
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:49,471
but she buried them under
heavy-handed detailing

778
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:51,473
- in the sculpt.
- The scales

779
00:38:51,508 --> 00:38:53,342
looked like feathers

780
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,010
it really did remind me
of her owl.

781
00:38:55,044 --> 00:38:57,246
All right, let's move on
to Keaghlan.

782
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,048
It doesn't feel like a snake.
It doesn't feel like a soldier.

783
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:03,185
- And the colors are awful.
- It's not a snakelike nose.

784
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:05,154
It feels more feline.

785
00:39:05,188 --> 00:39:07,556
All right then, judges,
have you made your decisions?

786
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,857
Tough one, but yes.

787
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:11,059
Okay, let's bring 'em back out.

788
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,135
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

789
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,571
Cig, your sculpture

790
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:24,506
was incredibly symmetrical.

791
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,642
And we really dug that you took

792
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:28,777
such an action figure approach
to the design.

793
00:39:28,812 --> 00:39:32,114
Dina, we loved how balanced

794
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:35,551
all of the proportions were
and the incredible detail

795
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,553
in both the sculpture
and paintwork.

796
00:39:37,587 --> 00:39:41,156
Drew, this makeup told
a believable story,

797
00:39:41,191 --> 00:39:43,292
and it felt very current
in the way

798
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:45,794
that you interpret a cartoon
character for the big screen.

799
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:48,197
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

800
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:51,200
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

801
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:59,221
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

802
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:02,157
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

803
00:40:04,127 --> 00:40:06,828
- Dina.
- Oh, really?

804
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:11,133
Between the detailed sculpture
and paintwork,

805
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:15,037
this creature was jaw-droppingly
beautiful on every level.

806
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:16,538
What a huge comeback.

807
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:18,106
Thank you so much.

808
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:19,575
Dina, congratulations.

809
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,076
You have won

810
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,146
the Hasbro 50th anniversary
GI Joe toy collection.

811
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,815
Aah! Oh, my God!
I'm so excited!

812
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:28,483
I won a really awesome prize

813
00:40:28,518 --> 00:40:30,752
that I want to give
to my boyfriend.

814
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:32,654
I feel like I'm finally
on track,

815
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,823
and I can't even describe
how good that feels.

816
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:37,225
Hopefully, I can keep up
the momentum.

817
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,294
Dina, nice work.

818
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:42,264
You, Cig, and Drew can all
head back to the makeup room.

819
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:44,733
I love you.
Good luck.

820
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:52,007
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

821
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,142
are on the bottom this week,

822
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:57,379
and one of you
will be eliminated.

823
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,448
Please step forward.

824
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:08,023
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

825
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:11,259
Rachael, the sculptural forms
of your head went awry,

826
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:14,229
but we're glad that you knew
where things went wrong.

827
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:18,166
Sasha, despite decent paintwork
here and there,

828
00:41:18,201 --> 00:41:20,535
the forms of the head
and the profile

829
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,871
were really undercooked.

830
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:25,741
Keaghlan, your character
concept wasn't bad,

831
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,243
but the colors became muddy,
and ultimately,

832
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,178
it just didn't read snake.

833
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:31,947
So who is going home tonight?

834
00:41:31,981 --> 00:41:34,983
The person going home tonight
is...

835
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:40,756
Keaghlan.

836
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,924
It came down to two things--

837
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,127
She didn't look like a snake,

838
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:48,864
and the most GI Joe thing
about her was her outfit.

839
00:41:48,898 --> 00:41:51,433
Keaghlan, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

840
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,969
That means, Rachael and Sasha,

841
00:41:54,003 --> 00:41:55,771
you both are safe this week

842
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,706
and can head back
to the makeup room.

843
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,679
I'm gonna miss you.

844
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:08,250
Keaghlan, don't let this
make you feel down.

845
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:11,553
Use this as a platform
to improve.

846
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:13,588
We look forward
to seeing you again.

847
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:15,424
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

848
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:17,859
It's been the most amazing
experience of my life,

849
00:42:17,894 --> 00:42:20,195
and I'll never forget it.

850
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:22,464
Keaghlan, it's been great
having you here with us.

851
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,466
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

852
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,867
and pack up your kit.

853
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:27,969
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Keaghlan.

854
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,005
- Good luck, Keaghlan.
- Bye, Keaghlan.

855
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:32,407
I'm really proud of every
single one of the makeups

856
00:42:32,442 --> 00:42:34,609
that I got to do.

857
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:36,678
- Oh, God.
- Who?

858
00:42:36,713 --> 00:42:38,213
- It was Keaghlan.
- Oh, my God.

859
00:42:38,247 --> 00:42:41,149
Being here has made me
just love makeup even more.

860
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,951
I came here to show the world
what I can do,

861
00:42:42,985 --> 00:42:44,553
and I did exactly that.

862
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:46,054
- It's not the end.
- Oh, no.

863
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:47,756
It's just the beginning.

864
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,225
At the end of the day,
what matters to me is the love

865
00:42:50,259 --> 00:42:52,627
and the heart
that I put into my art.

866
00:42:52,662 --> 00:42:54,362
