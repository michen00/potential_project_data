00:00:00,118 --> 00:00:02,649
Welcome to a very special
episode of <i>Face Off.</i>

2
00:00:02,682 --> 00:00:04,723
Tonight, the tables
have turned,

3
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:07,123
as the judges compete
head to head

4
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:08,388
with each other.

5
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:12,662
It's just an opportunity
to have a great time

6
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:15,111
and do what we do,
make some really cool makeups.

7
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:17,884
They'll each lead a team
of<i> Face Off</i> all-stars

8
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,317
and use every ounce
of their industry experience

9
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:21,821
to come out on top.

10
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,988
Oh, my God,
I've been wanting to see this

11
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:25,458
every season.

12
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:26,656
Good luck, guys.

13
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:28,191
Whoa!

14
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:29,687
That's a throwdown.

15
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:30,791
This is cool.

16
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,023
Loving it.

17
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:34,960
I'm havin' fun now.
Whoo-hoo!

18
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,498
This is tough to manage
symmetry on this guy.

19
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,771
Feel free to critique Neville

20
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,341
while he's working, guys.

21
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,573
Yeah, this is <i>Face Off.</i>

22
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:42,612
We're not worried.

23
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:44,108
This is what winning
looks like.

24
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:46,276
- Oh, her hands aren't painted!
- No.

25
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:47,716
I want her to have red hair.

26
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,613
Now I'm freakin' out here.

27
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,051
- Oh, my God.
- It's possible.

28
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:55,179
This is where
we succeed or fail.

29
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:56,945
<i>Face Off</i> is hard.

30
00:00:56,978 --> 00:01:00,139
The winner of
<i>Face Off, Judge Match</i> is...

31
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:06,483
Watch it all go down right now

32
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:08,745

00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,312
Hey.

35
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:28,576
I walk into the shop,

36
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:30,313
and I'm very excited
to be back.

37
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:33,382
I'm interested to find out
what we're gonna be doing.

38
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:35,414
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, McKenzie.

39
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:37,517
Welcome back to <i>Face Off.</i>

40
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,086
I'm sure you guys are wondering

41
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,320
what this special episode
of<i> Face Off</i> is all about.

42
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,227
Well, today, we're going
to do something

43
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,129
we have never done before.

44
00:01:46,162 --> 00:01:48,065
Sweet.

45
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,568
We're turning the tables
on our very own judges,

46
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:53,200
and they'll be competing
against each other.

47
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,272
- Yay.
- Yes!

48
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:57,671
This is <i>Face Off, Judge Match.</i>

49
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:04,375
Oh, my God, that's
what I've been waiting for.

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,110
I've been wanting to see this
every season.

51
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,614
This is gonna be incredible.

52
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:12,316
Please say hello
to our fantastic series judges--

53
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,820
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hey, guys.

54
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:14,955
- Hey, Glenn.
- Hey.

55
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:16,786
- Ve Neill.
- Good morning, everyone.

56
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:17,986
Good morning.

57
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,922
- And Neville Page.
- Hello, everyone.

58
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,153
We will be making
a $5,000 donation

59
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:23,761
in the winning judge's name

60
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:26,329
to a charity of their choice.

61
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:28,993
So, judges,
why don't you tell us

62
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:30,568
who you'll be competing for?

63
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:31,936
North Shore Animal League.

64
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,399
They use rehabilitation
and adoption efforts

65
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:37,002
to save the lives
of companion animals.

66
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:38,140
Ve?

67
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:39,580
A Window Between Worlds,

68
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,044
and organization that uses art

69
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,815
to help women
and their children

70
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:45,491
who have been impacted
by violence and trauma.

71
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:46,660
And Neville?

72
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:48,925
The Orangutan Foundation
International,

73
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:50,564
which is
a nonprofit organization

74
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:53,436
dedicated to the conservation
of wild orangutans

75
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:55,132
and their rainforest habitat.

76
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,373
Now, the judges can't do this
all on their own,

77
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,605
so that's
where you guys come in.

78
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,709
You talented people
are all here

79
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:03,413
because the judges
have invited you

80
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:06,380
to help them compete
against each other.

81
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:08,483
And as if the satisfaction
of helping

82
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,251
a charity in need isn't enough,

83
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:13,558
there's a prize on the line
for you guys as well.

84
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:15,823
The winning judge's
team members

85
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:20,232
will each receive $5,000 cash.

86
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:21,600
Hell, yeah.

87
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:22,936
This is exciting.

88
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,432
That's a pretty good payday.

89
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,567
All right, judges, it's time
to choose your teams of two.

90
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,103
We drew your names at random,

91
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:30,975
and, Glenn, you get first pick.

92
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:32,142
Sweet.

93
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,846
Of course, he does.

94
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,078
Now, there are obviously
no bad choices here

95
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,509
with this bunch,
but who is your first choice?

96
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,013
Ohh, it's hard.

97
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:42,785
What a great group
to have to pick from.

98
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,119
Laura.

99
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:47,287
Her application
and painting skills

100
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,096
are so phenomenal.

101
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,162
Neville?

102
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:51,435
I'm gonna go with Miranda.

103
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,172
She can sculpt, she can paint.

104
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:55,069
She's got raw skill.

105
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,909
And Ve?

106
00:03:56,942 --> 00:03:58,478
Conor.

107
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,646
He's an amazing artist,

108
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,183
an incredible sculptor,

109
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,481
and I'm so happy that neither
one of you guys picked him.

110
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,922
I'd never seen him before,
so I didn't know.

111
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,193
That's true.
He wasn't here Season One.

112
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:10,393
And I would have
killed you anyway.

113
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:11,729
Got it.

114
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:13,656
All right, Glenn,
your second choice.

115
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:15,591
Wayne.

116
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,199
He has the goods to deliver

117
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:19,735
massive amounts of quality
in a very short time.

118
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:20,800
Anthony.

119
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,233
Anthony's highly skilled
conceptually

120
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:25,844
and very capable as a sculptor.

121
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,109
Good luck, guys.

122
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,078
- Ha! Whoa!
- Ah!

123
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,182
That's a throwdown.

124
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:32,383
Roy, you're the best fabricator

125
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,583
we've ever had on the show.

126
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:34,791
Yeah, baby!

127
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:35,919
He's amazing.

128
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,590
He can fabricate anything

129
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:39,264
that anybody can think of.

130
00:04:39,297 --> 00:04:40,729
All right, judges,
why don't you go stand

131
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:41,898
with your new teams?

132
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,700
This is gonna be awesome, guys.

133
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:48,171
We have
the perfect fucking team.

134
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,107
All right, let's get into this.

135
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,140
Films like
<i>Chronicles Of Narnia,</i>

136
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,948
<i>Charlie</i>
<i>And The Chocolate Factory,</i>

137
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,118
and<i> Pan's Labyrinth</i>

138
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,490
turn the ordinary on its head,

139
00:04:57,523 --> 00:05:01,933
transforming it into something
stylized and fantastical.

140
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:08,469
That's cool.

141
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:09,942
Okay. Good.

142
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,605
These chess pieces
are the starting point

143
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:15,174
for each of your characters
this week.

144
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,213
Hmm.

145
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:17,877
So we have the king, queen,

146
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,042
bishop, knight, rook, and pawn.

147
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,419
In this challenge,
each team will create

148
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:25,514
a pair of living chess pieces

149
00:05:25,555 --> 00:05:26,985
that would be right at home

150
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:30,385
in a colorful,
stylized fantasy film.

151
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,354
Okay. Nice. We can do this.

152
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:34,561
This is cool. Okay.
I'm ready.

153
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:36,825
Are you lined up, ready to run?

154
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,064
I am lined up, ready to run.

155
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,096
Are you kidding me?

156
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:42,399
All right, let's go ahead
and choose which pieces

157
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:43,703
you will each be working with.

158
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,031
Neville, you're first.

159
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:47,934
Bishop.

160
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,208
Ve?

161
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,240
The queen.

162
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:51,273
Glenn?

163
00:05:51,306 --> 00:05:52,313
Knight.

164
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:53,410
Pawn.

165
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:54,450
Ve?

166
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,482
The rook.

167
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,851
The queen needs her castle.

168
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:58,115
I love it.

169
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,522
This is easy enough.

170
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,754
I'll take it.
The king.

171
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,026
Ooh! They got
two big ones.

172
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,962
This is cool.

173
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:07,659
All right, so before
you guys get to work,

174
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:10,364
there's one more component
to this challenge.

175
00:06:10,397 --> 00:06:12,036
Of course.

176
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,636
Since this season's theme
is life and death,

177
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,404
one of your characters
must be pure and pristine,

178
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:21,508
while the other
is evil and twisted.

179
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,508
- Ooh, I like that.
- Yeah.

180
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,179
All right, you guys have
three days for this challenge.

181
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:30,587
Choose your models
and get started on your designs.

182
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,851
I'll see you in a few days.

183
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:33,019
Let's go.

184
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:37,486
Let's go, boys.

185
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:40,590
First of all,
like, the evil queen

186
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:43,494
has kind of been done
a billion times recently.

187
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:44,959
Yeah, true, but she's so good.

188
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:48,538
I really want to do
a dark, evil queen,

189
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:49,834
and Conor says,

190
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,507
"Oh, well, there's been
so many evil queens."

191
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,106
There's never
been enough evil queens.

192
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,009
I want to do an evil queen.

193
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:56,841
You know, we'll
put our own spin on it.

194
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,947
She'll be fabulous,
it'll be different,

195
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,083
and after all, I am the queen,
so let me do what I want.

196
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:04,590
This guy can be
kind of like a creature

197
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:07,358
that she's cursed or something.

198
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:08,862
For the rook,
I want him to look

199
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,197
like he's been in there
for so long battling

200
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,696
that now he's becoming one
with his castle.

201
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:16,833
He could, like, break apart
and become partially human.

202
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:18,872
I'm really excited about
competing for my charity,

203
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,904
and I hope I win.

204
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:24,641
You guys have far more
experience in applying makeup.

205
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:27,384
No, you have all the experience
in applying makeup.

206
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:28,753
I have none.

207
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:30,251
I do a lot of creature design,

208
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,555
but I wouldn't say that
my resume screams of fantasy.

209
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:36,026
If anything, it screams more
of science fiction,

210
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,796
so I'm thinking there's a way
to manipulate this

211
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:39,830
in my favor.

212
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,271
If it's another planet,

213
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,674
it can be conceived
that they're aliens.

214
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:46,011
- Right.
- So one thought is,

215
00:07:46,044 --> 00:07:48,011
let's make our bishop
the bad guy.

216
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:50,376
We're going to make
the bishop dark,

217
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:54,614
and the bishop hat is going
to be part of his head.

218
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,686
The bishop is pretty much
the one in charge.

219
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:57,951
Yeah.

220
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:59,288
I want to design
the bishop first

221
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:01,593
and then figure out what
the pawn could be later on.

222
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,088
I think the big thing, too,
is unity,

223
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,823
making sure that they both look
like they're of the same.

224
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:07,095
Yeah, exactly.

225
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,798
I haven't worked
quite like this before,

226
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:10,566
but Neville's process
of designing

227
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,365
is really, really cool.

228
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:14,228
Sweet.
I'm excited.

229
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,932
So our knight is gonna be
our champion,

230
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:19,035
and the king is gonna be
our evil king.

231
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:21,634
I know going into this
Neville's going to have complex

232
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,171
and beautiful designs,

233
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,071
and Ve's application skills
are phenomenal.

234
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:28,775
However, this is what I do
all day, every day.

235
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,448
If I'm not on set applying,

236
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:31,944
I'm in the studio building.

237
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:34,817
It is of
the most urgent importance

238
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,322
that my team have clarity

239
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:40,057
on what it is that I need
to deliver.

240
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,086
With the knight,
let's take the horse head,

241
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,653
but make it on a human body,

242
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:46,190
almost like a centaur-y
fantasy creature,

243
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,791
but we can do lots of armor
in the sculpt,

244
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:50,033
so it's not just a horse head.

245
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:53,003
And the king is going
to be diseased.

246
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,035
He's going to be really,
really sickly, pale skin,

247
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,506
boils all over him.

248
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,708
Instead of trying to cover
huge areas,

249
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,917
we're just going to pick
our battles.

250
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,024
So how long has it been
since you've sculpted, Ve?

251
00:09:06,057 --> 00:09:07,721
30 years.

252
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:10,161
Under the circumstances
where we have no time,

253
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:11,866
we need to start right away,

254
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,961
so I started a headdress
for our dark queen.

255
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:17,002
Okay, here goes nothin'.

256
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,906
I think, well, okay, I better
start doing something

257
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,938
for the rook.

258
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,474
That'll keep him stable.

259
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:26,146
So I'm gonna do the chest piece
and the face piece

260
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,810
at the same time,
and we'll see what happens.

261
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,681
It doesn't matter in the end
who wins and loses,

262
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:32,953
'cause we're just here
having fun,

263
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,154
and I'm totally lying.
It always matters who wins.

264
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:39,261
I'm really trying to make sure

265
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:41,563
that we compliment
each other's skill sets.

266
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:43,962
This is a really, really
powerful team-up,

267
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:46,834
'cause Laura can sculpt
and design really well.

268
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:48,634
On the other hand, Wayne
is one of the fastest sculptors

269
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,937
I've ever seen.

270
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,472
He's gonna be so big.

271
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,775
It's like, how much clay
can you use?

272
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:58,672
We're gonna have Wayne
start banging out that horse,

273
00:09:58,713 --> 00:10:01,207
so I give Laura
the king's face to sculpt

274
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,479
while I start roughing in
an armor helmet.

275
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,479
Your charity is...?

276
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:05,751
North Shore Animal League.

277
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,848
Aw, great.
Don't you have a cat?

278
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,386
Two.

279
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:10,754
You have two kitties.

280
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:12,962
I have two cats, and they
are the center of my life.

281
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,292
Aww.

282
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,566
What I'm gonna do is
jump into ZBrush

283
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,766
and start
messing with some forms,

284
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:22,473
- and then we can apply it.
- Okay.

285
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:24,915
We decide to do
a parallel track.

286
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:26,948
While they're building up clay,

287
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:29,853
I'm going to be doing a digital
version simultaneously,

288
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:33,295
so that we can kind of start
to see where it's going.

289
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:35,497
And what I'm observing
in ZBrush, it's feeling less...

290
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,328
- Bishop-like.
- Bishop-like.

291
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,400
It's kind of like a competition
within a competition.

292
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,364
Whoever carves
the most appropriate path first,

293
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:43,395
that's where we go.

294
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:44,731
I like that.

295
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:47,970
Yeah, I agree that maybe
the two reads more demon.

296
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:56,975
Time's up!

297
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:59,510
Put your, uh, stuff down
and go home.

298
00:10:59,543 --> 00:11:00,573
Nice try.

299
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:01,940
We'll stay back and clean up.

300
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:09,682
Hey, are you fabricating?

301
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,817
Yes, of course. What else
would I be doing?

302
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,616
I start working on some of
the armor for the rook.

303
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,752
Our idea is for the rook
to, like, transform

304
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:19,287
from the castle
into a guardian character,

305
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,824
and so I've made a harness
out of L200

306
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,224
and then just made
a little hinge

307
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,463
so that the castle
can separate away from him,

308
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:27,693
and then there'll be armor
and everything underneath

309
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,995
and weapons and all kinds
of cool stuff.

310
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,700
- Hi, dude.
- What's up, dude?

311
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,405
I'm just looking around
at people's stuff,

312
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:36,972
see where we're all at,
what we're doing,

313
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,740
and jazz like that.

314
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:40,772
_

315
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:42,538
Yay.

316
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:47,009
Why don't we get
massing in on the pawn

317
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:48,248
just so we can start
to see something?

318
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:49,945
- So we know something's there.
- Yeah.

319
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:52,353
We decide that the pawn
is the altar boy

320
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:56,786
and is slowly being turned
to the dark side by the bishop.

321
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:59,056
So it's kind of just trying
to get that little bit

322
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:00,656
graphically to happen.

323
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:16,507
This is tough to manage
symmetry on this guy.

324
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:19,382
You know
what's a little odd is,

325
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,917
all of a sudden being
on the other side of the fence.

326
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,317
Hey, Glenn,
do you find yourself

327
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:26,651
imagining what you would
say to you right now?

328
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:28,586
Just the critique of,
you know...

329
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,320
Why didn't you do this?

330
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,024
Yeah, what were you thinking,
you fucking idiot?

331
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,389
The kind of stuff
we say to you guys.

332
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:36,061
I don't think
I've ever said that.

333
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:39,061
I'm having
a love/hate relationship

334
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,230
with your piece right now.

335
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,428
Feel free to critique Neville
while he's working, guys.

336
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:47,066
Oh, this is fun.

337
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,735
These guys must feel good
watching us next

338
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,999
and going, "See?
This is hard, isn't it?"

339
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,537
Coming up...

340
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,840
Why does she need hair?

341
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:58,909
Well, because
I want her to have hair.

342
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,339
I'm, like, freakin' out here.

343
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:01,403
Is there anything here?

344
00:13:01,444 --> 00:13:04,444
This is
where we succeed or fail.

345
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:05,508
Mothereffer.

346
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:06,843
Yeah, this is<i> Face Off.</i>

347
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:08,841
Fuck.

348
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:14,208
It's the first day

349
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:16,176
of our fantasy
chess piece challenge,

350
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:19,553
and I'm myopically focused
on our bishop.

351
00:13:19,586 --> 00:13:21,921
I'm sculpting little things,

352
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:23,858
going in there
trying to get it right,

353
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:27,491
and I look up and I see
Wayne has massed out

354
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,330
this giant horse head,

355
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:31,865
so I figure
I'm gonna derail him.

356
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,831
Hey, Wayne,
if you could speed it up

357
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:34,998
just a little more,

358
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:37,597
I'm sure your team
would appreciate it.

359
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,100
Wayne is fast,
and I'm a little jealous.

360
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:41,500
Is it supposed to be a donkey?

361
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:46,705
No, ladies and gentlemen.

362
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,103
Got Glenn to crack a smile.

363
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:51,374
You know, Conor is so fast,

364
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:52,638
about 2/3 of the way
through the day,

365
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,806
we're ready to mold the queen.

366
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:55,911
It feels pretty good

367
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,111
to be the first one
in the mold room.

368
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:59,352
But then I have Conor.
He's fast.

369
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,616
<i>Tres</i> fast.

370
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:02,783
So I'm slappin'
that plaster on there,

371
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:05,285
and I'm confident that we're
in pretty good shape today.

372
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,485
One character down.

373
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,853
And another one about to go in.

374
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:08,924
Mm-hmm.

375
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:10,787
I think
we're doing really well.

376
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:18,537
Laura finishes her sculpture
for the dark king

377
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,706
in an insane amount of time.

378
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:20,905
I'm extremely happy

379
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,073
with all of the subtle details,

380
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:24,378
and it looks amazing.

381
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:25,674
Well, should I go mold this?

382
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:26,683
Yes, please.

383
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,210
We are going to be casting up

384
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:29,882
the king's face in silicone,

385
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:34,120
because we want that pale,
translucent kind of quality.

386
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:36,857
Let's do that two more times.

387
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,566
Okay, guys, time's up.

388
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,629
- Good job, guys.
- No kidding.

389
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:50,996
- Bye.
- See you in the morning.

390
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,164
Bye, guys, see you tomorrow.

391
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:53,364
It's not a donkey.

392
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:55,932
Well, it's
a terrible camel then.

393
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:59,373
I actually sculpted
something today.

394
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:00,741
- Did you?
- Whoo! Whoo!

395
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:04,307
There's a lot of
awesome shit going on here.

396
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:06,842
Did you guys actually do
what I didn't do,

397
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,944
which is think
about application,

398
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:09,975
think about moldings?

399
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,278
Because I kind of figured,

400
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,214
eh, I'll work that out later.

401
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,581
I'm a little worried

402
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,380
just about the massive amount
of mold-making,

403
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,884
'cause I still have
a whole collar

404
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,020
and big shoulder piece.

405
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:20,221
I think
we've got to go home now

406
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,421
and have a Martini
or something.

407
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,556
Yeah, let's get some sleep.

408
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,722
I need something stronger.

409
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:25,657
Okay, bye.

410
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,032
Top of day 2, it's all about
time management this day.

411
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,735
Stopping the sculptures
fast enough

412
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:40,367
to get everything molded,
cleaned for foam in time.

413
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,000
How far are you from starting
to mold that?

414
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,102
Probably a few hours at least.

415
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:45,269
Wayne, at this point,

416
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:47,506
firmly in charge
of that knight character.

417
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,567
Meanwhile, Laura's
finishing the neck piece

418
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,440
for the king,
while I'm finishing the crown.

419
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:55,114
This is
where we succeed or fail

420
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:58,216
in our ability to fully deliver
both of these characters.

421
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,015
Do you want me
to make these shoulders smaller?

422
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:02,719
- No, exactly what you have.
- Okay.

423
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,223
We have to do the chest.

424
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:10,527
Where are you
at with your construction?

425
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,824
I'm working
on the construction.

426
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:13,328
The goal today,
I'm just gonna make

427
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,096
everything that we do perfect.

428
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,567
I'm gonna start working
on the headpiece.

429
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
I want to make sure
that all the horns are filled

430
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:19,705
and all that kind of jazz.

431
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:22,371
I also really want to
finish off the chest piece.

432
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:23,708
You do all the matching.

433
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:25,077
And then I'm gonna go
check on Roy,

434
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,309
and I'm actually gonna help him

435
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,213
with the fabrication
for the rook.

436
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:29,382
So what can I do to help you?

437
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:31,487
Okay, um...

438
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,116
I have Ve Neill,
Oscar-winning makeup artist,

439
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,522
doing grunt work.

440
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,423
I am making castle stones.

441
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,823
I'm a great grunt.
Just tell me what I'm doing.

442
00:16:42,856 --> 00:16:45,618
They're gonna be layered
onto this shape here,

443
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,223
and that's gonna create
our transforming castle.

444
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:50,927
I'm really excited about
how it's all coming on.

445
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,192
What about you, Roy?

446
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:53,960
The other two teams
don't have a chance.

447
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,096
Awesome.
That's what I want to hear.

448
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,168
Neville, that's beautiful.

449
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,497
Oh, thank you.

450
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:00,233
I'm getting a little nervous
about time, though,

451
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,872
'cause I've been treating it
like a real production piece.

452
00:17:02,905 --> 00:17:04,040
Wrong!

453
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,608
Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

454
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:09,043
Right now, the eyes
of the bishop are just holes.

455
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,546
We're all gonna gravitate
towards the eyes,

456
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,050
so that area has to be right.

457
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,420
I think you're in the groove
of the grooves

458
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:17,894
on doing some of those details
and forms.

459
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,990
I do need at this point
to hand it off

460
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:22,694
to Miranda and Anthony,

461
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:24,334
because they're gonna be
quicker at detailing,

462
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:27,101
so I'm gonna jump
onto the pawn.

463
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,439
Where did you want
the horns on these?

464
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,911
They should try to follow
this shape.

465
00:17:33,944 --> 00:17:35,408
Wayne and Laura
both are definitely

466
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:36,848
going in a great direction.

467
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,418
I think I have to stop Wayne,
as great as this is looking.

468
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:40,683
You guys got to start molding.

469
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:42,188
I don't want to keep sculpting

470
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:43,860
and then not have
some of the stuff get molded.

471
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:44,892
Yeah.

472
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:48,333
Everything just moved
to molding.

473
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:50,300
Depending on how far
they get with molds,

474
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,499
it'll dictate any time
that we have left today

475
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:53,762
what it is that we can do.

476
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:55,633
That's the fun of it, right?
Not knowing.

477
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,662
♪ It's a big-ass mold ♪

478
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,397
What do you think?
Can I mold it?

479
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,597
Yes.

480
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:02,902
We get our bishop into mold.

481
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:03,941
How do you want to do it?

482
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,269
Um...

483
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,604
However, what I'm starting
to get concerned with

484
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:09,108
is the fact that

485
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:11,907
I'm still getting the pawn
detailed out

486
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:14,077
and trying to get
the two to feel

487
00:18:14,118 --> 00:18:15,549
like they're of the same world.

488
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:16,749
Dude!

489
00:18:16,782 --> 00:18:19,053
That has me worried.

490
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,125
We just need to get it done.

491
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:23,756
Come on.

492
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:27,092
Today, I want to get that cowl

493
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,628
and that crown finished
for the queen.

494
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,027
We've got a prosthetic
on one of them,

495
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,666
we've got the cowl,
we've got construction,

496
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:33,066
we have a little bit
of everything.

497
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:34,162
All of a sudden, I realize,

498
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,297
oh, wait a minute,
it would be awesome

499
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,138
if the queen had
really long red hair.

500
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:40,370
Why does she need hair?

501
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:42,170
Well, because
I want her to have hair.

502
00:18:42,211 --> 00:18:44,139
But there's nowhere
to have hair.

503
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,410
Well, there might be.

504
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:49,682
The only problem is that Conor
sculpted an entire head.

505
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:52,248
But this whole frickin' thing
has these horns.

506
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,047
I want this to be
a really great beauty makeup.

507
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:56,583
Not only do I want her
to be evil,

508
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,920
but she should be
very appealing as well.

509
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:00,288
That's really important for me.

510
00:19:00,321 --> 00:19:02,727
Without hair, that's
kind of almost impossible.

511
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,055
I thought you were gonna do

512
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:05,758
a bunch of, like, red and black
feathers back there.

513
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,029
Well, I'm gonna do that, too.

514
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,998
I'm trying to figure out
what we can do.

515
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:11,965
It's just-- I want her
to have red hair.

516
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:13,533
I'm, like, freakin' out here.

517
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:19,856
I'm working on the queen,

518
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,329
and all of a sudden, I realize,

519
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:22,762
I really want her to have
long red hair.

520
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,162
But there's nowhere
to have hair.

521
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:26,161
Well, there might be.

522
00:19:26,202 --> 00:19:28,000
It's really feminine,
it's sexy.

523
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,935
And if I want to put that hair,
I'll just figure out

524
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,136
some bitchin' way to insert it,
you know?

525
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:33,671
I could cut this out
right here.

526
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:35,333
I mean, it's your call.

527
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,804
We can cut a hole.

528
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:39,003
I decide
I'm not gonna do anything

529
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,307
until I fit it on my model.

530
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,109
I want to see
how it fits her first,

531
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:44,281
and I'll see how this
is all gonna work.

532
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:45,481
At the last minute,
I might just say,

533
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:46,849
"Fuck the hair,
let's go."

534
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,457
Yeah.

535
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,225
Glenn, how much time
do we have left?

536
00:19:50,258 --> 00:19:51,520
About four hours,
just short of.

537
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:52,560
Okay.

538
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,697
Got it.

539
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,034
That is mighty impressive,
my friend.

540
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,066
I told ya.

541
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:04,371
We gotta jump on the molding.

542
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,843
We're behind a half-hour.

543
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,107
We keep pushing back,

544
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,611
and all of a sudden,
we kind of realize

545
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:10,379
there's no more time
to push back.

546
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,410
Oh! Mother of God!

547
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:16,954
This one is
a much more complex mold,

548
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:20,187
because it has to be done
in three parts.

549
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:22,060
Good thing there's three of us.

550
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:23,189
Down to the last minute, man.

551
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:24,524
We're running out of time.

552
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,523
Yeah, this is <i>Face Off.</i>

553
00:20:25,564 --> 00:20:28,663
Oh, shit, this is cool.

554
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,125
That looks really great in red.

555
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:31,661
Thanks, honey.

556
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:32,925
Loving it.

557
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,964
I'm havin' fun now.
Whoo-hoo!

558
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:37,028
Damn, that's sick, man.

559
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,132
Everything we have is awesome.

560
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:40,770
Shapes, profiles,
but when they get close,

561
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:42,097
we have this to offer,

562
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:44,399
so that they can look
at some really tiny detail.

563
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:45,767
Yeah, that's badass, man.

564
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,208
Wayne working on that knight

565
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:49,408
gives me the opportunity to do
exactly what I wanted to do,

566
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,040
which is paint that face.

567
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,806
It takes time,

568
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,480
so I know I need
a couple of hours

569
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:56,879
to layer the colors,
experiment with it.

570
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,646
Because my team
is so efficient,

571
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,046
I have the ability to do that.

572
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,285
Oh, my God, dude!

573
00:21:01,318 --> 00:21:02,486
We can help.

574
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:05,254
He's got it.

575
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:06,686
"Let me just grab
this 800-pound mold

576
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:07,894
and move it over here.

577
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,094
It's no big deal."

578
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,094
How's team Neville?

579
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:16,962
Yesterday was easy
by comparison, man.

580
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:21,231
The molding has truly become
a critical situation.

581
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:22,896
This, we're trying
to get out tonight.

582
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:24,032
It's possible.

583
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:25,964
We started this thing too late,

584
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:28,532
so we're just praying.

585
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,804
I really focus
so much on design,

586
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:32,676
because I typically
hand that over

587
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,771
to someone who has to deal
with my choices,

588
00:21:34,804 --> 00:21:36,139
but now I'm dealing
with my choices.

589
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:37,778
Here we go.

590
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,843
15 minutes, everybody!
15!

591
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:43,913
Now we gotta run it outside,
clean it out with just seconds.

592
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:47,216
Mothereffer.

593
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:49,048
Oh, I'm scared.

594
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,154
- You got probably two minutes.
- We're not gonna get it.

595
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,154
We're down to the wire.

596
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,155
Let's go, let's go.

597
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,195
- Under there?
- Yep.

598
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:56,531
- Yes, oh, my God.
- Tape that up.

599
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:59,066
Fuck yeah!

600
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,329
We put the mold together,

601
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,434
and we have no idea
how it's gonna come out,

602
00:22:02,467 --> 00:22:04,034
so I'm not gonna sleep
as well tonight

603
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,139
as I thought I was going to,

604
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:06,236
that's for sure.

605
00:22:06,277 --> 00:22:08,243
Very impressive effort,
guys. Thank you.

606
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:09,275
Bye, honey.

607
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:10,874
Bye, Glenn.

608
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:13,744
I think we did great.

609
00:22:13,778 --> 00:22:14,975
Nah, it was a great day.

610
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,110
I'm really feeling good.

611
00:22:16,143 --> 00:22:17,508
I was concerned for you today.

612
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,012
You guys are still
over there sculpting,

613
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,547
the day's half gone,
I'm like...

614
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,378
- "When are they being molded?"
- Uh!

615
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:23,682
Guys, I don't know about you,

616
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:25,449
but I'm ready to hit it.
Let's kick some ass.

617
00:22:25,482 --> 00:22:26,552
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

618
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:28,584
- Yeah, groovy. - Bye, boys.
- Good night.

619
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,697
Good to see you today.

620
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,728
- How are you?
- Ooh, look!

621
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:40,760
Yes!

622
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,567
Come into the lab
for application,

623
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,396
and I really was
expecting the worst,

624
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,068
but our pawn head is fantastic.

625
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,099
It's amazing.

626
00:22:50,132 --> 00:22:51,666
- Yay!
- Yeah.

627
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:54,072
We're not out of the woods.
There's no way.

628
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:56,568
We gotta run this bishop head
in poly-foam.

629
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:58,639
I'm so impressed
that that came out.

630
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:03,205
We mix it up, we pour it in,

631
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:05,978
we barely clamp
that sucker together.

632
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,672
The next thing to do
is, historically,

633
00:23:08,713 --> 00:23:10,113
we'd now take
that coffee break.

634
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:11,146
We're not worried.

635
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,744
This is what winning
looks like.

636
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:16,048
No. With the sweat
from the previous activity,

637
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:18,384
we open up the mold,
and it's perfect.

638
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:19,688
Let's go seam it.

639
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,750
- Mmm! Sweet!
- Yes!

640
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:27,860
You are the horse,
and you are the evil king.

641
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:29,690
- How are you?
- Terrified, but good.

642
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:30,688
Yeah.

643
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:32,959
Today, I'm in my element.

644
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,192
This is what I'm familiar with.

645
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:36,991
I do apply, so I start
on the rook's prosthetic

646
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:38,726
to make sure
that there's no edges,

647
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:39,860
there's no funky stuff,

648
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:41,792
and that it looks immaculate.

649
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:42,895
The boys are in the back.

650
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:44,358
They have a lot to do still.

651
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:45,727
But I'm pretty confident

652
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,830
that it'll look
pretty fabulous.

653
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:48,094
Wow!

654
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,732
Yeah, that came out good.

655
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:54,204
Oh, God, that's awesome!

656
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:57,438
Might be cool to treat
this area right in here

657
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:59,077
with the same colors as this.

658
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,243
The very first thing
we need to accomplish

659
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:02,810
is getting that knight
out of the mold,

660
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:04,873
making sure that we have
one great piece,

661
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:06,439
and by "We," I mean Wayne,

662
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,711
so he's gonna get a piece out,
we can look at it.

663
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:10,446
Dude, that looks awesome!

664
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,445
- Came out good.
- Yeah, it did.

665
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:14,813
And, meanwhile, Laura
moves into application

666
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,620
of the silicone face
on the king.

667
00:24:16,653 --> 00:24:18,987
The goal is
to assist her where I can,

668
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,618
because we have
a lot of different techniques

669
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:21,818
going on in that makeup.

670
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,258
You are in charge of the king.

671
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,354
All right!

672
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,461
- You're the kingmaker.
- No pressure.

673
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:35,104
Miranda is now applying
and painting that pawn piece,

674
00:24:35,137 --> 00:24:38,711
and Anthony's jumped onto
getting some amount of paint

675
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,776
on the bishop miter.

676
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:42,585
Anthony had the great foresight

677
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:45,015
in tinting our latex black
for that piece,

678
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:48,054
which will make painting
quicker, but the graphics.

679
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,193
It's so important to me
to get those graphics on there,

680
00:24:51,226 --> 00:24:52,721
and I'm looking
at the clock thinking,

681
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:54,697
we might want to speed it up
at this point.

682
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,999
I want to start working

683
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,566
on the beauty makeup
for the queen.

684
00:25:03,103 --> 00:25:06,564
I decided that I do really want
her to have hair in the back.

685
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,803
My plan is to just
cut the back out,

686
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:10,434
pop her head on,
and then I'm just gonna

687
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,938
attach the wig in the back,
and it'll be fabulous.

688
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,474
- Good?
- Yeah?

689
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:17,074
I'm moving forward with doing
black and red around her eyes,

690
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:19,284
and then I'm gonna go back in
with her foundation

691
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,684
and burnish it in,

692
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:22,988
make it really look almost
like it has an airbrush quality.

693
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,054
That's something that
I've pretty much perfected

694
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:27,293
after working
with Tim Burton so long.

695
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:30,159
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

696
00:25:30,192 --> 00:25:31,231
It's big.

697
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:32,895
Wowee!

698
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,294
With Ve, we all knew
what was coming.

699
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:36,868
She's gonna deliver
an unbeatable beauty makeup,

700
00:25:36,901 --> 00:25:38,732
and that's exactly
what she's doing.

701
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:41,939
She's clearly going to put up
stiff competition.

702
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,604
Shit, damn, that's cool, guys.

703
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:46,309
Coming up...

704
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:47,980
<i>Face Off</i> is hard!

705
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,946
We're down to the wire.

706
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:51,946
Nobody wants to let down
their judge.

707
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:53,252
Oh, her hands aren't painted!

708
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,380
Oh, wow.

709
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:56,252
I am totally blown away.

710
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:59,188
You will be choosing
the winner of this challenge.

711
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:00,251
How's that gonna work?

712
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:08,216
It is application day

713
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:10,016
of our fantasy
chess piece challenge.

714
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:11,289
I'm working on the queen,

715
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:13,089
and I'm having
a really great time doing it.

716
00:26:13,122 --> 00:26:14,594
Roy's finishing up in the back,

717
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:16,961
and I go back because I want to
see what he's doing.

718
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,096
I just want to make sure
that he can get

719
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,392
Matt in there comfortably,

720
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:22,096
and that he can operate
everything.

721
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:23,928
You want some padding
in the shoulders,

722
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:25,464
or does it feel
kind of comfortable?

723
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:26,504
I think it feels fine.

724
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:28,368
So he has a lot to do still.

725
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,626
_

726
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:31,240
- are going to have to match.
- Entirely.

727
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:32,575
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

728
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:33,608
And all I can say is,

729
00:26:33,641 --> 00:26:35,377
I love it when a plan
comes together.

730
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,248
I just hope it does.

731
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,314
I'm working on the pawn,

732
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:43,923
trying to get everything done
as fast as possible,

733
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:45,290
but I'm a little scared
right now.

734
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:46,985
Both Glenn's team and Ve's team

735
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:48,823
got to pre-paint yesterday.

736
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:50,159
We don't have
anything pre-painted.

737
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,222
We don't even have
any pieces on our bishop,

738
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:54,830
so I am pretty worried
about time at this point.

739
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,830
Nobody wants to let down
their judge,

740
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:59,162
but, also, we don't want
to let down the orangutans.

741
00:27:02,762 --> 00:27:04,370
When we put
the knight's head on him,

742
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,938
it turns out that the armor

743
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:08,738
has a big gap
in the front of the chest.

744
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:11,305
So we have this whole--
Is there anything here?

745
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,576
Nope, this right here
is still exposed.

746
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:15,039
There's a shoulder piece
that was initially

747
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,742
going to end up on the king.

748
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:19,077
All we have to do
is spin some things around

749
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,340
and think about it
the right way.

750
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:21,611
Waynester?

751
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:22,642
Yo? Oh, yeah.

752
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,441
And I absolutely love it.

753
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:25,913
The shoulder piece
actually looks

754
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:27,377
like a functioning piece
of armor.

755
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:28,849
You got to be happy.

756
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:30,321
I'll be happy
when this thing is done.

757
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:34,224
I'm a little worried
about running out of time.

758
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:36,686
We're down
to not just the wire,

759
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,654
but the core of the wire.

760
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,788
It's got me really concerned.

761
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:42,058
We don't have our staff.

762
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:44,456
We don't have our incense burner
put together,

763
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:46,089
and we don't
have things painted.

764
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,025
Okay.

765
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:52,299
I've never multitasked as much
as I am at this point.

766
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:55,034
I'm doing the staff.
I'm doing the staff head.

767
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,536
I'm doing costume details.

768
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:58,736
So I'm all over the place.

769
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:00,871
How the hell do you do it, man?

770
00:28:00,904 --> 00:28:04,144
I'm making a stick with a thing.
I'm struggling.

771
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:06,207
It ain't together yet, so...

772
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:11,580
Hey, guys!

773
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:12,843
Judges?

774
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:18,282
Hey, Neville!

775
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:23,495
Judges!

776
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:24,830
Yeah!

777
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:26,492
Last looks.
You got one hour left.

778
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:27,491
Thank you.

779
00:28:27,532 --> 00:28:30,299
Okay? All right, Neville!

780
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:34,067
Neville!

781
00:28:35,906 --> 00:28:37,230
I'm just going over there.

782
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:43,131
Last looks! One hour!

783
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:44,427
No!

784
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,468
Yes!

785
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:47,036
No!

786
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:49,270
Good luck!

787
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:50,271
- Okay.
- See ya!

788
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,272
All right.

789
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:53,943
This is weird with them.

790
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:54,975
Bye, guys, good luck.

791
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:57,479
- See you soon.
- See you soon.

792
00:28:57,512 --> 00:29:00,246
I think we just got
to get them in the outfits.

793
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,614
We don't have the bishop's head

794
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:03,317
or anything on her right now,

795
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,419
so it's a little scary.

796
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,250
I mean, miracles have happened
in last looks,

797
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:11,017
so I'm praying that one happens
for us today.

798
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:12,387
I can also go through
the whole thing

799
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:14,890
and put some rust,
or should we...

800
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:15,931
After everything's on--

801
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,460
hair, slime, spider webs
are on--

802
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,826
then that would
be the last thing.

803
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,297
I went for broad strokes
for this.

804
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:23,295
In these last minutes,
I really have to lean on Laura,

805
00:29:23,336 --> 00:29:24,398
kind of have to keep
pressing her

806
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,269
to not be as good
as she can be,

807
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:27,299
to let it go.

808
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:28,760
Glue that on
and start webbing him up

809
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,264
and sliming him up.

810
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:33,063
And focus on the all-important
finishing weathering touches

811
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,133
for the king.

812
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,595
I got those gauntlets
on my queen,

813
00:29:35,636 --> 00:29:37,499
and I'm tucking the strings in,

814
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:39,139
doing a couple
of little touchup things,

815
00:29:39,172 --> 00:29:40,706
putting a little pink
around her face

816
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:42,873
and putting a little red
around her fingers.

817
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,441
I am so excited now.

818
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:48,043
We're coming down to the wire,
and it's bitchin'.

819
00:29:48,076 --> 00:29:49,716
15 minutes, everybody!

820
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,484
We don't have stuff done.

821
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:55,189
Paint is wet.
There's just no way.

822
00:29:55,223 --> 00:29:56,286
Got to get
her finger things on.

823
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:57,293
Where are they, Neville?

824
00:29:57,325 --> 00:29:58,523
They're on the table.

825
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:02,492
We have so little time,
which is totally surreal,

826
00:30:02,525 --> 00:30:06,069
and you're still doing stuff
that's meaningful.

827
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:11,333
Dude, that's awesome!

828
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:12,836
They'll love it.
Well done.

829
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:14,172
Can you start putting these on?

830
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:16,140
- Yeah, of course.
- Oh, her hands aren't painted.

831
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:18,076
- No.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

832
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,108
Hey, Megan, hold on.

833
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:20,276
You want paint them first?

834
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:21,547
Yeah, just really quick.

835
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,349
There's about 45 seconds
on the clock,

836
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:27,685
and I just slather paint
on her hands.

837
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:30,819
Okay, get the fingers on.

838
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,058
Do you have the incense thing?

839
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:34,153
- Yeah, it's right in front.
- Okay.

840
00:30:36,162 --> 00:30:38,098
That's it! Time's up!

841
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:39,697
Oh, yeah, baby!

842
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,327
So this is how it feels.

843
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,095
- Good job.
- Awesome job!

844
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:46,503
Awesome! Boys!

845
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,808
Oh, man.

846
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:51,304
<i>Face Off</i> is hard!

847
00:30:56,247 --> 00:30:57,510
Good evening, everybody.

848
00:30:57,543 --> 00:30:58,614
Good evening.

849
00:30:58,647 --> 00:30:59,949
How do you feel
about your makeups?

850
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:02,014
- Great. Awesome.
- Pretty great.

851
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:03,950
Awesome. Well, I'm glad
you guys are feeling good

852
00:31:03,983 --> 00:31:04,982
about your characters,

853
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:06,719
but before we check them out,

854
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,023
I'd like to extend
a very warm welcome

855
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,623
to a couple of familiar faces.

856
00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:14,597
Season Seven judge
and Oscar-winning makeup artist,

857
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,125
the lovely Lois Burwell.

858
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:23,204
And, of course,
<i>Face Off</i> mentor,

859
00:31:23,237 --> 00:31:24,300
Oscar-winning makeup artist

860
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,839
and my dad, Michael Westmore.

861
00:31:26,872 --> 00:31:28,880
Hi, guys.

862
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,279
It's great to have you both
here tonight.

863
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:33,510
How are you?

864
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:35,982
Well, I'm really excited
about tonight.

865
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:37,654
It's gonna be fantastic,

866
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,085
and I am so relieved
it wasn't me.

867
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:42,389
Well done all of you.

868
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,789
You ought to be.

869
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:46,389
All right, judges,
so remind us again

870
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,630
what charities
you're competing for.

871
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:50,566
North Shore Animal League.

872
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,333
A Window Between Worlds.

873
00:31:52,366 --> 00:31:54,836
The Orangutan Foundation
International.

874
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:58,237
Now I asked you
to each choose two chess pieces

875
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,876
to use as a starting point
for your characters.

876
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,170
One was to be pure
and pristine,

877
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:06,072
the other twisted and evil.

878
00:32:06,105 --> 00:32:07,808
And they were all being made
for a colorful,

879
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:11,215
stylized fantasy world
that we're about to see.

880
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:14,877
Let's take a look
at your creations.

881
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:25,254
Let's take a look
at your creations.

882
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,130
- Wow.
- Oh, wow.

883
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:39,937
Very good.

884
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,970
It's so cool to watch
this challenge come together

885
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,578
and see pieces from other teams
standing next to yours.

886
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:46,314
It's a striking image, man.

887
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:48,683
I think we've done exactly
what we set out to do.

888
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,247
The king character looks like

889
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,518
it's ready for a fantasy film,

890
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:18,356
and the sheer size
of that knight character,

891
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:19,756
it's impressive.

892
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,186
It's a striking image
when you see all of it together.

893
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:46,216
I'm looking
at our bishop and our pawn,

894
00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:49,750
and I'm so pleased
at what Anthony and Miranda

895
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,157
were able to pull off,

896
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,956
that I was able to contribute
with them.

897
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,557
I'm so amazed
that we finished it.

898
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,088
I am totally blown away.

899
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:22,890
They're just gorgeous
and stunning

900
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:26,259
and just scary and creepy
and everything.

901
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,330
I'm just over the moon
about it.

902
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,666
All right, now that
you've seen the makeups,

903
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,770
what do you think?

904
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,340
Truly remarkable.
Well done.

905
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,476
- Thanks.
- Yeah, tremendous creativity.

906
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,540
I agree.

907
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:40,044
All right.
Well, let's find out

908
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:42,412
a little bit more
about your makeups.

909
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:44,348
Glenn, why don't we
start with you?

910
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:47,115
Tell us about your knight
and king characters.

911
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:48,451
The dark knight seemed trite

912
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:49,587
and sort of hackneyed to me,

913
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,523
as did the holy, goodly king,

914
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:55,225
so I wanted to flip
that on its head a bit,

915
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:58,628
and Wayne's ability to sculpt
large, massive forms

916
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:03,801
with incredible speed
is clearly why we designated him

917
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,938
in charge
of the knight character,

918
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,241
and I honestly cannot believe
how big that sculpt is

919
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,704
and how fast he did it.

920
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:13,175
The other thing that allowed us
to complete

921
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,039
this amount of work
in the time that we had,

922
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,175
Laura's flexibility
allowed us to do this.

923
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,477
She's the backbone
that made it possible,

924
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,212
because anything
I needed done at any time,

925
00:35:23,245 --> 00:35:25,747
I could just turn to her
and go, "Handle this."

926
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,851
Thank you.

927
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:28,147
I'd like them to hear
what you guys

928
00:35:28,187 --> 00:35:30,048
think about the makeups.
Lois?

929
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:31,350
Oh, golly.

930
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:33,553
Well, I'm madly in love
with the horse, of course.

931
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,057
I thought you might be.

932
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,689
- Yes, absolutely.
- We both are.

933
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:39,024
Everything about it.
I want to take it home.

934
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:40,295
I absolutely love it.

935
00:35:40,328 --> 00:35:41,895
And as for your king,

936
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:45,295
one of the cleverest things
was the choice

937
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:48,966
of the slightly
twinkly cobwebs,

938
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,637
because that just ties
everything together.

939
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,441
Well done.
Well done, the three of you.

940
00:35:53,474 --> 00:35:55,843
What's amazing with these
are the details.

941
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:58,619
All your groups,
and especially your king there,

942
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:00,881
you've picked up
all these little nuances

943
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:03,518
that you could say,
"What more can be done?"

944
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:04,950
- Nothing.
- Thank you.

945
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,918
All right, Ve,
would you please tell us

946
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:09,423
about the pieces you chose
and the backstory?

947
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:12,325
I chose the rook and the queen.

948
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:13,460
Mm-hmm.

949
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:15,060
I've been dying
to do a bad queen,

950
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:16,595
and when we started
the discussion,

951
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:18,760
Conor says, "Oh, well, that's
like the obvious thing to do,

952
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:20,758
the bad queen.
We should do a good queen,

953
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,958
and then make the rook bad,"

954
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:23,860
and I said,
"No, I want to do a bad queen."

955
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:24,858
I'm glad you did.

956
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,089
"The rook can be good.

957
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,360
Let's make him
kind of like a transformer."

958
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:30,032
He comes in,
and, boom, he opens up,

959
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:31,264
and he's a warrior.

960
00:36:31,297 --> 00:36:33,864
I chose the rook
because I had Roy,

961
00:36:33,897 --> 00:36:36,136
because I know that all I had
to do was let Roy go,

962
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:38,336
and he can build anything.

963
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:39,768
Conor was sculpting the queen.

964
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:41,505
I started sculpting
the piece on his face.

965
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:44,114
And, mind you, I haven't
sculpted in 30 years,

966
00:36:44,147 --> 00:36:46,849
so I thought, I have no idea
what this is gonna look like,

967
00:36:46,882 --> 00:36:48,313
but came out
really good, I think.

968
00:36:48,346 --> 00:36:49,849
Yeah, beyond.

969
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:51,280
It came out
really cool-looking,

970
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:52,688
and I was real happy with it.

971
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:55,287
So, Lois, dad, what do you
guys have to say about this?

972
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,420
It's extraordinary work.

973
00:36:57,453 --> 00:36:59,924
Obviously, we can see
your style there.

974
00:36:59,957 --> 00:37:02,787
How wonderful--
the nails, the fingers,

975
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:04,154
just beautifully done,

976
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:06,318
and the application
of the makeup

977
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,758
and the color choices
are superb.

978
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:09,789
Thank you.

979
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:11,157
We can see Roy's work.

980
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,294
What's so unique about it
is you've actually made

981
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:16,738
a third dimensional makeup
with moveable parts.

982
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:17,971
Wonderful.
It's great.

983
00:37:18,004 --> 00:37:19,907
And, Ve, I think
you did a great job on the face.

984
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,212
It's like that little underlay
there on the cheekbone,

985
00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:25,780
things like that,
it's like it's so subtle,

986
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:26,980
but it's there.

987
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:28,283
You know, when you get
on top of it,

988
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:29,915
- you can see all the work.
- Thanks, Michael.

989
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,155
Your queen is gorgeous, too.

990
00:37:31,188 --> 00:37:32,387
Thank you very much.

991
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,986
And, finally, Neville,
why don't you tell us

992
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,385
about your bishop
and pawn characters?

993
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:37,190
It's an alternative universe,

994
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:40,553
and the bishop is
a political, religious figure

995
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:44,521
that over time has become
more and more evil,

996
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,928
and as a consequence,
his own anatomy

997
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,626
has started to consume him,

998
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:54,037
and the pawn
is essentially the altar boy,

999
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,374
who is being manipulated
by the bishop,

1000
00:37:56,407 --> 00:38:00,344
and as a consequence,
the bony form on our pawn

1001
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:04,877
is slowly taking over
and starting to close in.

1002
00:38:04,918 --> 00:38:09,024
And we just basically kept
passing it around, all of these.

1003
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:11,289
I jumped on the clay,
which is kind of scary,

1004
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,025
'cause I haven't sculpted
practically in years.

1005
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:14,961
I thought, let's stay
a little bit longer

1006
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:16,667
on the design front,

1007
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,528
and maybe that could be
our edge

1008
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:21,168
from a competitive standpoint,
quite frankly.

1009
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:22,802
But then I thought,

1010
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:23,905
yep, might have shot
myself in the foot,

1011
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,240
and I'll be carting
out sculpts,

1012
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:27,409
because I spent too much time.

1013
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:28,705
So I was really nervous

1014
00:38:28,746 --> 00:38:30,481
that I was actually holding you
guys back for a bit.

1015
00:38:30,514 --> 00:38:31,680
We're used to this.

1016
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:33,176
Being held back by me?

1017
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:34,615
Oh, no.

1018
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:35,615
No, just rushing molds.

1019
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:36,719
Get used to it.

1020
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:37,983
All right,
so what are your thoughts?

1021
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,352
I think Neville's done
an unbelievable job here

1022
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,855
in capturing the pawn
and the bishop.

1023
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,687
His backstory
goes well with it,

1024
00:38:44,728 --> 00:38:48,530
and I'm really impressed
with making the person blind,

1025
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,401
because it's worked so well.

1026
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:52,864
You've brought the pieces
down so far over the eyes

1027
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,737
that it creates an illusion

1028
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,935
that's very difficult
to get away with.

1029
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:57,934
I love them both.

1030
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,333
Lois, what do you think?

1031
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:00,901
I love the shape of the bishop.

1032
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,638
You can see the bishop's miter,

1033
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:05,573
and I like the cleft
in between,

1034
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:08,750
the way it's reflected
in the shoulders.

1035
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:11,447
It's really nicely thought out.

1036
00:39:11,488 --> 00:39:13,055
And I love the pawn.

1037
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:15,088
There's something
charming about the fact

1038
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,488
that it's ecclesiastical,

1039
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:20,363
and yet submarine as well.

1040
00:39:20,396 --> 00:39:21,731
There's something wonderful

1041
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:24,530
about the underwater feel
that comes through,

1042
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,939
and it automatically takes
you out into space.

1043
00:39:26,972 --> 00:39:28,172
It's very nicely done.

1044
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:30,045
All right,
now, this is the part

1045
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,181
where we would normally
ask you all to leave

1046
00:39:32,214 --> 00:39:33,982
so that the judges
can deliberate,

1047
00:39:34,015 --> 00:39:36,288
but we won't be doing
that today,

1048
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:40,491
because you will be choosing
the winner of this challenge.

1049
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:41,627
We will?

1050
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,794
How's that gonna work?

1051
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,995
You mean we have to think more?

1052
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:46,331
We didn't see that coming.

1053
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:49,100
I'm definitely feeling
some nervous anticipation,

1054
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:50,634
but at the same time,
it's exciting.

1055
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,105
There's such amazing work
out there.

1056
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:53,799
All right, so here is
how this is going to work.

1057
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,773
You will each get to cast
one vote,

1058
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:59,037
but you cannot vote
for yourself.

1059
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,077
You cannot vote
for your own creations.

1060
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,140
Now, in the event of a tie,

1061
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:06,748
the three of us will be
the ones to break it.

1062
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:10,180
I think we can do that.

1063
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:11,684
So as a reminder,
the winning judge

1064
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:13,589
will receive a $5,000 donation

1065
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,326
for their favorite charity,

1066
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,527
and the judge's team members
will also receive $5,000.

1067
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,799
All right, everybody,
it's time to vote.

1068
00:40:21,832 --> 00:40:24,263
Glenn, why don't you
kick things off?

1069
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:27,669
Hey, Glenn, vote for me.

1070
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:57,193
All right,
it's the moment of truth.

1071
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:59,831
The votes are in,
and I do have to acknowledge

1072
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:02,567
that this was a real close one,

1073
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:05,470
which obviously speaks
to the quality of your work,

1074
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:06,839
which was phenomenal today.

1075
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:12,843
The winner of <i>Face Off,</i>
<i>Judge Match</i> is...

1076
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,061
The winner of <i>Face Off,</i>
<i>Judge Match</i> is...

1077
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,431
Neville.

1078
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:34,905
Oh, guys.
Congratulations.

1079
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:36,673
I'm truly shocked that we won.

1080
00:41:36,714 --> 00:41:39,250
Admittedly, it feels good
to have won, of course,

1081
00:41:39,283 --> 00:41:41,682
and to be recognized
by your peers in particular.

1082
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:43,553
Congratulations, buddy.

1083
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:46,216
But I really wanted to win
for the cause,

1084
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:51,257
and I really also wanted to win
for Miranda and Anthony.

1085
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,326
I think the $5,000
is just the cherry on top.

1086
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:56,463
Even cooler to win
a chunk of money

1087
00:41:56,496 --> 00:41:57,664
for Neville's charity,

1088
00:41:57,697 --> 00:41:59,400
and it was so cool
to have been a part of it

1089
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,233
with, you know, all of
these really incredible artists.

1090
00:42:02,274 --> 00:42:03,804
Congratulations.

1091
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:05,043
Thank you.

1092
00:42:05,076 --> 00:42:07,211
Great job. Well done.

1093
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:08,811
I'm so happy for Neville,

1094
00:42:08,844 --> 00:42:11,482
and I'm so grateful to have had
Roy and Conor with me.

1095
00:42:11,515 --> 00:42:13,081
And I hope that people
have learned

1096
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,246
a little bit about
A Window Between Worlds

1097
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:16,949
and that it helps a little bit.

1098
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,149
One thing I have to say
about my team

1099
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:19,950
is not only did they do
an incredible job,

1100
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:22,286
on top of that, they were
a pleasure to work with.

1101
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,925
And although, ultimately,

1102
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,589
our team didn't win
the challenge,

1103
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:27,663
I do hope that we've raised
a bit of awareness

1104
00:42:27,696 --> 00:42:29,802
for a charity that I feel
very passionate about,

1105
00:42:29,835 --> 00:42:32,137
and people should check out
North Shore

1106
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,370
and just see
what it's all about.

1107
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:34,707
Thank you.

1108
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,009
This entire experience
has been an unexpected delight.

1109
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,871
I would definitely
do this again...

1110
00:42:41,912 --> 00:42:43,110
just not soon.

1111
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,309
I need a little time to heal.

1112
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:47,341
Thanks for the votes.

1113
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:48,676
Don't thank me.
I didn't vote for you.

1114
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,748
No, no, I'm not--

1115
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,821
Thank you for joining us.

1116
00:42:53,854 --> 00:42:55,117
We will see you next week

1117
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,886
for an all-new episode of
<i>Face Off.</i>

1118
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,200
Good night.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
