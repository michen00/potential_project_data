1
00:00:00,457 --> 00:00:02,490
Shockingly awful.

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:06,494
That is the high point
for you thus far.

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:07,896
Previously on<i> Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:10,448
Drew's emo faun
gave him his first win,

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,866
and Rachael was sent home.

6
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:16,221
Now just six artists remain.

7
00:00:16,273 --> 00:00:18,640
And tonight,
they'll face a mythical twist.

8
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:22,894
It's time to make something
just a little more powerful.

9
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:25,880
But for some, it may prove
to be their Achilles' heel.

10
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,099
Shit-balls.

11
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:29,384
I'm so stupid.

12
00:00:29,386 --> 00:00:32,787
It has that grand,
majestic nature to it.

13
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:35,056
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

14
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:36,557
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

15
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:39,560
to one of their 85
international locations,

16
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:42,163
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

17
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:44,732
and $100,000.

18
00:00:46,836 --> 00:00:48,636

20
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:30,495
Ooh, looks lovely in here.

21
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:31,946
We get into the lab,

22
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:35,450
and it's been transformed
by all this Greek architecture,

23
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:39,387
and it looks like a coliseum.

24
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:40,388
Hey, guys.

25
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:41,389
Hi.

26
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,724
Before I give you the details

27
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,108
of today's foundation challenge,

28
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:48,129
I want to introduce you
to your special guest judge.

29
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,298
Her work has been featured
in major films,

30
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,332
like<i> Oblivion</i>

31
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,434
and one of my favorites,
<i>The Cell.</i>

32
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,802
Oh, my God.

33
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,138
She's also been nominated
for six Academy Awards,

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,343
and she won twice for her work
on<i> Dracula</i> and<i> Quest For Fire.</i>

35
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,444
Please give a warm welcome

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,697
to makeup artist Michele Burke.

37
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:09,600
Oh, my God, Michele Burke.

38
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:11,486
She's done all sorts of makeups,

39
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,305
including one of my favorite
movies,<i> The Cell.</i>

40
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,090
So I really want to impress her.

41
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,308
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:02:17,344 --> 00:02:18,509
It's so great to have you
here with us.

43
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,527
Thank you, thank you.

44
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,728
I'm delighted to be here.

45
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:21,929
All right, guys.

46
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,731
Today's foundation challenge
is inspired

47
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:27,235
by one of the most recognizable
and feared characters

48
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,905
of all Greek mythology.

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,674
Her deadly gaze
will turn you to stone.

50
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:36,794
Medusa.

51
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,812
Nice.

52
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,647
Oh, nice.

53
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:40,715
So your foundation challenge

54
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,600
is to create
one of Medusa's victims

55
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:44,685
who is turning into stone.

56
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:45,653
Yes.

57
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:47,305
- Nice.
- Yes.

58
00:02:47,357 --> 00:02:49,357
So what advice do you have
for these guys today?

59
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,758
What I'm really looking for

60
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,494
is how you create stone
and duplicate the textures,

61
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,862
and I'm also looking

62
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,348
for the expression
of when they're frozen,

63
00:02:57,384 --> 00:03:00,568
the fear or the shock
of being turned into stone.

64
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,869
Excellent, thank you.

65
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,489
Okay, guys, the winner
of this foundation challenge

66
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,942
will receive their
very own spray booth,

67
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:10,411
courtesy of our friends
at Paasche.

68
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:11,429
That's a big wow.

69
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:12,864
- Yeah.
- Holy cow.

70
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,250
That amazing booth will help
keep the air in your own lab

71
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:18,086
clear of any dangerous fumes

72
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:19,720
and is worth $2,000.

73
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:21,355
- Wow!
- Nice!

74
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,458
My spray booth is a table
in front of a window

75
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,559
with a box fan.

76
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,043
So I want
that Paasche spray booth

77
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,646
so bad, I can taste it.

78
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:31,299
All right, you have two hours
for this challenge.

79
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:35,303
Good luck, guys,
because your time starts now.

80
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,409
Oh, yes!

81
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:43,444
I envision Medusa's gaze
so intense

82
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:45,596
that it actually
sears your eyeballs,

83
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,432
so my character is gonna be
shielding his face,

84
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,100
but it's also burning
his fingers.

85
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:51,018
I grab some clay,

86
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:52,787
water it down to make a slush,

87
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:53,771
and then I also tint that

88
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,823
with some of the
Kryolan aqua proofs

89
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:58,459
and start painting that
on my model.

90
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:00,094
You're turning to stone, Alex.

91
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:05,820
_

92
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:06,819
_

93
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,637
My victim was sent out
to defeat Medusa

94
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,222
because they thought,
as a woman,

95
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:12,974
she wouldn't be affected by her.

96
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,977
I have this idea to cut up
cosmetic sponges

97
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,829
into shapes of rocks.

98
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,281
And with the paint job,
it'll look really cool.

99
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:21,949
I can't imagine having
my own spray booth.

100
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:23,184
That would be so awesome.

101
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,341
This nose looks
like a beast's nose.

102
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,460
I find this prosthetic,

103
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:34,795
and it's got mean eyebrows

104
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,764
and a funky lip and chin.

105
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:39,600
So he's going to be a creature
that has come to kill Medusa.

106
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,836
And I want a paint scheme

107
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:45,072
to have more color
than just gray and white.

108
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,207
I like that.

109
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:52,780
My concept is this
protector of the forest

110
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,248
who saw Medusa,

111
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:56,517
and he's just frozen
for all eternity.

112
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:57,635
Open and look up.

113
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:59,136
There are certain things
that happen to stone

114
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:00,254
when it gets really old.

115
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,974
Like, it gets moss on it,
and lichen,

116
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:06,110
which is, like, this really
vibrantly colored fungus.

117
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:07,378
I'm gonna incorporate that

118
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,829
to just make it
a little more interesting.

119
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:09,864
That looks really cool.

120
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,032
All right, 30 minutes.

121
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:24,145
That's it, time's up;
brushes down.

122
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,596
- Hi, Sasha.
- Hi.

123
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:28,299
All right, so tell us
about your Medusa-struck woman.

124
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,550
She's a princess,

125
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:31,619
and Medusa wanted to rule,

126
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:36,023
so she turned everyone royal
into stone.

127
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,792
I like the idea
of the ultra-color in the hair.

128
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,126
That's really interesting.

129
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:40,611
What could have
been done better,

130
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:43,247
if this line here
was not a straight line,

131
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:46,717
because on camera straight lines
catch the eye faster.

132
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:50,004
She was out gathering things
to help feed her family,

133
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,273
and she accidentally wandered
into Medusa's den.

134
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:55,009
You've really captured
the stone in her face

135
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:56,360
- and the crackling...
- And the texture.

136
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,579
That you could have showed
complete stone

137
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:01,048
and lesser stone,
but that's minor.

138
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,685
She is a warrior
sent out to defeat Medusa.

139
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:07,855
I really like that you gave it
a 3-D aspect to the makeup.

140
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,041
And I think that would translate
very well in film.

141
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,259
Excellent work.

142
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,361
Medusa's stare is so intense,

143
00:06:13,363 --> 00:06:14,829
the heat sears your eyeballs,

144
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:16,564
so he put up his hand
to block it,

145
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,099
and it burnt the tips
of his fingers.

146
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:19,567
I really like this idea.

147
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:20,835
I would have liked to have seen

148
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,638
a little bit less uniformity
around the eyes.

149
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:24,622
Mm-hmm.

150
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:25,640
But this is very creative.

151
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,475
He was a woodland warrior,

152
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:29,644
and Medusa stared him
straight in the face,

153
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,362
so he is entirely stone.

154
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:34,582
And this happened a while ago,
so I did some moss on the stone.

155
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,634
I love the fact
that you aged him a little

156
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,887
and made him a complete
frozen character.

157
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:41,122
Because he's young and foolish,

158
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:43,190
he decided he was just
going to charge in

159
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:44,859
and kill Medusa with his horns.

160
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:46,911
I like the fact
that you did use a prosthetic

161
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:49,330
to give him more dimension
to the face.

162
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:50,998
The eyes are good
because they're deep-set

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,266
and they show a fierceness,

164
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:53,901
and I like your paintwork.

165
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:55,836
You did a very good job
with that.

166
00:06:55,872 --> 00:06:57,922
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

167
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:58,956
All right, so, Michele,

168
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,141
who created your
favorite looks today?

169
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,142
Stella.

170
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:02,943
It was really creative

171
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,912
and different
to everybody else.

172
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:05,913
Thank you.

173
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:07,048
And George.

174
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,449
Your back-story
was very, very different,

175
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:10,318
and I love that
you aged the face.

176
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:11,652
- So, well done.
- Thanks.

177
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:14,021
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

178
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:15,956
It was a very tough choice,

179
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,391
but the winner is...

180
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:21,362
Stella.

181
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:22,563
Ah!

182
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,217
You nailed that expression,

183
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:28,202
and your paintwork
was really good.

184
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:29,570
Thank you so much.

185
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:31,255
Stella, congratulations.

186
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,708
As the winner of today's
foundation challenge,

187
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,844
you have won your very own
Paasche spray booth.

188
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:37,845
Are you excited?

189
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:38,879
Yes.

190
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:40,481
I won a spray booth
from Paasche,

191
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,800
which feels awesome, so, yay.

192
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:44,418
Michele, thank you so much
for joining us today.

193
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,419
Thank you so much.

194
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:46,420
It was a pleasure.

195
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:47,722
Good luck, everybody.

196
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:50,074
It was just a pleasure
to see you work today.

197
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,492
Thank you.

198
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,943
Thank you so much.

199
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:58,432
Okay, guys, let's talk about
your next spotlight challenge.

200
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:02,119
You've already created
the victim of a Greek beast.

201
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:05,589
Now it's time to make something
just a little more powerful.

202
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,442
While films like
<i>Clash Of The Titans</i>

203
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,211
and<i> Percy Jackson</i>
<i>And The Olympians</i>

204
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,863
feature Greek gods
as powerful immortals,

205
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:14,448
their incredible abilities

206
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:17,151
are rarely reflected
in their appearances.

207
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:19,620
So, with that in mind,
your spotlight challenge

208
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:23,040
is to re-imagine one
of the Greek gods,

209
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:25,810
using their own powers
as inspiration

210
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:28,462
for a supernatural
fantasy character.

211
00:08:28,514 --> 00:08:29,964
- Nice.
- Whoa.

212
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,632
I'm kind of nervous right now.

213
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:33,667
I really don't know that much
about Greek gods,

214
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,805
so I'm hoping that I'm going to
pick up on it really fast.

215
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,076
Each of the items beside me
represents a Greek god.

216
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,794
We have...

217
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:46,614
Demeter...

218
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,616
Poseidon...

219
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,284
Athena...

220
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,753
Zeus...

221
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,039
Artemis...

222
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:57,825
Aphrodite...

223
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,427
Apollo...

224
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:02,029
and Hades.

225
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:05,599
Stella, as the winner
of the foundation challenge,

226
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:06,667
you get first pick.

227
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:07,701
Yay.

228
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:09,670
Ah... okay.

229
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:10,704
Poseidon.

230
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,705
Aw.

231
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:12,973
Drew.

232
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:13,974
Hades.

233
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,277
Aphrodite.

234
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,045
Apollo.

235
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,163
Zeus.

236
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:20,648
Athena.

237
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:25,019
All right, now that you all
have your gods,

238
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:27,555
Greek mythology is filled
with epic stories

239
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:30,791
of heroes and gods
conquering unspeakable monsters.

240
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:34,228
In keeping with this season's
life and death theme,

241
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:37,031
you must also create
the severed head

242
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:40,334
of a mythological monster
conquered by your god.

243
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,919
Yes!

244
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:42,970
This is awesome,

245
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,104
but it's gonna be
a lot more work,

246
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,456
because not only do you
have to make a head,

247
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:47,775
but you have to make a makeup
that looks cool too.

248
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,777
All right, guys, you can
go home and get some rest.

249
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,512
When you get to the lab
in the morning,

250
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,180
get started on your designs.

251
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:55,549
I'll come by with my dad to see
how things are coming along.

252
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:56,650
See you then.

253
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:58,836
- Bye.
- Bye.

254
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:00,921
- Severed heads!
- Yeah!

255
00:10:00,957 --> 00:10:02,723
Yay.

256
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,232
The first time
I've been in top looks

257
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,533
for a foundation challenge.

258
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:13,501
- Yeah.
- So that felt nice.

259
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,502
Congratulations.

260
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:15,603
Yeah, good for me.

261
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:17,605
After being on bottom
last challenge,

262
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,790
it's nice to be
in top looks this time.

263
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,159
I'm feeling really positive
and more confident.

264
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,645
Now I just want to focus
on impressing the judges

265
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,914
with my Greek god
and my monster head.

266
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:38,759
It's day one in the lab.

267
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:41,979
We have ten hours to work today.

268
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:45,065
We pick our models
and start designing.

269
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:48,168
I chose Hades,
the God of the Underworld.

270
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,321
Because he's been
in the Underworld for so long,

271
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:53,474
he is starting to shrivel,
like the dead.

272
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,543
So I'm doing
this very desiccated,

273
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:57,678
leathery, corpse-like makeup.

274
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,846
My idea for the severed head

275
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:01,682
is, like, an impish,
demonic servant creature

276
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:03,183
that displeased Hades.

277
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:05,619
I'm gonna do, like,
really gnarly stringy bits

278
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:06,820
coming out of the neck.

279
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:08,822
Like, he didn't just
cut their head off.

280
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:12,593
He, like, pulled it
off their body.

281
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,194
My character is Zeus.

282
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,663
He's the God of the Sky.

283
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:17,815
He controls the lightning
and the thunder.

284
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,769
I'm kind of thinking of him
as almost like a--

285
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:23,537
like a Renaissance oil painting.

286
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:26,473
So he's gonna have the long hair
and the long beard,

287
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,376
but I want to give him
this ethereal armor.

288
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,512
So the first thing
I start working on

289
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:34,198
is the face sculpt.

290
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,283
I want it to have
Mediterranean features,

291
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,785
like the nose.

292
00:11:37,837 --> 00:11:40,487
He's gonna look attractive,
but also aged.

293
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,790
I think I'm doing my piece
out of silicone.

294
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:43,791
Nice.

295
00:11:43,826 --> 00:11:45,175
Zeus banished all the Titans

296
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:47,494
to the sea
in this underwater prison.

297
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,396
Because of that,
I want my severed head

298
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:53,200
to be the last remaining Titan
that he didn't quite round up.

299
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:59,239
My God is Aphrodite,

300
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,875
and she's the God
of Beauty and Love.

301
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:04,178
And she was actually born
in the sea,

302
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:06,146
so I'm thinking I want
to add sea elements

303
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,581
into this makeup,

304
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:10,734
and I'm just gonna do a cowl
and some shoulder pieces.

305
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,052
For my severed head,
I want to do,

306
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:14,388
like, the ugliest thing
I could think of in the ocean,

307
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,090
which is the angler fish.

308
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:19,126
Ooh, gorgeous.

309
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:20,260
I picked Apollo,

310
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:21,745
and since he's
the God of the Sun,

311
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,414
I really want to play up
the fire element

312
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:26,166
and design some really cool
fire armor.

313
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:28,736
So I decided I'm gonna do
a cowl and a severed head.

314
00:12:28,771 --> 00:12:30,070
Since he was the God of Plague,

315
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:33,240
I want him to have slain
this diseased abomination.

316
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,275
He dips his arrows
in the blood of this beast

317
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:37,578
to spread plague and disease
among his enemies.

318
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,316
I'm having the hardest time

319
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:44,718
figuring out
what my concept is gonna be.

320
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,437
My goddess is Athena.

321
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:48,722
She's the Goddess
of War and Skill,

322
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:52,259
and she represents the owl,

323
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,228
because the owl
is the wise bird.

324
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:56,497
But I've done
an owl makeup already.

325
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:58,265
I can't do another owl makeup.

326
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,567
There's no clay on my life cast
at this point,

327
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:03,871
and everyone else
is already sculpting.

328
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:06,523
I can't come up with anything
right now.

329
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:09,727
Coming up...

330
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,029
Now I have to figure out
how I'm gonna open it

331
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:13,514
without cracking any of it.

332
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:15,182
I know it's not the focus,

333
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:17,484
but it becomes
such a distraction.

334
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:27,007
Today is day one
of our Greek gods challenge,

335
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,609
and I'm having
a really hard time

336
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:31,212
figuring out what my concept
is gonna be.

337
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,447
There's no clay on my life cast
at this point,

338
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:36,617
and everyone else
is already sculpting.

339
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:40,588
I find that Athena guided
Perseus' hand

340
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:42,556
to cut off Medusa's head,

341
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,291
so I'm thinking, well, then,

342
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,927
maybe Medusa could be
Athena's severed head.

343
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:49,463
But she can still
turn people to stone.

344
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,199
So my goddess, Athena,
has been turned to stone

345
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:56,036
and is being controlled
by the Medusa head.

346
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:57,838
I hate my concept,

347
00:13:57,874 --> 00:14:00,207
but I just have to go for it.

348
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,917
Hey, guys, my dad and I
are here to check in on you.

349
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:11,969
- Hello.
- Hi.

350
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:15,523
So Poseidon was the God
of Seas,

351
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:17,224
and he created the horse.

352
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,059
So I figured I could do
a really cool,

353
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:21,662
like, water creature
with a sea horse element.

354
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:25,032
And I'm gonna do an octopus
for the severed head.

355
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,250
What is your thinking

356
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:28,802
on the cutting in
along the nose there?

357
00:14:28,855 --> 00:14:29,803
The gills.

358
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:30,971
- The gills?
- Yeah.

359
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,606
I think you ought
to over-emphasize these,

360
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,608
and then you could even
carry it on down

361
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,877
- into this upper piece here.
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,046
So Hades is the God
of the Underworld,

363
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:41,181
and the severed head
is actually going to be

364
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:43,951
one of the Underworld minions
who has failed him.

365
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:45,286
What are you gonna do for eyes?

366
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:48,489
I'm actually going to mold it
with those eye forms in

367
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:50,558
and paint the latex
and epoxy over them.

368
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:52,326
You've got them centered
straight ahead.

369
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:54,378
You might just roll them
a little bit,

370
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,564
because your dead eyes
roll up into your head.

371
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,848
Oh, yeah.

372
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,767
All right,
so you chose Aphrodite.

373
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:00,768
Yes.

374
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:01,936
She rose from the sea foam,

375
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,571
so I wanted to incorporate,
like, seashells.

376
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:04,738
That's great.

377
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,707
You might even pull this back
a little further

378
00:15:06,742 --> 00:15:09,310
to be able to put
iridescent shadow on there

379
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:10,995
to bring this makeup out.

380
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,196
We know you have Athena.

381
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,247
Yes.

382
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:14,982
I'm gonna have her
holding Medusa.

383
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:16,383
She turned into stone.

384
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,969
Now Medusa is, like,
controlling her body.

385
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:20,487
Interesting concept
you're doing,

386
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:23,791
because you're going a reverse
of what everything else is.

387
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:25,209
To really pull it off,
your head

388
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:27,127
- has to have life in it.
- The fake head.

389
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,629
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

390
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:31,432
It can't look like
a silly, cheap Halloween head.

391
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:32,967
All right, guys,
it's looking great.

392
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,034
Good luck to everybody.

393
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:35,519
- Thank you.
- See you later.

394
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,775
- Check it out.
- Oh, looks good.

395
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,177
So I get the face done,

396
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:46,213
and now it's time
to make the mold.

397
00:15:46,248 --> 00:15:48,315
I'm gonna be casting my face
out of silicone,

398
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,184
because if you're
using silicone,

399
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:52,019
you can just paint
a few light layers,

400
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:55,306
and you get that translucent
look of skin a lot easier.

401
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:58,192
But the mold needs to be
as perfect as possible

402
00:15:58,227 --> 00:16:02,496
so that when it opens
it doesn't tear.

403
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,482
I have to get my severed head
molded on day one,

404
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:08,936
because I want to be able
to slush some latex into it

405
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:10,738
and allow it to set overnight,

406
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:13,457
and I can run foam
first thing in the morning.

407
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:17,211
Mr. Westmore tells me

408
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:19,847
that I really have
to sell this Medusa head,

409
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:22,883
so I start sculpting snakes
on a flat board.

410
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:25,285
When they're done,
I'll mold them,

411
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:27,087
run them in foam latex,

412
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:28,672
stick a wire in them,

413
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,309
and paint them,
bend them however I want.

414
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:33,427
I like it.

415
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:35,663
But I think he looks
like the alien.

416
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:37,064
That's what I'm trying
to avoid.

417
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:38,799
The flames are looking
really cool,

418
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:40,834
but it resembles something

419
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,303
I had done in a previous
challenge for the alien,

420
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:45,806
and I don't want to do something
that looks the same.

421
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:47,841
I just really want
to illustrate fire.

422
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:49,309
Instead of going for armor,

423
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:52,446
I envision him more wrapped
in, like, this divine flame.

424
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,647
That gives me even more freedom

425
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:56,283
to not be in the confines
of just armor.

426
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:58,652
I know that changing my cowl
is gonna be a lot of work,

427
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:02,156
but I'm fired up.

428
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:03,457
30 minutes, guys.

429
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:10,898
- Do I look like Zeus?
- You look like a hippie Jesus.

430
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,232
Go back to Woodstock.

431
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:17,871
That's time.

432
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:19,523
So it's the end of day one.

433
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:20,941
I've got my mold finished.

434
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:23,293
I've got my head roughed out.

435
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,511
Ah!

436
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:26,280
There's a lot that I need
to do tomorrow,

437
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,615
but I feel pretty confident
that I'll get it all done.

438
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,312
How'd it come out?

439
00:17:42,348 --> 00:17:44,298
I don't know how this
could be any better.

440
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,834
So it's day two.
We have ten hours in the lab.

441
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,202
And the first thing I do

442
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,471
is pour my poly foam
in my severed head mold,

443
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,156
I let it completely set up,

444
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:53,440
and then I pull it
out of the mold,

445
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,192
and there's a couple
of little imperfections,

446
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:56,593
but whenever I'm painting this,

447
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:58,562
I'm just gonna turn them
into some scrapes

448
00:17:58,597 --> 00:17:59,847
or old scars or something

449
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:01,315
so that they make sense.

450
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:07,421
I'm, like, a zillion times
more excited about this

451
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,423
now that I'm not doing
hard flames.

452
00:18:09,425 --> 00:18:11,708
Good.

453
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,994
Athena is the Goddess of War,

454
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:16,964
so she needs to have
some sort of armor.

455
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:20,084
So I decide to fabricate
a helmet.

456
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,886
I take L200, and I shape it
into a helmet shape

457
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:25,222
with a heat gun.

458
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:27,341
And then I mix some Ultracal

459
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:31,028
and drip it on
to create a stone look.

460
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,362
Good job, Sash.

461
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:34,047
It's cool to get
some compliments,

462
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,850
and maybe today will be
better than yesterday.

463
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,625
I need to finish my cowl.

464
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,927
And because I only have
this one main piece,

465
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:48,695
I want to make sure
that it's perfect,

466
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:53,267
so I'm taking the extra time
to mold it properly.

467
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,435
I have so much detail
in my design

468
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:56,603
that I want to make sure

469
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,373
I have a really great piece
tomorrow.

470
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,844
I need to get my mold
opened and cleaned,

471
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:09,233
because I really want to start
pre-painting my severed head.

472
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:12,236
I realize I forgot
to put pry points in this.

473
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:14,588
Shit-balls.

474
00:19:14,623 --> 00:19:16,773
I'm so stupid.

475
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:18,842
Pry points help
the mold separate

476
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:20,477
without cracking the mold.

477
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,396
Oh, my God.

478
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:24,832
Now I have to figure out
how I'm gonna open it

479
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,533
without cracking any of it.

480
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:33,866
It's day two of our
Greek gods challenge,

481
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:35,701
and I'm having
a really hard time

482
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,269
opening my mold

483
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,838
because I forgot
to put pry points in this.

484
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,408
I'm such an idiot.

485
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:45,477
So I very slowly
and very carefully

486
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:49,781
got around the whole thing
to chisel my own pry points.

487
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:52,351
There's a chance
that I could crack it, break it,

488
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:54,803
and then I'll have wasted
the entire day,

489
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,155
and I'll not have a cowl.

490
00:20:02,396 --> 00:20:04,029
Oh, my God, I did it.

491
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:06,531
I am so relieved
that it finally opened.

492
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:07,666
It's got a few imperfections,

493
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:09,234
and it set me back in time,

494
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:11,954
but at least my mold is opened.

495
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,678
I have to fabricate armor
for my Zeus character,

496
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:23,181
so I heat up L200
and use my hands

497
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:25,484
to press it
over this mannequin shape.

498
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,252
Then I brush five-minute epoxy,

499
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,471
which is a really
quick-setting plastic

500
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:32,925
that self-levels and becomes
this really smooth

501
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:34,293
plastic surface.

502
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,761
How did you do that?

503
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:36,828
Magic.

504
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:37,896
After that hardens,

505
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:39,932
I spray-paint all of this
baby blue

506
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,199
to suggest the sky,

507
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,268
'cause Zeus is the God
of the Sky.

508
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,687
It's looking really cool.
I'm happy with it.

509
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:50,309
Ugh, it's a big, boily baby.

510
00:20:54,014 --> 00:20:55,948
We have two makeups to do,
basically.

511
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:57,482
And we're not gonna have time

512
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,101
to do it tomorrow
in four hours,

513
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:01,286
so I think we all
are in the same place,

514
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:04,456
hoping to get these heads
pre-painted today.

515
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:05,691
It's definitely weird

516
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:07,893
seeing everyone pre-painting
on day two,

517
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:10,345
but we have no choice.

518
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:12,731
That looks so creepy.

519
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:13,732
- That's good.
- Yeah.

520
00:21:13,734 --> 00:21:14,800
That's a good thing.

521
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:16,535
I hang my Medusa head
from the desk

522
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,553
because I want to see
how it hangs.

523
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,639
It's looking okay.

524
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:23,342
But everything
that I'm adding to this head

525
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:25,711
is just making it look worse.

526
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:27,412
So I decide to move on,

527
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:29,948
because I need to start
pre-painting the face and helmet

528
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,316
to look like stone.

529
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,358
That's time, guys.

530
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:45,030
Tomorrow I have to
apply the face,

531
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:46,548
paint her hair
to look like stone,

532
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,100
and paint her whole body.

533
00:21:48,135 --> 00:21:50,569
I'm hoping that I'll be able
to pull something together.

534
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,646
Whoo!

535
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:02,881
Whoo-hoo.

536
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:04,049
Whoo.

537
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,083
So it's application day.

538
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,184
We've got four hours in the lab

539
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,619
and one hour at last looks.

540
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:09,654
The first thing I do
is grab my severed head

541
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,692
and take this black gelatin
and cover whole neck stump

542
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:15,360
where his head's been torn off.

543
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:16,728
Then I take the rest,

544
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:18,797
and I dump that in cold water,

545
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:23,385
which allows it to form
this stringy, mass-y stuff...

546
00:22:24,872 --> 00:22:27,873
...which is exactly what I want
hanging out of my neck stump.

547
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:32,010
What's up?

548
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,479
You are going to be Hades,
the Lord of the Underworld.

549
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,148
This is your helmet.

550
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,931
_

551
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,755
I was on bottom last week.

552
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:47,325
I'm trying to not
have that happen ever again.

553
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:49,294
I start applying
my silicone piece.

554
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:50,962
Some of my edges
are a little thick,

555
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:54,199
but I have a patch paste
that I can smear in there

556
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:55,667
and blend down to his skin.

557
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:57,436
I'm really liking
this facial piece.

558
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:58,703
That looks awesome.

559
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:08,613
The first thing I need to do
is apply this puppy,

560
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:11,183
but I realize
when I put the cowl on him

561
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:13,635
that I had over-sculpted so much

562
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:16,388
that the face
is overlapping the ears

563
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,056
that I had sculpted on the cowl.

564
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:20,625
Yeah, that really
overlaps a lot.

565
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:23,728
So I have to cut
around the ears,

566
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:28,233
which is going to create
a thick seam between the pieces.

567
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,651
That's really thick edges.

568
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:31,670
I patch and I seam

569
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,322
and I make sure all those edges
are beautiful,

570
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:36,925
but I'm running out
of application time.

571
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:39,478
Better...ish.

572
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
To paint flames,
or anytime I do metallics,

573
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:50,205
I like to base them out
in black first,

574
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,908
because it really makes
metallic colors pop.

575
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:54,726
So I base the whole cowl
in black.

576
00:23:54,761 --> 00:23:57,996
Now it's time
to start with the golds.

577
00:23:58,031 --> 00:23:59,831
I airbrush on the Kryolan gold,

578
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:00,999
and it's going down great.

579
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,567
It's really covering the black.

580
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:04,202
And as soon as I hit
the highlights,

581
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:06,004
the piece is really
starting to pop.

582
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,939
Looking very godly.

583
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:14,513
There's some nasty edges
on her neck,

584
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:17,282
but the shoulder pieces
cover them pretty well.

585
00:24:17,317 --> 00:24:18,483
She's looking very godlike.

586
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,085
She's just so striking,

587
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:22,370
and I'm liking
the way it's going.

588
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:25,140
That's beautiful.

589
00:24:25,192 --> 00:24:26,274
I hate you.

590
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:29,895
Painting's not going well.

591
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,997
Everything's just
not looking good.

592
00:24:32,032 --> 00:24:34,716
I paint her body,
and I'm spattering,

593
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:36,034
trying to break up the color

594
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:37,686
to help this makeup
look like stone.

595
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:41,139
I'm gonna stick some
of the little stones on.

596
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:42,324
30 minutes.

597
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:51,149
The day is almost over.

598
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:53,969
I did not get
nearly enough finished.

599
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:56,805
I have a ton to do.

600
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:58,156
That's time, guys.

601
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,861
At last looks,
we've only got one hour,

602
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,614
and I've got probably three
hours' worth of work to do.

603
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:08,783
It's not gonna come out
as nice as I would like it to.

604
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:12,604
Coming up...

605
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:13,806
_

606
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:14,773
Take it off.

607
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:16,441
The helmet won't fit.

608
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:18,376
Oh, God, I hate this part.

609
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:20,612
It captures
the essence of a god.

610
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:22,364
That wig's a bit unforgiving.

611
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,849
The sculpt is so good.

612
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:33,830
Let's do this.

613
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,315
Good luck, guys.

614
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,516
We arrive at last looks,

615
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:38,718
and we have one hour
to finish our makeups.

616
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,587
I just touch up
her beauty makeup,

617
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:42,689
give her some nice eyeliner.

618
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:43,907
I have a lot of gold,

619
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,109
so I want to definitely
bring that into her lips.

620
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,528
Hopefully it will make me
a top look this time.

621
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,202
I get my mustache glued down,
and I'm not happy with it,

622
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:57,871
but I have to move on
to painting the armor.

623
00:25:57,906 --> 00:25:59,773
It's pretty important
that I get the clouds on it.

624
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,875
Otherwise, it's just
baby blue armor,

625
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,411
and that doesn't make
too much sense.

626
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,012
Good.

627
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:07,781
You look really cool.

628
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,915
Ten minutes, guys.

629
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:10,317
Does it kind of hurt?

630
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,169
_

631
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,587
I still have to
put the helmet on,

632
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:15,438
and I realize it won't fit

633
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,291
because I forgot to factor in
the bulkiness

634
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,427
of the prosthetic and her hair.

635
00:26:20,429 --> 00:26:21,428
- I'll just take it off.
- Take it off.

636
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:23,547
So I can't use the helmet now.

637
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,301
All right, that's time.

638
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,103
Good job, guys.

639
00:26:30,105 --> 00:26:32,405
I'm very disappointed
in myself.

640
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:35,075
I don't want to go on stage
with this mess.

641
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:47,887
Welcome to the <i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

642
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:51,024
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

643
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,994
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

644
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,162
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

645
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:57,163
Glenn Hetrick.

646
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,164
Good evening, guys.

647
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,332
- Hey, Glenn.
- Hi, Glenn.

648
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,334
Oscar-winning makeup artist,
Lois Burwell.

649
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,335
Hello.

650
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:03,470
Hi, Lois.

651
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,138
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

652
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:06,139
Hello, everyone.

653
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,307
- Hi, Neville.
- Hi, Neville.

654
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:09,309
And joining our panel tonight,

655
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:11,544
he is a Golden Globe
nominated actor

656
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,263
with critically acclaimed roles

657
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,315
in films like
<i>In The Heat Of The Night</i>

658
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,716
and<i> Monster.</i>

659
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,519
But he is perhaps best known
for his portrayal

660
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,189
of Hershel Greene
on AMC's<i> The Walking Dead.</i>

661
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,459
Please give a warm welcome
to Mr. Scott Wilson.

662
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,131
I'm a huge <i>Walking Dead</i> fan,

663
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,932
and I was so bummed

664
00:27:32,968 --> 00:27:35,185
when he got his head cut off
by the Governor.

665
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,636
On the other hand,
who better to judge

666
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,622
a severed head contest
than Hershel?

667
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,873
Thank you.

668
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,858
Thank you so much
for joining us tonight.

669
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,561
It's a real pleasure
to be here with you.

670
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,578
All right, guys.

671
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:47,180
This week,
your spotlight challenge

672
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:50,000
was to re-imagine
one of the Greek gods,

673
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:52,252
using their own powers
as inspiration

674
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,921
for a supernatural
fantasy character.

675
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:58,375
And in the spirit of this
season's life and death theme,

676
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,394
I also asked that you create
the severed head of a monster

677
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,396
your god had slain.

678
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,799
So let's take a look
at what you've come up with.

679
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,941
My god's backlit
by this beautiful sunset,

680
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:33,593
hitting those golds perfectly.

681
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,745
I think he looks radiant
and awesome.

682
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,667
Aside from some things
with the hair,

683
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,085
I'm pretty proud of this makeup.

684
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:00,603
It really reads Zeus.

685
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:22,475
I'm just so embarrassed.

686
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,810
It's terrible.

687
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,979
I know I'm better than this.

688
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,668
I have such a beautiful model,

689
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,570
and then the head
is so hideous.

690
00:29:50,605 --> 00:29:52,372
I love seeing that contrast.

691
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:14,027
He's creepy and wretched
and regal,

692
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:18,298
and the overall effect
of my makeup shows through.

693
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:38,785
I'm happy with what I did.

694
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,354
I definitely had a vision,
and I saw it through.

695
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,594
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look

696
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,078
at our Greek gods?

697
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,387
It's a form language
cornucopia,

698
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,705
which is great.

699
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,257
It's really hard to find
the skull shape in this.

700
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,492
There are some highlights,
though.

701
00:31:02,544 --> 00:31:04,143
- That eye is nice in there.
- Yeah.

702
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,080
_

703
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,217
The silicone on his face
is really nice.

704
00:31:11,253 --> 00:31:12,385
It is.

705
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,170
Just not sure that it works
as a character.

706
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,623
This look gives the feeling
of man-boobs,

707
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:17,941
doesn't it, really?

708
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:20,810
Well, I'm just curious
about the decapitation.

709
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:22,445
If it were a lightning bolt,

710
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,330
wouldn't there be
something burned?

711
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,832
That's a good observation.

712
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:33,223
Looks like it's a dried clay
more than a stone, doesn't it?

713
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,274
Yeah.

714
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:35,441
It would have worked better

715
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,411
had the natural skin tone
been on the model

716
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:40,446
and this been in the hand.

717
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:41,764
Mm-hmm.

718
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:45,835
It's lovely.

719
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,237
Yeah, it's stunning.

720
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,855
I love the shell shape.

721
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,557
The blend is good.

722
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:52,058
The head is amazing.

723
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:54,911
Yeah, it's a great
creature-y angler fish head.

724
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,062
Thank you.

725
00:31:58,033 --> 00:31:59,733
_

726
00:31:59,734 --> 00:32:00,900
There's always a chance

727
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,502
the judges are gonna
hate the makeup.

728
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:04,070
So I'm sweating a little bit.

729
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,605
I really hope
they like this makeup,

730
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,006
because there's only six of us,

731
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:08,741
and at least two
have to be in the bottom,

732
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:10,610
and those are strong odds.

733
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,080
We want to know what you think

734
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:15,832
of tonight's transformations.

735
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,618
Tell us on Twitter using
hashtag #FaceOff.

736
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,427
God, I hate this part.

737
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:23,662
Hey, I love this.

738
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:24,696
Yeah, that's rather marvelous.

739
00:32:24,748 --> 00:32:26,148
Whatever this is,
is super cool.

740
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:27,598
_

741
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:35,374
It looks like he's killed
a fish from <i>Fraggle Rock,</i> right?

742
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:38,243
It looks and feels
like a potato.

743
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:39,928
I do like the colors,

744
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:42,631
and the iridescence
is always fun.

745
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:43,999
Thank you.

746
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:52,241
So, Scott, what do you think
of tonight's characters?

747
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:53,275
They're extraordinary.

748
00:32:53,277 --> 00:32:54,526
I take my hat off to--

749
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:57,079
Or maybe I should say
I take my head off to you.

750
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:01,250
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations

751
00:33:01,285 --> 00:33:03,151
and would like to speak
with some of you

752
00:33:03,187 --> 00:33:04,803
to learn more about your work.

753
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:06,755
Cig, please step forward.

754
00:33:12,479 --> 00:33:14,847
Cig, tell us about
your character this week.

755
00:33:14,882 --> 00:33:17,049
I picked Apollo,
the God of Plague,

756
00:33:17,101 --> 00:33:18,984
and he rides the sun
across the sky

757
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:20,402
in his chariot of fire

758
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:23,505
and uses this
slayed pestilent beast

759
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:26,241
to spread disease and plague
among his enemies.

760
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:29,978
This is
a very successful makeup.

761
00:33:30,014 --> 00:33:31,296
I think you've done
a wonderful job

762
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,715
of bringing the fire aspect
of him to life.

763
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:36,251
It captures the essence
of a god.

764
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:38,387
It has that majestic nature
to it.

765
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:39,721
Thank you.

766
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:42,558
The flame on the right side
is really successful.

767
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,660
It looks like a flame licking.

768
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:47,362
But I wished you continued
the shape,

769
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:48,947
because it looks at the moment

770
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:53,101
as if the shoulders are puffed
sleeves on a girl's dress.

771
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:55,571
This is a really
difficult sculpture to do

772
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:58,040
because of this three
dimensional filigree shape.

773
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,175
But you've got
an overall character

774
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,927
that reads very strong.

775
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:04,279
I think the look that you have
is very nice.

776
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:06,682
I like your explanation
for the way he looks.

777
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:08,917
It's a wonderful job
that you've done.

778
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,252
Thank you.

779
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:11,870
Cig, will you please step back?

780
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:13,155
Thank you, guys.

781
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:19,027
Sasha, please step forward.

782
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:26,768
Tell us about your makeup.

783
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,253
My goddess is Athena.

784
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:32,524
Athena guided Perseus
to cut off Medusa's head.

785
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,043
But even when Medusa's head
is cut off,

786
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,212
she still turns people
to stone,

787
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:38,814
so she turns Athena to stone

788
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,716
and takes control
over her body.

789
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,401
How do you feel
about the makeup?

790
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:44,620
I think it's unacceptable.

791
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:47,239
I think you're right.

792
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,691
It doesn't say "Stone" to me.

793
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:52,561
Just looking
at the picture behind you,

794
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:54,429
there's stone.

795
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:59,217
This looks more like the gravel
than the walls made of stone.

796
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,970
I think the surface
of the skin and everything

797
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:03,672
should have been more solid,

798
00:35:03,724 --> 00:35:06,475
and her beauty should have been
more apparent

799
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,645
through her turning to stone.

800
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,013
Your second character

801
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:15,283
looks like
an anime sex doll head.

802
00:35:15,336 --> 00:35:16,952
I know it's not the focus,

803
00:35:16,987 --> 00:35:19,154
but it becomes
such a distraction

804
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:21,923
that it is the focus.

805
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,709
Sasha, you can head back.

806
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:32,868
George, please step forward.

807
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:40,976
Tell us about your character

808
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:43,378
and your god's attributes
in this.

809
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:45,364
This is Zeus, and he controls

810
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:46,848
like, the thunder
and the lightning.

811
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:49,451
He's also known
for banishing all the Titans

812
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:51,253
to below the sea.

813
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:53,772
So I thought for a severed head

814
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:55,390
it might be cool to have

815
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:58,193
and undersea
crustacean bottom-dweller.

816
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:02,514
The face,
the sculpt is so good,

817
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:06,601
but then you turn it
into a cross-dressing Zeus

818
00:36:06,637 --> 00:36:10,105
with this wretched costume.

819
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,140
He's got cloud man-boob armor.

820
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:14,743
I would have taken advantage
of your model's body

821
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:17,713
and used minimal costuming

822
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:21,183
and let that be part
of your character.

823
00:36:21,218 --> 00:36:24,186
What I'd like to talk about
is actually the facial hair,

824
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:27,389
because the beard is actually
somebody else's beard

825
00:36:27,424 --> 00:36:30,592
in comparison to the mustache.

826
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:32,994
The curl is a very Grecian curl.

827
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,864
Had you used that
on the beard form as well,

828
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,232
then it would have worked.

829
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:39,801
But as it is, they're growing
on separate people.

830
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:40,852
Mm-hmm.

831
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:43,605
And that wig's
a bit unforgiving.

832
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,424
George, you can step back.

833
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:51,913
Dina, please step up.

834
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:01,039
Dina, tell us about
how you designed your character

835
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:02,741
based on the parameters
that you were given.

836
00:37:02,776 --> 00:37:04,242
My goddess is Aphrodite.

837
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:05,794
She was born in the sea.

838
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:08,563
She's so beautiful
that every living thing

839
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:09,798
falls in love with her,

840
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,700
including her victim.

841
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:13,802
How do you feel about
your performance this week?

842
00:37:13,837 --> 00:37:14,836
I'm not very confident,

843
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:17,472
but I really do
love this makeup.

844
00:37:17,508 --> 00:37:18,757
It is amazing.

845
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,276
Are you joking?

846
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:25,063
I don't know how you got the
level of detail and symmetry.

847
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,548
It's astoundingly gorgeous.

848
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:27,682
Thank you.

849
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:29,117
I think it's a feast,

850
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:33,822
because you've listened visually
to the form of your model.

851
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:36,591
You can't ignore
the actor in the chair,

852
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:39,494
and you've come up with
something that is triumphant.

853
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,479
Well done.

854
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:41,480
Thank you.

855
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:42,697
From the bottom of the hem

856
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:43,899
to the top of the head,

857
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:45,133
everything is in place.

858
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:46,134
Everything works.

859
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,502
It all flows together.

860
00:37:47,538 --> 00:37:48,487
It's beautiful.

861
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:49,504
Thank you.

862
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,439
Dina, please step down.

863
00:37:55,913 --> 00:37:57,078
All right, guys.

864
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:58,947
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

865
00:37:58,982 --> 00:38:00,415
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

866
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,800
while they deliberate.

867
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:11,193
All right, judges, why don't we
talk about tonight's Olympians?

868
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,928
Let's start with Cig.

869
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:16,464
He really did manage to capture
the glorious nature of Apollo as a god,

870
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,634
and his explanation
of the Plague God as his enemy,

871
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,002
it all made sense.

872
00:38:21,004 --> 00:38:22,053
Yeah.

873
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:24,139
The relief filigree
is hard to do,

874
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:27,542
but it really lent itself
to a solid character idea.

875
00:38:27,578 --> 00:38:28,927
The thing that was
disappointing

876
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:31,329
was the little
tiny puff sleeves,

877
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:32,831
because it wasn't godlike.

878
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:34,850
If the shoulders had been
broadened a little,

879
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:36,685
he would have enhanced it
big time.

880
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,854
All right, let's move on
to Dina.

881
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,522
She told a whole story there.

882
00:38:40,557 --> 00:38:41,690
Right out of the gate,

883
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,692
you know an awful lot
about her.

884
00:38:43,727 --> 00:38:45,427
It's very successful.

885
00:38:45,462 --> 00:38:48,630
Wonderful use of color
and form.

886
00:38:48,665 --> 00:38:49,898
Beautifully done.

887
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:52,901
Taking the scalloped shells
as a headdress

888
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:54,269
was a beautifully unique way

889
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:56,538
to manifest
the aquatic attributes

890
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,139
of this god character.

891
00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:01,276
All right, judges,
let's move on to George.

892
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:04,312
Fundamentally,
George just missed the mark.

893
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:10,468
He didn't create a character
based on the god's powers.

894
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:12,787
That facial hair, honestly.

895
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:15,223
No one ever takes a beard
out of a box

896
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:16,825
and just sticks it on a face.

897
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,194
All right, let's move on
to Sasha.

898
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:21,296
She didn't really
satisfy the challenge.

899
00:39:21,331 --> 00:39:25,800
To have a god be affected
by her creature

900
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:27,369
- just made no sense.
- No.

901
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,771
Her beauty should not
have been clouded over.

902
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:32,991
Just because you turn to stone
doesn't mean you turn ugly.

903
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:36,811
The idea of building
a face out in big, round forms

904
00:39:36,847 --> 00:39:38,914
in order to create
a gravelly texture,

905
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:40,382
it's just not good enough.

906
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:42,250
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

907
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:43,518
Yes, we have.

908
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:45,687
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

909
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:55,764
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

910
00:39:55,766 --> 00:39:59,434
Actually, there is only
one top look this week.

911
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:09,361
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

912
00:40:09,396 --> 00:40:12,998
Actually, there is only
one top look this week.

913
00:40:16,536 --> 00:40:18,503
Dina, you were
head-and-shoulders

914
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:20,538
above everyone else.

915
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:22,941
The sculpture
was insanely beautiful.

916
00:40:22,976 --> 00:40:25,877
You lavished that
with a gorgeous paint job.

917
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:27,679
And then, on top of it all,

918
00:40:27,714 --> 00:40:30,882
you gave us an absolutely
phenomenal severed head.

919
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,334
Truly great work.

920
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,119
Thank you so much.

921
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:36,288
It feels so amazing.

922
00:40:36,323 --> 00:40:38,356
This is my third spotlight win.

923
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,125
In the beginning,
I definitely did not think

924
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,810
I would make it to the finale,

925
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:44,329
but if I keep doing
makeups like that,

926
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:45,897
I think I have a good chance.

927
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:47,599
Dina, congratulations.

928
00:40:47,634 --> 00:40:48,800
Thank you so much.

929
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:51,169
You, Cig, Stella, and Drew

930
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:53,038
can all head back
to the makeup room.

931
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,039
Thanks, guys.

932
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:02,514
Unfortunately, that means

933
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:04,482
the two of you
are on the bottom this week,

934
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:07,502
and one of you
will be eliminated.

935
00:41:07,537 --> 00:41:09,054
Please step forward.

936
00:41:18,298 --> 00:41:20,598
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

937
00:41:20,634 --> 00:41:23,868
Sasha, you started
with a flawed concept,

938
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:25,303
and then, expectedly,

939
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:28,840
that led to a rather
underwhelming goddess character.

940
00:41:28,842 --> 00:41:31,609
George, your beautiful
silicone makeup

941
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:33,745
was obscured
by atrocious hair work,

942
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,847
and we didn't see
your god's powers

943
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:38,216
clearly reflected
in the character.

944
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,834
So who is going home tonight?

945
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,820
The person going home
tonight is...

946
00:41:45,592 --> 00:41:46,708
Sasha.

947
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:51,229
Somewhere along the way,
you lost your confidence,

948
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:53,832
but we believed in you enough
to use the save on you,

949
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:56,534
so we hope that you leave here
with your head held high,

950
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,820
because you are
a truly talented artist.

951
00:41:58,855 --> 00:42:00,038
Thank you.

952
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,790
Sasha, I am so sorry.

953
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:04,743
That means you
have been eliminated.

954
00:42:04,778 --> 00:42:06,678
George, you are safe this week

955
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:08,596
and can head back
to the makeup room.

956
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,284
Thanks. Give me a hug.

957
00:42:14,688 --> 00:42:16,538
I really appreciate
the opportunity,

958
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,340
and I'm not giving up.

959
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,458
Oh, bless you for that, Sasha.

960
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:23,345
Sasha, it has been so great
having you here with us.

961
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:25,363
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

962
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:26,564
and pack up your kit.

963
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,565
Thank you.

964
00:42:27,617 --> 00:42:28,983
Good luck, Sasha.

965
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:31,836
It was a pretty bad makeup,
and I'm not proud of it.

966
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:33,587
I'm just proud
that I made it this far.

967
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:37,008
It's me.

968
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:38,308
- Ohh...
- Oh, Sasha.

969
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:40,459
I have all the confidence
in me somewhere.

970
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,745
I just have to go find it.

971
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:42,790
Come in here.

972
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:46,226
And I'm so thankful
for this opportunity,

973
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:49,395
because I've learned what it
takes to make this my career.

974
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:52,126
I plan to be so much more
driven and focused,

975
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:56,629
so I'm gonna go out
and work even harder.
