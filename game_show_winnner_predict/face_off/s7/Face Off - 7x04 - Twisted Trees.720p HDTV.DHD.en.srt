1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,413
I love it.

2
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:05,216
I've never seen
anything like this.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,717
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,287
Stella's incredible alien
brought her to victory.

5
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:12,957
- Thank you.
- And Gwen was sent home.

6
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,793
Now, 12 artists remain,
and tonight,

7
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,762
they'll face
an extraordinary twist.

8
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:20,064
There is one more thing
you need to know.

9
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:21,632
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,100
But not everybody will thrive.

11
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:24,435
I started noticing some cracks.

12
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,736
This is the end
of the line for me.

13
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,905
It's a triumphant victory
if it was

14
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:29,974
for an office Halloween party.

15
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,410
In the end, only one will
win a VIP trip

16
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:34,345
from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

17
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:37,415
to one of their
85 international locations,

18
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:39,250
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

19
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,024
and $100,000.

20
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:47,158
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

21
00:01:17,841 --> 00:01:20,011
Sync and corrections by n17t01

22
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,060
So what's it like to win?

23
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,895
- It's pretty awesome.
- Yeah?

24
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,397
Mm-hmm.
I'm not gonna lie.

25
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,400
I was just glad to not be
in that bottom circle again.

26
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,502
- Yeah, it sucks.
- Finally.

27
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:32,636
I've been on
the bottom a couple times.

28
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,505
The last makeup was
safe, which is good,

29
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,706
but I definitely want
to show everyone

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,110
that I can do better than this.

31
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:45,416
- Oh.
- Oh.

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,084
Ooh!

33
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,353
We're walking into the lab,
and all the models were

34
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:50,554
standing up on these pillars

35
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:53,023
in really elaborate costumes
and capes,

36
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,591
and we're
all really, really excited.

37
00:01:59,264 --> 00:02:01,031
Well,
as you've probably guessed,

38
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:05,202
today's foundation challenge
is all about superheroes.

39
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:10,140
- Oh.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:12,242
Before I give you the details,

41
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:15,245
I want to introduce you
to one of the biggest names

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,815
working in makeup
and special effects today.

43
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,516
He's helped create
some of Hollywood's biggest

44
00:02:19,551 --> 00:02:22,553
superhero movies,
like<i> Fantastic Four,</i>

45
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:24,021
<i>X-Men The Last Stand,</i>

46
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:28,125
and the movie that nabbed him
an Academy Award nomination,

47
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,493
<i>Hellboy II.</i>

48
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:30,928
Yes.

49
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:34,031
Please give a warm welcome
to Mike Elizalde.

50
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:38,135
I'm freaking out.

51
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:41,038
Like, I am
a huge, huge<i> Hellboy</i> fan,

52
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:43,774
and then, for him to walk in,
I am super stoked.

53
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:45,409
Great to finally
have you here on <i>Face Off.</i>

54
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,745
- It's great to be here.
- All right.

55
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:49,747
Well, some of the most
classic heroes of all time

56
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:52,750
are intrinsically linked
to their capes and costumes.

57
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:54,718
What they wear really
defines who they are

58
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:56,086
as superheroes.

59
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:59,156
That brings us to
today's foundation challenge.

60
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,159
You'll each choose one of
these incredible costumes

61
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:04,962
and create
the superhero that wears it.

62
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:07,097
- Nice.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:08,198
So Mike, what are you gonna
be looking for

64
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,366
in their final makeups?

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,101
I want to see integration
with the costume

66
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:12,469
that they're working with.

67
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,905
Put your best effort into
telling a complete story.

68
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,406
All right, guys.

69
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:19,777
The winner of this foundation
challenge will earn immunity.

70
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,578
On my "Go," I want you
to choose your model

71
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:22,813
and get to work.

72
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:26,450
You have two hours,
and your time starts now.

73
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:31,188
Hi.

74
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:32,723
Let's go get you
superhero-ed up.

75
00:03:32,757 --> 00:03:34,057
Right here.

76
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:35,759
I go right to these
knee-high glitter boots

77
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:37,594
and hot-pink cape.

78
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:39,930
My superhero's name
is Deadly Diamond.

79
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:43,066
She is hard and
beautiful as diamonds.

80
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,068
The piece doesn't
fit her face exactly,

81
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:47,805
so I rip parts away from it
and start creating

82
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:51,475
some of that diamond-shape
and that cracked pattern.

83
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:55,846
Perfect.

84
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,282
I look at my model,
and the most prominent feature

85
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,818
on her costume is
the huge protrusion of feathers

86
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:02,452
sticking out of
the shoulders of her cape,

87
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:05,189
and I find this really cool
feathered bird mask.

88
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,758
And I realize that with the way
that the piece is designed,

89
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,194
doesn't look like
it should be a part of her.

90
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,295
So it works perfectly.

91
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:12,396
It's a mask.

92
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,032
I want that immunity real bad.

93
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:21,338
I'm really excited because
I'm a huge comic book nerd.

94
00:04:21,372 --> 00:04:23,407
My character's an alien assassin
who comes to Earth

95
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,342
and falls in love
with earthlings.

96
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:28,478
I'm using this skullcap
and this cotton underlay

97
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:32,216
to create a new head shape.

98
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,655
He's Intensitron.
Part man, part machine,

99
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,524
all intensity.

100
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:41,992
I'm gonna bring
the color scheme up,

101
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,194
do some metallics
and some blues.

102
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,627
Intense.

103
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:50,801
Just something
about the purple man

104
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:52,769
that appeals to me.

105
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,271
So my superhero
is The Camo-Lord

106
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:57,507
he can change his skin
to any color or texture.

107
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,809
I use Kryolan Aqua Colors

108
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,011
on the face as a base
and then some airbrushing.

109
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:05,916
Two hours goes by
really frickin' quick.

110
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,986
You got 30 minutes,
we're at the 30-minute mark.

111
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,896
That's it. Time!

112
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,697
Brushes down.

113
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:21,798
- Hey, Doc, how are you?
- How's it going?

114
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:23,267
Hi, Doc.

115
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:24,735
All right, so tell us about
what direction you went in

116
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:25,736
with your superhero.

117
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,504
All right,
so this is Paul Fincher.

118
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:29,339
He is zookeeper by day,
birdcage by night.

119
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:32,042
It feels to me like
he's wearing just a mask.

120
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:34,211
It should carry over
into his skin as well.

121
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:35,512
But other than that,
I think your paint job's

122
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:36,580
really well done.

123
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:37,681
That means a lot.
Huge fan.

124
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,685
I really like what you did
with the layering of color.

125
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,053
It looks like you took a lot
of time in creating depth

126
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:45,122
to a very dark makeup.

127
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,124
I might have done a little
bit more with the lower half

128
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:49,526
of the face, but I think what
you've done looks very nice.

129
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,695
- Thank you.
- So this is Karma.

130
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:53,664
She's an assassin
on her home planet.

131
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,866
This is really, really elegant.

132
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,936
I think your use
of contouring is beautiful,

133
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,003
and the lashes look great.

134
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:01,405
Thanks very much.

135
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,341
I was inspired by the collar
to do the head shape.

136
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,143
Also it symbolizes cat ears.

137
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:07,978
I think it's
really, really beautiful.

138
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:09,880
It's tough to do black makeup,

139
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:12,049
and I like the way that you
augmented the highlights

140
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,084
by using silver,
that's a really nice choice.

141
00:06:14,118 --> 00:06:16,420
There are really some
amazing superheroes

142
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:17,821
in the room.

143
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,889
It would be so cool to win,

144
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:21,358
but everyone's is
really amazing.

145
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:24,361
It could go either way.

146
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,766
All right, Mike.

147
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,235
How do you think our
artists did today?

148
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,437
I think they did
an amazing job.

149
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,871
Thank you.

150
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:36,807
Okay, so who created
your favorite makeups?

151
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:40,243
Vince, I really love the way
that you used layering

152
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:43,246
in your airbrushing to give
your character an organic feel.

153
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,148
- Thank you.
- And Rachael.

154
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:47,985
Very seductive design,
beautiful contouring,

155
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:49,252
and good choice of colors.

156
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:50,487
Very well done.

157
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:53,190
Who is the winner
of today's challenge?

158
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:57,694
The winner of today's
challenge is...

159
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,597
Rachael.

160
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:05,502
You've created
a complete character

161
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,537
which told me a story
which I believed.

162
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,740
- Well done.
- Thanks very much.

163
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:11,508
Rachael, congratulations.

164
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,478
You have earned immunity in
the next spotlight challenge.

165
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:15,779
I am really excited to win.

166
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,080
Mike was so nice!

167
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:20,150
Just having his feedback
on my piece is really great.

168
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:23,120
I will see you tomorrow for
your next spotlight challenge.

169
00:07:23,154 --> 00:07:24,688
- Bye.
- Thanks, guys.

170
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:27,057
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

171
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:36,033
- We're back.
- Whoo!

172
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,035
We walk into the lab,
and we see McKenzie

173
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:40,470
with this huge tree.

174
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:42,139
I take a lot of inspiration
from nature.

175
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:46,343
So I'm pretty excited
to see what's in store.

176
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:48,078
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

177
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:49,546
Let's get to this.

178
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,814
Films like <i>Lord Of The Rings,</i>

179
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:55,218
<i>The Wizard Of Oz,</i>
and<i> The Evil Dead</i>

180
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:58,155
portrayed trees
as intelligent beings

181
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:00,223
that possess humanlike traits.

182
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:03,393
This week's spotlight challenge
is to create

183
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:05,228
a larger-than-life
tree character

184
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:10,233
inspired by
a unique tree species.

185
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:11,334
That's cool.

186
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,437
I'm absolutely freaking out.

187
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:15,205
I've been wanting to make
a tree character

188
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,406
for a really long time.

189
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:18,942
All right, so we have
banyan tree,

190
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,043
a sequoia tree,

191
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,512
weeping willow,
white birch tree,

192
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:25,382
bristlecone pine tree,
and silk floss tree.

193
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,351
For this challenge,
you'll be working together

194
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,821
in teams of two.

195
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:31,988
This time, you get to pick
your own partner.

196
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:33,390
Ooh.

197
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:37,027
Go ahead and stand
with your new teammate.

198
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:38,098
Yeah, sure.

199
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,720
_

200
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,165
Jason and I have both been
either safe or in the bottom

201
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,068
on every challenge, so we're
gonna combine our forces

202
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:48,939
of being terrible
and make something awesome.

203
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,006
All right, time
to pick the trees

204
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,109
that will inspire your designs.

205
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:54,077
Doc and Jason?

206
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:55,779
- Bristlecone pine.
- Sasha and Stella.

207
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:57,114
The white birch tree.

208
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:59,449
- Vince and Damien.
- Giant sequoia.

209
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,651
- Yeah.
- Dina and Rachael.

210
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:02,819
The banyan.

211
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,354
George and Keaghlan.

212
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:07,457
The silk floss.

213
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:09,192
There is one more thing
you need to know.

214
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:11,194
Ooh.

215
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:12,729
In each of the movies
that I mentioned earlier,

216
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:16,032
the trees were
either evil or angry.

217
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,234
So I want you to turn
your characters

218
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,668
into twisted trees.

219
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:20,370
- Nice.
- Yeah.

220
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:22,239
Now to help guide
your dark transformations,

221
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:23,707
you've each been assigned

222
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,809
a common malady suffered
by trees.

223
00:09:25,843 --> 00:09:27,110
Oh, that's cool.

224
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:31,047
Doc and Jason, your malady
is the lightning strike.

225
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:33,550
Cig and Drew,
your tree has pests.

226
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,118
Nice.

227
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:38,588
Dina and Rachael,
your malady is fungus.

228
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:42,058
Vince and Damien,
your tree has rot.

229
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:43,627
Sasha and Stella,
you've got burl.

230
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:45,595
This is so cool.

231
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,931
George and Keaghlan,
your malady is choking vines.

232
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,499
- Yeah.
- Cool.

233
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,234
Keep in mind that the judges
will be looking

234
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:53,203
for both the tree
and the malady

235
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:55,205
to be reflected
in your final makeups.

236
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:57,574
So select your models and get
started on your designs.

237
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:58,875
I'll be by later on with my dad

238
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,876
to check in on your progress.

239
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:00,877
- See you later.
- Thank you.

240
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:02,779
Bye.

241
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,484
- Bristlecone pine.
- Hell yeah.

242
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:09,085
Jason and I picked
the bristlecone pine.

243
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,622
Our malady is lightning,
so we've got the coolest tree.

244
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:14,157
We probably have
the coolest malady,

245
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,792
and we're gonna create
something awesome.

246
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:18,495
Maybe one big knot
going off to the side.

247
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,897
So we decided to have him be
the guardian of the desert.

248
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,832
And he's very old
and grumpy and lazy.

249
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,301
Whenever he's not doing
his job right,

250
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:26,102
the elder gods will strike him
with lightning.

251
00:10:26,137 --> 00:10:28,338
I definitely think-- just
keep going more asymmetrical

252
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:29,973
- with the profile.
- Okay.

253
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:31,708
This is, like,
my dream challenge.

254
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,244
I love incorporating nature
into my makeups.

255
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:37,647
We get the banyan,
and our malady is fungus,

256
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:39,616
which is amazing.

257
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,618
Since these are supposed
to be twisted trees,

258
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:44,154
maybe we include
an aspect of twisting.

259
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,589
Oh, yeah.

260
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:47,657
The fungus will be coming out
of cracked bark,

261
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,259
kind of moving with the flow
of the tree, so...

262
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,260
Yeah.

263
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:52,362
This is gonna be beautiful.

264
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:54,998
Sasha and I pick
the white birch tree,

265
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:57,534
and our malady is burls,

266
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:59,669
which are, like, tumor growths.

267
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:03,940
So I start on the face,
and Sasha starts on the cowl.

268
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:08,612
Our concept is a sacred
Native American tree

269
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,780
that is sad

270
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:13,917
that the white man scared
all his people away,

271
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,920
and he starts growing
all these burls

272
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:18,788
because of that.

273
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,390
Also, birch trees have eyes

274
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:22,759
and are known
as the watching trees.

275
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:25,028
So we want to put eyes
all over his body

276
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:26,496
as if he's always watching.

277
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,498
I love these branches so much.

278
00:11:28,532 --> 00:11:32,502
I think it's kind of sick.

279
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:34,271
All right, I'm gonna get
a block of clay

280
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:35,605
and start carving this out.

281
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,407
I don't really have
a solid concept

282
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,276
for a head or a face
on this tree.

283
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,810
So I give Vince the go-ahead

284
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:42,479
to start designing
that aspect of it.

285
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,080
We picked
the giant sequoia tree,

286
00:11:44,115 --> 00:11:46,182
and our malady is tree rot.

287
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:49,552
I would really love
to make a zombie tree.

288
00:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,589
The top of his head is gonna
have a really angry face on it,

289
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:54,824
big hands with huge,
you know, bent fingers,

290
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,326
and his feet are gonna
be also giant

291
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,894
and, like, big stumps.

292
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,930
That's cool, man.

293
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:06,636
Hey, guys. We're here
to check on your trees.

294
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:08,204
- Hello.
- How are you?

295
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,539
- Hi.
- Hello.

296
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:12,709
He is this twisted,
broken tree who's in pain,

297
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:15,979
so we are trying to show
the twist of how he's grown.

298
00:12:16,013 --> 00:12:17,013
You know,
when I first looked at it,

299
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,516
I thought it was vines
or a fire.

300
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,919
It's like different
directions going everywhere.

301
00:12:22,953 --> 00:12:25,088
I am totally freaking out
right now.

302
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:27,023
We just spent hours
sculpting this thing,

303
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:29,826
and I was excited about it,
and now we have to start over.

304
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,629
I'm worried because Rachael
has immunity,

305
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,531
so if we are on bottom looks,

306
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:37,434
I could be going home for this.

307
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,502
Coming up...

308
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:40,870
It's breaking.

309
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:42,405
The more we pry,
the more cracks we're getting.

310
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,740
- Is it fixable?
- Nope.

311
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:46,242
- I'm fucked.
- I actually enjoy it immensely.

312
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:49,813
It's devoid and crippling.

313
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:54,502
It's like different
directions going everywhere,

314
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:55,970
which isn't really
what your research is.

315
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,606
Mr. Westmore tells us
that our design

316
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,341
doesn't really resemble
a banyan tree.

317
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:03,178
I thought
it was vines or a fire.

318
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:04,579
We put a lot of work into this,

319
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:06,448
but if he doesn't think
it looks like a banyan tree,

320
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:08,082
then the judges
aren't going to.

321
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:11,052
We have to start over.

322
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,720
All right,
so you have the silk floss.

323
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:13,922
We have the silk floss.

324
00:13:13,956 --> 00:13:15,657
And the malady
is choking vines.

325
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:16,658
Choking vines.

326
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:17,992
So explain the concept.

327
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:20,662
Our character was
an environmentalist

328
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:22,197
perched up in the top
of this tree

329
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:23,932
to stop it
from being chopped down.

330
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:26,401
So when the tree fell,
her and the tree

331
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,737
combined and grew into
this warrior of the forest.

332
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:31,806
So the face-- we wanted
to incorporate the spines

333
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,409
into her face and kind
of create a brow with it.

334
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:36,311
Try to just take a little
bit of the human out of it.

335
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:39,347
Maybe filling in
a little under here

336
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:42,050
so it doesn't have
the sharp jaw sticking out.

337
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,084
Okay.

338
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:44,352
So you picked
the weeping willow.

339
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:45,420
Yes.

340
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:47,222
And it's infested with bugs.

341
00:13:47,256 --> 00:13:49,657
So our story is that
it was an earth spirit,

342
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,426
and she became infested
with these bugs.

343
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,660
She's all draped
in these leaves,

344
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:54,062
and people hear someone crying,

345
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:55,563
so they come up to the tree.

346
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:56,698
She snatches them up,

347
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:57,799
and the bugs come out
of all her holes.

348
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,267
And then they're eating
the people.

349
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:00,468
To show the bug,

350
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:02,003
are you gonna
have actually little holes?

351
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:03,304
'Cause the bugs are, you know,
like termites.

352
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:05,340
Yeah, I was just started
to put in some divots.

353
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:07,075
- Yeah, make 'em big enough.
- Yeah.

354
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,776
We have a big, big sculpture

355
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:09,911
that sort of resembles
the sequoia,

356
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:11,145
but then the face itself--

357
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
it's got the rot on the face.

358
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:13,448
When you get this out in foam,

359
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:14,949
pull a little foam out of it.

360
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,017
It'll give the model
more freedom

361
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:17,685
to be able to twist their head.

362
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,220
Yeah.

363
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:21,022
The bristlecone pine's got
these amazing trunks

364
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:22,457
towards the bottom,

365
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,592
so we've come up with these
cool boots to go over top.

366
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:27,629
The bristlecone pine--
there's just so much more...

367
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,397
- Jagged edges.
- ...going on with it

368
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:30,965
than what I'm seeing
what you're doing.

369
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Yeah.

370
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:33,201
You haven't gone far enough
for your design.

371
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:34,335
All right.

372
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,771
He's kind of
an old, craggy man.

373
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,274
You know, you're
getting real human in this.

374
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:42,110
You don't have to show
a mouth so much

375
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:43,878
or even the nasolabial folds.

376
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,547
It's not a person in a tree.

377
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:48,082
This is the personification
of a living tree.

378
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:49,150
Okay.

379
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:50,418
All right, everybody.

380
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:51,786
- Good luck with your trees.
- Good luck.

381
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,787
- Bye.
- Thank you.

382
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:54,122
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

383
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:00,328
Our malady is bug infestation,

384
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:02,330
and Mr. Westmore mentioned
that we should put

385
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:05,567
some of the evidence of the bug
infestation on the sculpts.

386
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:09,103
So I'm gonna sculpt bug trails
into the chest area

387
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:10,939
while drew is sculpting
the texture slab

388
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:13,308
that we can use
for the arms and the legs.

389
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,443
And then, we really need
to get started fabricating

390
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:17,745
the willow branches, which
is really important

391
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,047
because we've got to figure out

392
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,381
how to distribute
the weight properly.

393
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,382
I like 'em.

394
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,418
Let's look at this again.

395
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:25,987
I think Dina's very nervous
about the immunity,

396
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:28,523
and now,
we are completely redesigning

397
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,901
every aspect of
what we've been working on.

398
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:31,902
_

399
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:34,154
_

400
00:15:34,229 --> 00:15:37,165
My first face had a lot
of horizontal designs,

401
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,434
but once we got that curveball
from Mr. Westmore,

402
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:41,603
I decided to change
that completely

403
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:44,238
and have
vertical branches instead.

404
00:15:44,273 --> 00:15:46,941
- This is really depressing.
- I know, I know.

405
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:54,849
I was hoping
I could get it finished today,

406
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:55,850
and then, tomorrow,
as soon as I get here,

407
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:57,352
- we can open it.
- Dude, just--

408
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:59,854
- as thick as you can make it, and then--
- That's what I'm trying to do.

409
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:01,255
At the end of the day,
I'm pretty worried

410
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,957
the leg mold
is not thick enough,

411
00:16:02,992 --> 00:16:06,160
and I know I'm gonna have
to come back to it tomorrow.

412
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:07,795
Okay, that's time.

413
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,264
We're now behind for day two.

414
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:13,468
I have been in
the bottom every challenge.

415
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:15,003
It's just not
a good spot to be in.

416
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:17,972
I'm starting to get
extremely worried.

417
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:30,385
Oh, it smells like
foam latex in here.

418
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:31,953
Sweet.

419
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:33,855
It's day two
of our tree challenge,

420
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:36,724
and we have ten hours
in the lab.

421
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,593
Yesterday,
I re-sculpted the face,

422
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:41,596
so today, we're gonna have
to finish sculpting the cowl

423
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,232
and maybe do some hands,
chest piece,

424
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,367
and we'll see about a neck.

425
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:48,236
We have a lot of work
to do today.

426
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,438
Yeah, we need to add
something here.

427
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,843
- How's it looking?
- Fine and dandy.

428
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:56,944
How's our face?

429
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,513
Edges look really nice,

430
00:16:58,547 --> 00:16:59,981
- that's for sure.
- Yeah.

431
00:17:00,015 --> 00:17:02,483
We have our foam latex pieces
that we sculpted yesterday,

432
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:03,685
and they look beautiful.

433
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:06,821
So now, we have all of
day two for fabrication.

434
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:08,656
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
start cutting up

435
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:10,358
some flowers
while the latex dries.

436
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:11,359
All right.

437
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:13,327
The tree-- it has
this very, like,

438
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:16,864
feminine kind of curve to it,
so we were gonna fabricate

439
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,801
this pencil skirt out of latex
to do this.

440
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,336
I sculpt--
it's called a gang mold.

441
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:24,739
So that I have
a mold of, like, 30 spikes,

442
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:26,841
and I can just pass latex
in that.

443
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,378
And within 10 minutes,
I've got 30 spikes

444
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:32,246
that are ready to go
wherever they need to.

445
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:34,182
Can you think of anything else
that's more pressing?

446
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:35,683
Um, I don't know.

447
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:37,318
Maybe just dance.

448
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:52,100
Doc is finished
with the leg mold,

449
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:54,102
and I get the chest, back,
and cowl finished.

450
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:55,903
It's the biggest sculpture
I've ever done, and now,

451
00:17:55,938 --> 00:17:58,606
I have the biggest mold
I've ever made to make.

452
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,142
I'm probably gonna need
your help moving the mannequin.

453
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:04,145
While I'm molding the chest,
Doc is molding the arms.

454
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,947
We're both a little bit
worried about time management,

455
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:08,416
but hopefully,
we can get it all done.

456
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,951
Hey, Drew.
I think it's ready to go.

457
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:11,319
Let's do it.

458
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,687
The stone on the bodysuit mold

459
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:14,989
has completely hardened,
and it's ready to open.

460
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,762
Fuck.
I broke it.

461
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:21,763
We're having a lot
of trouble getting

462
00:18:21,797 --> 00:18:24,098
the mold actually popped open.

463
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:27,268
We started noticing
some cracks...

464
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:29,704
Shit.

465
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:31,739
And we start noticing
some more cracks.

466
00:18:31,774 --> 00:18:33,808
What the fuck happened?

467
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,510
The more we pry,
the more cracks we're getting.

468
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:37,345
- Oh, oh.
- What's happening?

469
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:39,881
It's breaking across the chest.

470
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:41,349
I'm getting
worried at this point.

471
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:43,985
If we don't get this mold open
and ready for foam today,

472
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,086
we won't have anything.

473
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,788
Why are you stuck?

474
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:48,356
We're in a lot of trouble.

475
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:53,829
It's breaking.

476
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,164
It's day two of
our twisted tree challenge,

477
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,034
and me and Drew are having
trouble opening our mold.

478
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:00,403
- All right. Stop.
- It's stuck here somewhere.

479
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:01,771
I'm starting to get
a little worried right now

480
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,072
because we really need
to get this mold

481
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:06,042
popped and get right
to fabricating willow branches.

482
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:12,815
Look at that.

483
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:14,350
Finally get the mold open,

484
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:16,252
and it's definitely a relief.

485
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:17,953
But we've lost a lot of time.

486
00:19:17,988 --> 00:19:19,522
All right, you go fabricate.

487
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,689
- I'll handle this.
- Are you sure?

488
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:21,724
- Yes.
- All right.

489
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,793
- Very sure.
- All right.

490
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:24,894
I immediately get started

491
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,562
on fabricating the branches

492
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,030
of the weeping willow tree.

493
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:29,732
I'm going to make
four large branches

494
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:33,169
that are gonna protrude
from the prosthetic in the back.

495
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,144
Once you see it start
to kind of,

496
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,780
like, wiggle on you,
that's your best point.

497
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:48,784
Birch trees have bark
that peels off like paper.

498
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:52,154
To create that look,
I'm taking L200,

499
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:53,489
and I cut some shapes into it,

500
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,391
and I curled them
with the heat gun.

501
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,759
Look, Sasha.

502
00:19:56,793 --> 00:19:58,928
Oh, my God!

503
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,496
We also have to make hands,

504
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,566
so Sasha makes burl hands out
of poly foam.

505
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,195
_

506
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:09,291
_

507
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,827
_

508
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,343
_

509
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,976
There's no way that they're
gonna come off the hands

510
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,378
without us completely
tearing them apart.

511
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:17,713
This is not good.

512
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,815
_

513
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,250
I'm very frustrated,

514
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:22,952
but I'm just gonna have
to figure something out.

515
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:23,986
Yeah.

516
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,360
- Okay.
- Ooh.

517
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,462
See, that right there is almost

518
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,531
just perfect for this
reddish color that's in there.

519
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,437
_

520
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:38,834
That's why I'm mixing
other colors in it,

521
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:40,503
and this is why I said
it was not the exact.

522
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:41,904
Damien definitely wants to go

523
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,939
more sequoia red color with it.

524
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,542
Our malady is tree rot,
so I want to go

525
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:50,012
a little bit more grayed-out,
dead zombie tree.

526
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,280
It just needs to get
a little bit darker.

527
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:52,314
But it dries a different color

528
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,983
than what you're looking.

529
00:20:54,017 --> 00:20:55,217
We're not quite in sync,

530
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:56,819
so I'm a little bit
worried about it.

531
00:20:56,853 --> 00:20:59,455
It could make or break us.

532
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:07,029
I decided to carve my hands
out of mattress foam.

533
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:11,267
It's not looking beautiful,
but burls aren't beautiful.

534
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,636
And at least now I feel
like I'm on the right track.

535
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,670
I'm gonna keep going.

536
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:17,206
Hit me.
Aww.

537
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,475
Time is just whittling away,

538
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,810
and I go to open the first arm.

539
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:25,347
I try and lift, and--
Oh, come on.

540
00:21:25,382 --> 00:21:27,183
It's just breaking
along the edges.

541
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:30,019
And there it goes.

542
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,054
It just completely breaks

543
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,889
into, like,
four different pieces.

544
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:35,891
We might not be
getting the arms.

545
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:38,060
- Why not?
- They just keep breaking.

546
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:39,562
This is just a mess.

547
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:40,996
That's time, everyone!

548
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:42,598
Brushes down!

549
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:44,333
- Eh?
- Eh.

550
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:45,801
This is the end
of the line for me.

551
00:21:45,835 --> 00:21:47,069
- I'm out.
- No, it's not.

552
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:48,837
Time runs out,
and at this point,

553
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,739
I'm already packing
my bags in my head.

554
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:52,541
We don't have the arms.

555
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:54,877
That was my responsibility.
I sculpted those.

556
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:57,313
I molded them.
I broke the mold.

557
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:59,682
It's my fault.

558
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:10,826
- Go on ahead.
- Go, go, go, go.

559
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,161
It's application day.

560
00:22:12,195 --> 00:22:13,329
We have four hours in the lab

561
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,264
and one hour at last looks.

562
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:16,365
Things are gonna be crazy.

563
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,733
Okay, that can be glued.

564
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:22,438
A little bit of a tear,
but that looks pretty good.

565
00:22:22,472 --> 00:22:23,439
Look. Check it out.

566
00:22:23,473 --> 00:22:24,673
What's that?

567
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,176
We have a very bad second skin
on our cowl.

568
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,911
Second skin is where
the outside

569
00:22:28,945 --> 00:22:31,647
of your foam piece
isn't attached,

570
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:32,915
but it really resembles
the rot texture

571
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:34,583
that we sculpted
into our cowl originally.

572
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:37,152
- That actually looks good.
- Yeah, like rot.

573
00:22:37,187 --> 00:22:38,254
You could do
the rot right there.

574
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:39,622
Oh, yeah.

575
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:40,990
So we decide to turn
all of our second skinning spots

576
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:43,092
into rot, which I'm hoping
doesn't come back

577
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:44,360
to bite us in the ass later.

578
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:45,961
- Cool. Yeah. Right on.
- That's awesome.

579
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:49,465
- I'm Vince.
- Cig.

580
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:51,834
So you're gonna be
the silk floss tree.

581
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:54,403
George and I have
to apply the skirt,

582
00:22:54,437 --> 00:22:56,639
apply the latex patches
from her shoulder

583
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:57,806
to her fingertips.

584
00:22:57,841 --> 00:23:00,476
We also have to apply
our face piece

585
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,777
and head dress as well.

586
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,445
I look around,
and everybody has

587
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,381
very, very different
makeups than ours,

588
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:08,350
but I'm hoping that it makes
us stand out in a great way.

589
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:10,085
If I got to go home,
I want to go home

590
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,387
on a makeup that
I had fun with,

591
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:12,521
and I've had a lot of fun.

592
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:13,656
Me, too.

593
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:19,795
This really looks
like peeling birch.

594
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:21,864
- I love it.
- Yeah, it really does.

595
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,632
We used brown as our base color

596
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,901
and then dry-brushed white
all over.

597
00:23:25,935 --> 00:23:28,304
Our tree is
totally coming to life.

598
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:31,340
The colors in it
and the eyes are popping--

599
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:33,442
like, really looking awesome.

600
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,885
Doc and I get the cowl
and torso on our model,

601
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,219
and I take a chip brush
and just start

602
00:23:44,254 --> 00:23:46,155
brushing
on that brown base coat

603
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:47,723
and then come up
with the lighter brown

604
00:23:47,757 --> 00:23:48,924
highlights on top of it.

605
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,726
And 'cause the arms
did not come out,

606
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,695
we have to find
a way to cover everything.

607
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:54,396
But luckily, I have a robe
that I can cut up

608
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:55,798
and glue down on top of him.

609
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:57,066
The sculpt bulks out.

610
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,233
The arms are covered.

611
00:23:58,268 --> 00:23:59,535
He looks cohesive.

612
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:01,311
I just hope it's good enough.

613
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,000
_

614
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:04,373
How much time?

615
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:05,574
Ten.

616
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:06,825
Oh, fuck.

617
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:11,313
Time's almost up.

618
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:14,783
We have all of our prosthetics
applied and painted.

619
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:16,919
So when we get over there,
we're gonna attach

620
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:20,389
your branches, and they're
gonna come out above you.

621
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:21,457
Guys, that's time.

622
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:23,659
- Brushes down.
- Yeah.

623
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:27,029
It's a risk for us
to apply at last looks,

624
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:28,764
but without the branches,

625
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,833
she won't read
as a weeping willow at all.

626
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:33,202
So we have to make sure
that we get 'em done

627
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:36,438
and done right.

628
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:38,640
Coming up...

629
00:24:38,675 --> 00:24:39,775
We need to focus on the paint.

630
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:41,176
It's looking very hokey.

631
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,045
Stay together, girl.
I don't know what happened.

632
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,380
It's awe-inspiring.

633
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:46,515
There are so many
missed opportunities here.

634
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,679
Let's go. Let's go.

635
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:57,181
We get to last looks,
and we have an hour left

636
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,682
to complete our tree.

637
00:24:58,717 --> 00:24:59,883
They should come out
in a two-top.

638
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:00,985
Okay.

639
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:01,986
Drew's putting on the branches

640
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,454
while I'm touching up the paint.

641
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,489
I'm worried that if we don't
get this tree canopy,

642
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:07,291
there's nothing about
the makeup

643
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:08,292
that says "weeping willow."

644
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:10,125
Perfect.

645
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,064
_

646
00:25:14,065 --> 00:25:15,699
We notice that some
of his legs were showing.

647
00:25:15,734 --> 00:25:18,335
- What do you need?
- The big piece of pine needles.

648
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,304
So we bring in some more
of the green pine

649
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,706
to make it look like
it's all intentional.

650
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:24,341
And I'm just thinking,
"Oh, my God.

651
00:25:24,376 --> 00:25:27,344
We may have pulled it off."

652
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:30,987
_

653
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,055
_

654
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,150
_

655
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:34,852
I'm still questioning
the hands in my head,

656
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:39,456
but the character looks amazing.

657
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:41,992
We need to focus around
the costume,

658
00:25:42,027 --> 00:25:43,360
getting it all black.

659
00:25:43,395 --> 00:25:44,828
We're frantically painting.
Time is running out,

660
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:46,063
and it's just too bright.

661
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,131
It looks very hokey.

662
00:25:47,165 --> 00:25:48,599
So we start darkening that dye

663
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,034
with some blacks
and some browns.

664
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:51,635
- It popped way better like that.
- Did it?

665
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,470
So we're looking pretty good.

666
00:25:53,505 --> 00:25:55,906
All right, guys.
15 minutes.

667
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:01,612
Time, guys.

668
00:26:01,646 --> 00:26:03,113
- Awesome, awesome, awesome.
- Kick ass.

669
00:26:03,148 --> 00:26:05,416
At the end of last looks,

670
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,186
I cannot believe that Cig and I
have managed to create

671
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,056
not just a tree creature,
but a tree.

672
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,191
I think we've got
a really good chance

673
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:16,193
of hitting top looks
with this makeup.

674
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:17,861
Please,
just stay together, girl.

675
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:20,597
Yeah, right?

676
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:31,041
Welcome to
the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

677
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:33,844
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

678
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:36,647
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

679
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:39,249
Owner of Optic Nerve
Make-Up Effects Studio,

680
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:40,417
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Good evening, guys.

681
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:41,885
- Good evening.
- Hey, Glenn.

682
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,922
Oscar-winning makeup artist,
Lois Burwell.

683
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:46,357
Good evening, all of you.

684
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:47,958
Hi, Lois.

685
00:26:47,992 --> 00:26:49,226
And creature
and concept designer,

686
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,894
- Neville Page.
- Hello.

687
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:52,596
- Hi, Neville.
- All right, guys.

688
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,199
This week, your spotlight
challenge was to create

689
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,234
a twisted tree character based

690
00:26:57,268 --> 00:27:00,137
on a unique tree species
and malady.

691
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:01,572
Let's take a look
at your creations

692
00:27:01,606 --> 00:27:02,873
while the audience
at home tweets

693
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,776
about their favorites
using #FaceOff.

694
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,636
I'm loving
how interesting he is

695
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,204
and how he doesn't look
like any other tree.

696
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,728
I wish there was a little
more variation in the color,

697
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:00,130
but the makeup is
pretty complete.

698
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:22,853
He stomps onto the stage.
He looks amazing.

699
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:26,423
I'm really hoping
that we get top looks.

700
00:28:45,176 --> 00:28:46,143
I think he looks great.

701
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:47,377
I think he's got
a strong profile

702
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:48,479
and a strong silhouette.

703
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:50,514
It looks like a tree character.

704
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:13,437
Our banyan tree
doesn't look good.

705
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:15,472
I'm definitely expecting
to be on bottom.

706
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:36,760
There are no branches.

707
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:38,061
What the fuck?

708
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,297
When we finished last looks,
it was all put together,

709
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:42,399
but now, it's not.
I don't know what happened.

710
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:50,374
Judges, it's time to have
a closer look at our trees.

711
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:58,215
It's really well-rendered.

712
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:00,484
- And I like the bark here.
- Yeah.

713
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:01,718
I love this.

714
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:03,420
- Full head-to-toe coverage.
- Yeah.

715
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:06,490
Thank you.

716
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:08,926
Wow, there's
a lot of work here.

717
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,628
The strangling vine idea
seems placed on

718
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:12,796
as an afterthought.

719
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,567
Thank you.

720
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:17,768
I don't get it.

721
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:20,504
I think it's
the stump at the top.

722
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:22,539
There's a lot of things
well done,

723
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:23,674
but it's flawed.

724
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:26,009
The hands are really good.

725
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:27,077
Yeah.

726
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:29,413
Thank you.

727
00:30:29,447 --> 00:30:31,882
This is stunning,
the way that it trails off

728
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,383
in one direction.

729
00:30:33,418 --> 00:30:34,585
I love the clarity of the face.

730
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:38,555
Thank you.

731
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,626
This pattern here doesn't
say "tree bark" at all.

732
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,961
It doesn't say it anywhere.

733
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:47,197
As Glenn is gesturing,
I'm starting to notice

734
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,366
all the things that
we should have done.

735
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,902
Looks like fungus
wasn't the only malady.

736
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:55,005
I have immunity,
so I am gonna be

737
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,543
really, really upset
if Dina goes home.

738
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:02,245
Who made your favorite
twisted tree character?

739
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,849
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

740
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,761
Oh, lord.

741
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:11,730
I'm starting to notice
all the things

742
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:12,964
that we should have done.

743
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,866
Looks like fungus
wasn't the only malady.

744
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:18,170
I am gonna be really upset
if Dina goes home.

745
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:19,704
Thank you.

746
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:22,874
The arms seem so undone,

747
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:26,044
and the colors don't even
really tie together.

748
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:27,679
It feels to me as
if there's something

749
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:28,814
elaborate missing.

750
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:37,856
Okay, the judges have
scored your creations,

751
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,124
so let's find out
what they thought.

752
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:42,160
George and Keaghlan,

753
00:31:42,195 --> 00:31:45,096
Dina and Rachael...

754
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:47,032
Congratulations,
you are all safe

755
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:49,868
and can head back
to the makeup room.

756
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:55,874
That means the rest of you
were the best

757
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:57,843
and the worst this week.

758
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:59,477
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

759
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:00,745
to learn more about your work.

760
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,783
Doc and Jason, please step up.

761
00:32:07,753 --> 00:32:09,654
Tell me about the tree
that you selected

762
00:32:09,689 --> 00:32:12,224
and how it influenced
your makeup.

763
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:13,425
We got the bristlecone pine.

764
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,960
Its malady
was lightning strike.

765
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:17,362
Since the bristlecone pine
is a Western tree,

766
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,431
we made him the guardian
of the desert.

767
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:22,601
I sculpted the hands,
chest, back, and cowl.

768
00:32:22,635 --> 00:32:24,236
Doc blocked out
the face and the--

769
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,370
And the stumps.

770
00:32:25,404 --> 00:32:28,106
The form language is exquisite.

771
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,108
Oh, my goodness.

772
00:32:30,142 --> 00:32:33,144
You're doing highly
advanced creative thinking.

773
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:36,548
The shapes actually inform
the visual experience

774
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:37,849
for the audience.

775
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,317
It's quite awe-inspiring.

776
00:32:39,352 --> 00:32:41,519
Thank you so much.

777
00:32:41,554 --> 00:32:43,722
I like all the small details.

778
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:47,592
I love the way you've even done
the knees and the feet.

779
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:49,327
I think it's excellent work.

780
00:32:49,362 --> 00:32:50,729
Thank you.

781
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,030
On the malady front,

782
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:53,765
I don't really know if
it's supposed to be

783
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:55,834
on fire
or it's just extinguished.

784
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,802
I would have chosen
one way or the other.

785
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,070
Yeah.

786
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:03,909
But the finesse in
the cheek area is so good.

787
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:07,979
Doc and Jason,
please step back.

788
00:33:08,014 --> 00:33:08,980
Thank you, guys.

789
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:10,882
Good job, buddy.

790
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,284
Good job, man.

791
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:14,386
Good job, guys.

792
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,123
Cig and Drew, please step up.

793
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:23,295
Tell us about your tree.

794
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:24,663
We got the weeping willow.

795
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:26,164
It has bug infestation,

796
00:33:26,198 --> 00:33:28,934
and the only way
that she can get

797
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:30,135
the bugs to not eat her

798
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:31,670
is to give them
something else to eat.

799
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:35,840
So she sits under the willow
branches and grabs passersby.

800
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,809
Then, the bugs come out,
and they feast on the person

801
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:40,045
while she's weeping
in their face.

802
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:41,846
I don't want to lead you
with anything,

803
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:44,349
but is there anything missing?

804
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:47,619
She was draped
in willow branches.

805
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,521
I'm not really sure,
but I think our model

806
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:51,256
had a last minute
weight issue with them.

807
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,692
Even taking that into account,

808
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:58,396
I feel as if there are so many
missed opportunities here.

809
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:01,232
There's something about
the way the color is done.

810
00:34:01,267 --> 00:34:04,002
This seems to be so uniform,

811
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:07,339
and the sluggy bugs
don't make sense to me.

812
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:10,308
There's some really nice
fine detail work

813
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:12,243
up in the face,

814
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:15,046
but it turns
to mud rather quickly.

815
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:17,649
Who's responsible
for the different aspects

816
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:18,683
of the makeup?

817
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:20,385
Cig sculpted the body,

818
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:25,156
and I did the face
and fabricated the branches.

819
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,891
So you're taking
full responsibility

820
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:29,394
for engineering
whatever I'm not seeing.

821
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:31,262
That's brave of you.

822
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:32,664
I'm sad it didn't work out.

823
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:34,299
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

824
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,401
Cig and Drew,
if you'd please step back.

825
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:40,705
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Iris.

826
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:45,010
Sasha and Stella,
please step forward.

827
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,917
So tell us about the tree
that you chose

828
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:55,687
and how the malady inspired
this design.

829
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:58,790
Our tree is
the white birch tree,

830
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:02,093
and it is sacred to
the Native American people.

831
00:35:02,128 --> 00:35:05,497
He is upset that his people
were driven from his land,

832
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:08,033
and because of that,
he started growing burls

833
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,801
all over his body.

834
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:11,803
I'm pretty well impressed.

835
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:17,542
It is so well-rendered
and so clear that it is birch.

836
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:22,947
Then, I see these boxing gloves
that are so wrong.

837
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:24,349
I wanted to do away with them.

838
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,784
Oh, you didn't like them?

839
00:35:25,818 --> 00:35:27,886
I said, "Can we
please get rid of them?"

840
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,888
It's a little late now.

841
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,289
Are those just gloves?

842
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:33,758
Can you take one of them off
so I can just see his form

843
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:35,427
without the--

844
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:36,928
If his hand was just white,

845
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:39,097
it's a gigantic leap forward,

846
00:35:39,131 --> 00:35:42,600
but overall, the paint job is
absolutely gorgeous.

847
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,369
I enjoy it immensely.

848
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:47,005
- Thank you.
- I really like this makeup too.

849
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,641
I particularly love
the crumply knees.

850
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:51,476
Just a nice touch.

851
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,677
It's really, really good.

852
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:54,379
Thank you.

853
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:58,183
Stella and Sasha,
please step back.

854
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:05,056
Damien and Vince.

855
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:12,831
Tell me about the tree
that influenced this makeup.

856
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,799
Our tree was the giant sequoia,

857
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,534
and its malady was rot.

858
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:18,103
Somebody chops him down,
and that's how

859
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:19,304
he gets infested with the rot.

860
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:22,107
Vince sketched out
a profile of him

861
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,675
and sculpted the face.

862
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,143
I sculpted the hands,

863
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:28,446
and we both had hands
on the cowl and the feet.

864
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:30,715
I think it's
a triumphant victory

865
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:36,321
if it was
for an office Halloween party.

866
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:40,358
It's just not sensible to
have started

867
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:43,394
with the trunk on his head
because it's so limiting

868
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:46,664
in terms of what you can do
for the rest of the body.

869
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:49,634
It really is like he's rushed
into the forest

870
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,036
and pulled something over
his head as a disguise.

871
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:55,807
There's something
not cohesive about it.

872
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,442
There's some gorgeous
work here.

873
00:36:57,476 --> 00:37:00,745
The giant hands,
well-sculpted,

874
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:02,380
but his left eye--

875
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:05,183
What is that supposed to be?

876
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:06,751
It's just a dead eye,

877
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,820
just like the rot in--
that's infesting him.

878
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,288
Don't understand that,

879
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:13,324
and conceptually,
it's devoid and crippling.

880
00:37:14,426 --> 00:37:16,494
Vince and Damien,
please step back.

881
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:19,531
Thank you.

882
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:24,569
All right, guys.

883
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,104
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

884
00:37:26,138 --> 00:37:27,305
If you'd please head back
to the make-up room

885
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:31,876
while they deliberate.

886
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:36,414
All right, judges.

887
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:37,749
So why don't we start
with the looks you like

888
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:38,750
the most this week.

889
00:37:38,784 --> 00:37:40,685
How about Doc and Jason?

890
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,320
I thought it was gorgeous.

891
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:44,189
There's little
that you can do to screw it up

892
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:46,391
once you've got the forms
that right-on,

893
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:48,826
and I think that
was mostly Jason.

894
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,563
The way that
the expression comes through

895
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,932
and the clever use of
that red under the eye

896
00:37:53,966 --> 00:37:56,100
to give that haunted look.

897
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:57,302
I really loved it.

898
00:37:57,336 --> 00:37:59,504
The distance read had
a lot of information

899
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,172
that was interesting,
and up close,

900
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:03,208
there was a lot
of tight detail.

901
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,176
All right, let's move on
to Sasha and Stella.

902
00:38:05,211 --> 00:38:09,147
That thing read instantly
that it was American-Indian,

903
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:12,784
birch, and there was something
fantastical about it.

904
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:15,987
- The coloring was superb.
- Yeah.

905
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:17,822
I don't know that you could
have nailed

906
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,458
the texture color any better.

907
00:38:20,492 --> 00:38:22,427
It's just wonderful.
I loved it.

908
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:25,496
Let's move on to
the looks you like the least.

909
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:26,998
Cig and Drew.

910
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:29,200
It's a shame
because it's so hard

911
00:38:29,235 --> 00:38:32,370
when part of the makeup isn't
actually there in front of you,

912
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:34,872
but we can't judge something
that isn't there.

913
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:36,507
The fact that they're
not clever enough

914
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:38,676
to have engineered something
in the time

915
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,445
that they had to carry
that weight,

916
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:42,247
that's
a decision-making problem.

917
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,983
So even though Drew
dropped the ball

918
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:46,851
on the most important part,

919
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,886
he was responsible
for the face,

920
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:50,221
which is the best part.

921
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:51,322
- Yeah.
- All right.

922
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:53,057
Let's move on
to Vince and Damien.

923
00:38:53,092 --> 00:38:56,828
It is devoid of a concept.

924
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:59,564
I don't think Da Vinci
himself could have made

925
00:38:59,598 --> 00:39:03,001
anything happen with that idea
of a tree mask

926
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:06,537
with his eyes and mouth showing
through on his head.

927
00:39:06,572 --> 00:39:08,306
And what about Vince
and that eye?

928
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,909
That was one very,
very specific region

929
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:13,544
that had
the greatest opportunity

930
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:16,981
to design, sculpt,
and sell character.

931
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:18,116
Yes.

932
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,484
A complete missed
opportunity there.

933
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:21,686
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

934
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,554
- We have.
- Yep.

935
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:27,091
Okay. Let's bring them
back out.

936
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:36,734
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

937
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:38,670
Doc and Jason,

938
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:41,039
there was
some elegant flowing lines

939
00:39:41,073 --> 00:39:42,173
in your sculptural work,

940
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:43,341
and we thought that you made

941
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,877
all the right choices
in your paint job.

942
00:39:45,911 --> 00:39:47,512
Stella and Sasha,

943
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:50,348
your birch texture really
came through,

944
00:39:50,382 --> 00:39:52,517
and we absolutely adored
the way

945
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:55,553
that your malady drove
the sympathetic nature

946
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:56,688
of your character.

947
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,690
All right.
Which team came out on top?

948
00:39:58,724 --> 00:40:01,726
The top team tonight is...

949
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:07,448
All right, Glenn.
Which team came out on top?

950
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:10,484
The top team tonight is...

951
00:40:12,187 --> 00:40:13,487
Doc and Jason.

952
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:17,858
Looking at that makeup,

953
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,994
you would never know
that the two of you guys

954
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:22,163
started off the day thinking
that you were in trouble.

955
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:24,398
It is a remarkably strong
piece of work.

956
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:25,666
Thank you.

957
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:28,169
Jason and Doc, congratulations.

958
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:30,371
As you know,
we can only have one winner.

959
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:31,372
Glenn?

960
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:34,742
Our winner tonight is...

961
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:37,078
- Jason.
- Oh, my God.

962
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:41,015
There was true beauty in some
of your detail work tonight.

963
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:42,249
What a comeback.

964
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:43,317
Congratulations.

965
00:40:43,351 --> 00:40:44,585
Thank you guys so much.

966
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:46,687
I actually won a challenge,
and it feels great.

967
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:48,389
No matter what happens further
in this competition,

968
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:50,658
I have this win, and they can't
take that from me.

969
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:53,327
- Jason, congratulations.
- Thank you.

970
00:40:53,361 --> 00:40:56,297
You and Doc, Sasha,
and Stella are all safe

971
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:58,866
and can head back
to the makeup room.

972
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:03,938
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

973
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:05,339
are on the bottom this week.

974
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:08,642
One of you will be eliminated.

975
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:11,679
Please step forward.

976
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:19,019
All right, Glenn.

977
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:21,255
Tell us
about tonight's bottom teams.

978
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:24,792
Cig and Drew, we thought
the face was quite nice,

979
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:27,795
but the missing willow canopy
just left your makeup up

980
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:29,263
a river without a paddle.

981
00:41:29,297 --> 00:41:33,167
Vince and Damien, there were
some well-done pieces

982
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,770
of the makeup,
but the crippled concept

983
00:41:35,804 --> 00:41:38,773
was just too prevalent
in the end result.

984
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:40,841
So who's going home tonight?

985
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:46,380
The person going home
tonight is...

986
00:41:46,414 --> 00:41:49,216
Vince.

987
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,520
Most of our major issues
were the shapes

988
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,054
of the head and cowl.

989
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:56,457
They just left no where else
for the makeup to go.

990
00:41:56,491 --> 00:42:00,628
Vince, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

991
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:04,231
That means
Damien, Cig, and Drew,

992
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:05,833
you guys are safe this week
and can head back

993
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:08,836
to the makeup room.

994
00:42:14,943 --> 00:42:17,845
You've got great talent,

995
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:20,080
and I hope in the future
we meet up again.

996
00:42:20,115 --> 00:42:22,216
Thank you.

997
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,484
Vince, it's been great
having you here with us.

998
00:42:23,518 --> 00:42:25,352
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

999
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:27,621
and pack up your kit.

1000
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,423
- Good luck, Vince.
- Thank you.

1001
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:31,425
I'm bummed
that I didn't get a chance

1002
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:33,794
to compete in other challenges.

1003
00:42:35,297 --> 00:42:36,864
Who is it, guys?

1004
00:42:36,898 --> 00:42:38,999
- Vince.
- Oh, Vince.

1005
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:41,535
I have a lot of ideas
that I wanted to show.

1006
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,505
My only regret, I guess,
would be that

1007
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,274
I didn't think more
about the concept,

1008
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:50,644
but makeup effects,
it's my first love,

1009
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,279
and I still love doing it,

1010
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:56,083
and being able to do
that is pretty great.
