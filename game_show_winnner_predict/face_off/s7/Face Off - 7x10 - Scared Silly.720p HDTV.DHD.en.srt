1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:02,228
You really knocked
this one out of the park.

2
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:06,065
Somehow, it's just
all gone a bit mimsy.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:07,633
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,135
Dina's serpentine sniper

5
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:10,703
- blew the judges away...
- Thank you.

6
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:13,706
And Keaghlan was sent home.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,976
Now eight artists remain.

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,812
Tonight they will face
their darkest fears.

9
00:00:19,846 --> 00:00:22,581
This is going
to give me nightmares.

10
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:24,250
I'm about to peel it off.

11
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,552
And for some, the challenge
won't be a laughing matter.

12
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,020
I'm really not happy with it.

13
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:30,623
It doesn't feel
like a solid vision.

14
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,792
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

15
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,326
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

16
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:37,363
to one of their
85 international locations,

17
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:39,999
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

18
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,501
and $100,000.

19
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:46,338
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,319
Wake up, kiddies.

22
00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:34,954
Wake up.

23
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:36,422
What is that?

24
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:39,658
We're hearing laughter
and some disembodied voice.

25
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,060
I don't even know
what time it is.

26
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:43,696
Everyone's waking up,
like, "What the hell is that?"

27
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,264
Come on, kiddies,

28
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:47,733
get dressed and make
your way to the lab.

29
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,970
Don't worry.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

30
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:54,840
Oh, my God.
What just happened?

31
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,009
We're all incredibly
freaked out.

32
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,011
We have no idea
what's happening.

33
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,779
I don't want to even leave
my room,

34
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:03,249
let alone go to the lab.

35
00:02:07,854 --> 00:02:09,355
I can't even see the door.

36
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,757
Where am I going?
What is that?

37
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,058
Oh, no, no.

38
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:14,293
Oh.

39
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:15,561
We're half asleep,

40
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,196
and we're walking around
in a pitch-black lab.

41
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,031
I don't know what's coming.

42
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:21,367
I'm feeling around,
in case I hit something

43
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:22,935
or someone tries to attack.

44
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:25,871
Hello?

45
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,206
Ooh, what's that?

46
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:31,810
Oh.
I don't like this.

47
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:38,384
For your next spotlight
challenge,

48
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,920
you'll experience one
of the most powerful

49
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:43,122
human emotions.

50
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:47,660
It's what you're feeling
right now...

51
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,094
Fear.

52
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:52,298
This is going
to give me nightmares.

53
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:56,468
I didn't know McKenzie
could be so terrifying.

54
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:59,905
While some fears evolve
as you grow into adults,

55
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,274
childhood fears,
like being afraid of the dark,

56
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:04,476
can last a lifetime.

57
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,646
This week, you're going
to venture into the world

58
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,916
of a character
that is mostly regarded as good,

59
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:14,119
but has also instilled fear
in thousands of children

60
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:17,990
and adults in films
like<i> Poltergeist, Saw,</i>

61
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:21,226
and Stephen King's<i> It...</i>

62
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,095
Clowns.

63
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,631
So your spotlight challenge
is to create

64
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:28,267
your very own
evil-clown character.

65
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:32,137
This challenge
is gonna be a lot of fun.

66
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,139
I'm really excited,
because back home,

67
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,642
I'm known
for doing scary clowns.

68
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,144
And, of course, you know
it won't be that simple.

69
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,680
Before this challenge,
you were all given a survey

70
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,115
with various questions,

71
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:47,720
but one of them was about your
own darkest, childhood fear.

72
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:48,887
Creepy.

73
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:51,256
George, you wrote "Worms."

74
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,659
Dina, "Tornadoes."

75
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,562
Cig, "Dark water."

76
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:59,565
Damien, "Spiders."

77
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,268
Sasha, "Old dolls."

78
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:05,304
Drew, "Spiders."

79
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:08,941
For Stella, it was
"Monsters under the bed."

80
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,909
And, Rachael,
you said "Cockroaches."

81
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:13,145
Yeah, I did.

82
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:16,215
You will each use
your own childhood fear

83
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:19,451
to inspire
your evil-clown character.

84
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:21,720
Of course,
there's just one more thing.

85
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:23,922
Your makeups will be applied
on real clowns...

86
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,726
...who will put your makeups
to the test on the reveal stage,

87
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,963
featuring a flurry of juggling,
slapstick routines,

88
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:33,432
- and unicycling.
- Sweet.

89
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:37,002
I want your designs
to really capture your fears.

90
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:40,105
So I'm going to leave you here
in the dark to work on them.

91
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,707
Good luck.

92
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,575
Oh, my God.

93
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,611
So let's go find
our sketchbooks.

94
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:46,845
Over here?

95
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,647
It's pitch-black
in the room again,

96
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,417
and we all feel around
for our tablets

97
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:53,652
and start sketching.

98
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:01,493
Sitting in the dark
is really helping me channel

99
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:02,928
my childhood fear,

100
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:04,797
which is monsters under the bed

101
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:07,366
that would reach up
and grab me.

102
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,936
So my evil clown is dressed

103
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,172
in these oversized pants

104
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:14,506
made out of bedsheets,

105
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,309
and he's gonna have
all these hands coming out.

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,947
Spiders have always
creeped me out.

107
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,248
I hate them.

108
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:26,085
I start designing a clown face
that has spider eyes

109
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,453
across the forehead,

110
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:31,957
and the cranium comes back
into this big arachnid butt

111
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,161
that's basically an amalgamation
of everything about spiders

112
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:37,963
that used to terrify me
as a kid.

113
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:39,631
So it's gonna look
like a spider,

114
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,835
but it's gonna have the color
palette of a twisted clown.

115
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:44,503
I think he feels like something
straight out

116
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:47,206
of my own nightmares,
and it's kind of cool.

117
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,176
So right now I'm kind of
going with the idea that, like,

118
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,312
my clown ate a bunch
of spider eggs,

119
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:55,914
and now he's got all these
tiny spiders crawling out

120
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,182
all over his face.

121
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:59,485
My childhood fear was that,
you know, a spider

122
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,453
could crawl into your mouth
while you're sleeping

123
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:02,955
and lay its eggs inside of you.

124
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:04,656
And then you have all these
baby spiders hatching

125
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:06,091
inside of your body.

126
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:08,460
So right away I really wanted
to just get the gross-out,

127
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:12,331
like, ugh factor, 'cause I hate
little itty-bitty spiders.

128
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,969
So my childhood fear
was tornadoes.

129
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,237
I don't know why.

130
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,405
I think maybe I watched too much
<i>Wizard Of Oz.</i>

131
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,875
So I'm doing, like,
a twisted face.

132
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,209
I'm, like, bringing it up
into the hair,

133
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,378
making the hair actually
look like a tornado.

134
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:29,915
We'll see if I can pull it off.
It's gonna be a tough one.

135
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:32,784
The lights come back on.

136
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,020
We have six hours in lab today.

137
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:39,091
We pick our model, and
it's time to start sculpting.

138
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,362
When I was a kid,
my dad and I took a clown class.

139
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:47,032
I wasn't really the coolest kid,
but I'm hoping that'll give me

140
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,568
some kind of edge
in this challenge.

141
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:51,637
I am really afraid of worms.

142
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:55,240
I feel like they're gonna burrow
up into my shoes and get me.

143
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:57,910
So my character
is gonna be a big,

144
00:06:57,944 --> 00:07:01,680
segmented worm head
with a floppy stocking cap,

145
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,383
and I would love to just cover
this whole makeup

146
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,751
in some super slime.

147
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:09,354
But if he's gonna be dancing
around or juggling,

148
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,390
it can't be slippery at all.

149
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:14,793
So I have to keep
everything minimal.

150
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,330
Hey, Sasha.

151
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,399
Tell me why you're afraid
of old dolls.

152
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:23,335
When I was little,
I was scared of old dolls,

153
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:26,038
but now
I love old creepy dolls.

154
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,974
My grandmother has so many
of them in her house,

155
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,910
and I've always had a hard time
sleeping at her house

156
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:33,412
because of these dolls.

157
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:35,581
I decided I'm gonna take
a different approach.

158
00:07:35,615 --> 00:07:37,316
I'm not making a clown.

159
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,019
I'm gonna make a cracked doll
that has clown makeup.

160
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:43,622
I know I'm taking a risk
by not making a clown

161
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:47,125
and going with the doll
concept, but I like it,

162
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,895
and I'm gonna make sure
it looks good.

163
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,067
- Did you get a haircut, George?
- No.

164
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:56,134
You look kind
of different today.

165
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:57,369
I trimmed my beard a little.

166
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,870
- Is that what it is?
- I think it is, yeah.

167
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,138
There's something different
about you.

168
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:02,374
I knew it.

169
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,347
My childhood fear
is cockroaches.

170
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:13,819
My concept is a cockroach hybrid
who is pretending to be a clown.

171
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:16,088
I'm sculpting the face to look
like the segments

172
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,089
of a cockroach's body,

173
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:18,290
but I also want to bring

174
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:19,958
a little bit
of a clown aspect to it,

175
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:23,262
so I'm actually sculpting
clown-like lips

176
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:26,098
and a clown-like brow.

177
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,036
Cig, you have
hydroskourophobia.

178
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,472
"One that is afraid
of dark, murky water."

179
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:35,040
I used to have these
reoccurring nightmares

180
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:36,942
where I would fall
into this giant pool

181
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:39,011
of, like, black, tarry water,

182
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:41,280
and these, like, skeletal,
creepy creatures

183
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:43,448
would try to drag me under
and eat me.

184
00:08:43,483 --> 00:08:47,686
So I'm actually going to sculpt
one of these creepy creatures

185
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,555
that I used to see
and turn it into a clown.

186
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,124
As I'm sculpting, I'm realizing

187
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,393
that a lot
of my stylistic choices

188
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,162
come from these nightmares
that I used to have as a kid,

189
00:08:57,196 --> 00:09:00,032
and I didn't realize
it until this challenge.

190
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,234
It's like I learned
something about myself.

191
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:04,836
Imagine that.

192
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,675
So this long nose, Cig,
is gonna be a spider's leg,

193
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,176
but there's gonna be, like,
little hairs and stuff

194
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,277
sticking out of it.

195
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,645
It's gonna be gross.

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,080
For my spidery clown face,

197
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:18,450
I work out this weird structure
for the nose,

198
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:20,919
and then I figure out
a really cool arrangement

199
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:23,288
for the spider's eyes
coming off the browridge.

200
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:26,358
And I really like the shapes
and forms of the face,

201
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:29,494
and I think that he's gonna
look really cool.

202
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,365
I'm looking at my sculpture.

203
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,933
I got it almost ready to mold,

204
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,668
and I realize
that this character

205
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:38,770
is just a bunch of blobs
of clay.

206
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,839
It literally looks like poop.

207
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,642
For the first time,
I'm seeing a makeup

208
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:45,377
that could send me home.

209
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:47,846
There's eight
really talented artists left,

210
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,648
so there's no room for error.

211
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,850
I don't know if there's enough
time to rip it all apart

212
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,118
and start all over,

213
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,620
but I really don't have
a choice.

214
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:57,956
Coming up...

215
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,658
- I think it's a stretch.
- Yeah.

216
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:00,792
It's hard to do a good makeup

217
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:02,461
when your heart's
just not in it.

218
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:04,129
- It's horrific.
- I love it.

219
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,798
It just left me a bit confused.

220
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,034
So it's day one
of the evil-clown challenge,

221
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:15,602
and I'm really, really unhappy

222
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:17,470
with how the sculpture's
coming out.

223
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:21,274
It looks just like my sketch,
but this is bad enough

224
00:10:21,308 --> 00:10:22,542
to send me home.

225
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:25,445
My best option is just to tear
all that clay off

226
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,613
and start fresh.

227
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,281
So you took the whole face off.

228
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:29,616
It just wasn't looking right.

229
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,419
The thing was, like,
two inches thick in some spots.

230
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,121
That's a mask.
That's not a makeup.

231
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,724
Even though I'll be behind,
it's the best option.

232
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:40,860
But now I need to figure out
a much better concept

233
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:44,397
very quickly.

234
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:45,865
Isn't the rule for the monster

235
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,967
if you have your
feet under your covers,

236
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:49,269
you're fine?

237
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:51,104
My mother tucked me in like
a mummy every night

238
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,605
so the hands couldn't get me.

239
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,840
The clown is gonna be made up

240
00:10:53,874 --> 00:10:55,842
of things that you would
find under the bed,

241
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:57,410
like lost toys.

242
00:10:57,445 --> 00:11:01,848
So I'm going to take this
bouncy ball that I found

243
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:05,452
and use it as the clown's chin.

244
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:11,658
I come up with this concept
of a serial-killer clown

245
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:14,627
whose essence possessed
all these worms,

246
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:18,665
and now, they have reformed
into a killer worm clown man.

247
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:21,735
I wasted a few hours,
so I'm gonna have to bust my ass

248
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,304
to finish this.

249
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,477
Hello, guys.

250
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,078
- Hey.
- Here to check in.

251
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:33,646
Mine was dark water.

252
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:34,814
It's gonna be really wet,

253
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:36,716
and I'm gonna use
the Kryolan aqua colors

254
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,832
and actually
paint the clown makeup

255
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,633
and then use a spritzer bottle 
and then melt it off.

256
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,422
I'd suggest doing
some tests on it first...

257
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:44,424
- Yeah.
- Because if it doesn't work,

258
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,793
- it's gonna be hard to go back.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:49,362
She's gonna have these cracks
all over her,

260
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:52,899
and I want it painted
like a porcelain doll.

261
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,069
You might age it a little
teeny bit of brown, yeah,

262
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:57,537
because if you paint it
pure white,

263
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,906
it's gonna look
like it's brand-new.

264
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,907
Okay.

265
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,408
Tornadoes were my fear.

266
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:04,277
His hair was gonna actually
be the tornado,

267
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:06,946
and it's kind of pulling
his skin up into it.

268
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:08,181
It's a different thought.

269
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:10,150
It's not one
that I would think of.

270
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,818
- I think it's a stretch.
- Yeah.

271
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:15,555
Mr. Westmore's not completely
comfortable with my concept.

272
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,257
It's not helping
with my confidence.

273
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,527
Make sure it tells the story
right away of what you're doing.

274
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,128
I'm focusing on all
of the things

275
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:23,596
about spiders that scare me.

276
00:12:23,631 --> 00:12:26,232
So he has six eyes
instead of two now.

277
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,368
This is actually going
to transform

278
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:29,569
into a spider's leg.

279
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,337
There's so much spider
you have coming out.

280
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:34,674
Be careful with the paint job--
that it isn't too bright.

281
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,042
All right, everybody.
We're heading out.

282
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:37,443
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

283
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,479
Bye.

284
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,951
I don't have very many
references for cracks

285
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:46,452
for my doll's head,

286
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:51,090
so I am just taking pictures
of the cracks in the pavement.

287
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,526
I want to make every little
detail perfect

288
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,228
because I want to prove
to the judges

289
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:57,764
that they saved me
for a reason.

290
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,301
You son of a bitch.

291
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:03,069
- What?
- Are you molding already?

292
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,206
Yeah.
I got a lot of spiders to make.

293
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,374
It feels really good being
the first one in the mold room,

294
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,143
but it also makes me
second-guess myself.

295
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,544
Did I go too simplistic?

296
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,746
Everybody else is spending
a lot more time

297
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,747
on their sculptures,

298
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:15,915
but I'm just gonna focus

299
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,884
on putting on
a really clean makeup.

300
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,819
Hopefully, that's gonna do
the trick.

301
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,256
Ten minutes, guys.

302
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,161
I know it's boring.

303
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:30,763
I'm still a little worried
about my concept.

304
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:31,998
It's hard to do a good makeup

305
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,200
when your heart's
just not in it.

306
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,569
That's time, guys.

307
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:39,572
I'm feeling a lot of pressure
to tweak my concept.

308
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:40,940
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do,

309
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:44,143
but hopefully I can figure it
out before tomorrow.

310
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:54,854
So it's day two
of the evil-clown challenge,

311
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,457
and I have a ton of work to do.

312
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:00,293
Originally, I designed
this giant spider butt

313
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:03,296
for the back of the head,
but I realized that our makeups

314
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,767
have to withstand a professional
acrobatic performance,

315
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:10,937
and that giant spider butt's
probably gonna be in the way.

316
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:13,206
So I shrink it down
quite a bit.

317
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,575
Hopefully, it works.

318
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:20,313
I have a big chest cavity
I need to sculpt,

319
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,516
two big arm cavities,
and lots of little baby cavities

320
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,785
to really complete the idea
that these spiders

321
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,921
are just eating him from within

322
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,956
and not just coming out
of his face.

323
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,428
Last night I was thinking
that I need have

324
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,964
a little more fun
with this design.

325
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:42,435
So my new concept is the clown
got stuck outside

326
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:44,604
at a birthday party
during a tornado

327
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:48,141
and impaled
with birthday-party debris.

328
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:50,777
I definitely feel a lot better
about my concept now.

329
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:55,448
It tells a story,
so I'm excited.

330
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:57,984
George thinks that it
would be really comfy

331
00:14:58,018 --> 00:15:00,853
to wear shorty-ass shorts,

332
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:03,389
shorter than any man
should ever wear.

333
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:06,492
You're distracting me.

334
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:08,928
I didn't have a whole lot
of fun in the lab yesterday,

335
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:10,630
and I wanted to get
some fun going,

336
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,865
and I wanted everyone
to look at my legs.

337
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,034
I could feel the eyes
on me all day.

338
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,004
I mean, it's hard not to look
at perfection.

339
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:20,473
George, you want to grease
up your arms?

340
00:15:20,507 --> 00:15:21,908
Sure.

341
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,410
Stella's been staring
at my awesome thighs all day,

342
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:27,480
so she wants to see
if I got awesome arms as well,

343
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:28,948
which I do.

344
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:32,652
My evil clown needs to have
arms coming out of his body,

345
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:36,723
so I have George put his hands
in alginate arm molds.

346
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:39,959
It's not as nice as my thighs,
but I do have good arms.

347
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,928
Algin is basically
made out of seaweed.

348
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:43,997
It's what they put in your mouth
when you go to the dentist

349
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,465
and get your mouth molded.

350
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:46,799
Awesome.

351
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:50,236
Once it's set up, I can pour
poly foam into the mold

352
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,973
so that I can make as many arms
as I need to.

353
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:56,042
Do a quick test.

354
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:57,543
I need a hell of a lot
of spiders

355
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,045
'cause there are gonna be
a bunch of them

356
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,780
crawling out all over his face.

357
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:03,016
My first idea is to dab
a bead of hot glue

358
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,585
and pick each little leg out
with a little string.

359
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,819
Not working.

360
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:09,155
So I tried sticking little bits
of wire in it.

361
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,623
Use this.

362
00:16:10,657 --> 00:16:13,226
Then I would try to thread
some wire into some beads,

363
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,261
but the legs aren't staying
where I want them to stay.

364
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:16,863
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.

365
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:19,365
I'm getting really frustrated
that I can't figure out a way

366
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,034
to make these damn spiders.

367
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:23,069
My character is a spider clown.

368
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:24,871
If I send him out there
without any spiders,

369
00:16:24,905 --> 00:16:26,372
I know that
I'm gonna be going home.

370
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:27,907
I tried, like,
30 different things.

371
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,510
I'm about to fucking give up.

372
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:36,812
So it's day two
of our evil-clown challenge,

373
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:39,415
and I want to put these nasty,
rotted baby spiders

374
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,716
crawling all over him,

375
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,218
but I'm getting
really frustrated

376
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,021
that I can't figure out a way
to make these damn spiders.

377
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,355
I tried, like,
30 different things.

378
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,523
I'm about to give up.

379
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:50,026
If I send him out there
without any spiders on,

380
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,594
I know that I'm gonna be
going home.

381
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:53,529
I hope this works.

382
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,665
I finally start taking
four pieces of wire

383
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,900
and then taking a little string
of duct tape

384
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,702
and wrapping it
around the center

385
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:03,005
and then just bending
and posing the leg.

386
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,707
I spray 'em black.

387
00:17:04,741 --> 00:17:07,410
Clear coat 'em so they're nice
and shiny and gross-looking.

388
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,979
They look really good.

389
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:20,256
I remember being creeped out
by the heads of the dolls.

390
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,526
Their hair-- it almost
looked like bad hair plugs.

391
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,929
So I start punching hair
through a cowl

392
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,398
and make this really creepy wig

393
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,334
that just looks like
the doll's head.

394
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:33,536
Are you gonna see an edge
of this in the front?

395
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,905
No, because the face covers it.

396
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:37,506
I'm totally happy with it.

397
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:40,710
- That's cool.
- Thanks.

398
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:48,117
Since I'm only
doing a face and a cowl,

399
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,020
for my evil clown, the paint job
has got to be really good.

400
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,256
So it's really important
that I test this out.

401
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,724
I get a premade appliance,

402
00:17:54,758 --> 00:17:57,360
and then I paint
the aqua colors over the top.

403
00:17:57,394 --> 00:18:00,196
And I hold it up, and I spritz
it with a water bottle.

404
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,265
That works.
It looks all drippy and gross.

405
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:03,733
It runs through the cracks.

406
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:07,470
So I'm actually really excited
about application day.

407
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:15,878
I want to make giant worm arms
by tying thread

408
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,080
around a soft foam and covering
it with silicone.

409
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:20,750
If I cover it in silicone,
I'll get the sheen

410
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,918
and the glossiness of a worm

411
00:18:22,953 --> 00:18:25,755
without having to make
my performer all slimy.

412
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:27,690
It can't be slippery at all.

413
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,392
It could ruin
the whole performance.

414
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:31,360
Oh, my gosh.

415
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:33,129
That's disgusting.

416
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,965
Hey, guys, one hour left.

417
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:43,072
I start fabricating antennae
for my creepy cockroach.

418
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:44,774
I'm using foam tube

419
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:47,243
and armature wire
so I can bend them back

420
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:49,045
and make sure
that they won't interfere

421
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,280
with the performance.

422
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:52,548
It's looking really cool.

423
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:56,018
I'm really excited
to put this on my model.

424
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:05,661
That's time, guys!

425
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,497
It's the end of day two,

426
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:11,233
and I am happy
with everything I've done.

427
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:13,602
I think it incorporates
my childhood fear

428
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:16,505
and the clown element,
but I was in the bottom

429
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,907
for the last three weeks,

430
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:20,910
and I'm really hoping
that it comes together nicely

431
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:22,611
on application day.

432
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:32,922
It's application day,
and we have four hours in lab

433
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:35,591
and one hour in last looks,
and my foam looks great.

434
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,927
- That's some good foam.
- That's some good foam.

435
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:39,762
All my edges are paper thin.

436
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:41,197
- It's great.
- Some good seaming.

437
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:43,099
Yeah.

438
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:47,603
Those pants are ridiculous.

439
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:50,840
Oh, I hope she can dance
in that.

440
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:53,476
Clowns.

441
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,910
Hi.
I'm Rachael.

442
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,412
Nice to meet you.

443
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,813
- I'm Damien.
- Demetrius.

444
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:00,950
Demetrius, nice to meet you.

445
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:02,284
- No problems?
- No, I don't think so.

446
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,319
Okay.

447
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:05,087
I want to try these worm arms
on you.

448
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:07,022
These guys--
they're not our regular models.

449
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:08,457
They're used
to just being silly.

450
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,560
And I notice as soon
as they get into the lab,

451
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,496
the whole atmosphere
is just lifted

452
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,930
'cause these guys
are so much fun.

453
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,198
So perfect.

454
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,466
You think you'll be able
to juggle in those

455
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,268
- with some white gloves on?
- No problem.

456
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,070
Okay.
Cool.

457
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,809
I get the cowl on, and I notice

458
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:29,678
that there's a little bit of
space in the back of the head,

459
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:31,313
and it kind of wobbles
a little bit.

460
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:33,361
Does it feel okay?
Everything comfortable?

461
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:34,340
_

462
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:35,480
_ _

463
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,287
If she's doing flips
and jumping around and dancing,

464
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,756
the wobble could potentially
tear the whole makeup off.

465
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,125
So I stuff the back so it fits
a little bit more snugly

466
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,693
and it's not wobbling
around so much,

467
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:46,162
and hopefully it'll work
in my favor.

468
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,763
Can you move your head
and everything?

469
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,399
- Yeah.
- Cool.

470
00:20:52,469 --> 00:20:54,403
The pieces are fitting
together really nicely

471
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:56,806
except the neck isn't hitting
his actual anatomy

472
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,174
all that well.

473
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,076
So I get it to stretch across
in a decent-enough way

474
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,178
so that it looks pretty good.

475
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:05,247
Try not to move
your neck too much.

476
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:13,556
I want to create muscle
and the skin flap

477
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,357
and, like, the inside
of his skull.

478
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:17,126
So I use Kryolan Artex,

479
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,628
which is a two-part,
like, on-skin silicone.

480
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:20,963
And I sculpt some lines into it

481
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:22,898
and try to make it look
like muscle.

482
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:28,404
It's actually looking
pretty cool.

483
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:30,406
Shit.
It's just not wanting to stay.

484
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,075
I'm having a lot trouble
with his chin area.

485
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:35,811
His edges around his mouth are
starting to break down again,

486
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,481
and I just don't know what it is
that's causing these problems.

487
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,049
Here, I'll show you where
it's coming off at.

488
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,551
I still have to do all
this paint work and glue on,

489
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:46,622
like, 150 spiders, so I'm really
starting to freak out.

490
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:48,491
It's that mouth for some reason.
I don't know why.

491
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,659
Hey, guys.
Ten minutes left.

492
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:00,369
That's time, guys.

493
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,238
Once I kind of see it together,

494
00:22:02,272 --> 00:22:04,707
I notice that his arms
and his face

495
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:08,410
aren't the same color,
and that's not good.

496
00:22:08,445 --> 00:22:11,113
So now I have one hour
to fix this.

497
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,282
I have to even up my paint job,

498
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:16,118
and I still have to paint him
to look like a clown.

499
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:19,021
This could get me in trouble.

500
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:22,024
Coming up...

501
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:23,626
I still got a lot shit to do.

502
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,594
I'm worried my clown
is not "clown" enough.

503
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:26,695
Take it away, guys.

504
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,797
There's no words
to describe it.

505
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:41,293
All right. Awesome.
Let's just do the bench.

506
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:43,962
We have one hour at last looks,
and my clown's mouth

507
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:45,197
is falling off his face.

508
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,666
I grab some telesis
and slather it on

509
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,301
and hope
that it's gonna stay down.

510
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:50,769
I got a lot shit to do.

511
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:53,772
It feels okay?

512
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,040
All the painting's done,

513
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:57,342
and now I start spritzing it
with water

514
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,544
to make it look runny.

515
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,012
I'm only gonna have
one chance at this.

516
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,547
If it doesn't look right,
I don't think

517
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,716
I'm gonna have time to fix it.

518
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm painting as fast
as I can because his face

519
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,886
is really red,
and his arms are really purple.

520
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:10,522
So I need to even out
the color of skin.

521
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,325
I am really nervous
my clown is not "clown" enough.

522
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,394
I hope that I can pull it off
with my paint job

523
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:17,463
because everyone else's
looks pretty clown-y.

524
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,698
15 minutes, guys!

525
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,836
I'm running out of time,
so I need to finish the makeup

526
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,404
around the eyes and the mouth,

527
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:28,173
and I'm also worried that
that big hair is gonna fall.

528
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,608
- Who's got hairspray?
- Damien.

529
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,510
Throw it over.
I got right here.

530
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,083
All right, that's time!

531
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:40,018
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

532
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,654
Time's up, and I didn't get
the chance

533
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,691
to add spider-leg details
to the nose,

534
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,926
but I'm hoping
that it still works.

535
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:49,962
Whew.

536
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:01,573
Welcome to
the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

537
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,843
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

538
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:07,546
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

539
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,781
Owner of Optic Nerve
Make-Up Effects Studio,

540
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:09,815
Glenn Hetrick.

541
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:10,849
Good evening, guys.

542
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,050
- Hey, Glenn.
- Hey, Glenn.

543
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:13,852
Oscar-winning makeup artist
Lois Burwell.

544
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:14,853
Hello, all.

545
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,155
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Lois.

546
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,223
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

547
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,058
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

548
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,493
This week
your spotlight challenge

549
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,629
was to use
your own childhood fear

550
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:27,466
as inspiration
for an evil-clown character.

551
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,835
My evil twin also told you
that your characters

552
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,739
would be tested in a performance
here on the reveal stage.

553
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,842
First, let's take a look
at your evil clowns.

554
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,631
Even from far away,
my clown's terrifying.

555
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,634
It looks like it just stepped
right out of my nightmare.

556
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:21,453
My clown probably
looks better up close

557
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,588
than he does from far away.

558
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,790
So, hopefully,
the judges will notice

559
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,925
how much I actually did.

560
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:45,410
Everyone's laughing at her.

561
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:48,146
She's hilarious and creepy
and terrifying

562
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:50,315
at the same time.

563
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,801
I'm not happy with it at all.

564
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:11,470
If I go home
on a clown challenge,

565
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:15,774
it's gonna feel
really embarrassing.

566
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,158
This makeup is terrifying.

567
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,193
He's very spider-y.
He's very creepy.

568
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,162
I really enjoy watching him.

569
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,282
I took a risk by going
with the doll concept.

570
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:59,484
I love my makeup,
but I just don't know

571
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,887
if the judges are gonna like it.

572
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,207
I feel pretty good
about this makeup.

573
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:24,309
I think it's definitely gross,

574
00:27:24,344 --> 00:27:27,546
and that's what I was going for.

575
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,263
I'm not sure if the judges
will get it,

576
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:46,698
but it creeps me out.

577
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,368
So I like it,
and it's disgusting.

578
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:55,073
All right, it's time to see
your evil clowns in action.

579
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:58,043
Take it away, guys.

580
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:27,732
There's no words
to describe it.

581
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,734
Everyone's makeup
held up really well.

582
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,204
I didn't see any foam latex
flop on the stage

583
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,472
or any of that stuff.

584
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:37,742
So I think it was a success
across the board.

585
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:42,814
All right, judges,

586
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:45,684
it's time to take a closer look
at our clowns.

587
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:53,925
- Oh.
- These shapes are amazing.

588
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,694
It looks so wet and drippy.

589
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:59,731
It really is good.

590
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:00,799
Oh, look at this.

591
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,267
Beautifully executed.

592
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,337
The way that this is painted
to look like worn makeup...

593
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,906
- Yes.
- Really well done.

594
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:12,410
I really like how
the eyelashes are sculpted in.

595
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:14,546
- It's clever.
- This is weird.

596
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,281
Is it a dog toy?

597
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,683
It just doesn't make sense.

598
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:22,587
Oh, golly.

599
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:25,490
This is such a known approach
to the makeup.

600
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:27,058
It feels like the joker.

601
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,694
At least bring out
the sternum here a bit.

602
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:33,565
Thank you.

603
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,901
These eye shapes
should have proceeded up

604
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,369
- along the side of the head.
- Yes.

605
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,705
I think the judges are talking
about how tightly clustered

606
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,240
the eyes are,
and I'm starting to think

607
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,675
I might have made a mistake.

608
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:46,678
So I'm freaked out.

609
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:51,349
Who made your favorite
evil-clown character?

610
00:30:51,384 --> 00:30:54,419
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

611
00:30:55,464 --> 00:30:58,333
It's neither spider nor human.

612
00:30:58,367 --> 00:30:59,667
The judges go up to my makeup,

613
00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:02,904
and I see them gesturing
to the sides of the head,

614
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:05,039
and I'm starting to think
I might be in trouble.

615
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:08,643
You've got what looks
like a finger nose, maybe, or--

616
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:11,112
- I don't know what that is.
- I don't know either.

617
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:14,382
Thank you.

618
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,818
I like the way it looks
like some of the painting's

619
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,486
coming off and cracking.

620
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,390
This specific hair punching
that you'd see on a doll.

621
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,559
Oh, that's fantastic.

622
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:29,564
Around the eyes, there's not
a whole lot that's been done.

623
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,798
I kind of wish
he would have kept

624
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:33,534
the sausage-casing coloring
to the face

625
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:36,504
'cause this is wretched
in the best way possible.

626
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:41,709
It's a cute idea.

627
00:31:41,744 --> 00:31:44,178
I'm just not sure we got
to a place where the roach

628
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,480
and the clown came together.

629
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,815
It's almost
a cartoon version of both.

630
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,952
- Thank you.
- Bye.

631
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:55,556
Okay.

632
00:31:55,591 --> 00:31:57,191
The judges have scored
your creations,

633
00:31:57,226 --> 00:31:59,160
so let's find out
what they thought.

634
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:01,562
Stella...

635
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:04,165
George...

636
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:07,335
Rachael...

637
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,504
Congratulations,
because you guys are all safe

638
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:11,639
and can head back
to the makeup room.

639
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:13,274
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

640
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:15,143
Good luck, guys.

641
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:20,148
Now, the rest of you
were the best and the worst.

642
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:21,950
The judges would like to speak
with each of you

643
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,318
to learn more about your work.

644
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:26,621
Dina, please step up.

645
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,494
Tell us about your fear
and how you integrated that

646
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:34,829
into your clown character.

647
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:36,831
My fear as a child
was tornadoes.

648
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:38,933
My clown was at
a birthday party, performing.

649
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:43,171
A storm hit, and he got impaled
by a bunch of party debris.

650
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:44,872
How do you feel
about your creation?

651
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:46,808
I think it's a fun concept.

652
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:50,945
I think you should be
extremely pleased.

653
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,246
It was exceptionally difficult,

654
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:54,248
but you struck
the perfect balance for me

655
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:57,585
between the fantastic
and realism.

656
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:59,020
I like the blood.

657
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:01,122
I love the piece of skin
coming up,

658
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:05,226
and I absolutely adored
the balloon animal.

659
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,128
It's really very good.

660
00:33:07,162 --> 00:33:10,732
I have to kind of disagree
with the two other judges.

661
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:13,234
They like it.
I love it.

662
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:15,269
I think it's really
well sculpted,

663
00:33:15,304 --> 00:33:16,571
really well painted.

664
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:19,207
I'm starting to really see
a whole new tier

665
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:20,408
to your skill set.

666
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,876
Thank you so much.

667
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:24,078
Dina, please step back.

668
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:26,280
Thanks.

669
00:33:26,315 --> 00:33:28,950
- Good job.
- Thanks.

670
00:33:28,984 --> 00:33:31,853
Drew, please step forward.

671
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:38,993
Tell us about your childhood
fear and your makeup.

672
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:40,895
My childhood fears
were spiders.

673
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:42,530
The things that scare me
the most about spiders

674
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,700
were their furry, hairy bodies,
their spindly limbs,

675
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:46,968
and their webbing.

676
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:49,637
So I tried to incorporate
all of those ideas

677
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,539
into this makeup.

678
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,575
This, for me, doesn't work.

679
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,479
If you'd taken the eyes
and placed them on the sides

680
00:33:58,514 --> 00:33:59,947
of the forehead,

681
00:33:59,982 --> 00:34:03,284
then the eye makeup
and the spider's eyes

682
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:07,121
would actually have complemented
each other.

683
00:34:07,156 --> 00:34:08,523
What were you going for
with the nose?

684
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:09,991
Is it supposed to be,
like, a little finger or--

685
00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:13,061
- it was actually the segmented
end of a spider's foot.

686
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,797
Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to complete it.

687
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:17,698
When you have a complex idea
like that

688
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,567
and you don't get
to complete it,

689
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,437
it affects the overall feel
of the makeup.

690
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:23,905
It just left me a bit confused.

691
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:25,673
Okay.
Thank you.

692
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:28,509
Drew, please step back.

693
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:33,247
- I thought it was amazing.
- Thank you.

694
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:36,484
Cig, please step forward.

695
00:34:41,023 --> 00:34:43,524
Tell us about your fear
and the resulting design.

696
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:46,060
My fear was dark water,
and as a kid,

697
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:48,563
I would have these nightmares
that I would fall

698
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,231
into this dark, tarry water,

699
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:53,067
and these sinewy,
skeletal creatures

700
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:55,236
would try to drag me under
and eat me.

701
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,072
So I created
one of those creatures

702
00:34:58,107 --> 00:34:59,907
and turned it into a clown.

703
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:02,143
It's so good
in so many different ways.

704
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:04,779
It's absolutely horrific.

705
00:35:06,248 --> 00:35:08,883
The asymmetry of the paint job
on the front

706
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,919
applied
to this grotesque skull--

707
00:35:11,954 --> 00:35:13,654
this is awesome.

708
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:15,590
There's something
very childlike

709
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:17,959
about the color palette
that you've used.

710
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:21,295
It's scary, but you've got
humor there as well.

711
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,463
Thank you so much.

712
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,565
The paint techniques
that you used

713
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,135
on the back of that head
is phenomenal.

714
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,903
That's what I would want it
to look like

715
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:30,138
coming out of my shop.

716
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:32,406
- You should be very happy.
- Thank you.

717
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:34,976
Cig, you can step back.

718
00:35:38,313 --> 00:35:41,415
All right,
let's talk to Damien.

719
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,888
Tell me about your fear
and how you integrated it

720
00:35:46,922 --> 00:35:47,955
into your character.

721
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,891
My fear as a child was spiders.

722
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:53,361
So this is Webbles The Clown,
and he's a sideshow performer

723
00:35:53,395 --> 00:35:54,729
who would pop a spider
in his mouth

724
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:56,264
and pop it out as a gag.

725
00:35:56,298 --> 00:35:58,032
And while he had it
inside of his mouth,

726
00:35:58,066 --> 00:35:59,867
it actually laid its eggs,
and he swallowed them.

727
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:01,536
So now
they're eating him alive.

728
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,571
As much as I love your idea,

729
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:06,974
there's so many other ways
to have done that, man.

730
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:09,644
As it stands, there's not
a whole lot to the fake depth.

731
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,045
It kind of feels glued on top,

732
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,550
and this has so many
expected lines and shapes.

733
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:17,385
It's just not
your strongest work.

734
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:19,320
I agree 1,000%.

735
00:36:19,354 --> 00:36:21,923
It looks very sort
of Halloween-y costume

736
00:36:21,957 --> 00:36:23,124
this week.

737
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:24,525
Here's what I love
about it, though--

738
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,594
the definition happening
with the painted part

739
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:27,828
of the makeup.

740
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:29,297
I think that we needed
to see more of.

741
00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:33,401
It's just too much of the
classic evil-joker look to it.

742
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:35,603
I agree.

743
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:37,805
Damien, thank you very much.
Please step back.

744
00:36:41,843 --> 00:36:44,545
Sasha, you're up.

745
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:57,325
Sasha, tell us
about your makeup, please.

746
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,561
My fear was
old porcelain dolls.

747
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,531
I took a different approach
with not making a clown.

748
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:07,802
I made a doll, and I painted
the clown face on.

749
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:10,271
I absolutely adore it.

750
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:11,973
Thank you.

751
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:13,341
I like the cracks.

752
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:16,711
I love the highlights
on the lips and on the nose,

753
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:20,648
but best of all,
the dolly plugs in the hair--

754
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:23,651
- absolutely brilliant.
- Thank you.

755
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:25,052
It's beautiful.

756
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:26,354
It's the overall silhouette

757
00:37:26,388 --> 00:37:29,357
that gives you a strong,
memorable character.

758
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:31,325
Thank you so much.

759
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,027
The way
that you applied the paint

760
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:34,428
to the doll-shaped face

761
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:37,431
fulfills the clown aspect
without going over the top

762
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:40,268
and still makes it feel
like a creepy antique doll.

763
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,203
Thank you so much.

764
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:45,006
Sasha, please step down.

765
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,313
- Good job.
- Thank you.

766
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:53,547
All right, guys,

767
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:55,383
the judges have heard
what you have to say.

768
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:57,718
Please head back to the makeup
room while they deliberate.

769
00:37:57,753 --> 00:38:00,721
Thank you.

770
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:05,893
All right, judges,

771
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:07,995
let's start with some
of the looks you liked the most.

772
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,030
How about Dina's work?

773
00:38:09,064 --> 00:38:10,865
I really love
everything about it.

774
00:38:10,899 --> 00:38:13,567
I like the wounds, and I like
the contrast between one side

775
00:38:13,602 --> 00:38:14,902
of the face and the other.

776
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,737
I also think
that the paint application

777
00:38:16,772 --> 00:38:18,239
was handled extraordinarily well

778
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:22,310
because it felt like a real
horror prosthetic makeup.

779
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:23,411
Yeah.

780
00:38:23,445 --> 00:38:24,779
All right,
let's move on to Cig.

781
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:26,547
Ugh.
A dark water clown?

782
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:29,250
That's extraordinarily difficult
to concept out,

783
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:30,751
and it's all there.

784
00:38:30,786 --> 00:38:35,156
The exposed skin so clearly
reads as a waterlogged corpse.

785
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,560
That melted makeup
was beautifully handled.

786
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:42,330
It's really gorgeous
from the profile as well.

787
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:43,731
All right, how about Sasha?

788
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:46,300
The technical work
not only in the sculpt

789
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:50,471
but in the painting-- I mean,
that's beautifully painted.

790
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,807
She did such a good job
with a makeup

791
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:54,208
that I've seen done
many, many times.

792
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:55,643
That's phenomenal.

793
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:58,212
She felt she was taking
a risk by putting clown makeup

794
00:38:58,246 --> 00:38:59,714
on the doll.

795
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:02,183
That's exactly the decision
making that wins challenges.

796
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,517
All right, judges,

797
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,886
let's move on to the looks
you liked the least.

798
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:07,855
Let's start with Drew.

799
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,024
This one failed miserably,
in my opinion.

800
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,460
The eyes should go up
the side of the head,

801
00:39:12,494 --> 00:39:15,963
and the nose is one of the worst
noses on a makeup ever.

802
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:18,566
Unless we knew it was a spider,

803
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,867
there's nothing there

804
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:21,502
that would give you
that information.

805
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:23,204
We got too many things
happening,

806
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:25,873
and therefore, we can't figure
out what it's supposed to be.

807
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:27,575
All right, let's move on
to Damien.

808
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:31,545
It is the lowest-hanging fruit
imaginable in the clown

809
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,813
department of makeup.

810
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:34,415
It's the elongated chin.

811
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:37,418
It's just so uninspired.

812
00:39:37,452 --> 00:39:39,854
It was as if he had thrown
it all together,

813
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:42,790
and at this point
in the competition...

814
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:44,892
- That's right.
- ...that's no place to be.

815
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:47,395
All right, then, judges,
have you made your decisions?

816
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,764
- Yes.
- Let's bring them back out.

817
00:39:57,806 --> 00:40:00,674
All right, Glenn.
Tell us about the top looks.

818
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:03,911
Dina, we loved the way
that you juxtaposed

819
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,980
fantasy over realism.

820
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:09,483
Cig, your clown
and that paint job of yours

821
00:40:09,518 --> 00:40:11,152
was absolutely phenomenal, man.

822
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:12,486
Awesome.

823
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:16,757
Sasha, your decision
to explore a different path

824
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:19,126
was clearly worth the risk.

825
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:21,629
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge?

826
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:24,932
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

827
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:32,289
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge?

828
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:35,125
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

829
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:39,763
Sasha.

830
00:40:41,966 --> 00:40:44,134
You took a big creative risk
tonight,

831
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:46,804
and you delivered
an outstanding makeup.

832
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:49,339
Thank you for reminding us
why we saved you.

833
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:51,742
- Well done.
- Thank you so much.

834
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:53,110
I won the challenge.

835
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:55,446
This is one of the best days
of my life.

836
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,115
I have so much more confidence
in my skills,

837
00:40:58,149 --> 00:41:00,851
and I feel like I belong here.

838
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:02,686
Sasha, congratulations.

839
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:05,522
You, Dina, and Cig can head
back to the makeup room.

840
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,832
Unfortunately, that means
the two of you

841
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:16,467
are on the bottom this week.

842
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:19,703
One of you will be eliminated.

843
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:22,172
Please step forward.

844
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:30,714
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

845
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:33,584
Drew, some of the paint work
was actually quite good,

846
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:36,787
but the design, particularly
in the center of the face,

847
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:38,856
was just far too busy.

848
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,891
Damien, you did
some cool painting,

849
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:43,560
but there was nothing
that really surprised

850
00:41:43,595 --> 00:41:45,696
or intrigued us
about your makeup.

851
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,431
So who is going home tonight?

852
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:50,200
The person going home
tonight is...

853
00:41:52,437 --> 00:41:54,371
Damien.

854
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:56,707
It was just too expected
of an approach

855
00:41:56,741 --> 00:42:00,778
for a challenge that begged
for out-of-the-box thinking.

856
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:04,314
Damien, I am so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

857
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:05,949
It means, Drew,
you are safe this week

858
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:07,885
and can head back
to the makeup room.

859
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,287
Thank you.

860
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:15,526
Damien, I hope you find

861
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,194
that this experience
has been encouraging,

862
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:19,363
because the three of us
have really enjoyed your work.

863
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:20,831
Thank you.

864
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:23,367
Damien, it's been so great
having you here with us.

865
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,169
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

866
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:26,236
and pack up your kit.

867
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:27,371
Thanks, guys.

868
00:42:27,405 --> 00:42:28,438
- Good luck to you.
- Good luck.

869
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:29,807
Take care.

870
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:32,109
I really expected to do
a lot better this challenge,

871
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:33,744
but I made it this far,

872
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:37,581
so I can't really
be upset about that.

873
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:40,950
- Clowns sent me home.
- No...

874
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:44,473
Competing along side these
other artists has meant the world to me.

875
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,633
This has been
a complete blessing.

876
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:50,681
I feel even more capable than
I did when I first came here.

877
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:52,414
So, I'm really excited
to go home and

878
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:55,332
make my dream of
doing this every day come true.
