1
00:00:00,885 --> 00:00:02,553
This is great thinking.

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:05,155
I'm not particularly fond
of this makeup.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,057
Sleeping with the fishes.

4
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,859
Previously on <i>Face Off,</i>

5
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:10,460
the 14 surviving artists
teamed up

6
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:13,130
for their first
spotlight challenge.

7
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:15,299
Cig's outlandish tuna
brought him his first win...

8
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,600
Thank you.

9
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:21,038
...but Barry's creative flaws
sent him packing.

10
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:23,106
Now 13 artists remain.

11
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:25,976
And tonight, they will take
monumental inspiration

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,945
to create
out-of-this-world makeup.

13
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:29,379
That's right. Aliens.

14
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:30,647
Yes.

15
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:32,416
My brain is like, "Yeah."

16
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,017
I've never seen
anything like this.

17
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:36,153
But some will never
even get off the ground.

18
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:37,754
Well, that's
your first mistake.

19
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,456
And I'm just at a standstill.

20
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,892
In the end, only one
will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,527
from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

22
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,897
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:48,765
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,183
and $100,000.

25
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:55,657
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

27
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:36,413
Looks like a spaceship.

28
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:39,716
We're walking
by this gigantic pyramid,

29
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,351
which is really cool.

30
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:45,923
We see Glenn and McKenzie, so we
have no idea what to expect.

31
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:47,024
Hey, guys.

32
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:48,725
- Hey.
- Hey, McKenzie.

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,460
Welcome to the Walter Pyramid

34
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:53,764
at California State University
Long Beach.

35
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:55,032
For centuries,

36
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:57,434
historians, architects,
and engineers have marveled

37
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,203
at incredibly advanced
ancient wonders,

38
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:02,372
like the Pyramids of Giza
and Stonehenge,

39
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:03,907
which were built
long before the age

40
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:05,142
of modern
construction techniques.

41
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:08,512
While most experts insist

42
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,948
that these remarkable structures
were manmade,

43
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:13,083
others are convinced that
something not of this world

44
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:15,519
must have had a hand
in their creation.

45
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,454
That's right. Aliens.

46
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:18,655
- Oh.
- Yes.

47
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,825
My brain is like, "Yeah."

48
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:24,160
I imagine aliens just as
silly and awful as we are.

49
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,563
So I'm all about it.

50
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:29,232
While this theme has been
explored in movies like <i>Stargate</i>

51
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,334
and<i> Indiana Jones And The</i>
<i>Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull,</i>

52
00:02:31,369 --> 00:02:34,137
alien theorists take
the theme a step further,

53
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,007
suggesting that
these extraterrestrial visitors

54
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,509
may have also left clues
about their own civilizations

55
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:41,478
within these ancient constructs.

56
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:45,282
For your first individual
spotlight challenge,

57
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:47,684
you will select
an ancient construct

58
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:51,087
to inspire
your very own alien creation.

59
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:52,155
Yes.

60
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,558
Aliens are a tall order

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,927
for one person to do
in 2 1/2 days.

62
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,161
All right, let's take a look

63
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,596
at the ancient sites
and cultures

64
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,731
that you all have
to choose from.

65
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:05,035
We have the Giza Necropolis
in Egypt,

66
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:06,770
Easter Island
in the South Pacific,

67
00:03:06,804 --> 00:03:10,540
Stonehenge in England,
Machu Picchu in Peru,

68
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:12,309
Pyramid Of The Sun in Mexico,

69
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:15,145
Peruvudaiyar Kovil Temple
in India,

70
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:16,680
and Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

71
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:18,381
Yes.

72
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,418
All right, guys, once
you've decided on a location,

73
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,886
you can stay here
to work on your designs.

74
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,989
When you're done, head back
to the lab and get to work.

75
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:27,190
See you later.
Good luck.

76
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:28,426
Thank you.

77
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:34,931
I'm here on<i> Face Off</i>
to kick-start my career,

78
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,567
so I'm really, really gonna
try to push myself creatively

79
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:39,135
to come up
with really cool ideas.

80
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,271
I choose the Giza Necropolis
in Egypt.

81
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,773
The aliens
that I'm creating are dying,

82
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,575
so they decide to pass on
all their information

83
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,077
to the Egyptians
so that their way of life

84
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,244
doesn't just die with them.

85
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,479
Then the pyramids were built

86
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:50,981
to emulate
the way the alien looked.

87
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:54,284
So I really want to keep
a really sharp, angular design

88
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,320
to really make it pop
and speak out as Egyptian.

89
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:59,356
So I got Angkor Wat.

90
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,858
Since Angkor Wat is dedicated
to Lord Vishnu,

91
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:05,295
a Hindu deity, I'm gonna
sculpt my interpretation

92
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,064
with a blue exo suit
with two extra arms,

93
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,500
but I'm definitely
biting off a lot,

94
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:15,772
so hopefully it
doesn't bite me in the ass.

95
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:20,143
I selected Peruvudaiyar,
and Lord Shiva is depicted

96
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,847
throughout the structure
with a closed third eye.

97
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:26,683
So my alien is
Lord Shiva's mate,

98
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,220
and Lord Shiva starts
mating with all the natives.

99
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:34,524
My alien gets very angry,
and she opens her third eye,

100
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:38,094
turns them all to stone,
and erects Peruvudaiyar

101
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:40,830
as a warning to never
mate with the natives.

102
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:49,572
The construct that I chose
was Easter Island.

103
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:52,509
The Moai statues are known
for having fish lips.

104
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,577
So I'm gonna go
with this fish-type alien.

105
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:57,347
I think I'm gonna own
this challenge,

106
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,110
and it's gonna be
really fun to do.

107
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,554
So I've picked Machu Picchu.

108
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:08,058
I'm thinking
this telepathic race of aliens

109
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:11,127
that communicate
through frequencies.

110
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:14,164
So this alien
is gonna have a long beak.

111
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,132
So I need to make
a giant headpiece

112
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,302
and a modest face piece.

113
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,207
I am doing the Giza Necropolis.

114
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,676
I envision my character
as the princess

115
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:28,511
of an alien royal family,

116
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:31,715
and I'm going to incorporate
a feline aesthetic

117
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,617
into my alien because I see
a lot of those elements

118
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:37,420
in Egyptian artwork.

119
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:40,256
This will be the first time
I've ever had to do something

120
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:45,729
so grand by myself,
so I am definitely nervous.

121
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,865
Hey, guys,
let's go back to the lab.

122
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,975
We get to the lab,
and we have five hours

123
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:02,445
to get started
on our alien makeup.

124
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,314
I'm a giant nerd,
and I get to make aliens,

125
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:07,717
and I'm super stoked.

126
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,219
I choose the Pyramid Of The Sun

127
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,520
because I've actually
been there,

128
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,589
and I feel like that
would give me an advantage.

129
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:16,860
My concept for my alien
is based on one

130
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:19,662
of the Aztec gods associated
with the Pyramid Of The Sun,

131
00:06:19,697 --> 00:06:20,630
Quetzalcoatl.

132
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:23,666
He is a snakelike god
with feathers,

133
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:28,772
and it will translate really
well into an alien society.

134
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,341
First thing I do
is start sculpting the cowl.

135
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,444
Since I love India
and I choose Peruvudaiyar,

136
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,248
I decide to blend
Indian culture into my alien.

137
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:40,183
So I'm gonna incorporate
the building's wavy shapes

138
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:42,218
into the cowl.

139
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,687
I'm trying to work with
the features of my model's face

140
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:48,591
and do a very aesthetically
pleasing shape to the head.

141
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,565
Where is he gonna see out of?

142
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,101
He's gonna have eyeholes
covered up with a pattern

143
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,669
that resembles
what the Polynesians wear.

144
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:01,604
- Oh, cool.
- I chose Easter Island.

145
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,306
These aliens taught
the Polynesians

146
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,308
that working together,
you get a lot more done.

147
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,077
So the Polynesians erected
these statues

148
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:09,412
that look like the aliens

149
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,114
as a thank-you
for what they taught them.

150
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:13,383
I'm going to change
the proportions of the head

151
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,919
by making the nose longer,
flattening the forehead,

152
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:18,655
and making the jaw huger,
so my alien will resemble

153
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,757
the look
of an Easter Island statue.

154
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:21,991
That looks fun.

155
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,214
I like it.

156
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,298
I think the biggest thing
is I don't want it

157
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:29,599
to look like a dinosaur.

158
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,767
No, your concept's solid, man.

159
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,835
It's awesome.

160
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:32,869
I end up getting Stonehenge.

161
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:36,339
So my concept is
an aquatic alien who convinces

162
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,375
the locals to build her
this magic temple.

163
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,744
I definitely want to go,
like, older woman.

164
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,313
I'm thinking
about a face piece and a cowl.

165
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:46,416
I'm hoping that I'm gonna
have time for hands,

166
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,750
but I'm not banking on it.

167
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,119
I have to say
my favorite alien is Predator.

168
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:51,988
It is pretty awesome.

169
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,524
My ancient structure
is also Stonehenge,

170
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,193
and the movie<i> Predator</i> has
that warrior type of tone,

171
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:59,796
which I love about<i> aliens.</i>

172
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,997
I'm thinking well, maybe
I could utilize some of that

173
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,732
to make my character
more barbaric,

174
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,933
more humanoid.

175
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,669
Just create the monsters, dude.
Take that.

176
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:13,543
Hello, everybody.

177
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,944
- We're here to check on you.
- Hello.

178
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:15,945
- How are you?
- Hi.

179
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,180
- Hi, Dina.
- Hi.

180
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:18,348
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

181
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:19,616
- Hi, how are you?
- Good to see you.

182
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,251
Okay, so tell us
what you picked.

183
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,219
I picked Pyramid Of The Sun.

184
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:26,789
The people who built the temple
built it for the Sun god,

185
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:29,492
and he carries fire on his head.

186
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:33,329
So instead of having my alien
hold a fire above his head,

187
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:34,964
it will be
a mind-control device.

188
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,299
I'd also go ahead

189
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,534
and give yourself
a small piece down here,

190
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,670
just to be able
to carry your texture.

191
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,739
- Okay.
- Why did you pick Machu Picchu?

192
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,375
Machu Picchu's just
a very interesting location.

193
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:48,578
Machu Picchu was built
for the Incan god of creation,

194
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,980
and I wanted to incorporate
elements of that god

195
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,582
into my alien design.

196
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,051
They're said to have a headpiece
that's like a sun,

197
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,220
so I was gonna cut
this top piece off,

198
00:08:57,254 --> 00:08:58,755
put some LEDs and stuff
underneath.

199
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,690
It should represent sunlight.

200
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,225
What we did
on The Borg Queen was

201
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,827
we literally picked out foam
from the inside

202
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:08,197
almost to the surface
and laid LEDs in there

203
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,165
and siliconed them in.

204
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:10,466
Great idea.

205
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,467
Let me turn this a little bit,
so I can see it.

206
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:12,702
Okay.

207
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,170
The construct that I chose
was Easter Island.

208
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,472
So I'm thinking
go with something amphibian,

209
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:17,840
like sympathetic,
older creature

210
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,609
from another water planet.

211
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,278
Okay.
I don't feel Easter Island.

212
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,180
Okay.

213
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:25,181
This was my vision
from the get-go,

214
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,050
and now I'm just confused.

215
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:30,420
These images here
were made by the people

216
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,221
in the semblance of their god.

217
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:35,024
If they saw this guy,
they wouldn't be making these.

218
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,960
I have no idea what to do.

219
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:40,697
I'm just extremely worried.

220
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:42,231
Coming up...

221
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm not saying,
"Don't listen to Mr. Westmore."

222
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:46,336
I should go out
this way, right?

223
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,271
I don't really know
how to do this.

224
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:52,175
- This is very unsuccessful.
- I love it.

225
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,634
I don't feel Easter Island.

226
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:01,102
I'd really get in

227
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:02,470
and do a little bit rethinking
on the nose and the brow ridge.

228
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:03,638
Okay.

229
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:06,608
I just think it should
be maybe a little higher.

230
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:08,209
I would maybe fill this in.

231
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:09,644
Bring your lower lip out
a little bit.

232
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:11,779
But it could be a little flatter.

233
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:13,081
It's day one
of the alien challenge,

234
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,483
and Mr. Westmore has
a bunch of different changes

235
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:16,985
that he thinks I should make,

236
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,753
and that takes all the wind
out of my sails.

237
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:20,955
I'm really confused.

238
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,423
I don't want to go
against what Mr. Westmore says,

239
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,692
but I didn't want
to go too literal.

240
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,694
So now I have to regroup
and figure out

241
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:29,330
how I'm gonna save this makeup.

242
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:32,400
There's a bull
that guards this tower,

243
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:35,103
and he's got this big,
ornate neck piece on.

244
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:36,204
So I was thinking of doing that

245
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,306
but starting it at her lip.

246
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,607
That would be great.

247
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:40,808
My concern is

248
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:42,644
she's not gonna be able
to move her neck.

249
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:46,180
When you get this piece out,
from the back side,

250
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:47,982
you tear out
some ridges across it,

251
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,817
and that allows them
to do this.

252
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:50,885
Okay.

253
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,921
I am creating an alien queen.

254
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:57,325
I've been utilizing
Nefertiti's headdress.

255
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,127
- It's a good profile.
- Thank you.

256
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:01,796
Yeah, but what's really
going to make this for you

257
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,964
is gonna be your paint job.

258
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:04,632
So make sure you leave yourself
enough time...

259
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:05,967
Absolutely.

260
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,969
...to really do
a beautiful paint job.

261
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:10,238
I'm really excited that
Mr. Westmore has come in

262
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:12,373
because he is really
the king of aliens.

263
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,842
He's worked
on so many<i> Star Treks,</i>

264
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:16,110
it's ridiculous.

265
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:18,846
So I cannot be more excited
to get his input,

266
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:21,215
and I'm definitely
gonna be taking his advice.

267
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,151
All right, we're heading out,
everybody.

268
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:26,587
- Good luck, to everybody.
- Thank you.

269
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:36,364
I look around the room,
and I'm super nervous

270
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:38,266
because this is the first time
I've ever sculpted a cowl,

271
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,902
and it just looks
so much smaller and wimpier

272
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,537
than everyone else's.

273
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,905
Damn.

274
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:44,906
He's crazy.

275
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,407
Oh, I know.

276
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:47,575
I'm hoping that
it's just my nerves,

277
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:51,179
so I'm just gonna keep going.

278
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:53,114
Mold, mold, mold, mold,
mold, mold, mold.

279
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:54,349
So I finish up my face
fairly quickly.

280
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:56,818
I have only about an hour
left in the day

281
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:57,952
to start molding it.

282
00:11:57,987 --> 00:11:59,454
I would just really like
to get this out tonight,

283
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:01,556
so I have something
to go off of tomorrow.

284
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,124
It's only me and Rachael
back in the mold room

285
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,559
getting our faces molded.

286
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,127
♪ I'm a-molding,
I'm a-molding ♪

287
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,795
So I'm feeling like I'm in
a really good spot for the day.

288
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,163
I feel like I'm kind of ahead,

289
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:10,498
and I like the direction
that it's going.

290
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,899
I like having the face done
on the first day.

291
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:14,268
It feels good.

292
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,841
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

293
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,843
I'm not saying,
"Don't listen to Mr. Westmore,"

294
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,911
'cause obviously
that's always a bad idea.

295
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:25,513
Yeah, I know.

296
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:28,416
But I think just taking it
super literally and putting

297
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,652
an Easter Island head
on a dude is gonna be weird.

298
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,755
I'm trying to walk
that fine line

299
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:37,225
between what Mr. Westmore said
but still keep my own concept,

300
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,060
and I'm just at a standstill.

301
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:43,831
- You think this looks wonky?
- Uh...

302
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:45,366
I think--
I don't know.

303
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:47,402
I have no idea what
I'm gonna do at this point.

304
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,003
And every time
I look up to the clock,

305
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:50,304
it's just burning and burning,

306
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,241
and I realize I'm just
wasting too much time.

307
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,943
I've got to refigure out
the cowl, finish it off,

308
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:59,113
and at least get the face
where I'm happy with it.

309
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:08,122
Time is winding down,
and the more I sculpt,

310
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:11,092
the more I'm just having a hard
time seeing the character.

311
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:14,695
I think the scales
have tipped a little bit

312
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,198
on my confidence level.

313
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:21,102
- Okay, guys, it's time!
- Whoo!

314
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,404
That will have to wait
till tomorrow.

315
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:25,440
At the end of the day,
I'm really kind of concerned

316
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:28,242
because I've already been
bottom look,

317
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:29,410
and I'm just not feeling
so great about this.

318
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:31,112
I need some time
to step away from it

319
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:35,583
and just get my thoughts
together and come back.

320
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,326
It's day two
of our alien challenge,

321
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,661
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab,

322
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,996
and I have the opportunity
to get a set of fresh eyes

323
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:50,231
on my sculpture.

324
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm feeling
more confident today.

325
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:53,601
So I change out the nose,

326
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:56,104
and I've got the mouth
turned down a little further,

327
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:57,438
like Mr. Westmore had wanted.

328
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:58,739
So it's kind of
less fish-like

329
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,141
what I had
originally anticipated,

330
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:02,844
but I really can't spend
any more time on the face

331
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:04,178
when I need
to also give attention

332
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:08,416
to the cowl
and get two molds finished.

333
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,457
I start sculpting out
the neck piece,

334
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:19,360
and I know that I don't
have enough time to sculpt

335
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,762
individual jewels
into this piece.

336
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:26,467
So I find whatever jewelry
I can in the lab,

337
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:29,237
and I push them all
into the neck piece,

338
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:30,705
just so I know how
it's all laid out,

339
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,773
and I know exactly
where to put them back

340
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:36,577
once I get this face done.

341
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:43,784
I finally finish sculpting,
and I realize doing a mold

342
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,954
as big as I have to do is crazy.

343
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,524
I'm really nervous
about this mold.

344
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:52,693
I think my sculpture was at
a good place maybe an hour ago,

345
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:55,463
and I'm a little pissed at
myself for not molding earlier,

346
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:58,533
so I am trying to mold
as quickly as possible.

347
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:04,071
- Left side, right side.
- Oh, yeah.

348
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,107
Definitely a lot better.

349
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:07,375
Today, I feel really good.

350
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,943
I'm feeling better
about my concept.

351
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,411
As I'm sculpting
the chest and the back,

352
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,280
I see more of the creature
coming out.

353
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:15,082
He's alien, but I wanted
to create the anatomy

354
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:17,919
where it's just a touch
out of the humanistic realm.

355
00:15:17,953 --> 00:15:19,053
I was like, "No belly button.

356
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,888
That means
you are definitely an alien."

357
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:22,056
I'm feeling
really confident now.

358
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,224
I can work with this.

359
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:25,793
- Looks good.
- Cool. Thanks.

360
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,267
So I finish
my first cowl sculpt,

361
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:36,571
and I'm gonna go start
my first two-piece cowl mold.

362
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,610
I really have not that much
experience making molds,

363
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:43,945
so I'm completely confused.

364
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,813
I should go out
this way, right?

365
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:47,615
Yeah.

366
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:51,485
I don't really know
how to do this.

367
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,423
And I'm starting to panic.

368
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,976
It's day two
of our alien challenge,

369
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:04,179
and I'm doing
my first cowl mold.

370
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,215
I should go out
this way, right?

371
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:07,416
Yeah.

372
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,421
But I don't really know
how to do this.

373
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:15,558
I feel like I can pick up
on things really fast,

374
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:19,094
so Dina seems like
she's done this before,

375
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:22,932
and I just start doing
exactly what she's doing.

376
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:28,037
And I'm just gonna
hope for the best.

377
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,172
I go and I pop my face mold,

378
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,807
start cleaning it out.

379
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,677
I stipple in a bunch of latex,
let that dry.

380
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:37,513
I pull it out, and then I have
kind of a Halloween mask

381
00:16:37,547 --> 00:16:39,615
so I can lay that up
onto the face

382
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,216
that my cowl is sculpted on,

383
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,485
and I can make sure that
all my lines that I designed

384
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,089
are gonna line up correctly.

385
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:49,191
I'm a firm believer that aliens

386
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,393
should have no human features,

387
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,462
because fingers look
like a human in makeup.

388
00:16:53,496 --> 00:16:56,432
I have this idea
to do basically squid hands.

389
00:16:56,466 --> 00:17:01,537
So I cut this L200 foam
in certain shapes,

390
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:02,771
and it looks great.

391
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:15,784
So I sit down,
and I try to open the mold.

392
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,686
I'm down there on the floor.

393
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:19,121
I'm tugging on it.

394
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:20,923
Don't know if this mold's
even gonna open.

395
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,794
How's it going, Sasha?

396
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,429
Yay!

397
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,965
It finally opened,
so I'm actually feeling

398
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,066
a lot more confident.

399
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:35,638
- 19 minutes!
- Okay.

400
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:38,540
It's hard to run
with heavy things in your hands.

401
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,981
So I see most of the people
are running around

402
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,783
trying to get
their cowl molds done,

403
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:51,553
and...

404
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:54,990
I'm basically getting ready
for tomorrow's application.

405
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:58,160
I'm trying
to mentally get there.

406
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,629
I think if I have
a better plan,

407
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,831
it will be better for me.

408
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:07,670
And I won't have to be running
around like a crazy person.

409
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:14,276
I really want to give
this character four arms

410
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,512
because Lord Vishnu
always has four arms.

411
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:20,215
So I get the idea
to joint the arms,

412
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,852
and I'm gonna use monofilament
and attach it to his wrists,

413
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,487
so when he raises his arm,

414
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,289
the arm would raise
with his arm.

415
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,981
Yay, they work.

416
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:34,163
Everybody, that's time.

417
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,198
Coming off a win,

418
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,599
I feel like the judges
are expecting more of me.

419
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:39,978
So I want to make sure
I don't disappoint.

420
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,378
So it's application day.

421
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:50,546
We've got four hours in the lab

422
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,823
and one hour in last looks.

423
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:57,486
How's everybody's stuff look?

424
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,887
It's mostly fine.

425
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:01,023
My foam came out beautiful.

426
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,591
I have no problems.

427
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,491
It's all coming together.

428
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:09,131
All right.

429
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:10,365
Hey, how's it going?

430
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
- Iris.
- Jason.

431
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:13,335
So you're gonna be an alien.

432
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,004
We have
a pretty bad situation here,

433
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,239
not good at all.

434
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:19,775
I had a really big plan
for application,

435
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,278
but my foam chest piece,
it's just bad.

436
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:25,147
Not doing so well right now.

437
00:19:25,181 --> 00:19:27,316
The foam has
collapsed on itself,

438
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,751
so it has these air pockets
just sitting there.

439
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:30,419
This is gnarly.

440
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:31,320
So I have to figure out how
to salvage this chest piece.

441
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:33,255
This is part of my character.

442
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,970
I need to have this chest.

443
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:40,062
You look like an alien,
I swear to God.

444
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:41,950
Keep going, keep going.
Almost there.

445
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,300
_

446
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,267
I start applying, and
my only concern at this point

447
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,136
is that the cowl
is a little big,

448
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,004
so he's got
this large, bulbous head,

449
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:50,939
which isn't quite the look
I was going for,

450
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:52,875
but I know I can leave it loose

451
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:55,544
and then glue it down
in last looks.

452
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,985
All right, let's start
putting this on your face.

453
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,117
Whoo!

454
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:05,420
I decide to go with a yellow
and green color scheme

455
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,955
because usually
the dangerous snakes have

456
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,123
the brightest colors.

457
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:09,658
So I do my base color,

458
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:12,427
and then I airbrushed
some detail signs.

459
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,429
And then I used a stencil
to get the green patterning

460
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,932
on the skin, and I really
like the direction

461
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,934
that it's headed in.

462
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,704
I start painting,
and then I realize

463
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:24,306
how much work I have to do.

464
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,442
It's a big piece.
It's 360 degrees around.

465
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,346
So I just let the colors fly.

466
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:37,286
A lot of Egyptian artwork,
it's lots of golds and blues,

467
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,154
so I really want to stick
to those colors.

468
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:42,324
So I start painting my piece,
basing out with gold,

469
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:43,859
which I'm really,
really happy with.

470
00:20:43,893 --> 00:20:45,727
You are golden, literally.

471
00:20:45,762 --> 00:20:48,597
I get some of the blue put on,

472
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:51,600
and it's starting to get
kind of muddied up.

473
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:53,468
So I try going back
to kind of cover up

474
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,605
with a little bit of gold,
but it's not really helping.

475
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:58,407
So I'm really
stressing on my paint job,

476
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:00,309
and it's too late to turn back.

477
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,578
- What's the time?
- 1:16.

478
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:05,280
All right.

479
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,921
This is just trashed.

480
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:15,657
I spend three hours just trying
to patch and fix this thing,

481
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:18,093
and my paint,
I have to kind of sacrifice.

482
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:21,196
Everything that could
go wrong is going wrong.

483
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:24,466
30 minutes, guys!

484
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,809
That's time, guys!

485
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:35,644
- Ooh.
- Hoo!

486
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:36,812
All right, let's go.

487
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,180
My heart's just falling.

488
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,983
It's kind of like watching
the car crash happening

489
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,986
while you're in the car.

490
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:45,004
When I have to try to pull
a really good paintjob

491
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:47,579
to salvage this piece, but,
things aren't looking good.

492
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,760
Coming up...

493
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,296
I get my airbrush out,
and it's completely clogged.

494
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,531
It's gonna take a miracle
for me to be safe.

495
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,267
This is
a beautiful-looking piece.

496
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:00,469
Did you get lost time-wise?

497
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:03,138
It's really quite remarkable.

498
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,030
- Let's go to work!
- Where my alien at?

499
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:14,900
We have one hour at last looks,

500
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,635
and I get my airbrush out.

501
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,071
Oh, come on, airbrush.

502
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,739
And it's completely clogged.

503
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,741
So I start hand-painting it.

504
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,454
Just making it work.

505
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,281
I try and spatter
some black on him,

506
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,715
you know, kind of break up
some of the gray.

507
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,250
Turn your arm over.

508
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,586
Everything that I would see
on the statues is there,

509
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,455
but I'm still on the fence
with how it's gonna look

510
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:37,706
to the judges.

511
00:22:40,894 --> 00:22:41,860
I'm gonna attempt
to put this thing

512
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:43,295
on the front of you.

513
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,897
I put the costume on,
and it's a little bit better.

514
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,199
It helps hide
some of my mistakes,

515
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:48,967
but not all of them.
It's just a gnarled mess.

516
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:52,805
It's gonna take a miracle
for me to be safe.

517
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:56,375
I stick on the bindi,
and I hang chains from her nose.

518
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,145
It looks alien-like,
and it looks Indian-like,

519
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,182
so I'm pleased.

520
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:11,890
This side is just
not staying down.

521
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:19,932
All right, guys, it's time!

522
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,500
Yeah!

523
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:23,435
Whoo!

524
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,947
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

525
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,949
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

526
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:39,918
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges.

527
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,453
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

528
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,654
Glenn Hetrick.

529
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,257
- Good evening, guys.
- Hi, Glenn.

530
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,459
A big welcome back
to Oscar and Emmy-winning

531
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:48,694
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

532
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:49,928
I missed you last week, guys.

533
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:51,563
I can't wait to see
what you have for us.

534
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,031
We missed you too.

535
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:55,767
Say hello to creature and
concept designer Neville Page.

536
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,436
- Hello.
- Hi, Neville.

537
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,838
And Oscar-winning
makeup artist Lois Burwell.

538
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,206
Good evening, everyone.

539
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:02,841
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi.

540
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,109
All right, guys.

541
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:07,613
This week, your first individual
spotlight challenge

542
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,382
was to choose an ancient wonder
and create the alien species

543
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,683
who might have helped build it.

544
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,887
Let's take a look
at your otherworldly beings.

545
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,843
The paint's not really
popping like I want it to,

546
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,811
but there's a lot of things
I like about it.

547
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:43,248
I'm really hoping
I'm safe at this point.

548
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,998
His overall presence
is really cool.

549
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:02,267
I'm really proud
of my prosthetic.

550
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:05,304
Hopefully, that'll
be enough to save me.

551
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,456
I'm not really happy at all.

552
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,892
I really hope the judges see
the amount of time I put in

553
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:30,929
to try to make this thing work.

554
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,913
It's exactly
what I pictured in my head,

555
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,182
but I think the wardrobe

556
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:54,152
might have been
a little too crazy.

557
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:12,471
I look at my character,
and he looks pretty cool.

558
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:16,375
It's kind of creepy and, like,
very, very alien to me.

559
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,958
I'm proud of it.

560
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,260
I think she looks beautiful.

561
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:37,896
I created exactly
what I wanted to see.

562
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,346
She looks amazing.

563
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,383
I was able to show
what I'm truly capable of.

564
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,501
I think it's pretty cool.

565
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:19,004
This totally looks like
an alien that could've inspired

566
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,008
the creation of Angkor Wat.

567
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:41,726
I wish I had given her
a prop, but overall,

568
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:45,197
I'm impressed with the amount
of stuff I got done.

569
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,546
I really like
how she looks overall.

570
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:07,079
Hopefully, the judges notice
all the work I put into it.

571
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,236
I'm not super happy with it.

572
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,505
It's not what I envisioned,
but at this point,

573
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,674
I'm just hoping for the best.

574
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,760
I'm not 100% happy with my
paint job and some of my forms,

575
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:52,664
but with the time that I had,
I'm proud of it.

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,282
I took a risk
by going very minimal,

577
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:13,785
and I'm hoping that
the judges think less is more.

578
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,661
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look at our aliens?

579
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:33,071
- Look at that edge.
- Yeah, wow.

580
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,439
There's a lot more paint
on the body

581
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,740
than there is the face.

582
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,242
There's not really
a focal point.

583
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,277
We have to ask
where it comes from.

584
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:42,314
Okay.

585
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,916
He got a little crazy
with sponges and maybe

586
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,085
a stencil or something.

587
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,839
He kind of ruined it
with the paint.

588
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,200
_

589
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,925
I'm nervous that
my incomplete paint job is going

590
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,628
to kick me in the balls,
and I'm gonna end up going home

591
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,130
because of it.

592
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,832
What do you think
of tonight's designs?

593
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:04,169
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

594
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,906
He ruined it with the paint.

595
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,207
I'm freaked out.

596
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,276
All the parts came together
except the paint job.

597
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,980
At this point, I'm worried
that I could be sent home.

598
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,582
- I really love the mouth.
- Yeah, that's great.

599
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:19,050
Thank you.

600
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,753
It's using
the Egyptian headdress...

601
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:22,821
Mm-hmm.

602
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,689
...and the traditional
goatee shape.

603
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:26,558
I think that's very wise.

604
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:27,792
I love the reference.

605
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:30,996
Thank you.

606
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,230
This is cool.

607
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:35,567
There are some real
adventurous forms on this face.

608
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:39,137
- Yeah.
- I really love this collar.

609
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:46,178
It just doesn't feel
like this wise alien race.

610
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,680
It feels so sad and destroyed.

611
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,150
_

612
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,654
He's sparkly.

613
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:59,943
To put these shapes on the
face makes no sense whatsoever.

614
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:03,450
_

615
00:31:03,496 --> 00:31:06,665
Thank you.

616
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,900
It's terrific 'cause she has

617
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:10,635
such a nice, little,
narrow chin.

618
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,638
Just really helps that whole
shape really be very effective.

619
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,900
_

620
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,477
Continues the shape,
gives it femininity.

621
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:22,580
It does.
Come back around?

622
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:25,416
All right.

623
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,256
All right, the judges
have scored your creations,

624
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,557
so let's find out
what they thought.

625
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:36,794
Sasha, Doc,

626
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,264
Stella, Gwen,

627
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:45,770
Damien, Keaghlan,

628
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:48,272
you were the best
and the worst this week.

629
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,374
That means the rest of you
are safe and can head back

630
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,711
- to the makeup room.
- Thank you.

631
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,150
All right, the judges would
like to speak with each of you

632
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,352
to learn more about your work.

633
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,488
Sasha, you're up first.

634
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,161
Tell us about this character

635
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,964
and how your location
inspired your design choices.

636
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:13,998
This is Shiva.

637
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,266
She came to Earth

638
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,434
because she's
an animal species collector.

639
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,570
She built a shelter,
and when she left,

640
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:23,041
everyone used the shelter
as a temple and worshipped her.

641
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:25,476
It's really quite remarkable.

642
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:26,911
Thank you.

643
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:32,717
It is instantly recognizable
as having Indian influence,

644
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,285
and you kept the form
so nice and tight

645
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,921
to accentuate
those big, beautiful eyes.

646
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,322
Thank you so much.

647
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:42,260
I really compliment you
in regard to her head

648
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:46,330
because you created proportions
that feel not even achievable,

649
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,599
and I like that.

650
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,901
I love the use of the jewelry.

651
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:52,570
It's something that
obviously is traditional.

652
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:55,273
- Very wise choices.
- Thank you.

653
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:59,277
Sasha,
if you'd please step back.

654
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:06,184
Doc, you're up next.

655
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:12,590
Tell us how you let
the Moai statues

656
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,926
help you create
your alien today.

657
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,127
I wanted to create something

658
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,629
that alludes
to what the Moai statues are.

659
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,598
That's why he's got the kind of
squared off front of his head

660
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:23,401
and the longer face
and then the downturned mouth.

661
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,002
I'm sorry, Doc,
but I think this makeup

662
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,972
is very unsuccessful.

663
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,775
The paint job itself is
just completely monotone.

664
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,044
You've created this
sympathetic look that allows

665
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:35,146
your character to do nothing
but look sad.

666
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,848
And the sculpting
on the bottom of the face

667
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,584
is very strange
around the mouth.

668
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,353
You chose to cover the ears.

669
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,688
Why is that?

670
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:44,856
I wanted to go amphibian

671
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,124
with more
of a fish-type character.

672
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,793
It doesn't
communicate your intention,

673
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,428
so it feels concept-less.

674
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,630
Okay.

675
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,299
Doc, please step back.

676
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,074
All right, Stella, you're up.

677
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,245
Oh, God...

678
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:12,049
So tell us about the concept
and how the cultural influences

679
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,451
inspired your creation.

680
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:14,952
This is Lord Shiva's mate.

681
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,788
Shiva started to mate
with the natives,

682
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,556
and he had 250 sons,

683
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,292
and she was so angry with him

684
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:24,362
that she opened her third eye
and turned them all to stone

685
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,831
and erected this building
as a warning

686
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,333
to never mate
with the natives again.

687
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:32,069
You're doing some things
with forms

688
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:36,240
that just shouldn't work,
but it does.

689
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,942
The way you brought
the cheeks down

690
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:40,011
towards the corner of the mouth
is beautiful.

691
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:44,148
It is a very successful makeup
and character.

692
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,449
Thank you.

693
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:48,219
I like the color choice
of the contact lens.

694
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,656
I like the way you put henna
on the back of the hands,

695
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,724
and the collar is fantastic.

696
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:54,892
Thank you.

697
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,394
I've never seen
anything like this,

698
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,629
so I think you succeeded
on an extremely complex

699
00:34:58,664 --> 00:34:59,997
and advanced level.

700
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:01,599
Thank you so much.

701
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:05,236
Stella, please step back.

702
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,777
Gwen, please step forward.

703
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:18,883
Tell me about the concept

704
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,252
and what you're trying
to tell us.

705
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,054
When my character
came to Earth,

706
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,723
he gave the Viking people
mathematics, the Sun,

707
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,024
and Stonehenge.

708
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,894
The Viking people
showed him how to survive,

709
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,597
which made him more savage
the longer he stayed.

710
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:36,267
He looks pagan, not alien.

711
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,670
Did you get lost time-wise?

712
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:42,807
I spent a lot of the time
trying to patch and maintain

713
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:45,176
the chest piece
because I wanted to show

714
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,911
that he is
a little human-esque.

715
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,480
One of the worst decisions
you made was sculpting out

716
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,850
a whole chest and doing almost
nothing with it to tell us

717
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,919
that it's an alien.

718
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:59,557
With better use of color,
you could've salvaged it.

719
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:02,894
Gwen,
if you'd please step back.

720
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,901
Damien, please step up.

721
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:17,308
Please enlighten us as
to how you utilized the location

722
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,377
that you chose
to motivate your makeup.

723
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:23,247
So my alien finds Earth
and decides to give them

724
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,516
his knowledge,
and in honor of that,

725
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,353
humans decided to build
monuments in his likeness.

726
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,722
I think pulling the pyramid
shapes down onto the face

727
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:37,395
has no basis
in anatomical reality.

728
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,931
It's just rough forms
with color on it.

729
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,066
Damien, did you start
with the blue or the gold?

730
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,234
I started with the gold.

731
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,235
Well,
that's your first mistake.

732
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,703
You didn't start with a color.

733
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,338
You started with a highlight,

734
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,739
and I'm not really happy
with the blue.

735
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,242
I mean,
nothing looks organic on him.

736
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,544
I understand.

737
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:57,315
Damien, please step back.

738
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:03,220
Keaghlan, you're up.

739
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,662
Tell us how the pyramids
inspired your alien.

740
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:15,533
She landed on the planet
and brought the cat species,

741
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,170
and then her form inspired
the Egyptian culture

742
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,340
to adorn their royalty
with those features.

743
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:26,544
This makeup is much prettier
up close.

744
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,079
I love the way
you used the gold

745
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,680
and made really subtle accents.

746
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,415
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

747
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,450
Strong silhouette.

748
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,051
Even the subtle graphic
design of the pale face

749
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:36,454
to the yellows and oranges

750
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:38,322
within that headpiece is great.

751
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:40,157
Thank you.

752
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:43,494
Keaghlan,
if you'd please step back.

753
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:46,731
- Good job.
- Thank you.

754
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,832
All right, guys,
the judges have heard

755
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,467
what you have to say.

756
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:50,534
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

757
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:53,437
while they deliberate.

758
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,175
All right, judges.

759
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,877
Let's talk about the looks
you like the most this week.

760
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,145
Why don't we start with Sasha?

761
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,714
She allowed
the model's features

762
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:06,650
to drive the beauty
in this makeup.

763
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:09,854
And doing so little,
always risky,

764
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,422
but I think she knew
her limitations.

765
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,591
I loved the color choice
of the contact lens

766
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,992
and the blue stone.

767
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:16,994
How about Stella?

768
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:20,731
The neck piece-- beautiful,
multicultural references.

769
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,900
Even those petals
on the back of the head.

770
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,336
It was just one more thing
that was so spectacular.

771
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,140
She does have an eye
for shape and form,

772
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,475
but the real skill set
is bringing it together.

773
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,810
And what about Keaghlan?

774
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,578
I think it's a great makeup.

775
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:37,815
It fits into the ideology
of the Egyptian pantheon.

776
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,283
I was surprised
at how great the paint job was

777
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,152
when we got a little bit closer
to it.

778
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,220
I liked the balance
of the ears.

779
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,722
All right, so before we talk

780
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,490
about the looks
you like the least,

781
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:49,026
I want to remind you, you do
have that special immunity

782
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,162
available if you
would like to use it.

783
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:53,030
All right,
let's talk about Doc.

784
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:56,233
This lack of symmetry
and the shapes around the mouth

785
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:58,102
was just so sloppy and clumsy.

786
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:01,906
If someone that depressing
arrived and that gray,

787
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,607
it would make me lose
the will to live.

788
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:06,110
If he actually stepped out
the craft, you'd be likely

789
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:11,015
to club him to death rather
than take him and build a--

790
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,983
But he knew it was a lemon.

791
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,418
And what about Gwen?

792
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:17,354
Did not satisfy
the challenge at all.

793
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,391
We ended up with
this cromagnon-like character.

794
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,359
And I think she wasted
so much time trying

795
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,662
to patch up her chest,
which she covered up.

796
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,230
And what do you think
of Damien's work?

797
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,066
In this challenge,
it felt totally off the mark.

798
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:31,435
And the fact alone that
he started with that gold paint,

799
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,070
you're doomed right there.

800
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:35,406
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

801
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,209
- Yes, we have.
- Let's bring 'em back out.

802
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:45,783
So, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

803
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:49,253
Sasha, you did
a great job embracing

804
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,388
your model's features,
and the Indian influence

805
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,924
was so present in your work.

806
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,861
Stella, we loved
some of the unique shapes

807
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,929
in your character's face,
and the overall image

808
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:00,965
was quite powerful.

809
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:05,236
Keaghlan, this character
had a bold, graphic quality,

810
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,937
and we love
how you incorporated

811
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:09,507
recognizable
cultural references.

812
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,842
So who is the winner
of tonight's challenge?

813
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:15,746
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

814
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:22,269
So who is the winner
of tonight's challenge?

815
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:26,907
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

816
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,408
Stella.

817
00:40:28,443 --> 00:40:31,812
Thank you.

818
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,781
There were so many things
that should not have worked,

819
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,850
yet you managed
to pull together

820
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:38,785
all of these disparate elements

821
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,287
into an incredibly
successful makeup.

822
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:42,656
- Very cool.
- Thank you.

823
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,525
I win.

824
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,227
This is an amazing feeling,

825
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:50,497
and I proved to myself
that I can do this.

826
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,600
- Stella, congratulations.
- Thank you.

827
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:56,036
You, Keaghlan, and Sasha can
head back to the makeup room.

828
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,338
Thank you.

829
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:04,311
Unfortunately, that does mean
that the three of you

830
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,446
are in the bottom this week.

831
00:41:06,481 --> 00:41:09,016
One of you will be eliminated.

832
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,052
Please step forward.

833
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:21,328
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom looks.

834
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:25,132
Doc, your struggle
to nail down some of the aspects

835
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:29,069
of your makeup was undeniable,
and that was notably apparent

836
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:30,570
in your sculptural forms.

837
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:34,274
Gwen, not a lot about
your makeup worked tonight,

838
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:36,843
but perhaps the biggest misstep
was the fact that

839
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:40,814
it looked more like a tribal
demon than it did an alien.

840
00:41:40,848 --> 00:41:42,616
Damien, we thought
that there were

841
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,018
some fairly significant
sculptural misfires

842
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:46,253
in your makeup,

843
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:49,723
and your paint job
only served to enhance them.

844
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,992
So who's going home tonight?

845
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:56,363
The person going home tonight is...

846
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,302
Gwen.

847
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:06,173
You clearly suffered
some major technical setbacks,

848
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,709
but it was your inability
to adapt to them

849
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,043
that ultimately
was your undoing.

850
00:42:10,078 --> 00:42:14,014
Gwen, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

851
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:17,451
That means, Doc, Damien,
you guys are safe this week

852
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:21,455
and can head back
to the makeup room.

853
00:42:23,558 --> 00:42:25,692
Gwen, I know
you're a talented artist,

854
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,894
and I can't wait to see
what you do in the future.

855
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:29,096
Thank you.

856
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,131
Gwen, it's been great
having you here with us.

857
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:33,467
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

858
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,068
and pack up your kit.

859
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:38,371
- Thank you guys.
- Good luck.

860
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:40,006
Going home this soon
is heartbreaking.

861
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,876
Who is it?

862
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,478
- Gwen.
- No.

863
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:46,913
Being here has shown me
that I can move forward

864
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:48,148
with my art.

865
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:49,750
I love makeup a lot.

866
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:50,951
I love designing new creatures,

867
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,986
so this is just the beginning.

868
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,489
