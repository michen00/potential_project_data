1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,808
I think it's amazing.

2
00:00:03,843 --> 00:00:05,310
I loved the character.

3
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:07,345
- Whoo!
- Watch your face.

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,880
Previously on <i>Face Off...</i>

5
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:10,315
Damien's ambitious
animal hybrid

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,016
earned him his first win,

7
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:15,153
and Doc was eliminated.

8
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:16,254
Oh, boy.

9
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:18,189
Now just ten artists remain,

10
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:21,092
and tonight they'll take on
a wonderful twist of whimsy.

11
00:00:21,126 --> 00:00:22,927
This rainbow is an homage

12
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:24,596
to one
of the most legendary films.

13
00:00:25,865 --> 00:00:26,998
Ugh!

14
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:28,500
But for some,
it will be just plain wicked.

15
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:31,102
- Cheer up.
- It just not looking great.

16
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:33,104
I'm hypnotized
as she stares at me.

17
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:34,239
It's so freaky.

18
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:35,773
In the end, only one will win

19
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:38,076
a VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

20
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,079
to one of their 85
international locations,

21
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:43,515
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

22
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:46,351
and $100,000.

23
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:51,389
Welcome to<i> Face Off.</i>

25
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:28,126
It's a breakfast feast.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,062
Wow!
Oh, he's so beautiful.

27
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,230
Pshew!

28
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,299
I woke up this morning
really, really excited.

29
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,734
I mean, I'm feeling
very confident.

30
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,236
I have now had three top looks

31
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,204
in spotlight challenges,

32
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,707
and I'm ready to do something
really awesome.

33
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:43,908
Let's go.

34
00:01:43,943 --> 00:01:45,543
What do you think
the challenge is gonna be?

35
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:48,046
Better be something pretty.

36
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,487
Oh, boy.

37
00:01:56,522 --> 00:01:58,389
We are walking
in Sony Pictures,

38
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:01,092
and we see this giant rainbow,

39
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:02,927
and I'm instantly excited.

40
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:04,495
Ooh, are we talking whimsical?

41
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,697
Please tell me whimsical.

42
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:06,998
Oh, please don't be whimsical.

43
00:02:07,032 --> 00:02:09,100
Most people are afraid
of creatures and monsters,

44
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:12,437
but I hear "whimsical,"
and that's scary for me.

45
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,805
There's McKenzie.

46
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,139
Hi.

47
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:16,541
Look at this.

48
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:18,710
Looks like a crazy tea party.

49
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:20,778
That's so cute.

50
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:23,014
McKenzie is set up
with a tea party.

51
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:24,983
It's really, really adorable.

52
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:27,218
I'm a little bit nervous
to see what's in store,

53
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:29,821
but it's gonna be fun.

54
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,556
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

55
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,359
Welcome
to Sony Pictures Studios.

56
00:02:34,393 --> 00:02:37,695
Soaring 94 feet into the sky,

57
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,598
this rainbow, created by
renowned sculptor Tony Tasset,

58
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:43,501
is an homage to one
of the most legendary films

59
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:44,969
in cinematic history,

60
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:48,406
which is celebrating
its 75th anniversary this year,

61
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,841
<i>The Wizard Of Oz.</i>

62
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:52,443
I am in heaven,

63
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:55,513
because<i> The Wizard Of Oz</i>
is my favorite movie.

64
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:58,249
The film is based
on the classic children's book

65
00:02:58,283 --> 00:03:00,284
that created some of
the most memorable characters

66
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,619
in popular culture,

67
00:03:01,654 --> 00:03:04,255
Frank Baum's
<i>The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz.</i>

68
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,224
And for today's
spotlight challenge,

69
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,558
you'll be bringing

70
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:09,894
some of the book's
iconic characters to life.

71
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:10,895
Awesome.

72
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,797
Now, this is a team challenge,

73
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:13,831
so before I tell you more,

74
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,366
go ahead and choose a partner.

75
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,535
You and me.
Let's do it.

76
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:18,803
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

77
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,638
- Sasha?
- Yes.

78
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:23,207
Jason likes monsters
and horror,

79
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:26,244
and I like
bright, pretty stuff,

80
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:28,546
so I hope we can pull off
something crazy

81
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,948
with our different styles.

82
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:33,885
Now, since I've been talking

83
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,520
about<i> The Wonderful</i>
<i>Wizard Of Oz,</i>

84
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:37,922
you may be wondering
why I've invited you

85
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,457
to The Mad Hatter's tea party.

86
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:41,859
Well, of course, that's because

87
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:43,628
there's a big twist
to this challenge.

88
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,663
- Oh, my--
- Of course.

89
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:47,331
Your spotlight challenge

90
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:48,866
is to reimagine a character

91
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,868
from<i> The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz</i>

92
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:53,204
as though they've fallen
down the rabbit hole

93
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,672
into the fantastic world

94
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:57,008
of<i> Alice's Adventures</i>
<i>In Wonderland.</i>

95
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,343
- Oh, fuck!
- Yes!

96
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:02,146
Merging Oz into Wonderland
is gonna be really fun.

97
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,749
With all the trippy colors
and surrealistic aspects,

98
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:06,350
I think we'll be able
to do something

99
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,820
really creative and outside
the box with this makeup.

100
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:10,188
On the bottom of each teacup

101
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:12,523
is the name of a character
from Oz.

102
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:13,691
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:15,626
When I call your name,
pick one to find out

104
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,628
which character
you'll be transforming.

105
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:18,796
George and Drew,
you're up first.

106
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:20,898
- Yeah!
- Ooh.

107
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,403
Wicked Witch Of The West.

108
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:28,039
Dina and Stella.

109
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:29,841
Winged Monkey.

110
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,610
Cig and Damien.

111
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:33,678
The Scarecrow.

112
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:34,679
Uh-oh.

113
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:37,281
Rachael and Keaghlan.

114
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,983
Tin Woodman.

115
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,552
Jason and Sasha.

116
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,488
Cowardly Lion.

117
00:04:43,522 --> 00:04:44,822
Okay, you're all set.

118
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:46,724
Get started on your sketches.

119
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,227
- Good luck, guys.
- Thank you.

120
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,430
I'm so stoked for this.

121
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:53,931
So we're definitely
going green, right?

122
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:54,932
Yeah.

123
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,300
Our Wicked Witch Of The West

124
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:58,536
was flying in a tornado
on her broomstick

125
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,938
and ends up in Wonderland
by getting blown off course.

126
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:04,008
All of her features
become super exaggerated

127
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,043
as Wonderland fuses with her.

128
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:08,780
She's actually gonna have
a spiraled hairstyle

129
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,481
so that when she takes
her hat off,

130
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:11,649
we'll have the reveal

131
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:14,318
of this cool, like,
twisted tornado of hair.

132
00:05:14,353 --> 00:05:17,221
I really like that idea,
actually.

133
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,324
He was burlap in <i>Wizard Of Oz.</i>

134
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:21,559
So maybe he fell down
the rabbit hole,

135
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:22,827
and he lost stuffing.

136
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,195
He was always, like,
falling around

137
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:25,396
'cause he doesn't have bones.

138
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,632
We decide
that our Scarecrow embraces

139
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,100
the madness of Wonderland.

140
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:30,368
We'll still have some burlap,

141
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:31,602
but we were gonna incorporate

142
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,205
bright polka dot
and striped patchwork.

143
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,107
And then if we build up
fake shoulders,

144
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:37,441
we could do that head gag,

145
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:38,843
where it looks
like his head falls off.

146
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:41,145
- Like, mm, mm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,514
I think
that's a great idea, dude.

148
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:44,515
We need to figure out
his character.

149
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,683
Okay.

150
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:48,719
I read the description
of the Winged Monkey,

151
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:50,421
and it says that
he's very mischievous,

152
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:52,456
and he likes
to play tricks on people.

153
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,025
So how does he mess
with people?

154
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:55,693
So maybe he's the joker.

155
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:57,795
- Oh? That's actually...
- Right?

156
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,097
He's the joker
of the Queen's court.

157
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,332
That's smart.

158
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,634
So our concept is
that our Winged Monkey

159
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:06,671
is going to be the jester
for the Queen Of Hearts.

160
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:08,973
What if his wings were made
out of a deck of cards?

161
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,474
We could.

162
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,010
That could look
really interesting.

163
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:14,378
Rachael and I
are really excited

164
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:17,248
about creating a character
that fits in both these worlds.

165
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:19,016
The Queen Of Hearts
is always yelling

166
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:20,184
"Off with their head."

167
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,652
Who better to carry out
that request

168
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,788
than the Tin Woodman
with his ax?

169
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:26,457
So, basically, like,
he falls in down the rabbit hole

170
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,926
and is immediately forced
into the Queen Of Hearts' army.

171
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,528
Mm-hmm.

172
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:32,163
In refusing to act
as her executioner,

173
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:34,198
he realized that he had
a heart after all.

174
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,334
I like that.
He's that kind of character.

175
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:38,469
Yeah.

176
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:39,804
What's your idea?

177
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:40,972
Couple ideas.

178
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:42,707
Well, okay,
the Lion's in Wonderland.

179
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,408
Right.

180
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:45,610
I figured maybe the Queen

181
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:47,545
turns him into her soldier,

182
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,380
but he's cowardly,
so he doesn't want to fight,

183
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:50,748
so she beats him
and starves him,

184
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:53,885
so he's all withered
and lacerated.

185
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,120
I like creepy and gross stuff,

186
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,822
but that's not
what we're supposed to do

187
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:59,156
for the challenge,

188
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:01,192
and I don't want the same thing
that happened with Barry

189
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:02,426
to happen now.

190
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:04,061
You've been given
a challenge...

191
00:07:04,096 --> 00:07:06,631
- Yep.
- ...and it isn't here.

192
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,666
We need something colorful.

193
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,235
You know, the Cheshire Cat's
purple and pink stripes.

194
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,571
I don't know.
I kind of want to go with cool.

195
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:14,772
We just came off a challenge

196
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,340
where we were doing
whimsical makeup,

197
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,909
so I'd really like
to make something

198
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:20,444
a little darker and scarier.

199
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,180
Um...

200
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:25,850
I don't know if that's right,

201
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:28,352
but I don't like confrontation.

202
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:29,654
I'm so bad at it.

203
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:32,523
So we're gonna go
with a creepy lion, I guess.

204
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:34,825
All right, guys,
let's head back to the lab.

205
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,928
All right.

206
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:39,096
Whoo!

207
00:07:45,804 --> 00:07:47,271
It's nice and cool in here.

208
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:48,439
We come back to the lab.

209
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:50,274
We have 6 1/2 hours today,

210
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,411
and the first thing we do
is select our models.

211
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:55,079
Then we start sculpting.

212
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:57,548
I'm gonna block out
the cowl for Tin Woodman,

213
00:07:57,582 --> 00:07:59,283
while Keaghlan
starts to block out the face.

214
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,751
Do you like kind of
the shapes I'm going with?

215
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:04,455
I do.

216
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,324
What if the ears were, like,

217
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:08,292
in the shape of a joker hat?

218
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,695
Of a joker hat?
Oh, yeah!

219
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:11,963
Would that be kind of cool?

220
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:15,433
Stella and I are mixing
inorganic and organic.

221
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:19,637
We're doing the jester hat
out of skin.

222
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:22,473
Once we have our concept down,
then we start sculpting.

223
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:24,408
I get started on the face,

224
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:26,744
and Stella starts
blocking out the cowl.

225
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,279
I'm gonna make it
a little ear shape

226
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:29,280
at the bottom, I think.

227
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:31,315
Okay.

228
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,354
George and I are working
really well together.

229
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,290
We're on the same page
conceptually and technically.

230
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:41,359
I'm still musing on how
to make her more Wonderland,

231
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:42,827
'cause I'm worried
that she's just gonna be

232
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:44,562
too straightforward
Wicked Witch.

233
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:48,132
The nice thing about Drew
is that he has no trouble

234
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,701
saying what's on his mind.

235
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,137
We could make
her teeth rotten and gnarly.

236
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:57,308
Think we could paint them up
like playing cards?

237
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:58,442
Yeah.

238
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:59,543
- I don't like that idea.
- Okay.

239
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:01,245
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

240
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,582
Since Jason has this idea
for this makeup,

241
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:06,150
he starts sculpting the face,

242
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:07,685
and I start sculpting the cowl.

243
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,420
I want to do exaggerated ears

244
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,888
to make it more whimsical.

245
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:13,090
Jason, what do you think
about the ears?

246
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,291
Uh, not too big.

247
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:16,427
Lion ears are small.

248
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:18,562
I'll make them more realistic.

249
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:20,264
I definitely am not happy

250
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:23,134
with the direction
of our makeup at all.

251
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:33,911
Cig and I are sculpting
our Scarecrow's cowl and face

252
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:34,912
really, really quickly.

253
00:09:34,946 --> 00:09:35,980
I'm gonna go back there

254
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,915
and start cleaning
this bad bitch up.

255
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:40,184
We don't have to spend
any time detailing the sculpts,

256
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:42,686
because we're going
to actually sew fabric

257
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,655
into the foam pieces.

258
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:49,627
So about two hours in, we have
the face done and the cowl,

259
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:51,762
and we're ready to mold.

260
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:55,132
It feels really good

261
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,801
being the first ones
in the mold room.

262
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:58,536
We want to get these
ready for foam tonight,

263
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,472
so we can spend
all day tomorrow fabricating.

264
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,177
Hey, guys.
Here to check on your work.

265
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,479
- Hi.
- Howdy.

266
00:10:08,513 --> 00:10:10,347
- So you got the Wicked Witch.
- Yeah.

267
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:12,149
What are you going to do
with the mouth here?

268
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:15,186
We want to have
a curled-under sort of look.

269
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,387
One thing you can do
would be to make

270
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,155
your upper lip
a little thicker.

271
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,157
It's gonna make that
fall back in.

272
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,392
Yeah.

273
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,627
We were thinking
about building these ears up

274
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:25,196
like a jester's hat.

275
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,297
Are you gonna use any hair

276
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,465
or any fur on it at all?

277
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:28,966
I really don't want to.

278
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,935
- Are you a little nervous?
- I know you don't.

279
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:32,069
Little bits wouldn't hurt,

280
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,838
even if you lay a little bit
on the chin,

281
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:36,140
just very whimsical
little things,

282
00:10:36,174 --> 00:10:38,008
'cause you could do that
on the back of the hands too.

283
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:39,076
Mm-hmm.

284
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,244
We have the Tin Woodman.

285
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:41,946
I like the way
you straightened all this out.

286
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,947
- Yeah, this is great.
- Yeah.

287
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:44,148
But all of a sudden,

288
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,783
I'm looking at a seashell
over here.

289
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:48,819
- It need more planes to it.
- Okay.

290
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:50,087
Make it a little sharper?

291
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:51,522
Sharpen the leading edge
and then round into it.

292
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:52,556
Okay.

293
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,158
We have the Scarecrow.

294
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:55,593
Are you talking
about making him patchwork?

295
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:57,027
Mm-hmm.

296
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,396
The thing is,
don't get really crazy and busy

297
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:02,066
overly doing it,
making the face disappear.

298
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,267
Yeah.

299
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,835
As soon as the Lion
gets to Wonderland,

300
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,770
the Queen is the first person
that finds him

301
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:08,072
and beats him up a little bit.

302
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,740
So he's like
one of her soldiers?

303
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:11,308
Yeah.

304
00:11:11,343 --> 00:11:13,077
It needs to be bolder.

305
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:16,514
It's reading kitty-cat to me,
not a lion.

306
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,282
You need to get
a little whimsical

307
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:20,451
into this character.

308
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,686
I said to Jason from the start,

309
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:24,255
it's got to stand out
and be interesting.

310
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:25,422
This is wonderland.

311
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:27,825
This is not quite coming up

312
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:28,859
to what everybody else
is doing.

313
00:11:28,894 --> 00:11:30,594
I'm really worried now.

314
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:31,762
If I don't take his advice,

315
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:35,499
they could end up sending
one of us home.

316
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:36,901
Coming up...

317
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,636
Only thing that worries me
is the movement.

318
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,070
It's gonna put our heads
on the chopping block.

319
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:43,207
It's a little bit stiff
and masklike.

320
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:45,676
That is confounding to me.

321
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,268
It needs to be bolder.

322
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:55,104
This is not quite coming up

323
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:56,805
to what everybody else
is doing.

324
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,109
It is day one of our<i> Wizard</i>
<i>Of Oz</i> and<i> Wonderland</i> challenge,

325
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,678
and Mr. Westmore doesn't think
we're going whimsical enough

326
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:04,546
with our creepy Cowardly Lion.

327
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:06,115
I'm kind of already scared
at this point.

328
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,217
Color-wise,
what do you plan on doing?

329
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:09,885
Applying colors
like the golds and the browns.

330
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,553
But that's really
not what the challenge is.

331
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:14,623
I said that to Jason
from the start.

332
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:15,924
It's got to stand out
and be interesting.

333
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,359
This is Wonderland.

334
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:20,629
Think happy and colorful
to mesh both worlds together.

335
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:21,730
Good luck.

336
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:22,931
Thanks, guys.

337
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,500
Maybe now we can make a makeup

338
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,902
that I really would
love to make.

339
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:28,437
All right, guys, good luck.

340
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:29,505
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

341
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,274
Thank you so much.

342
00:12:32,308 --> 00:12:34,042
♪ making witches ♪

343
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:35,544
♪ making witches ♪

344
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:38,881
♪ making witches ♪

345
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,082
What's the matter, Dina?

346
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,850
He still looks
a little too happy.

347
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:43,185
Oh, yeah.

348
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:44,987
We want a very mischievous look

349
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,422
on our monkey's face,

350
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:48,157
like he's smirking at you.

351
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,026
Dina can't seem
to get the expression right.

352
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,361
You want to switch?

353
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:53,695
Yeah, we can switch.

354
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,197
I just kind of
push her clay around

355
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:58,801
until I get it
to where it looks perfect.

356
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,836
Yeah, I think
he looks creepier.

357
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,837
- Like that? Okay.
- Yeah.

358
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,807
Good. It looks good.

359
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,841
So we want to do, like, a...

360
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,910
Pfft.
Like, a collar thing, right?

361
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:08,944
Yeah.

362
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,412
For the gag to work
to make it look

363
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,214
like our Scarecrow's head
falls off,

364
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:14,183
Damien and I have to build up
the shoulders

365
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:16,618
so that when his head drops,
the perspective

366
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,921
is that his shoulders
are still in place.

367
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,123
So maybe, like, build it up
with couch foam first

368
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,124
and use that
as, like, an armature

369
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,625
to shape the L200 around.

370
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,061
I get this couch foam,
and I start carving out

371
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:29,264
a collar shape that we'll put
under his wardrobe,

372
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:30,699
and when he drops his head,

373
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:32,734
the shoulders look
like they stay in place.

374
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,970
- Unh!
- Yeah.

375
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:42,044
Mr. Westmore tells me
to incorporate elements

376
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:43,645
from the Cheshire Cat
into my sculpture,

377
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,482
but it's frustrating having
to change your sculpt

378
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:47,950
after you've been
working on it all day.

379
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,918
So I'm just trying to bulk
the face out

380
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:51,587
to make it look
like a lion snout.

381
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:52,921
Hopefully,
that'll help the design.

382
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:55,157
Jason's
just moving clay around.

383
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,260
He hasn't done anything
to make our Cowardly Lion

384
00:13:58,294 --> 00:13:59,795
more whimsical.

385
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,030
It was really frustrating,
but I just sit there

386
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,967
in my own world,
sculpting my lion ears,

387
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:06,902
all depressed.

388
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:08,804
Hey, Rachael, can we have
some of your hair?

389
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,873
You know, just a trim.

390
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,977
We're gonna take
Mr. Westmore's advice

391
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:16,745
and give our monkey
some little chin hairs,

392
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:19,748
and Rachael with her big,
beautiful, purple hair

393
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,283
is perfect.

394
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,485
Cut from the back, please.

395
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,553
Okay.

396
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:25,821
Have you ever cut hair, Stella?

397
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:28,323
Nope, but I've watched
people cut hair.

398
00:14:28,358 --> 00:14:30,158
You're not making me
feel any better.

399
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,128
We have a piece of Rachael
in our makeup now.

400
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:34,897
Oh, yeah!

401
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,999
Perfect.

402
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:39,635
Cig, I'm gonna bundle
all this hay shit together.

403
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,769
I want to see what you think.

404
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:42,137
Hope it's not gonna
look too hokey.

405
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,539
We're going to stuff
our Scarecrow

406
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,107
with some glittery material,

407
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:47,509
so you can tell that he was
the original Scarecrow,

408
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:50,279
but he's been in Wonderland
for a long time,

409
00:14:50,313 --> 00:14:51,513
and he's embracing the madness

410
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:52,714
a becoming part of Wonderland.

411
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,050
It's definitely
more Wonderland.

412
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:56,552
It's Wonderland hay.

413
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:59,388
Wonder hay.

414
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:02,424
Sasha, babe, cheer up.

415
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,860
I'm very upset because this is
like my dream challenge,

416
00:15:04,894 --> 00:15:07,996
and it's just not going the way
that I would have loved.

417
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,898
I like pretty things.

418
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,366
Look how pretty that looks.

419
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:13,035
You want to make
something pretty?

420
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,670
We can't make--
It's creepy.

421
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:17,339
There's so much creativity
that could be put into this,

422
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:20,576
and I just want to do something
Wonderland-ish.

423
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,512
It's not pretty and creepy.

424
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,948
It's just creepy.

425
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:27,983
Ours just is so boring.

426
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,820
All right, everybody,
that's time!

427
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:33,155
Whoo!

428
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:38,160
I'm just hoping to
come back tomorrow and fix this.

429
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,474
Can you see the air pocket
on the nose?

430
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:54,109
- Nope.
- Good.

431
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:56,278
And there's glitter
on everything.

432
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:59,481
Looks like a fairy just
CENSORED over here everywhere.

433
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:02,784
There we go.
That's what we're looking for.

434
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,721
It's day two
of our Oz/Wonderland challenge,

435
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,423
and we've got 9 1/2 hours
in the lab.

436
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,793
First thing I'm gonna do
is add the skin across the back.

437
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:14,429
We start off by finishing
the sculpture for our witch.

438
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,098
I decided, rather than stick

439
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,833
to the strong anatomical
bone structure,

440
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,469
I'm gonna add stretches
of wrinkly skin

441
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:22,137
in between the shoulder blades.

442
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:23,772
I think this will be
a lot cooler

443
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:25,941
than just sculpting
realistic scapula.

444
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:29,211
It should be ready
for detailing shortly.

445
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:32,748
Okay.

446
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,216
Do you want to look
this over for me?

447
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,118
If you want to play
with it any, be my guest.

448
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:37,519
Okay.

449
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,447
Keaghlan asked me to jump
on the face and check it out.

450
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:40,888
_

451
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,792
And I see some stuff
that really needs to be fixed,

452
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,595
because symmetry's really
important for a Tin Man.

453
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:49,398
We want to get our molds done
in a couple hours,

454
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:51,633
so we're trying to step it up
as fast as we can.

455
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,036
I really dig
how beautiful you made him.

456
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,437
I think it's really beautiful.

457
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:58,373
Thank you.

458
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:02,811
While Dina is molding,

459
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:05,313
I get straight to work
on the wings,

460
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:08,583
which means I have to make
my own deck of cards.

461
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,787
I lay the stencil down,
and I airbrush them.

462
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,889
I glue them to a piece of L200

463
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:16,224
and cut out each card.

464
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,495
Sasha, I don't really think

465
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,863
I want to do much more to it.

466
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:24,099
Yeah?
Then I'm gonna mold it.

467
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:27,135
I'm still not happy
about Jason's face sculpt,

468
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,272
but we got to get this going,
so I start molding it.

469
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:32,140
I'm trying to stay
really positive.

470
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,776
Later, I'll figure out
how to make this creepy lion

471
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:37,979
more whimsical.

472
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,011
Oh, that's cool.

473
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:40,312
_

474
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:42,217
Cig stitches
the patchwork on our face,

475
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:43,885
and I really like
the way it's looking.

476
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,454
Only thing that worries me
is the movement.

477
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:46,688
Yeah.

478
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:48,824
But it's really losing
a lot of elasticity,

479
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:50,759
and one of the first thing
that the judges

480
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,894
ask your model to do
is move your face.

481
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:54,830
Can you move your brow?
Can you open your mouth?

482
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:55,831
Can you smile?

483
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,365
It feels tight,
like, up to here.

484
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,434
And if our model
can't do any of that,

485
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,969
we're really afraid
we're gonna hear

486
00:18:01,003 --> 00:18:03,538
that dreaded "M" word,
which is mask.

487
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:04,973
Maybe score it out,

488
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,708
but I don't know if that's gonna
help all that much.

489
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,076
We're gonna
have to make it work,

490
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:09,878
otherwise, it's definitely
gonna put our heads

491
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:12,514
on the chopping block.

492
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:18,426
Only thing that worries me
is the movement.

493
00:18:18,461 --> 00:18:19,961
It's day two
of our <i>Alice In Wonderland/</i>

494
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,263
<i>Wizard Of Oz</i> challenge,

495
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,632
and me and Damien are worried
that our Scarecrow face

496
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,733
is a little too stiff,

497
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,301
so we have to make it work.

498
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,170
If we cut on the inside
from here up

499
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:30,172
and separate the jaw...

500
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:32,307
I cut strategic movement points

501
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,842
around the mouth, nose,
and forehead.

502
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:35,610
Hopefully,
that's gonna fix the problem

503
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:37,012
of it looking like a mask.

504
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,714
That's a lot better.

505
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:45,454
I'm excited
about the monkey wings.

506
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:48,123
I'm just nervous about
how much time it's taking me

507
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:50,392
to make all of these cards
and put the wings together.

508
00:18:50,426 --> 00:18:52,361
It doesn't really look
like a wing.

509
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:53,495
Dina's done molding,

510
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:55,063
and she comes over and sees

511
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:56,832
that I might
have a problem here.

512
00:18:56,866 --> 00:18:59,034
We can get thinner here.

513
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,936
I've never fabricated wings
before,

514
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,572
so I'm relying on Stella
to build the armature,

515
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:07,509
and then I'll work on the shape
and gluing them all down.

516
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:08,644
Maybe it'll come together.

517
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:10,312
I like some of them
upside down.

518
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:13,649
Yeah, it does look
kind of cool.

519
00:19:13,683 --> 00:19:15,250
Ugh.

520
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:16,685
The face is molded,

521
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:19,688
and now I'm gonna start
the legs and arms.

522
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:20,956
Awesome.

523
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,660
I decide that
I'm going to make a lion suit

524
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:27,696
and stripe it
like the Cheshire Cat.

525
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,098
I'm hoping that this is gonna
turn our makeup around.

526
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,567
I decide to do fur transfer,

527
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:35,837
so it moves the way
a human moves,

528
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,206
rather than just a fur suit.

529
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,077
So I'm taking fun fur,
sticking masking tape on it,

530
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:46,248
I shave off the fabric
that it's attached to,

531
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:49,284
and I spray glue
and stick the fur down

532
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:50,686
and pull the tape off.

533
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,322
And it looks like the fur
is really stuck into the fabric.

534
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,463
You can't have a Wicked Witch
Of The West without a broom,

535
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:04,099
so I start fabricating
the witch's broomstick.

536
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,802
I'm using PVC pipe
for the handle

537
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:09,671
and spiraled floral sticks

538
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:11,173
for the bristles of the broom.

539
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,543
I get it all painted, and,
you know, it looks really cool.

540
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,016
All right, guys,
30 minutes left!

541
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:26,922
Awesome!

542
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,459
I pop the face mold open to
go ahead and start cleaning it,

543
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,894
and it pulls out perfectly.

544
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,530
Then I go to open
the cowl mold.

545
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:42,504
I think the core is locked
inside the cowl.

546
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:43,972
Think there's an undercut
behind the ear.

547
00:20:44,006 --> 00:20:46,308
It looks like when Sasha
molded the cowl,

548
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,844
the plaster actually went
behind the ears

549
00:20:48,878 --> 00:20:50,712
and locked the core
inside the mold.

550
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:51,947
I'm so sorry.

551
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:54,216
If we don't break
the lock on this mold,

552
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,352
then we're screwed
for tomorrow.

553
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:04,559
It's a miracle.

554
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,394
Yay!
You got it?

555
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,296
- Yeah.
- Yay!

556
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:10,232
The mold's definitely
busted up in a lot of spots,

557
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,967
but it's not gonna be
a huge issue,

558
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,503
because we're just gonna
lay hair on the edges anyway.

559
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:16,605
That's time, guys!

560
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,006
End of day two,

561
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,642
me and Sasha are definitely
feeling a lot better.

562
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:22,277
We're ready to come in
on application day

563
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:25,413
and knock this out.

564
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:32,921
Whoo!

565
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,025
It's application day.

566
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:38,260
We have four hours in the lab.

567
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:41,163
I have to spray-paint
our boots,

568
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:44,566
finish our ax,
and spray-paint the cloak.

569
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,067
While I'm doing that,

570
00:21:46,102 --> 00:21:48,503
Keaghlan is cutting off
the seams of our pieces,

571
00:21:48,538 --> 00:21:52,774
and then we have to apply
everything to our model.

572
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:56,945
Yeah.

573
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:57,979
- Oh, my God.
- I'm Sasha.

574
00:21:58,014 --> 00:21:59,281
Hi. Nice to meet you.

575
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:01,950
So let's have you
put your outfit on first.

576
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,919
We put on our spandex bodysuit

577
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:05,020
that has all the Wonder hay

578
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:06,922
and the mushrooms
growing out of it,

579
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:09,424
and then cut it up so that
the hay and the mushrooms

580
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,694
grow out from the right places.

581
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:15,030
That's cool.

582
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:17,032
There we go.

583
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:18,466
The cowl goes on just fine,

584
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:21,870
but we notice that
the face has a little dent,

585
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:24,139
so Dina adds some cotton

586
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:26,074
so that the forehead
can go right over it

587
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:27,909
without it being dented.

588
00:22:27,944 --> 00:22:30,245
That's better.

589
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,454
Should we fill that
or pretend it's a dent?

590
00:22:39,488 --> 00:22:40,856
Dent.

591
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,424
We are trying to create

592
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,359
a really realistic Tin Woodman,

593
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:46,695
so we base him out
entirely in gray,

594
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:49,798
and then we dry-brush silver
to get a good depth.

595
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:51,066
He looks like a Tin Man.

596
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,234
He does.

597
00:22:52,268 --> 00:22:55,136
And then we add some black
in the creases

598
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:59,140
to pop that color even more.

599
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:00,609
We start painting,

600
00:23:00,643 --> 00:23:03,745
and I'm trying to follow
Jason's directions,

601
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,047
but he really didn't come up
with a plan

602
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:08,016
for what color
we're gonna paint this.

603
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,886
We're just messing
with different colors.

604
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,555
We're using purples and browns

605
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:16,725
and not going
in any specific order,

606
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:19,194
and it's kind of a mess.

607
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:20,262
Oh, careful!

608
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:21,296
That's a lot of yellow.

609
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,998
Think lion, Sash.

610
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:24,666
I don't even know
how I'm feeling.

611
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,502
I'm just, like, trying
to get through this.

612
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:29,771
It's just not looking great.

613
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,806
15 minutes, guys!

614
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:40,949
We got
two different underskirts,

615
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:42,450
and we have a full hoop skirt.

616
00:23:42,485 --> 00:23:43,451
Okay.

617
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:44,986
Our wardrobe looks really cool,

618
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,389
except the hat doesn't have
very much space on the inside

619
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:51,259
to actually build
our spiral tornado hairstyle.

620
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:52,494
We're not gonna do the blah...

621
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:53,628
Oh, we're not gonna do it?

622
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:55,597
It won't fit under the hat.

623
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:57,232
All right, guys, it's time!

624
00:23:57,266 --> 00:24:01,069
Our Witch isn't
as Wonderland-y as the rest,

625
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:04,172
so scrapping the hair
could be the wrong choice.

626
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:07,909
Coming up...

627
00:24:07,944 --> 00:24:09,411
We have to re-haul
the color scheme.

628
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:12,047
The huge mash-up of color
might get us in trouble.

629
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:13,515
It's a lovely idea.

630
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:14,582
So freaky.

631
00:24:14,617 --> 00:24:17,619
We can't find a makeup job.

632
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:26,926
We get to last looks,
and we only have one hour,

633
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:28,495
and the first thing I do

634
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:31,231
is make sure that our cape
has the red heart

635
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:32,766
from the Queen Of Hearts

636
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,301
so that the backstory
is tied into our character.

637
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:38,938
Sasha and I still have
a lot of work to do,

638
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:41,274
and I'm really worried
'cause the lion's

639
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,709
still really reading
kind of brown and werewolf,

640
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:46,179
so we have to majorly re-haul
the color scheme in an hour,

641
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:48,348
and that's just
not a lot of time.

642
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:52,752
This looks great.

643
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,721
George and I decide
to scrap the cyclone hairstyle,

644
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:56,089
but we still want her to have

645
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,424
some thin, wispy, witchy hair,

646
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:59,292
so I start
the hair-laying process,

647
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:01,161
while George paints
layered age effects

648
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,496
with light and shadow
on our model's hands.

649
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:04,497
Does that work for you?

650
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:05,598
- Should we go longer?
- Yeah.

651
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:08,168
Stella starts adding hair
to the chin,

652
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:09,636
and as she's doing that,

653
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,338
I'm adding Rachael's hair
to the monkey's hands.

654
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:13,673
It's real hair,
so it's awesome.

655
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:16,242
Ten minutes, everyone!

656
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:26,586
All right, guys, it's time!

657
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,354
Cig and I are a little worried.

658
00:25:28,389 --> 00:25:31,424
Our Scarecrow's a huge mash-up
of color, which is great,

659
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,793
but the head gets lost
in some of the costume elements,

660
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:37,330
and that might
get us in trouble.

661
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,875
Welcome
to the <i>Face Off</i> reveal stage.

662
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:53,079
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

663
00:25:53,114 --> 00:25:56,649
First let's say hello
to our talented judges.

664
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,451
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

665
00:25:58,486 --> 00:25:59,452
Glenn Hetrick.

666
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:00,453
Good evening, everyone.

667
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:01,554
- Hi.
- Hi, Glenn.

668
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:02,956
A big welcome back

669
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,493
to our three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

670
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:08,328
I missed you guys.
I'm glad to be back.

671
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:09,863
Hi, Ve.

672
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:12,365
Creature and concept designer
Mr. Neville Page.

673
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:13,466
Hello.

674
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:14,734
- Hi.
- Hello.

675
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:17,504
And Oscar-winning
makeup artist Lois Burwell.

676
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:19,439
Evening, lovelies.

677
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:20,974
Hi, Lois.

678
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:24,410
Now, next week,
Glenn, Ve, and Neville

679
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:25,979
will be competing
against each other

680
00:26:26,013 --> 00:26:28,615
in a very special edition
of<i> Face Off</i>

681
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:30,049
called "Judge Match."

682
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:31,618
- What?
- Wow.

683
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:33,453
And they're going to have

684
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:36,189
some of the best
former<i> Face Off</i> contestants

685
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:39,125
to help bring
their original designs to life.

686
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,527
I, for one, cannot wait.

687
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:42,529
Really?
That's confidence.

688
00:26:42,563 --> 00:26:43,630
Oh! Game on.

689
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:46,399
I'm frightened.

690
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:49,869
In the meantime, let's take
a look at tonight's makeups.

691
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:51,337
This week,
your spotlight challenge

692
00:26:51,372 --> 00:26:53,907
was to reimagine
one of the classic characters

693
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:55,642
from <i>The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz</i>

694
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:58,545
as if they'd fallen down
the rabbit hole into Wonderland.

695
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:01,915
So let's take a look
at your colorful creations.

696
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:28,107
She looks great, and
she totally sells the makeup.

697
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:29,609
We're just so happy.

698
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:33,346
We created something that
we truly believed in and loved.

699
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:56,669
There's fur flying everywhere.

700
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:58,771
It's so bad.

701
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:02,408
I'm in deep trouble.

702
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:22,495
Her color
is really, really nice.

703
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:26,532
She feels like the Wicked Witch
of Wonderland onstage.

704
00:28:47,254 --> 00:28:48,454
I'm so proud.

705
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:50,256
I think Rachael and I
created a Tin Woodman

706
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,558
that could step out
of his own film.

707
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:16,215
I'm a little bit worried,
because from where I'm standing,

708
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,117
I can't see any sort
of facial features,

709
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:21,621
so I know that the judges
can't see them either.

710
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:27,760
Judges, it's time
to take a closer look

711
00:29:27,795 --> 00:29:31,030
at Wonderland's newest citizens.

712
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:36,502
Oh, man.

713
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:37,837
It's freaky.

714
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:39,005
It really is.

715
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,573
I like the way the neck
comes down

716
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:41,974
into these little goodies.

717
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:45,178
Show us shock, surprise,
and then anger.

718
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:47,647
That's great.

719
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:51,517
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

720
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:52,785
Let's see this.

721
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,554
It looks like they did
a whole bunch of sculpting

722
00:29:54,588 --> 00:29:55,888
and created a whole piece.
Let's see your chest.

723
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:57,256
- Show us your--
- Show us your tummy.

724
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,725
- There's no payoff here.
- No.

725
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:01,494
Wish more time had been spent
on the face.

726
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:03,763
I'm not really feeling good
about where we're standing.

727
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:05,865
I know the judges
don't like the makeup.

728
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:08,568
I'm not sure if this is just
out of the box and loopy enough

729
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:12,305
to fit this challenge.

730
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:16,109
Who reimagined your favorite
Oz character in Wonderland?

731
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:19,345
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

732
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:24,920
Wish more time had been spent
on the face.

733
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:26,622
I'm not really feeling good
about where we're standing.

734
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:28,524
I mean, I'm hoping
we can be safe,

735
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,393
but I'm not sure if this is
out of the box enough

736
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,694
to fit this challenge.

737
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:34,463
Where are its ears?
Oh, they're in here.

738
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:35,998
I wish these were longer.

739
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:39,168
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

740
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:42,905
Can you turn sideways?

741
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:45,007
It is a gorgeous profile.

742
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,342
Very birdlike.

743
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:50,279
The head is kind of eggy,
though, isn't it?

744
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:52,848
Thank you.

745
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:56,118
Kneel, so we can really look
at your face.

746
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:57,486
Oh, lovely.

747
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,089
They've done a really good job
of maintaining symmetry.

748
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:01,691
Yeah, this whole line
right up in here

749
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:03,426
is really perfect.

750
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,895
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

751
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,899
The fabrics,
although it's a clever idea,

752
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:12,001
it's too busy.

753
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:16,372
This is unfortunately
less interesting up close.

754
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:18,607
I don't even see
what they sculpted.

755
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:22,078
It's, like, laminated
over the top.

756
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,314
Thank you.

757
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,152
All right, the judges
would like to speak

758
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,321
with each of you
to learn more about your work.

759
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:35,191
Drew and George,
please step up.

760
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,532
Tell me about your character

761
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,401
and how you integrated
the two different tales

762
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:46,969
into this creation.

763
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:49,505
Our Wicked Witch Of The West
was flying in a tornado

764
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:52,074
and blew off course
and ended up in Wonderland,

765
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:55,211
and her features
became super exaggerated.

766
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:59,115
It feels very <i>Wizard Of Oz,</i>

767
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:01,784
not very Wonderland.

768
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:04,086
Can you take the hat off?

769
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:06,756
There's some great technique
going on here,

770
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,958
but it feels like
the makeup ends

771
00:32:08,992 --> 00:32:11,393
right where the edge
of the wardrobe begins.

772
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:14,296
This makeup could have changed

773
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:17,900
into a Wonderland makeup
so easily

774
00:32:17,934 --> 00:32:19,401
if you had not painted
her green.

775
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:21,904
She just doesn't address
the challenge.

776
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:24,240
I have a question
about the shape

777
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:25,407
of the top of the head.

778
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:26,909
What was the reason
behind that?

779
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:28,677
The hair was gonna
be swooped up

780
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:29,879
like a big tornado,

781
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:31,680
but anything we would have done
with the hair

782
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:33,716
would have been crushed
as soon as we put the hat on,

783
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,317
and you can't have a witch
without a hat.

784
00:32:35,352 --> 00:32:36,519
I think you can,

785
00:32:36,553 --> 00:32:38,921
and I think if you
would have kept the hair,

786
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:41,357
you would have had something.

787
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,092
It would have been more fun

788
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:46,562
had you turned the hair
into a heart shape or a crown.

789
00:32:46,596 --> 00:32:48,898
Give her red hair,
anything like that.

790
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:52,468
It could have
told the story better.

791
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,370
Drew and George,
please step back.

792
00:32:54,404 --> 00:32:56,939
Thank you, Lena.

793
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,679
Damien and Cig, please step up.

794
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:13,122
Tell us
about your character, please.

795
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:14,490
We got the Scarecrow,

796
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:17,426
and he was unstuffed
by the Wicked Witch Of The West,

797
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,961
and he ends up
falling into the rabbit hole.

798
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,529
He decides he doesn't need
a brain,

799
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,064
and he just embraces
the madness.

800
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:23,332
This is very clever.

801
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:26,235
Unfortunately,
you have made his face so dark,

802
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:29,638
we can't even find
a makeup job.

803
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:31,040
I think it just went amiss

804
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,474
because we really
cannot see him.

805
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:36,178
He's just
one big patchwork quilt.

806
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:37,847
I like the colors,
I like that it is muted,

807
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,648
but the biggest problem

808
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:41,851
is that the face
has no focal point.

809
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:45,955
Would you mind
taking the hat off?

810
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:47,289
And turn round.

811
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:52,428
See that wonderful metal
and how it pops out?

812
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,563
That's a shame that it was
buried underneath the hat,

813
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:57,700
because it's a lovely idea.

814
00:33:57,734 --> 00:34:00,102
Damien and Cig,
if you'd please step down.

815
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,712
Stella and Dina,
please step forward.

816
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,218
You're so creepy.

817
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:17,486
Tell us about the concept here.

818
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,455
She is a Winged Monkey.

819
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,357
She flew down the rabbit hole

820
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:24,026
and ended up
in the Queen's property,

821
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,928
so the Queen decided,
"She's goofy.

822
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:27,529
I'm gonna make her
my jester."

823
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:32,268
This is the most
wonderfully realized fusion

824
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,870
of the two worlds.

825
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,972
I'm almost hypnotized
as she stares at me.

826
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,574
It's so freaky.

827
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:39,575
Good work.

828
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:40,843
Thank you.

829
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,578
Who came up with the concept
on this one?

830
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:44,013
It was kind of a joint effort.

831
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:46,048
You came up with, like,
the jester idea,

832
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:47,750
and then I came up
with having the head

833
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:49,652
be a part of the jester hat.

834
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:51,086
You found your focus

835
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:56,525
in the merging
of organic into inorganic form,

836
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,627
and that is
what I want to applaud.

837
00:34:58,662 --> 00:35:02,464
Well, ladies, I dig the heck
out of this creepy little thing.

838
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:05,167
The color, I think,
was a really good choice.

839
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:09,004
She's devilish and mesmerizing
all at once.

840
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,508
Stella and Dina,
please step back.

841
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,209
Thank you.

842
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:21,350
All right, let's talk
to Sasha and Jason.

843
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:29,224
Tell me
about your Cowardly Lion.

844
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:31,093
When the Cowardly Lion
falls down the rabbit hole,

845
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:32,361
he is found by the Queen,

846
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:34,229
and then when she finds out
that he is cowardly,

847
00:35:34,264 --> 00:35:35,731
she starts trying
to get him tough.

848
00:35:35,765 --> 00:35:37,599
And he's also possessed
by the Cheshire Cat.

849
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:40,269
It might have been wiser
to have more work

850
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:42,671
been placed into the face.

851
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:47,977
It's a little bit stiff
and masklike,

852
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:51,447
rather than
a movable, living makeup.

853
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:54,283
Why didn't you seize
upon the opportunity

854
00:35:54,317 --> 00:35:56,085
to bring
the Cheshire Cat's colors

855
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,021
and do crazy afro wig
or something?

856
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:00,322
Any giant mane.

857
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:02,191
I think we kind of still wish
he was more yellow

858
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,625
in order to read more lion.

859
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,327
Okay.

860
00:36:05,362 --> 00:36:09,765
This challenge begs
for whimsical, cartoony makeups,

861
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:13,769
and then you ended up going
in a more realistic direction.

862
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:16,538
That is confounding to me.

863
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,440
Whose idea was this?

864
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:19,775
The concept was my idea.

865
00:36:19,809 --> 00:36:22,044
It's my fault
for not speaking up

866
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:24,246
and trying to do something
more whimsical.

867
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,682
It's not colorful enough.
It's not the Cheshire Cat.

868
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:28,984
It's got stripes,
but they're not the right color.

869
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:32,488
To me,
this looks like<i> Teen Wolf.</i>

870
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:34,890
Sasha and Jason,
please step back.

871
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:44,466
Rachael and Keaghlan,
you're up.

872
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:51,373
Please tell me about
your design for this character.

873
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:52,808
We have the Tin Woodman.

874
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:55,144
He fell down the rabbit hole.

875
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:57,179
He found himself
in the Queen's Rose Garden,

876
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:59,715
and in refusing to act
as her executioner,

877
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:01,984
he realized that he had
a heart after all.

878
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:05,387
I think
it's very well executed.

879
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:07,990
I have to commend you
on presenting

880
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:10,926
super clean, finished work.

881
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,761
I love the colorings.

882
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,830
I love the little rust marks
here and there.

883
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:17,199
He's not just
a solid silver being.

884
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:20,269
It's probably one of
the nicest symmetrical makeups

885
00:37:20,303 --> 00:37:21,970
that I've ever seen
on this show.

886
00:37:22,005 --> 00:37:23,338
Thank you.

887
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:26,508
I really like it
from the side view.

888
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:29,511
The spiral here
and those tubes coming up,

889
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:31,847
the hint
of something industrial.

890
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:32,915
Well done, girls.

891
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,083
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

892
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:36,652
Rachael and Keaghlan,
please step back.

893
00:37:36,686 --> 00:37:38,954
Thank you.

894
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:43,092
All right, guys,
the judges have heard

895
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:44,359
what you have to say.

896
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:45,828
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

897
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:46,895
while they deliberate.

898
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,896
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

899
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:50,332
Thanks, guys.

900
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:55,104
All right, judges, before
we talk about tonight's makeups,

901
00:37:55,138 --> 00:37:56,538
I just want to remind you

902
00:37:56,573 --> 00:38:00,476
that you do have that special
immunity still available.

903
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,778
So let's start
with Stella and Dina.

904
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:06,215
I think that they nailed
the synthesis of the two worlds.

905
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:08,951
I love the way they melded
the hat out of the flesh.

906
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,385
What a great idea.

907
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,756
And it's so well-sculpted,
painted, conceived.

908
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:18,093
They've created
a very memorable makeup.

909
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:19,561
All right, how about
Rachael and Keaghlan?

910
00:38:19,596 --> 00:38:22,531
They really clearly knew
how to work

911
00:38:22,565 --> 00:38:24,733
with each other's weaknesses
and strengths.

912
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,235
I think they did
an amazing job.

913
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,402
The paint job was beautiful.

914
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:28,971
It looked like metal up close,

915
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:31,874
and the thing was
extremely well-sculpted.

916
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:33,308
Sculpting symmetry,

917
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:34,476
it's one
of the hardest things to do.

918
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:36,478
That's a specific skill.

919
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:39,081
All right, let's move on
to Drew and George.

920
00:38:39,115 --> 00:38:41,183
I know you guys didn't care
for that witch that much,

921
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:42,651
but I really liked her.

922
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,953
I think they just didn't
paint her the right color.

923
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:46,355
There is some beautiful work
on here,

924
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:48,457
but to say
"It won't fit in the hat,

925
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:50,526
so we'll just have
a big, green egg for a head"?

926
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,828
It was a lame reason too

927
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:55,464
to say it's not a witch
without a hat.

928
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:58,700
Well, it's not a winner
without a concept, mate.

929
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:00,869
All right, let's move on
to Damien and Cig.

930
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:02,804
Really cool idea,

931
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,874
and then they put all
that dark fabric on the face.

932
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:07,543
If only they had applied

933
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:11,113
the idea they'd done on the back
of the head to the front.

934
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:13,949
All right, let's move on
to Sasha and Jason.

935
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:15,050
I think it was clear

936
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:16,885
that they had no direction
whatsoever.

937
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,620
There was nothing there
conceptually

938
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:21,623
that was stimulating,
riveting, appropriate.

939
00:39:21,658 --> 00:39:24,459
It didn't reflect Wonderland
or <i>Wizard Of Oz.</i>

940
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:27,996
I think Jason was confused
in the concept.

941
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:31,300
And she didn't have
the courage to speak against it.

942
00:39:31,334 --> 00:39:32,501
All right, judges,

943
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:33,535
have you made
your decisions then?

944
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,603
Yes, we're there.

945
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:37,573
Let's bring them back out.

946
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,048
Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top teams.

947
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:47,816
Stella and Dina,

948
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,319
we love the way
that you chose to fuse

949
00:39:50,353 --> 00:39:52,821
the organic with the inorganic.

950
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:55,524
Keaghlan and Rachael,
your outstanding teamwork

951
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:59,628
led to a beautifully painted
and very well-balanced makeup.

952
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:01,330
All right,
which team came out on top?

953
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,731
The top team tonight is...

954
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:12,681
All right, Glenn,
which team came out on top?

955
00:40:12,715 --> 00:40:14,416
The top team tonight is...

956
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,754
Stella and Dina.

957
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:25,360
What a bounty
of fantastic ideas you had.

958
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:28,964
She was the perfect synthesis
of Oz and Wonderland.

959
00:40:28,998 --> 00:40:29,965
Thank you.

960
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,700
Stella and Dina, nice work.

961
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:34,202
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

962
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:35,370
Glenn?

963
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:37,706
The winner tonight is...

964
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,707
Dina.

965
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:44,179
We absolutely loved the face,

966
00:40:44,213 --> 00:40:46,615
particularly the way
that the ears

967
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:48,216
flowed into the jester hat.

968
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,317
Congratulations.

969
00:40:49,352 --> 00:40:50,585
Thank you so much.

970
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,420
I'm just crazy excited.

971
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:53,722
I'm just a cake decorator,

972
00:40:53,756 --> 00:40:55,123
but I want to be
a makeup artist,

973
00:40:55,157 --> 00:40:57,359
and I feel like
I finally proved myself.

974
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:58,860
Dina, congratulations.

975
00:40:58,894 --> 00:41:03,498
You, Stella, Keaghlan, Rachael,
Drew, and George

976
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:06,468
are all safe and can head back
to the makeup room.

977
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:08,903
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

978
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,475
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

979
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:14,843
are on the bottom this week.

980
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:16,411
One of you will be eliminated.

981
00:41:16,445 --> 00:41:18,780
Please step forward, guys.

982
00:41:26,522 --> 00:41:28,690
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

983
00:41:28,724 --> 00:41:31,126
Damien and Cig,
you let your concept

984
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,228
overwhelm
your decision-making,

985
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:35,864
which led
to an overly busy character

986
00:41:35,898 --> 00:41:37,599
with no focal point.

987
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:39,134
Sasha and Jason,

988
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:42,737
this was another example
of a laundry list of choices

989
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:45,807
that led to
a completely inadequate makeup.

990
00:41:45,841 --> 00:41:47,676
So who is going home tonight?

991
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,378
The person going home
tonight is...

992
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:57,185
Jason.

993
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:59,320
Your concept and color choices

994
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:01,056
undermined the makeup
from the start.

995
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,590
Yeah.

996
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:05,493
Jason, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

997
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:08,763
That means,
Sasha, Damien, and Cig,

998
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:09,798
you're all safe this week

999
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:11,199
and can head
back to the makeup room.

1000
00:42:12,902 --> 00:42:14,903
Thanks, man.

1001
00:42:18,774 --> 00:42:20,208
Jason, I'm so looking forward

1002
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:21,810
to what it is
you're gonna bring

1003
00:42:21,844 --> 00:42:23,678
to the community
of makeup arts.

1004
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:24,746
Thank you so much.

1005
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,081
Thank you so much.

1006
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,416
Jason, it's really been great
having you here with us.

1007
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:30,745
If you'd please head back to the
makeup room and pack up your kit.

1008
00:42:30,786 --> 00:42:32,721
Thank you guys.
It's been an honor to be here.

1009
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:34,773
Good luck, love.

1010
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:36,625
I think I'm going home
a little bit early.

1011
00:42:36,676 --> 00:42:37,659
I just feel like I had

1012
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:41,096
a lot more to prove for myself.

1013
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,197
It's me.

1014
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:43,698
Ohh!

1015
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:44,766
This was the most stressful

1016
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,934
and intense experience
of my life,

1017
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:47,218
but it was definitely worth it.

1018
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,638
I really hope
I made my family proud.

1019
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:51,006
I learned a lot,

1020
00:42:51,008 --> 00:42:52,173
so I'm gonna be walking
out of here

1021
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,909
with my head held high,

1022
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:56,674
and I'm gonna move on
to bigger and better things.
