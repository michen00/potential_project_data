Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,974
Laura's ode to cubism
brought her to victory.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,544
Perhaps your best work yet.

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,414
But Scott's tribute
to surrealism sent him home.

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,850
Now, eight artists remain,

6
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,552
and they'll take on
a high-flying challenge

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,220
that is out of this world.

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,721
It's exciting.

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,324
This is gonna be
a really cool challenge.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,692
But for some artists,

11
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,961
the strain will bring them
to the breaking point.

12
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,262
Do you like the cowl,
or you don't?

13
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,764
I didn't want to say
I didn't like it.

14
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,316
- Well, you should have.
- Maybe take the jaw down a bit?

15
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,268
Mm, no.

16
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,304
- Oh, fuck.
- That's awesome.

17
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,340
I do love the paints,
but it's just muddy as a design.

18
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,676
Something went haywire.

19
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,445
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,180
from Kryolan
Professional Makeup

21
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,217
to one of their 85
international locations,

22
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,620
a 2013 Fiat 500,

23
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:57,723
and $100,000.

24
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,993
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

25
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:04,196
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,043
- Are you proud?
- I am proud.

28
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,362
Last night,
I got top looks again.

29
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,530
It's time for you
to get kicked off.

30
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:56,982
You've been in the top too much.

31
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:59,285
I'm really happy I haven't
been on bottom looks,

32
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,787
but I really just want
to win a challenge.

33
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,406
Let's go, guys!

34
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,070
- It's dark again in here.
- Ooh, spooky!

35
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,940
So, we walk into the lab
and it's completely dark,

36
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,410
and there's a spotlight
on McKenzie.

37
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,545
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

38
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,047
Before movies and television,

39
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,848
people from all over the world

40
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,984
found entertainment
under the big top.

41
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,453
- Oh!
- They were mesmerized

42
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,290
by jaw-dropping performances
that seemed otherworldly.

43
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,960
To this day, the circus
continues to evolve.

44
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,796
Take a look at this.

45
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,999
Oh!

46
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,984
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! Ooh.

47
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,740
Oh, that's so cool!

48
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,843
What?

49
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,311
Oh, yay!

50
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,852
All right,
I'd now like to introduce you

51
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,421
to the co-owner
and creative director

52
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,623
of the cutting-edge
circus troupe

53
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,459
Cirque Berzerk.

54
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,728
Please welcome Suzanne Bernel.

55
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,298
I love Cirque Berzerk,

56
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,401
so this is extremely
exciting to me.

57
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,036
- Hi.
- Hi, McKenzie.

58
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,070
Thank you so much
for being here.

59
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,271
Thank you.

60
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,456
Hi, everyone.

61
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,741
Can you tell these guys
a little bit more

62
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,725
about Cirque Berzerk?

63
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,410
We wanted
to re-invent the circus.

64
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,346
While we tip our hats
to our Vaudeville,

65
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,248
big top, dust bowl roots,

66
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,500
we wanted to bring
the sexy and the dark

67
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:41,203
and the punk rock
back to circus.

68
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,321
- Nice.
- That is so rad.

69
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,789
I love this.

70
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,125
Cirque Berzerk
has successfully re-invented

71
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,261
the circus here on planet Earth,
but for this challenge,

72
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,630
we want you to take things
out of this world.

73
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,265
- Hmm.
- Oh.

74
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,434
Working together
in teams of two,

75
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,052
your spotlight challenge
is to create

76
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,639
a dark and sexy
alien circus performer.

77
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,808
Oh, I'm so excited.

78
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,510
I love the whole circus aspect.

79
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,512
I love aliens.
I love dark and sexy.

80
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,248
And I think that this is gonna
be a really cool challenge.

81
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,382
All right, guys, go ahead,

82
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,518
and you can choose
your teammate.

83
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,119
- Really?
- Let's do it.

84
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,439
I picked Laura because we
always wanted to work together.

85
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,525
I mean, ever since season three,
we would always say,

86
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,793
"You know, we would be
a really good team,

87
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,161
and it'd be
something incredible."

88
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,163
This is gonna be awesome!

89
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,330
I'm excited.

90
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,183
Dude, this is our challenge.
We got this.

91
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,384
_

92
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,654
Everyone's really excited
about doing an alien.

93
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,272
They've been waiting
for this challenge,

94
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,010
and it's just the one
I've been loathing.

95
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,212
Now, there's only one more
thing that you should know.

96
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,847
Oh, gosh.

97
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,465
The performance
that you just saw today

98
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,851
was just a tiny little glimpse
of what will happen

99
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,654
on the reveal stage.

100
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,322
The models you will select

101
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,491
are actually performers
from Cirque Berzerk,

102
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,594
and will take part
in a spectacular performance

103
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,014
as members of
an intergalactic circus troupe.

104
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,699
Fuck yeah.

105
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,302
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

106
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,436
All right, Suzanne.

107
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,838
So, what things
should these artists

108
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,840
keep in mind while
creating their aliens?

109
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,843
Well, we need to have people
be able to jump and flip

110
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,045
and fly through the air,
so they need to be able

111
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,831
to move in their makeup and have
their makeup not come off.

112
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,584
I've never done a makeup
on an actor who had to do

113
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,153
this much movement, and so
it's gonna be a challenge.

114
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:23,172
All right, guys, go ahead
and choose your models

115
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,040
and get started
on your designs.

116
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,425
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, guys.

117
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,994
Thank you, guys.

118
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,597
Day one, we got six hours
in the lab.

119
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,067
We pick our models
and get to work.

120
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,652
On our Samsung Galaxy tabs,

121
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,704
we get to see what
our models actually do.

122
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,339
So our model
is a contortionist,

123
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,940
so she has to be really free,

124
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,508
so we're going tight,
thin appliances.

125
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:44,910
And we can do, like,

126
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,179
some sort of suggestion of,
like, the punk rock mohawk.

127
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,349
So our concept is that
a manned space mission landed on

128
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,751
one of the moons of Neptune,
and an alien

129
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,420
got a punk band tape recorder
from the astronaut,

130
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,422
so our alien's
gonna have a mohawk

131
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,625
and, like, all kinds
of cool punk-rock things.

132
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,976
That's super punk rock.

133
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,078
It's, like, old school
Sex Pistols.

134
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,097
How about something like that?

135
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,232
Almost like an <i>alien</i>
facehugger-type thing?

136
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,101
Yeah, except
it's on its stomach.

137
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,737
So, our character
is a alien animal trainer,

138
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,506
and somehow, he has
a parasite attached to him

139
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,942
from his many years
of training aliens.

140
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,476
I really like that.

141
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:20,546
Oh, he's on the thing.
That's, like, my favorite.

142
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,015
I'd love to make our character
into a ringmaster because

143
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,218
I feel like that's
a really sexy position

144
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,386
to be in a circus,

145
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,255
and because our performer
is on the ring,

146
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,541
it's kind of a little play
on words.

147
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,960
What if we do, like, scales?

148
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,545
I decide we should do scales.

149
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,298
That might look really cool,
and they'll be thin pieces,

150
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,233
and they'll be able to move
on the body well.

151
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,801
That's not a bad idea.

152
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,270
There's this group of carnies,

153
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,139
and she's potentially
the leader.

154
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,508
Our character
is a space contortionist,

155
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,326
and she's the leader
of a circus

156
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,879
and lures in
other space travelers

157
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,447
to become a part
of this circus.

158
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,815
We need to think
about the shape

159
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,350
of the head and the face,
'cause that's what

160
00:06:58,368 --> 00:06:59,785
- we've got to get started today.
- Yeah.

161
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,220
Our performer is doing

162
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,821
all sorts of backbends
and everything,

163
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,606
so it can't be
this big crazy head

164
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,158
'cause she almost
does headstands,

165
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,160
but we want her
to look very regal,

166
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,797
and we come up with this kind
of crown-like, round head shape,

167
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,766
so we're just gonna go with that
and get started sculpting.

168
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,604
Eddie starts blocking out
the cowl,

169
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,339
and I start working
on the face.

170
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,757
Do you think we should
take it back more,

171
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,091
or do you think we should--

172
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,409
'Cause I think it would be cool
if it flows into this...

173
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:25,711
- Yeah, I think maybe.
- ...jaw bone right here.

174
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,005
Yeah.

175
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:32,467
I'm gonna work on the face
while Roy works on the cowl.

176
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:34,686
We want to take
both of our sketches

177
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,257
and try to combine them
into one alien.

178
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,398
Why is everybody so quiet?
It's not art, it's aliens.

179
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,000
- Whoo!
- Let's hear some noise!

180
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,668
I'm excited.

181
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,520
I can tell
you're excited, Frank.

182
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,672
Team Banana Fingers over here.

183
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,706
You would get stuck
with the gimp

184
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:55,991
on this one, wouldn't you?

185
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,110
Roy, my other hand
still works pretty good, bro.

186
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,314
On the art challenge,
I injured my finger.

187
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,852
And I ended up with 13 stitches,
and I still can't feel

188
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,053
most of my finger, and the part

189
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,388
that I can feel
hurts really bad,

190
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,140
so I'm really happy
to have Frank on my team.

191
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:13,859
While Frank blocks up the cowl,

192
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,695
I start the chest
by laying aluminum foil over

193
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,063
a female mannequin torso.

194
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,433
I secure those shapes
by putting duct tape over it.

195
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,303
We pull it off and lay it
down flat on a board.

196
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,772
I trace it with a marker,
and it allows you to do

197
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,775
a one-piece flat mold.

198
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,718
Hey, guys!

199
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,086
Here for a walk-through.
Gonna check on your work.

200
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,637
- Yay!
- It's circus time.

201
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,856
Show us dark and sexy.

202
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,525
We want to bring
a little bit of wrinkling,

203
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,261
but not too much
that it looks old age.

204
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,729
You've got these lines
going here,

205
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,565
the eyebrows, and you've got
your cheeks going into here.

206
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,101
You might even just
combine this into a smooth piece

207
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,270
as opposed to getting
wrinkles into it.

208
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,538
What are you gonna make
the mohawk out of?

209
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,340
We-- we haven't really gone
and looked yet,

210
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,275
but it's not gonna be fun fur,
I promise.

211
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,943
- Or porcupine spines.
- Yeah.

212
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,328
- Okay.
- Nothing that can--

213
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,546
you know, they do a head spin
and stab themselves, and--

214
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,613
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,115
Yeah, let's not
hurt the performers.

216
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,484
We got stuck with a male
who has a ton of hair.

217
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,585
Work with the hair,

218
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,786
- as opposed to trying to...
- Yeah.

219
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,388
...put a cowl
over the top of it.

220
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,490
Otherwise, you're gonna wind up
with a big head like this.

221
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,591
Hair is sexy.

222
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,592
I like the shape of the head.

223
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:21,960
It's different and good,

224
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,496
as opposed to this.

225
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,865
I'm concerned about your face
as far as the sexy goes.

226
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,899
Yeah.

227
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,334
Okay, there's a problem.

228
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,603
How do you bring out
the sexy in your aliens?

229
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,506
Because a pair of eyelashes
isn't going to change that.

230
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,942
Maybe taking
the jaw down a bit?

231
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,243
Mm, no.

232
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,344
Oh, fuck.

233
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,912
I think it's the giant nostrils

234
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,681
that are looking out at me.

235
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,167
The other thing too,
this mouth isn't sexy either.

236
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,518
I like that piece.

237
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,486
But then,
I've liked pieces in the past

238
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,428
and I was on the bottom for it.

239
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,429
It's too busy.
Needs to be smooth out.

240
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,692
I-I don't know.
I...

241
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,563
Coming up...

242
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,631
You don't think it looks good?

243
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,199
We're just not
on the same page.

244
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,801
Fuck.
I hate poly foam.

245
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,903
It's just a big, gobby mess.

246
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,371
That's awesome.

247
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,674
- Something went haywire.
- I don't read him as alien.

248
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:19,146
I'm concerned about your face
as far as the sexy goes.

249
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,114
- Yeah.
- Day one, Mr. Westmore

250
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:22,933
comes by
and he's not digging it.

251
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,519
I'm seeing a really
intricate skull structure

252
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:26,904
going on underneath there,

253
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:29,556
as opposed to a softer one.
It's too busy.

254
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,657
I would smooth it out
a little bit.

255
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:31,658
- Just smooth it out?
- Yeah.

256
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:32,793
Okay.

257
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:34,761
If Michael Westmore
says do it, you listen.

258
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:36,096
- All right, good luck.
- Thank you.

259
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,497
- Good luck, guys. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

260
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:38,899
All right, everybody,
we're heading out,

261
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,001
but cannot wait to see
your performers.

262
00:10:41,035 --> 00:10:42,119
- Thanks, guys.
- Bye, guys.

263
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,987
Bye-bye.

264
00:10:44,022 --> 00:10:46,773
So, we need to go
into a different direction.

265
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,392
I'm trying to think
of all the sexy aliens

266
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:51,311
that I've ever seen, and I
can't think of, really, a lot.

267
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:52,879
You got any ideas?

268
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:54,347
'Cause now we're back kind of
square one on the face.

269
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:55,482
I know.

270
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:57,350
The parameters
for this challenge

271
00:10:57,368 --> 00:11:00,787
are so very specific
about being alien and sexy,

272
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:03,357
and what does
that exactly mean?

273
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:05,725
Let's see here.
Maybe if I take away the brow,

274
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:07,794
and make it a bit softer
that way.

275
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:08,812
It's something about the mouth.

276
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,597
It just looks so reptilian.

277
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:11,698
- It's just--
- Yeah, I know.

278
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,684
I make everything
a little bit more round,

279
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,435
make everything
a little bit more sleek,

280
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,970
and a little bit more sexy.

281
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,438
- It's <i>sexier.</i>
- That looks good.

282
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:19,840
- Yeah.
- It's more alien now.

283
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,344
Yeah.

284
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,014
I can't wait to paint this.

285
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,982
We want to do
this really kind of cool

286
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,019
tree frog/fish painting.

287
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:33,520
We want to use
really bright colors--

288
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:35,489
purple, green, yellow, blue.

289
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,891
The paint job is so fun.

290
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:39,926
I agree.

291
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,863
While Laura's
working on the sculpt,

292
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:45,698
I decide to create
a laser whip,

293
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,900
so I go ahead and grab EL wire.

294
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:49,969
It's a very flexible piece
of wire that lights up.

295
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:52,939
So I take that and take
some L200 and some vacuum form,

296
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,307
and start creating
a laser whip.

297
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:57,310
And then I also start
cutting out pieces and shaping

298
00:11:57,344 --> 00:12:00,379
parts of the rest
of the costume.

299
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:07,720
You know what
this reminds me of?

300
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:09,188
The things in <i>Hellboy.</i>

301
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:10,857
Wasn't it, like, the Angel
Of Death or something like that,

302
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:12,758
that-- that had the head
like that?

303
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:16,028
I totally know
what you're talking about.

304
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,897
I spent quite a while
getting the contours

305
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:19,615
to a point that
it looked really cool,

306
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,100
but I don't want it
to look like something

307
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,101
that's already been done.

308
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:23,486
Time is running out,

309
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,155
so we're gonna
think about it tonight

310
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,708
and move forward tomorrow.

311
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:31,310
Ten minutes!

312
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:39,335
That's time, guys!

313
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,254
- Let's go home!
- Yay!

314
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:42,839
I'm worried because I know that

315
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,257
we have to change
this cowl shape.

316
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,859
I just hope that I have
enough time to sculpt it

317
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:48,678
to a level
it needs to be tomorrow.

318
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:50,546
But I'm not happy
with the character,

319
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:54,700
and I don't know what
I'm gonna do to make it work.

320
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,726
- Bam, bam!
- I'm gonna go look

321
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:05,061
- at the teeth really quick.
- Okay.

322
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:07,980
It's day two in the lab.
We have 9 1/2 hours.

323
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:10,750
Our design is very reminiscent
of another design,

324
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:12,685
and we're gonna have
to change the sculpture.

325
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,437
I'll redesign this front view.

326
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,189
If you want
to just attack that face.

327
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:18,124
I don't want to mold a sculpture
I'm not happy with,

328
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:20,593
so we need to change it
as quickly as possible.

329
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,115
- I'm gonna put the--
- Is this sexy enough?

330
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,450
Yeah, I-I think so.

331
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:31,003
The face looks really sexy,
and I'm liking it.

332
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:34,173
I'm feeling really good
about the makeup.

333
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:39,579
Mr. Westmore
said that we should utilize

334
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:43,149
our model's hair, but all
I sculpted so far are scales.

335
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:44,784
Scales are just texture,

336
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:47,486
and I could go home
if that's all I do.

337
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:49,155
So I'm thinking
that I should do a cowl.

338
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:52,191
I'm gonna make it split
at the top like a mohawk

339
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:53,993
and have all
of his dreads come out,

340
00:13:54,027 --> 00:13:55,995
so we'll still
be using his dreads,

341
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,798
but we'll just have more
of an alien look to him.

342
00:13:58,832 --> 00:13:59,982
- Top look, top look!
- Top look, top look!

343
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,201
Got to keep the Laney
and 'Lana tradition up.

344
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:08,541
I don't think that we should

345
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,793
spend time sculpting
the cowl all over again,

346
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:13,779
so instead, I add little nubs

347
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:15,615
and cut into the top of it,

348
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,950
and rather than having it be
one continuous circle,

349
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:19,485
make it into two forms.

350
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,819
And I think that
looks pretty cool, honestly.

351
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:21,938
I'm with ya.
I think that's awesome, yeah.

352
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:23,659
- I almost like that better.
- Yeah, me too.

353
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,977
Our alien has all these
subdermal piercings,

354
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:30,630
and these pyramid spikes
I embedded in her chest.

355
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,565
And because of my injury,

356
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,899
I'd rather stay out
of the mold room,

357
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,435
so I start sending pieces
to Frank.

358
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,553
He's molding them up.

359
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,672
I'm gonna go make this mold,
you see.

360
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:41,207
All together, I'm gonna

361
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:43,876
be making seven molds
all by myself.

362
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,344
If it was somebody
like Alana or Miranda,

363
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,646
they'd probably
have a meltdown,

364
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,347
but I'm pretty good
at managing my time,

365
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:51,517
so this doesn't worry me
at all.

366
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:57,590
- Ten blenders.
- We decided to make

367
00:14:57,624 --> 00:15:00,092
blender pieces, which
are just really thin pieces

368
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,428
of foam latex that have
a little build up in the middle

369
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:04,196
that smooth down
to all the sides,

370
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,615
and you use them to blend
any edges that show,

371
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,669
like the cowl and the face
on our alien animal trainer.

372
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:13,072
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

373
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:15,975
That's really cool.

374
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,743
Quit sculptin' so damn good.

375
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,029
You guys really made
that departure nicely.

376
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,665
Yay, thank God.

377
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:26,352
I hope that these
don't read too fish-like.

378
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:27,737
I don't think they will.

379
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:30,522
I'm just a little nervous
now about it.

380
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,024
Some scales look a certain way,

381
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,626
and some scales
look another way.

382
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,695
I'm just worried
that it's not gonna blend well

383
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:37,029
or be cohesive.

384
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:41,283
Well, I want to add in
this shape going back on that,

385
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:43,285
so it's not just scales
on the head.

386
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,138
Do what you want,
just own it onstage tomorrow.

387
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:49,575
So, what do you mean
you want me to own that onstage?

388
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:51,077
You don't think it looks good?

389
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,395
I just know
it could look better.

390
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,513
Alana's second-guessing
everything that I do.

391
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:55,781
I'm just, like, hoping that

392
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:57,616
all of this goes together,
you know?

393
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,319
She's really not trusting me
on this one.

394
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:02,221
Well, it doesn't matter
about the sculpture

395
00:16:02,255 --> 00:16:04,507
as long as you
can paint it right.

396
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:06,642
So, I'm confused.
You don't like my sculpture?

397
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:09,945
Oh, God.
We're just not on the same page.

398
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,082
Is that what you're saying?

399
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,128
So, you don't like
my sculpture?

400
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:20,796
Is that what you're saying?

401
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,297
It's day two,
and I'm pretty stressed.

402
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,500
Alana's not liking anything
that I'm doing.

403
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:27,068
I-I just thought that's
what we decided on sculpting.

404
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,203
I just don't want this to look,

405
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,806
like, helmet-y
if we don't blend it.

406
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,808
She's so negative.

407
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:35,778
Everything I do or say,
she's not happy with.

408
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,613
So what would you like me to do
different right now, Alana?

409
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,998
I have one intention

410
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:42,501
and she has another
for this alien ringmaster,

411
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,837
and I think we're
just trying so hard to mesh

412
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:47,573
these ideas together
when it's not really happening.

413
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,158
You want to bring
that same thing,

414
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:50,242
like the big to small,

415
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:52,628
or do you want to do it
from small to big?

416
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,163
I just want them
to be on the head

417
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:55,514
so it's not just a scale head.

418
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,598
I want there
to be something else.

419
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,166
Yeah, I think it needs,

420
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:02,237
like, more form for sure,
so maybe that'll do it.

421
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,673
I'm confused about how
it's gonna blend onto the face,

422
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:06,475
but I have faith in Laney,

423
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:10,445
so I'm just ready
to keep moving forward.

424
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,188
That's looking dope, Eddie.

425
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:20,388
Thanks, man.

426
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,391
It's like intergalactic
Wonder Woman.

427
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:25,427
Yeah.

428
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,763
I could add some light purple.

429
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,165
Like, a periwinkle purple,
like, in the back here?

430
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,266
Hopefully I'll have something
you can play with

431
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,051
- in a little bit and see.
- Okay.

432
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:35,320
We want to run our pieces,
except for the face,

433
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:36,705
in poly foam so we can go ahead

434
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,206
and get everything
pre-painted.

435
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,609
So I take the cowl,
put latex in it,

436
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,911
and start running it
in the poly foam.

437
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:44,496
While Roy
works on the poly foam,

438
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,498
I'm testing paint.

439
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,083
We do want to go in
a blue route,

440
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:50,452
but also put some greens
in there as well,

441
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,921
and I think that'll read alien.

442
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,267
It's, like, getting close
to the end of the day,

443
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,801
and I go to open up the mold,

444
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,739
and it's just a big,
gobby mess of just stickiness.

445
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:13,992
Fuck.
I hate poly foam.

446
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,111
It's like sticking
your hand in honey.

447
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,714
I've already been burned
by poly foam this season.

448
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:23,635
Now I'm burned on it again,

449
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,836
and I've got to get
this thing cleaned up

450
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:26,538
so I can get
my foam running in it.

451
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,390
Poly foam is just not
liking me this season.

452
00:18:28,424 --> 00:18:30,392
Yeah, it is
just not curing well.

453
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,994
No, it's not.

454
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,128
I'm just gonna peel it and we'll
take it and run it for foam.

455
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,429
Yeah.

456
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:37,366
I've never had this much
problem with poly foam.

457
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:46,741
All the teams are still
cleaning their shit out.

458
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,260
All I got do is to write
our name on it.

459
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,912
Right?

460
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:52,281
Time, everybody!
That's time.

461
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,050
I guess we ought
to get out of here.

462
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:57,119
End of day two, Tate and I
are right on schedule.

463
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,370
Up top.

464
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,189
We got everything
about as ready as possible.

465
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:04,226
I think we're ready
for application tomorrow.

466
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:11,600
Let's go!
Let's go get it.

467
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,101
Let's go get it!

468
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:14,670
So, it's application day.
We have four hours in the lab,

469
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,004
and then one hour of last looks

470
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,507
at the stage, and we have
a ton of work to do today.

471
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,975
How'd that cowl turn out?

472
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,777
It's got a couple
of funny spots, but it's fine.

473
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,378
Tate will pretty much spend
the first two hours

474
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,314
working on makeup,
and then I'll jump in

475
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:28,183
and spend the second two hours
applying the cowl and face,

476
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:32,487
and getting the paint job going
on our cool, punk rock alien.

477
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,626
So you're
the galactic contortionist.

478
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,860
We're turning you into, like,

479
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:41,496
a-a crust punk sort
of uh, circus alien, so...

480
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:44,333
- Nice.
- You're a reptilian alien.

481
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,884
We saw that you do
a lot of this,

482
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,737
so we've got a giant bug
on your chest.

483
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,622
We're under a crazy time
crunch, so we'll probably be

484
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:53,925
flying around like chickens
with our heads cut off today.

485
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,797
Let me see how you have yours.

486
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,582
We want to make sure
they're even.

487
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,250
We start applying,
and we get the chest

488
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,986
and cowl down together.

489
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,088
We've got kind of
a complex headpiece,

490
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,272
so it takes some time.

491
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,524
I have to kind of cut back
in certain areas.

492
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:11,276
That is all second skinned.

493
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,694
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

494
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,596
A second skin is when you have

495
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,466
the foam latex and then the skin
and they're not attached.

496
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,817
- But we'll have to...
- Make it work.

497
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,468
Like, definitely pack--
Yeah, make it work.

498
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:23,505
Just like real effects artists.

499
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,114
Okay, I need to go check
on my bug head.

500
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,181
Okay, yeah.
Go for it.

501
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,150
The head
on this little creature

502
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:37,386
that we have on the belly
is a bit heavy,

503
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,122
so I can make an upholstery foam
mold of the head piece.

504
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,657
While that's setting up,
I figure out that I can run

505
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:46,211
a simple tension device
attached to his thigh,

506
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,862
so whenever he bends,
it creates that tension

507
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,664
so that the head will pop up.

508
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,199
Oh, jeez.
He's getting excited.

509
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,013
Really bad edges.

510
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:06,715
I'm really worried
about this cowl.

511
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:09,167
Whatever, the judges
are used to bad edges.

512
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:10,952
The last time I was
in this competition,

513
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,337
the judges said quite often

514
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:15,357
that my face and my cowl
didn't meet up correctly,

515
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,726
and that's exactly
what's happening on this piece.

516
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,846
I think that we maybe have to
blend the edge of the cowl

517
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,330
und-- like, underneath.

518
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,415
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

519
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,634
I don't think
we have time for that.

520
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,052
It's gonna look like
shit if we don't.

521
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:30,505
I went home
for something like that.

522
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,275
I feel like Alana and I
just aren't on the same page.

523
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:35,477
This piece is not working.

524
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,012
Even though it's Laney's piece,

525
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,346
Laney's never been on bottom,

526
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,665
but I have, and they'll
send me home for this.

527
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,517
Do you like the cowl
or you don't?

528
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:43,702
I just think it's too wide.

529
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,070
That's-- When I was looking
at it yesterday,

530
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:46,388
I didn't want to say, like,
I didn't like it.

531
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:47,506
Well, you should have,
because that's when

532
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,292
I was sculpting it
before we molded it.

533
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:52,094
These edges are so awful.

534
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,294
Well, what do you
want me to do?

535
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,813
Make the call.

536
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,848
I know that if we're on bottom,

537
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,550
I'm gonna go home, she's not.

538
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,062
Tell me what to do.

539
00:22:01,938 --> 00:22:03,171
Coming up...

540
00:22:03,206 --> 00:22:04,706
I can't read your mind
right now.

541
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,942
I am so stressed.
This makeup's a mess.

542
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,410
It falls short.

543
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,078
I think she's quite beautiful.

544
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:12,214
Now it's time to put
your makeups to the test.

545
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:21,795
Tell me what to do.

546
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,031
It's application day,
and Alana's just not

547
00:22:24,065 --> 00:22:25,599
into the cowl at all.

548
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:27,868
Honestly, if I was doing
this makeup by myself,

549
00:22:27,886 --> 00:22:28,869
I'd scrap the cowl.

550
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:30,871
If I scrap the cowl,

551
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:33,106
then all I did was scales,

552
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:36,210
so if I'm in bottom looks,
then I'm gonna go home.

553
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:37,661
Let me Frankenstein it.

554
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:40,180
I'll own it.
Like, just let me do this.

555
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:43,400
The cowl looks so big
compared to the face.

556
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:45,919
Like, step back.

557
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:48,205
This cowl's not gonna fly.

558
00:22:48,256 --> 00:22:49,489
Even though it's Laney's piece,

559
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:51,258
I know the judges
are gonna call me out.

560
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,227
All right.
Let's use his hair.

561
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,461
We're running out of time,

562
00:22:54,495 --> 00:22:56,480
so I just finally agree,
let's not use the cowl.

563
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:58,332
Don't you think
that's what's right to do?

564
00:22:58,366 --> 00:22:59,800
Yeah.
Let's-- let's do it.

565
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,334
I think this
should be your call,

566
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:03,103
'cause you really feel like
if we're on bottom,

567
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:04,254
you're going home,

568
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,974
and I want this
to turn into your makeup now.

569
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,842
That's not fair.
That's fucked up.

570
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,944
Well, I know you're not gonna
be confident unless this is off.

571
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,262
So we're scrapping the cowl.

572
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:13,413
We're gonna go something crazy
with the hair

573
00:23:13,448 --> 00:23:14,798
and do an awesome paint job.

574
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:17,718
Let's do this.
Let's-- let's keep you here.

575
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:20,220
All right,
that's 30 minutes, everybody.

576
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:32,833
That's it!
Time's up!

577
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,167
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

578
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:35,802
I think it looks really good.

579
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:37,604
I'm confident about this one,
but my model's

580
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:38,805
not just gonna be
standing there.

581
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:40,524
He's gonna
actually be performing,

582
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:42,943
and my makeup has to stay on
all through the performance.

583
00:23:42,977 --> 00:23:44,211
There's so many things
that could go wrong,

584
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:47,714
and if it does,
you're instantly on bottom.

585
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:55,255
Let's do it, guys.

586
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,124
- Good luck, everyone!
- Good luck.

587
00:23:57,158 --> 00:23:58,392
We get to last looks,

588
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,227
and we've got quite a lot
still to do.

589
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:02,329
So I'm going to finish
painting the face

590
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:04,047
and Eddie's gonna work
on the chest

591
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:05,749
and the body and the wardrobe.

592
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,319
You might want to mix a little
more white into it, maybe.

593
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,726
The first thing we got to do
is the eyes and the mouth,

594
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,227
and while Laura's
working on that,

595
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:19,379
I take it and I start basing out
his hands and his feet.

596
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:20,881
- He's still popping up.
- Yeah.

597
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:23,050
I'm gonna cover that
with a blender.

598
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:27,738
I've never dealt
with anything like this before.

599
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:31,391
Why don't we go like this?

600
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:33,527
In last-looks, I start
with getting some color

601
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:34,945
onto the alien's head,

602
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:37,431
and I'm adding more contrast
around her eyes.

603
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:40,166
I also have
to finish the mouth.

604
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:42,035
15 minutes, guys!

605
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,170
You see all these white dots
that I just put in?

606
00:24:44,188 --> 00:24:45,906
The yellow needs to be
brought down into it.

607
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,707
We're so far behind,

608
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:49,977
and it feels like
I'm a little bit on my own here.

609
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:51,778
I can't read your mind
right now, and I don't--

610
00:24:51,813 --> 00:24:53,280
I can't see
what's in your head.

611
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:54,881
I don't know,
I-I feel like I said it.

612
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:59,451
_

613
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,814
That's time, everybody!

614
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,399
There's so much more depth

615
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,517
that needs to be
in that paint job,

616
00:25:13,568 --> 00:25:14,968
but, at this point,

617
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:19,656
I can only just try to own
what we've put together.

618
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:21,875
Oy vey.

619
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:33,954
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

620
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:37,474
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

621
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,526
Let's say hello
to our talented judges.

622
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,429
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

623
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:43,964
- Good evening, guys.
- Hey, Glenn.

624
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:47,050
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

625
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:49,069
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Ve.

626
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:51,438
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

627
00:25:51,472 --> 00:25:53,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

628
00:25:53,074 --> 00:25:54,458
Hey, Neville.

629
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:56,109
So this week,
your spotlight challenge

630
00:25:56,127 --> 00:26:00,180
was to create dark and sexy
alien circus performers.

631
00:26:00,214 --> 00:26:02,516
Now, I also told you
that your characters

632
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,918
would participate
in a spectacular performance

633
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:06,887
here on our reveal stage.

634
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:10,640
But before we see
our sci-fi circus,

635
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:13,060
let's take a look
at your creations.

636
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,750
I'm really happy with it.

637
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:37,901
I know Laura is too,

638
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,486
so I don't care
what anybody else thinks.

639
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,122
This is a cool-looking alien.

640
00:26:58,973 --> 00:27:00,607
Our piece
isn't pulled together,

641
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:04,194
and I know we're
about to be ripped up for it.

642
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:26,065
I'm very happy.

643
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:28,285
I think this galactic
contortionist

644
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,004
captured our vision.

645
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:50,423
I think it looks pretty cool.

646
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,942
It's got the punk rock element.

647
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:55,162
It feels circus-y,
even sexy.

648
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:01,668
All right.

649
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:03,753
It's time to watch
your creations perform

650
00:28:03,804 --> 00:28:08,425
with Cirque Berzerk
in our very own sci-fi circus.

651
00:28:08,476 --> 00:28:10,343
I think our character
looks great,

652
00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:12,445
but her makeup has
to withstand the performance,

653
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,183
so I'm nervous because you
never know what could happen.

654
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:21,388
What do you think of tonight's
alien circus performers?

655
00:28:21,422 --> 00:28:24,641
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

656
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,693
Now it's time to put
your makeups to the test.

657
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,535
Ooh! Ooh.

658
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,111
That's crazy.

659
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:13,418
Oh, my God.

660
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:15,454
Wow.

661
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,297
Judges, I'm sure you're anxious

662
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:45,167
to take a closer look
at these aliens.

663
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:54,542
Funny stuff going on here.

664
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,944
It's a parasite.

665
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:57,479
I don't understand it
at all, actually.

666
00:29:57,513 --> 00:29:58,730
The head I like,

667
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:00,348
and there's
a lot of really nice details.

668
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,284
It's really asymmetrical,
isn't it?

669
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:04,469
Is it, or is it crooked?

670
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,221
Thanks.

671
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:12,027
The face feels very minimal
in terms of anatomy.

672
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,078
You know what's really weird?

673
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,579
It's the way they painted this.

674
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:16,948
It doesn't really go with
the scale work they put on it.

675
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,633
I am so stressed out right now.

676
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:21,269
It's a mess.
I'm terrified I'm gonna go home.

677
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:25,540
She held together pretty well.

678
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:27,008
Scrunch your forehead.
There you go.

679
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:28,076
That's kind of neat looking.

680
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,534
_

681
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:31,935
_

682
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,049
Look how symmetrical this is.

683
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,784
That's really hard to do that.

684
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:36,918
- Oh, yeah.
- I think it's beautiful.

685
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:39,454
Just all this around
the eye here. Great job.

686
00:30:39,489 --> 00:30:41,556
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

687
00:30:44,994 --> 00:30:48,430
This is just so confusing
as a detail.

688
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:51,443
_

689
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,701
_

690
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:56,872
I do like some of the paint work
going on through here.

691
00:30:56,906 --> 00:30:58,807
I absolutely love
a lot of the paint work

692
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,125
going on on that head.

693
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:03,078
But the belly is very muddy,
difficult to read.

694
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,380
Thank you.

695
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,403
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

696
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:13,822
to learn more about your work.

697
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:17,391
Tate and Frank, you're up.

698
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,266
Tell us about your design
this week, guys.

699
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,268
She's from one of the moons
of Neptune.

700
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,404
A space mission
crashed into it.

701
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:31,339
Her tribe was sifting
through the wreckage,

702
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:33,141
and they came across
the walkman,

703
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:35,326
which had a punk band in it
called "Dumpster Duck,"

704
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:37,712
which is the name
of our character.

705
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:41,783
There's some definite
high points on this makeup.

706
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:42,984
Who did what on this?

707
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:45,937
I sculpted the face
and painted the head.

708
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:49,757
Tate sculpted the chest,
made the mohawk, the tattoos,

709
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,510
and lot of the painting,
and we both worked on wardrobe.

710
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:56,364
I love the clean execution
of the head,

711
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,082
particularly in the paint.

712
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,868
For the time that you had,
that's pretty impressive.

713
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:04,706
The best part about this
makeup is the awesome paint job

714
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,275
that you did
all throughout her body.

715
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,677
Under her skin, where
it looks like stained ink,

716
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:13,748
it actually looks like
that's the coloring of her skin.

717
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:18,219
From chin down to waist,
it's muddy visually.

718
00:32:18,254 --> 00:32:21,689
I do love the paints,
but it's just muddy as a design.

719
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:25,126
Frank and Tate,
you can step back.

720
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:34,068
Miranda and Eddie, you're next.

721
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,225
So tell us about your concept

722
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:42,143
for your alien
circus performer.

723
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,679
Our character is known
as the "Galactic Contortionist."

724
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:48,550
She is a space siren who lures
in other space travelers

725
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,118
to become part of the circus.

726
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:52,270
I sculpted the front
of the cowl,

727
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,255
and Eddie sculpted
the back of the cowl.

728
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,524
I sculpted the face.
Eddie sculpted the chest.

729
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,925
He painted the majority
of the body,

730
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,394
and I painted the head.

731
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:03,731
I think she's quite beautiful
in a very alien way.

732
00:33:05,134 --> 00:33:07,168
She is very regal.
I love the crown.

733
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:09,304
I think the paint job
is beautiful.

734
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:11,089
I do, however,
think she could have been made

735
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,143
to look a little bit
more feminine and sexy.

736
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:16,244
The sexy, I think,

737
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:18,746
is very apparent here,
and here's why.

738
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:21,649
The more symmetrical
a person's face is,

739
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:24,052
generally speaking,
the more beautiful we find them,

740
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,604
and this
is beautifully symmetrical

741
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:29,307
with fine fades
and transitions with the paint.

742
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:32,226
Can we see the back please?

743
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,728
That's awesome.

744
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,864
It looks like a combination
of plant and perhaps sea life.

745
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,435
It works as splendidly
as the front of the head does.

746
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:42,203
There's some gorgeous things
happening.

747
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:44,289
The way you flow up
from the cheekbone.

748
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,190
You create the illusion
of an ear,

749
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:49,193
and it wraps itself back down
into the mandible.

750
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,779
That whole zone
is just handled so beautifully

751
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:53,181
in regards to form language.

752
00:33:53,215 --> 00:33:54,749
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

753
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,769
Please step back.

754
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:05,226
Alana and Laney, you're up.

755
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,468
So tell us about the concept.

756
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:17,588
He is a space womanizer,
and he started the circus

757
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,874
to entertain women
around the galaxy.

758
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:21,609
Who specifically did what?

759
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:25,646
Alana sculpted the face,
and I sculpted all the scales.

760
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,198
Alana helped refine them.

761
00:34:27,249 --> 00:34:29,917
I also sculpted a cowl
that we scrapped

762
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:31,786
'cause of really bad edges,

763
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,371
so my big piece of work

764
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,556
didn't make it
to the stage today.

765
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:41,429
It falls short in feeling
like a dark, sexy alien.

766
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,949
I get that you're trying
to do something different

767
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:47,118
with the skin, but the scales

768
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:52,540
don't transition in
its surface quality or utility.

769
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:53,958
Who did the facial sculpt?

770
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,177
- I did.
- It's interesting.

771
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:57,829
But I don't think that
that bottom lip

772
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,333
lends itself to him
looking sexy or an alien.

773
00:35:02,368 --> 00:35:05,119
I very much like
the beginning of the idea

774
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:06,954
of what started on the side
of the nose,

775
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:10,257
where you started to do, like,
some layers around his nostrils,

776
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,627
but the nose is the only thing
that started to go

777
00:35:12,661 --> 00:35:16,414
in the right direction, and even
that's not a complete idea.

778
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:21,002
Most frustrating is the fact
that he looks goofy carnival,

779
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,555
so I don't read him as alien.

780
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,625
I just really wish
that you would have painted it

781
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,377
so that it made sense.

782
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:30,712
The colors are gorgeous,

783
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:32,113
but the purple
is just kind of like--

784
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,631
Psht! Psht!--
all over the place.

785
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:37,184
I think something went haywire.

786
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:40,021
Alana and Laney,
please step back.

787
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,532
Laura and Roy.

788
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,807
Tell me about this concept.

789
00:35:59,842 --> 00:36:03,177
Our character is
a creature-tamer and performer,

790
00:36:03,212 --> 00:36:06,214
and he also has a parasite-host
relationship going on.

791
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:09,083
I sculpted the cowl.
Laura did the face.

792
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:10,334
We both worked on the chest.

793
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:12,587
Laura did the majority
of the sculpting on that,

794
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:14,121
and I fabricated the outfit

795
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,757
and mechanized the head
on the parasite.

796
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,193
As much as I love the idea,

797
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:23,181
it just feels like it
could have been done better.

798
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:25,316
Taking that parasite
off his chest,

799
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,452
putting it onto his neck
and the upper back

800
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:28,569
would have integrated
better there,

801
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:29,754
and it would have solved

802
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:32,774
a lot of the design problems
that I have.

803
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:36,210
But I do like the shape
and color choices of the head,

804
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:38,512
so this is a mixed bag for me.

805
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,650
I'm not really fond of
the blue coloring on this alien.

806
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:45,603
More color in different areas
to break up that blue

807
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:48,506
would have been really helpful
in this makeup.

808
00:36:48,557 --> 00:36:51,726
The overall vibe of the head
and some of the form choices,

809
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,328
I think, are good,
but I see no point

810
00:36:54,363 --> 00:36:57,064
and a total waste of effort
in the insect

811
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:59,867
just hugging him perfectly
on his chest.

812
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:03,671
It's not your best effort.

813
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:06,707
Laura, Roy, please step back.

814
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,748
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

815
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:15,516
If you'd please
head back to makeup room

816
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:16,834
while they deliberate

817
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,986
and the home audience
tweets about their favorites

818
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,023
using #FaceOff.

819
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:25,292
All right, judges.

820
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,144
Why don't we talk
about tonight's makeups.

821
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:28,880
Let's start
with Tate and Frank.

822
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,832
It's sculpted well,

823
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:33,768
it's applied well,
and the color is gorgeous.

824
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,002
I love that paint job.

825
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:37,305
It looked like
that's what her skin was.

826
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,006
And it was a good compensation
for the lack

827
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,209
of physical texture
on the face.

828
00:37:41,243 --> 00:37:43,611
All right, let's move on
to Eddie and Miranda.

829
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:45,947
Ooh, I think this one was cool.

830
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:48,716
I loved that framework
around the face.

831
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,218
It was like a beautiful crown.

832
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:53,037
I think the sculpting
was really beautifully done.

833
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,522
I thought Miranda
was gonna tell me

834
00:37:54,556 --> 00:37:56,858
that she sculpted
the whole head, front to back.

835
00:37:56,892 --> 00:37:58,926
Eddie did a great job
continuing that aesthetic

836
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:00,328
into the back of the head.

837
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,414
I did really appreciate
the fact that it looked like

838
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,249
it was one cohesive sculpture.

839
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,835
All right, let's move on
to Alana and Laney.

840
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,638
He didn't really
look like an alien,

841
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,440
and the paint job was crap.

842
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:14,475
The scales as a pattern,

843
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,611
I don't think
they were done very well.

844
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,546
Their efforts this week
were hopeless.

845
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,314
The facial sculpt,

846
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:22,350
which sets the tone
for the whole makeup,

847
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:25,903
is not alien, is not dark,
and is not sexy.

848
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:28,823
All right.
Let's move on to Laura and Roy.

849
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:31,058
This is a concept
I cannot get behind.

850
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:35,546
This symbiotic relationship
with an insect-like thing

851
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:37,865
that was poorly designed
and executed.

852
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,402
An overwhelming display
of poor self-editing.

853
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:42,803
They jumped on this concept of

854
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:44,255
"Let's stick something
right there.

855
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:45,673
How genius is that?"

856
00:38:45,707 --> 00:38:48,175
The color palette
was so boring.

857
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,811
- I know.
- It was just a pale blue alien.

858
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:53,047
All right, judges.
Have you made your decisions?

859
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,048
Yes, we have.

860
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,216
- We good?
- Yeah.

861
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,319
Okay, let's bring 'em back out.

862
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:07,061
Glenn, tell us about
the top teams.

863
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:09,563
We really liked several
of the makeups tonight,

864
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,050
but there was one that stood out
above the rest for us.

865
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:22,309
All right, Glenn.
Tell us about the top teams.

866
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:24,945
We really liked several
of the makeups tonight,

867
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,582
but there was one that stood out
above the rest for us.

868
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:34,338
Eddie and Miranda.

869
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,926
We loved the shape of the head,

870
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,311
and we thought
that the paint job

871
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,429
just worked to accentuate it.

872
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,597
Well done.

873
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you guys so much.

874
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,067
Eddie and Miranda, great job,

875
00:39:47,102 --> 00:39:49,670
but, as you know,
we can only have one winner.

876
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:51,071
Glenn?

877
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:55,109
The winner of this challenge
is... Miranda.

878
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,712
Once again,
a brilliant application.

879
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:02,683
Your sculpting, blending,
and painting, all superior.

880
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:04,518
- Really well done.
- Thank you.

881
00:40:04,552 --> 00:40:06,987
I feel so proud to win
my fourth challenge.

882
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:10,274
I think that that's quite
amazing, and I'm so honored.

883
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:12,873
_

884
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,912
Miranda, congratulations.

885
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:17,147
You and Eddie
can head backstage.

886
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,282
Thank you, guys.

887
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,334
Good job, Miranda.

888
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,759
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom teams.

889
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,179
There was only one bottom look
for us tonight.

890
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:37,218
Alana and Laney.

891
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:39,603
All right,
that means Laura and Roy,

892
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:40,854
Tate and Frank,

893
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:42,523
you guys are all safe.

894
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:43,991
Please head back
to the makeup room.

895
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,027
Congrats, guys.

896
00:40:53,969 --> 00:40:58,555
Alana and Laney,
if you'd please step forward.

897
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,479
Laney and Alana.

898
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:07,548
Despite the obstacles
you faced,

899
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:09,750
you missed some
really simple opportunities

900
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:10,851
to correct course,

901
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,320
and therefore delivered
a subpar makeup.

902
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:16,123
All right,
so who is going home tonight?

903
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:18,259
The person
going home tonight is...

904
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,030
Alana.

905
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,765
No!

906
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:28,736
I'm so sorry, Alana.

907
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,405
I'm so sorry.

908
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:34,008
I'm so sorry.

909
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:37,077
Alana, we didn't think
that the character looked like

910
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:40,781
a dark, sexy alien,
and that started with the face.

911
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:42,583
I said this once before,

912
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:44,268
and I'll say it again.
This is the best stress

913
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:45,469
I've ever been under,

914
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,587
and I've learned
so much from everyone here,

915
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,390
especially you guys.

916
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:54,194
Alana, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

917
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,463
Laney you are safe
for this week.

918
00:41:56,498 --> 00:41:59,583
If you'd please head backstage.

919
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:08,642
Alana, I'm so proud
of what you've achieved.

920
00:42:08,677 --> 00:42:12,346
I love your hunger.
I love your passion for this.

921
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,615
I also know
that we have not seen

922
00:42:14,649 --> 00:42:16,884
nor heard the last of you,
sweetie.

923
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,502
I may be gone,
but I'm not over.

924
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:22,523
Alana...

925
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:24,224
it's been great
having you here with us.

926
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:27,911
If you'd please head backstage
and pack up your kit.

927
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:29,897
Thank you.

928
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,570
I'm sad, I'm disappointed,
but I'm proud.

929
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:37,921
It's me.

930
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,909
I really do believe in myself.

931
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:45,279
That's something I couldn't
ever say before <i>Face Off.</i>

932
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,232
I know that this is just
gonna be a motivating factor

933
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:51,568
for me to go home and keep
sculpting, keep painting,

934
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:54,021
and keep being inspired
by the wonderful people

935
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:55,739
that I'm surrounded with.

936
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,875
I'm not gonna stop after this.
