00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:03,585
Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:08,690
Laura earned her first win

3
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:10,258
for her Mother Earth goddess.

4
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:11,325
Thank you.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,761
And veteran artist RJ

6
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,596
was sent home.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,398
Now ten artists remain,
and tonight,

8
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:20,234
they'll reimagine
some all hallows' classics.

9
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,502
- Yes!
- All right!

10
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:23,471
But some will crack
under the pressure.

11
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,273
Oh, damn it.

12
00:00:25,307 --> 00:00:29,110
I cannot go home
on a Halloween-themed challenge.

13
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:32,013
I don't even have
a concept yet.

14
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:33,414
I don't know what to do.

15
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:36,451
I'm literally on the verge
of tears right now.

16
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:37,886
I really do love
what you've done with this.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,153
It's really cool-looking.

18
00:00:39,188 --> 00:00:41,122
It's uninspired and inadequate.

19
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:43,992
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

20
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:45,794
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

21
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:48,797
to one of their 85
international locations,

22
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:52,166
a 2013 Fiat 500C,

23
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,570
and $100,000.

24
00:00:55,605 --> 00:00:58,673
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

25
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,742
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

26

27
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:47,221
I'm still very sad
that RJ has left.

28
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:48,690
It's gonna be rough
around here without him.

29
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:51,292
That's the second veteran
to go home.

30
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:52,493
Now we're down to what?

31
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,629
Four of the newcomers
and six veterans?

32
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:56,264
Some of them are showing
some promise.

33
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:59,034
I'm feeling a little bit
nervous myself

34
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,902
'cause there's not a dud
in the bunch at this point,

35
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,103
and we're all here to win,

36
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:03,905
so it's gonna be tough
from here on out.

37
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:06,941
All right, guys, let's go.

38
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,944
Got a new challenge
waiting on us.

39
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:19,287
We walk in the lab,
and I see all these models,

40
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:22,523
and there are boxes
on each table.

41
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,793
I can't wait to see
what's inside.

42
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,730
Makeup artists
are sometimes given

43
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:31,099
the tiniest bit of inspiration

44
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,367
and asked to turn it
into an incredible character.

45
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:37,072
Well, today's foundation
challenge will be no different.

46
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:40,175
I've placed a box
on each of your workstations.

47
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,145
Inside you'll find a single item
that will serve as the basis

48
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,613
for your creations today.

49
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:48,216
What's in the box?
What's in the box?

50
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,551
Before we get started,
I'd like to introduce you

51
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,787
to someone who knows
exactly what it takes

52
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,122
to excel in Hollywood.

53
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:55,356
She was the makeup designer

54
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,158
on Tim Burton's
<i>Alice In Wonderland,</i>

55
00:02:57,193 --> 00:02:58,492
which won her a Bafta,

56
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:00,561
and she won an Oscar
for her work

57
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:04,265
on <i>Lemony Snicket's</i>
<i>A Series Of Unfortunate Events.</i>

58
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:06,134
Please welcome Valli O'Reilly.

59
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,638
Having somebody
of Valli O'Reilly's caliber

60
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:13,307
judging your makeup
creates a lot of added pressure

61
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:14,308
because this person could be

62
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,844
a potential employer someday.

63
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,078
- Hi, Valli.
- Nice to meet you.

64
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,847
- Thank you for being here.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,149
As the judge
of today's challenge,

66
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:23,651
what are you going to be looking
for in their final makeups?

67
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:25,486
I always want to see
a little bit of a human

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,621
in the makeup.

69
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:28,356
I don't like them
to look cartoony.

70
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,891
All right, guys,
we have a major prize

71
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,860
on the line today.

72
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:34,362
The winner will receive immunity
from elimination

73
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:35,930
in this week's
spotlight challenge.

74
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,331
Oh, hell yeah.

75
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,700
I really need to win this.

76
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:41,702
I have been on the bottom
two weeks in a row,

77
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:44,605
and I don't like it.

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,940
All right,
why don't you all go stand

79
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,243
at your workstations?

80
00:03:48,277 --> 00:03:51,412
You will have two hours
to complete this challenge.

81
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:54,783
On my mark, open your boxes,
and get started.

82
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,185
The time starts... now.

83
00:03:58,254 --> 00:03:59,287
Oh!

84
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,422
- No way.
- Oh, lord.

85
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:03,391
Ooh, teeth.
Everybody has different teeth.

86
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:05,927
I look over,
and Scott has cartoony teeth.

87
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,096
Frank has got
these alien-looking teeth.

88
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,132
Oy.
Mine look like demon teeth.

89
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,867
Immediately I go
over to the prosthetics.

90
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,470
I come across a demon brow,
and I decide that might work.

91
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:21,342
My teeth are sharp,
pointy things, and they're gold.

92
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:23,845
Let's go ahead and go ahead
and get your teeth fit.

93
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,546
My concept is he has
this disease

94
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,248
that caused all
these little tumors on his face.

95
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:30,118
It looks like a scale pattern,
so he becomes, like,

96
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:32,086
this reptile boy.

97
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:33,521
Yeah.
That's good.

98
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:34,522
So I got these purply teeth,

99
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:36,490
and they say
space monster to me,

100
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:40,328
so she's an astronaut that got
some sort of space virus

101
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,396
and is starting to mutate.

102
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,397
Here you go.

103
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:45,200
My teeth look like
cartoon teeth,

104
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:47,235
and I found this little
schoolboy costume,

105
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:48,402
and I've got a rabbit nose

106
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:50,805
that I think I can make work
really well.

107
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,844
Very gory.

108
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,912
I got teeth
that were wired shut.

109
00:04:57,947 --> 00:05:00,614
My concept is that
she's some kind of a prisoner,

110
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,084
so she's kind of wasting away.

111
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:05,286
My teeth look Quasimodo-ish.

112
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,754
They're nicotine-stained,

113
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:08,522
so my character is
a Spanish gunslinger,

114
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,791
and I decide to do
an old-age makeup,

115
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:13,627
so this is really going to be
hard for two hours.

116
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,400
My teeth,
since they're grotesque,

117
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,535
I'm making him into a corpse

118
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,868
that's coming out of the grave
to seek revenge.

119
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:25,999
_

120
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,615
I take fishnet stockings
and apply art gel over it.

121
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:36,985
It's gonna add
a three-dimensional stencil,

122
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:40,654
and I have these scales
that look like little tumors.

123
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:44,292
I got these silver teeth,

124
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:47,461
so I make her into, like,
a cyborg princess.

125
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,197
You have 15 minutes left.

126
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:54,969
Time's up.
Brushes down.

127
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,237
- Hi, Laney.
- Hi.

128
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,472
- How are you?
- I got the silver teeth,

129
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:00,341
so I was thinking maybe
her under-structure

130
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,675
is also made of silver.

131
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
I think it's good.

132
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:03,878
My only suggestion would be,

133
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,880
on this part of the foundation,

134
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,749
the prosthetic has
a lot more fleshy color.

135
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,919
Otherwise it's imaginative.

136
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,954
This is<i>El Sucio,</i>
the dirty bandit.

137
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,422
I wanted to work
with a human character for once.

138
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:15,823
I've made a lot
of monsters already.

139
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:17,091
Very good.

140
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,259
I like what you did
with the skin.

141
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,294
Thank you very much.

142
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,295
This is Ramel.

143
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:21,396
He got this disease

144
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,696
that caused
all these small tumors,

145
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,365
and so he ran off
and joined the circus.

146
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,034
Wow, good texturing.

147
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,635
Really looks like a reptile.

148
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,271
My idea was that this girl
has been enslaved

149
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,672
by an evil man.

150
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:33,908
- He has wired her mouth shut...
- Yeah.

151
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,543
...so she can't eat
or talk back.

152
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:37,278
She almost looks like
a shrunken head.

153
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,446
- Yeah.
- You know?

154
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,547
I think you did a good job.

155
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:41,382
Hey, girl.
Great to see you.

156
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,783
I'm looking around the lab,

157
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:45,886
and I'm feeling like everybody's
doing great stuff,

158
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,257
and it's a totally unique take
across the board.

159
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,591
This is anybody's game.

160
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,593
All right, Valli.
How do you think they did?

161
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:55,229
Overall, I thought
they were very creative.

162
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:57,498
I can't believe how much
they pulled off.

163
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:58,866
Who created
your favorite looks?

164
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,468
My first one I really liked
was yours, Tate.

165
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:01,802
Thank you.

166
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:04,772
I could see him sitting
on a set in some western.

167
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,074
I thought your work
was very good.

168
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:07,541
- Thank you very much.
- Roy,

169
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:09,344
you took those teeth,
and you developed

170
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,545
a whole character
that incorporated everything

171
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,713
that I asked.

172
00:07:12,747 --> 00:07:13,881
I was really impressed.

173
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:15,049
Thank you very much.

174
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:18,152
Miranda, I also liked
the makeup that you did.

175
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:22,023
It was creature-like
but still a little human-like.

176
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:23,124
I thought you did a great job.

177
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,825
Thank you so much.

178
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,760
All right, Valli, who is
the winner of this challenge?

179
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:27,761
The winner is...

180
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,300
Roy.

181
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:33,601
Yeah, Roy!

182
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:35,569
Oh, wow.

183
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:36,637
Thank you.

184
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:38,539
I loved the way
the teeth looked,

185
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,275
and you did a great job
of the human element.

186
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,777
- Thank you.
- Roy, congratulations.

187
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:46,647
You have won immunity this week
and cannot be eliminated.

188
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:48,983
I'm really happy
to have immunity.

189
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:50,318
Now I can breathe
a little bit more freely.

190
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,353
All right, everybody,
I will see you tomorrow

191
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,522
for your next
spotlight challenge.

192
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:55,523
Lovely meeting you.

193
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:56,991
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

194
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:06,100
- Oh, boy.
- Whoa.

195
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,936
We walk into the lab,
and there's fog everywhere,

196
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,239
and McKenzie is standing
in front of a graveyard.

197
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:12,340
It's scary, but it's exciting.

198
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:13,774
Hey, guys.

199
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:16,177
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

200
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:18,212
Your next spotlight challenge
is inspired

201
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,449
by my favorite holiday,
Halloween.

202
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:23,217
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoo!

203
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,952
- Yay!
- I sell prosthetics

204
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,887
during the Halloween season
for a living.

205
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,222
This is what I love,

206
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,757
so I'm excited
about this challenge.

207
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,793
Halloween was once
a serious tradition

208
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:35,696
where people wore costumes
to ward off evil spirits.

209
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,732
Over time,
some of those costumes

210
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,001
have become absolute classics.

211
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:42,736
Come on in, guys.

212
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,172
Oh, God.

213
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,574
- Yes!
- All right, yes!

214
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:50,010
- Wow.
- Okay.

215
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:51,546
I want that clown.

216
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,846
For this spotlight challenge,

217
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,282
each of you will select

218
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:57,585
one of these
classic Halloween characters--

219
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,555
vampire, clown, scarecrow,

220
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,390
skeleton, devil--

221
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:03,924
and bring it to life

222
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,295
as a completely reimagined
creature of the night.

223
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,862
This is fun.

224
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:11,632
Okay, Scott, you're up first.

225
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,334
- Clown.
- Vampire.

226
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:14,902
I am the devil.

227
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:17,105
Oh, my God, thank you.
Vampire.

228
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,939
- Devil.
- I was just like,

229
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:20,674
please not skeleton,
please not skeleton.

230
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:22,076
Scarecrow.

231
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,179
- Clown.
- Skeleton.

232
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,447
Scarecrow.

233
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,617
Of course,
the last one is skeleton.

234
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:30,784
I just have no idea

235
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:33,521
what I'm gonna do
for this character.

236
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,756
Okay, before I send you
off to work,

237
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,326
there's one more component
to this challenge.

238
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,860
In the spirit of Halloween,

239
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:43,797
I want each of you to add
a trick element of some kind

240
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,333
to your characters.

241
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,767
It could be anything,
from a simple bladder

242
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,870
to a blood gag,
or LEDs or fiber optics.

243
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:51,539
The first five years
of my career,

244
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:52,706
that's all I did.

245
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,176
Blood gags, bladders,
things that move.

246
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,910
So I've got a million ideas.

247
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:59,147
I want you to go ahead
and pick your models,

248
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,115
and I will see you tomorrow.

249
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,116
- See you.
- Bye.

250
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,451
Thank you.

251
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,057
I really have no intention
of letting immunity change

252
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:11,091
my concept or what I do.

253
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,326
I always go over the top
a little bit,

254
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,128
because if you don't have
the concept

255
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:15,996
to start out with,

256
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,299
you don't really stand
a chance in this competition.

257
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,933
I want to paint my devil black,

258
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:21,369
and I'm thinking
it'd be beautiful

259
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,104
to do oranges under the black.

260
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,975
For my trick, I'm thinking
of fabricating bat wings.

261
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,077
My concept is to keep
the devil pale,

262
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:31,879
which is something
I haven't seen before.

263
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,215
I really want her
to be ram-like,

264
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:37,084
but instead of doing horns,
I decided to use lava shards.

265
00:10:37,118 --> 00:10:40,421
For my trick, I'm gonna put
LEDs behind silicone,

266
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:43,257
it'll give the effect of lava.

267
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,893
I'm having trouble
with the design for a skeleton

268
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:49,029
because you can't take away
the human anatomy.

269
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:50,030
We can only build on top of it.

270
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,399
A skeleton doesn't have a nose.

271
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,568
Like, you can't cut off
somebody's nose,

272
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:56,604
so it's extremely difficult.

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,940
Frank and I both picked
the scarecrow.

274
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:02,276
My character's gonna be feeding
on crows.

275
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,044
The chest is made of twigs
and has

276
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,313
a few dead crows on the inside.

277
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:06,347
Fuck yeah, dude.

278
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:09,383
My gag is to make
his chest bleed.

279
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,651
What about you?
What you got going on?

280
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:11,819
This is the silhouette
of the dude.

281
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,053
Oh, that's cool.

282
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,323
I design a very standard
scarecrow monster,

283
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:17,358
which the judges could like
for its simplicity

284
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:20,194
or not like because I'm not
reinventing it enough.

285
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:21,696
And I'm gonna probably make
its eyes glow.

286
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,898
- That's awesome.
- That's my gag.

287
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:34,709
Once I'm confident
with my design for the skeleton,

288
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:37,478
I start sculpting.

289
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:38,946
I think
I'm onto a cool character.

290
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,481
I'm calling it
"The Lady Of The Cemetery."

291
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:43,484
She is a corpse pushing herself
out of the ground.

292
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,253
Her tombstone
comes up with her.

293
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,724
For my trick, I'm going to do
a beating heart.

294
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:52,326
I've been struggling
with this damn skeleton all day.

295
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,629
It's so frustrating.

296
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,731
Everyone else is already
sculpting their characters,

297
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:59,767
and I don't even have
a concept yet.

298
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:04,387
I am literally on the verge
of tears right now.

299
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:05,198
_

300
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:08,342
Coming up...

301
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:09,443
Oh!

302
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,845
I cannot go home
on a Halloween challenge.

303
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,381
I really do love
what you've done with this.

304
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:15,883
It's uninspired and inadequate.

305
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:26,235
It's day one
of the Halloween challenge,

306
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:27,770
and I'm having trouble
with the design

307
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:29,004
for a skeleton,

308
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,939
but I start to piece together
an idea.

309
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:33,976
I have to ask you
about <i>Dia de los Muertos.</i>

310
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,545
<i>Dia de los Muertos</i>
is a Spanish holiday.

311
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,449
It's people offering tribute
to their dead ones

312
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:42,385
at the cemetery,
and there's a lot of skulls.

313
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:43,486
Okay.

314
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,954
I'm thinking I can make
this character

315
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:48,223
a voodoo doctor
that people go to

316
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:50,125
to bring their loved ones
back from the dead.

317
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,595
I'm doing a face sculpt,
the hands,

318
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:53,729
and fabricating a headdress.

319
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,032
I'm just nervous about
my ability to complete all this

320
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,967
in such little time.

321
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:05,508
I'm making this vampire
that's a half man, half bat.

322
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,810
Since it's a nocturnal creature,

323
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:10,846
I'm using lights in the eyes
as my trick.

324
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:14,817
- How you doing, Scott?
- I'm okay.

325
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,886
I might be able to get this
molded and out today.

326
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,523
The basic concept for my clown
is that he's a serial killer.

327
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:22,758
And he has ripped
his own heart out,

328
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:25,795
so my joke is to have him
holding a heart

329
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,697
that makes noise
when it's squeezed.

330
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,800
I'm having so much fun
with my clown.

331
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:33,969
For the trick,
I build a fake stomach on her

332
00:13:34,003 --> 00:13:36,138
and have her pulling out
her intestine.

333
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,206
I get it done fairly quickly,

334
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,777
and then I decide to mold it.

335
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,012
I'm the only person
in the mold room,

336
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:45,714
which feels pretty cool.

337
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:48,784
I never really make it there
on the first day,

338
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:51,987
so I'm doing awesome.

339
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,795
I'm really nervous
about sculpting this skull.

340
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,864
The skeleton has to be
anatomically correct.

341
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:04,232
If I have one contour
out of place,

342
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,734
the judges will just kill me
for it.

343
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:07,402
What can I do to hide her nose?

344
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,037
Just paint it black.

345
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:10,539
I don't know what to do
with this area.

346
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,207
- You think this looks fine?
- Absolutely.

347
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:13,476
Do you think
I should have it, like,

348
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,010
more like she's wearing it?

349
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,680
I wish Miranda would accept
her talent level.

350
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:19,949
This is a lot of stuff
I don't exactly know how to do.

351
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:21,750
All of us are looking
at her sculpts going,

352
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:22,985
damn, you're a prodigy.

353
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,599
You're totally fine.

354
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,500
_

355
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:26,722
All right, well, then,
I'm gonna quit telling you

356
00:14:26,756 --> 00:14:28,491
it looks fine
if you're gonna keep telling me

357
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,492
it looks stupid.

358
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:31,827
Oy, fuck.

359
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:34,530
Laura, what's your concept?

360
00:14:34,564 --> 00:14:36,031
I simplified the design

361
00:14:36,065 --> 00:14:38,400
so that I could concentrate
on details.

362
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,469
My vampire starts out pretty,

363
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,872
but he starts feeding
on himself,

364
00:14:42,906 --> 00:14:46,041
and he becomes very emaciated,
and his skin turns gray.

365
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,544
So my trick's gonna be blood
just kind of spewing

366
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:49,545
out of his arm.

367
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:50,913
Oh, wow.

368
00:14:59,422 --> 00:15:01,657
I am definitely not
where I want to be

369
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,759
at the end of day one.

370
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:05,394
That's time, everybody.
Let's go home.

371
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:06,695
At this point in the challenge,

372
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,030
we're all drained.

373
00:15:08,064 --> 00:15:10,833
My extra years of life
are starting to show.

374
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,535
Let's do this.

375
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:21,911
It's day two
of our Halloween challenge,

376
00:15:21,945 --> 00:15:24,279
and we have 9 1/2 hours today.

377
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:25,714
Oh, you're so ugly.

378
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:28,250
I still need to refine
some of the features

379
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:29,418
on my sculpture,

380
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:32,354
but at this point,
I have to get it molded.

381
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,258
Today I have to get
my sculpt detailed out

382
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:37,259
and ready for foam.

383
00:15:37,293 --> 00:15:38,393
In a skeleton

384
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,128
where would obviously be
the body cavity,

385
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:43,398
I decide to go
with deteriorating anatomy,

386
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,100
so the judges
aren't gonna walk up

387
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:49,004
and see a black painted hole.

388
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,405
Hello, everybody.

389
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,740
Hi.

390
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,341
We're here to do
our walkthrough.

391
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:54,409
Mr. Westmore and McKenzie
come in.

392
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:55,844
- Hey, Laura.
- Hi.

393
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,079
I'm extremely excited

394
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:58,914
to see what kind of advice
he has to give.

395
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:59,949
I got vampire.

396
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:01,584
- Vampire.
- For my gag,

397
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:04,252
I'm gonna put
a strip of foam on his arm

398
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:05,854
and then have him bite into it.

399
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:06,956
- So blood will pump out?
- Yeah.

400
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,624
That's why he's all feral,

401
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:09,825
- and he's getting--
- I like it.

402
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,393
But you're gonna need
a bigger tube...

403
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:12,661
- Mm-hmm.
- ...'cause that isn't gonna get

404
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:13,729
much blood through it at all.

405
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:14,830
Okay.

406
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:16,665
I picked the devil,
and my trick

407
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,766
is that I want to make wings.

408
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,201
Boy, you have a lot going
for you.

409
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,136
- But it looks great.
- All right, so with immunity,

410
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,905
are you able to relax
a little bit, or--

411
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:24,640
No, 'cause I want
to win this one.

412
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,441
Well, I got skeleton.

413
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:29,344
Her black heart is going
to be beating.

414
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:30,679
I'm going to insert a bladder.

415
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,380
How is she actually gonna make
the bladder work?

416
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:34,583
- Yeah.
- You think something like this?

417
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,152
You're gonna need something
larger than a turkey baster.

418
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:38,854
Worst-case scenario,
I can always go with breath,

419
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,689
- but I would really prefer not--
- You can follow behind.

420
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:43,125
- Yeah.
- I've been there.

421
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,393
- I chose a vampire.
- Okay.

422
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:48,030
The trick,
I'm adding light to the eyes.

423
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:50,332
You're gonna have to leave
enough room in here.

424
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:53,602
Otherwise, he's gonna be doing
this to try to see.

425
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,937
Typically,
when you think "devil,"

426
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,538
it's like that red skin.

427
00:16:56,572 --> 00:16:58,807
And I really want to go albino
because they're underground,

428
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,209
and my inspiration for the face
was a ram.

429
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:03,178
Are you going to get it
into the nose?

430
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:05,014
'Cause I'm seeing
human nose here.

431
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,581
That doesn't say animal.

432
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:07,716
I picked scarecrow.

433
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,018
This is
a very static character.

434
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:10,719
A devil isn't, a clown isn't,

435
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:12,121
but the scarecrow is.

436
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:14,256
I think you should do away
with the human lips on there.

437
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,691
Otherwise, it's gonna look
like a mask on it.

438
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:16,692
Gotcha.

439
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:17,960
I'm scared I'm not going

440
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,129
original enough to--
like, you know,

441
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:21,797
it has the big nose,
the chin, and the cheeks,

442
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,198
and the big ears.

443
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,399
I don't think there's so much
problem with that.

444
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:25,701
I think it's your painting

445
00:17:25,735 --> 00:17:27,102
that's gonna make
the difference

446
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,638
because all the clowns' faces
are all human beings,

447
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,808
yet they look so different
because of the paint jobs.

448
00:17:32,842 --> 00:17:33,976
All right, everybody.
We're heading out.

449
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,977
It's looking great.

450
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:36,178
Thanks, guys.

451
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:37,379
Can't wait to see your tricks
and treats.

452
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:40,248
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, thank you.

453
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:50,192
I'm opening my cowl mold,

454
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:52,861
and I have no trouble at all
getting the back off,

455
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,563
but when I try the front...

456
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:57,800
Oh, damn it.

457
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,267
It locks.

458
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:03,371
Want me to help you out?

459
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:06,175
Come on.
People are trying to help me.

460
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:08,911
Time is ticking down,
and I'm starting to panic.

461
00:18:11,948 --> 00:18:13,015
Oh!

462
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:14,249
Oh, my God.

463
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:17,052
I cannot go home
on a Halloween challenge.

464
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:25,055
My cowl mold locks.

465
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,323
- Whoa.
- Fuck.

466
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:27,490
Part of it breaks off.

467
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:30,794
Finally, after a lot of pulling
and pushing

468
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:32,562
and digging and help,

469
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:33,830
I get it open,

470
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:37,367
and sure enough,
there's a huge crack.

471
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:41,238
This is the problem that
can absolutely destroy a makeup.

472
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:44,641
One bad edge can send me home,

473
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:48,011
so I'm just gonna have to pray
for the best.

474
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:58,388
So I finished molding
my clown face,

475
00:18:58,423 --> 00:18:59,957
and it's ready for foam.

476
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:03,060
Next I start fabricating
intestines.

477
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:06,229
I paint several latex layers
on the floor.

478
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:08,398
Once it dries,
I roll the latex together,

479
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:11,734
and it will form a coil.

480
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:20,277
After I get my molds ready
to be run in foam latex,

481
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:23,113
I start sewing together
a burlap mask

482
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:24,747
that the actor's gonna rip off
onstage.

483
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:27,317
Ten minutes left!

484
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,119
I look across the lab,

485
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:30,820
and I see
so many outstanding makeups

486
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:32,122
that I have no idea
who's gonna win this challenge.

487
00:19:33,824 --> 00:19:35,058
I'll finish this up
in the morning.

488
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:36,826
By the end of the day,
I'm a little nervous.

489
00:19:36,861 --> 00:19:39,463
I know I have a lot of work
to do on application day...

490
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:40,630
Time, guys!

491
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:44,267
...but I'm confident
I can get it done.

492
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:55,545
So today's application day.

493
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:56,546
Good luck, everybody.

494
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,448
We have four hours in the lab,

495
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:00,550
and then we have one hour
at last looks.

496
00:20:00,584 --> 00:20:01,751
Oh, boy.

497
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,054
The very first thing I notice
is the cowl.

498
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:07,190
That's unusable.
It's torn in several places.

499
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,291
Damn it.

500
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:09,426
There is really no way
to fix that,

501
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,262
other than to scissor out
from the inside

502
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,031
and remake a new thin edge,

503
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:15,499
and there's no way
I can do that

504
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,767
with all the applying, painting,
and fabricating

505
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,936
I have to get done today.

506
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:25,942
I'm Eddie.
Nice to meet you.

507
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:26,976
Matt.
It's good to meet you, man.

508
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:28,078
Morning. Hoyt?
Laura.

509
00:20:28,112 --> 00:20:29,312
Today you're gonna be
a scarecrow.

510
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:31,181
- Got you again.
- Yes, sir.

511
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:32,516
A woman of her word.

512
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,550
There's a lot to do today.

513
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:34,817
Apply the hands.

514
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:35,852
Apply the face.

515
00:20:35,886 --> 00:20:37,354
Paint the hands.
Paint the face.

516
00:20:37,388 --> 00:20:39,389
Adorn the dress.
Make this headdress.

517
00:20:39,424 --> 00:20:41,858
Get these LED lights
into these roses.

518
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,026
And I just don't know

519
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:46,096
how the hell I'm gonna do
all of this.

520
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,797
I have
at least 26 prosthetics...

521
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,466
- Oh, my--
- ...to put on you,

522
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,667
but they're just
little booties.

523
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,569
I'm super excited
about my makeup.

524
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:54,737
The edges are beautiful.

525
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:56,639
I put her face on.

526
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:59,242
That fits her perfectly well.
So does the belly.

527
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:01,111
I love success!

528
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:02,946
Now I just hope
the rest of the day

529
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,381
will go this smoothly.

530
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:06,349
Oh, my God.

531
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:11,088
I mix five different batches
of silicone

532
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:13,323
trying to get the translucency
and the fluorescents

533
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,357
that I need of lava.

534
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:15,858
These aren't working?

535
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:16,960
And then the light breaks.

536
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,595
Plan fucking B.

537
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:21,198
So I decide to use
the ball light.

538
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,699
Ah, this isn't gonna stay now.

539
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,101
I need hot glue.

540
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:26,069
Does anyone have
a hot glue gun on?

541
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,572
I glue these LEDs
into my lava rock,

542
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:30,273
but when I finally go
back to put the silicone

543
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,275
over the lights...

544
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,344
My silicone just fucking set.

545
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,445
Fuck!

546
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,080
So now I have to remix
the silicone

547
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:39,282
and get it on top
of this lava rock.

548
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:40,617
I'm really getting hard
on myself,

549
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:45,054
and I can't because I have
way too much to do.

550
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:46,756
I'm feeling
a little self-conscious

551
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,626
because I've been in trouble
with the judges

552
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,061
for using a lot of contrast
and hard lines,

553
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:54,731
which I'm very used to using
because I'm a body painter.

554
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:58,001
So doing this
realistic paint job,

555
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:59,902
it's very nerve-racking.

556
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:11,981
Old-age stipple latex
has a high ammonia count,

557
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:14,217
which keeps it thin.

558
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:16,520
Moments before it fully dries,
it's set,

559
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:18,188
but it's still
a little fragile,

560
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:19,922
and it will catch
in certain spots,

561
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:21,258
creating different-sized holes,

562
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,925
kind of like a run
in a pantyhose.

563
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,828
This will cause your skin
to look all old and withered.

564
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:28,031
It's a pretty cool trick
for a zombie-type flesh.

565
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:36,005
This is so awesome.

566
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,507
Laney has made the decision

567
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,277
to use real cotton candy
for hair.

568
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:41,778
If you know what
cotton candy is,

569
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:43,813
it's just spun sugar.

570
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:46,349
And what happens to sugar
whenever it gets hot?

571
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:48,552
It melts.

572
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,953
These are actually working
really well.

573
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:54,524
And, you know, I don't think
that she's considered that.

574
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,559
Oh, my God.

575
00:22:55,593 --> 00:22:57,827
I love it so much.

576
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,500
How's that feel
around your nose-- secure?

577
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:05,468
- Yeah.
- I get my face and my cowl

578
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:08,071
down onto my model,
and I'm like, oh, my God.

579
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:09,406
This looks like a cat bunny.

580
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,941
It isn't evil or demonic.

581
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,710
I should have listened
to Mr. Westmore.

582
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,845
He was concerned the nose
could be a bad choice.

583
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:17,947
I'm such a piece of shit,
I can't stand it.

584
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,550
But it's too late now.
There's nothing I can do.

585
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:23,587
My heart is racing so hard
right now.

586
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,458
I'm working next to Miranda,

587
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,494
and she's got her shit
all over the place as usual.

588
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:33,630
Miranda, I need
those scissors back.

589
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:34,831
I have them.

590
00:23:34,865 --> 00:23:36,032
I'll get them to you
before we go, I promise.

591
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:37,100
But I'm working
on something now.

592
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:38,568
Oh, okay, dude.

593
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:40,303
I'm actually surprised
at how far behind

594
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,804
Miranda seems to be.

595
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,905
- Here's the scissors.
- Jeez.

596
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,940
It's all good.
Yeah, I got it.

597
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,609
- I just gotta...
- Thank you.

598
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:47,810
...mentally try to figure out
what's going on.

599
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,112
Looking around the room,

600
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,513
everybody's
pretty much finished,

601
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:53,717
and I've only just started
applying the prosthetics.

602
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,118
11 minutes, guys.

603
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:56,353
I'll be right back.
Gonna get gloves.

604
00:23:56,387 --> 00:23:58,688
Hopefully I can pull this
together in last looks,

605
00:23:58,723 --> 00:24:02,892
because that's all I have.

606
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:04,628
All right, that's time!

607
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:07,664
I really think
I could be going home.

608
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,234
- Coming up...
- Here we go.

609
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:14,003
There's no way
that I'm gonna finish in time.

610
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,172
This has fallen a little short
this week.

611
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,040
I'm loving this makeup.

612
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,997
- Whoo!
- Here we go.

613
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,799
Last looks, we have one hour,

614
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,834
and it goes by so fast.

615
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:32,837
Does anybody have
a dark brown airbrush paint?

616
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,005
Yup.
It's right there.

617
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,308
I still have to paint
the entire character

618
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:38,443
to make it look decent.

619
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,714
There's no way that I'm gonna
finish it in time.

620
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,816
And do something
about this hair.

621
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,185
Her cotton candy hair
completely melted off,

622
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,089
and her prosthetic is falling
off her face.

623
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,357
15 minutes, everyone!

624
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,160
Take a sip of this.

625
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,161
All it is
is corn syrup and water.

626
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,083
Wash it around in your mouth.

627
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,200
There you go.

628
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:03,332
Yeah.

629
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,343
Time!
That's it, guys.

630
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:14,546
God!

631
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,190
Welcome
to the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

632
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:29,327
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

633
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,529
Let's say hello
to our talented judges.

634
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,633
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

635
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,668
- Good evening.
- Hey, Glenn.

636
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,604
Three time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

637
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,573
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Ve.

638
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,743
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

639
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,811
- Boo.
- Hey, Neville.

640
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,013
All right, so this week,

641
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,182
your spotlight challenge
was to choose

642
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,850
a classic Halloween character

643
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,287
and reimagine it
as a creature of the night,

644
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,822
and in keeping with the spirit
of Halloween,

645
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,925
I also asked you to incorporate
a trick element

646
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,193
into your designs.

647
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,195
So let's take a look
at your creatures.

648
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,650
If I was hired on a movie

649
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,686
to make a scarecrow monster
like that,

650
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,554
I would think I pulled it off.

651
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,123
It's a complete character.

652
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,039
I feel like
I accomplished my vision.

653
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,142
I've always wanted to get
a vampire makeup on this show,

654
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,777
and I'm definitely thinking

655
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,780
that this could even be
a top look.

656
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,196
I could be in bottom looks

657
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:15,533
because of my poor application

658
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:18,336
and the cotton candy melting.

659
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:34,853
I think at least I'm going
to be safe.

660
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,690
I'm feeling better about it
because it's a finished design.

661
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:56,741
The wings are actually working

662
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:57,942
the way that they're
supposed to.

663
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,343
I like the profile of it.

664
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,614
I'm liking everything
about this makeup.

665
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:18,195
I can't see the bird skeletons
from far away,

666
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,298
so the torso looks like
a big mess,

667
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:23,367
but I'm happy with what I did.

668
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,616
I'm proud of my time
management and execution.

669
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:42,153
I could see this
on my business card.

670
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,205
The face isn't as creepy
as it should be,

671
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,575
but it's
a beautiful application.

672
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:05,176
Hopefully that's enough
to spare me

673
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,912
from being a bottom look.

674
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,628
I think I've accomplished
the task.

675
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:24,829
I really like

676
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,964
the metal rivets
in the cheekbones.

677
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,466
I think it looked pretty cool.

678
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:43,648
I thought I was gonna be
sending out

679
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,949
an unfinished makeup,

680
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:49,120
but I look at it,
and it's a cool character.

681
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,792
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look

682
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:57,194
at tonight's creatures?

683
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,602
Can you open your mouth?

684
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,470
I just feel like
we've seen this before.

685
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,941
It's a good execution
of another interesting idea.

686
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,510
Mm.
Hmm.

687
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,145
The teeth are kind of
falling out on you.

688
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,147
One part I do like
is right here.

689
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:19,784
It's almost as if the gum
has been torn off.

690
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,922
That's creepy.

691
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,322
I think she looks good
from far away

692
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:26,658
but not so good from up close.

693
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,193
I see the judges
turn her around,

694
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,396
point at the hair, and I know
the wig cap is showing.

695
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,165
The cotton candy's melted.

696
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,900
I think the ears are very odd.

697
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,369
Those are
just unusual sculptures.

698
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,938
Furl your brow.

699
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,074
I'm starting to get
really nervous

700
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,309
because they wouldn't be able
to use this piece for a film.

701
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,311
I think
that could send me home.

702
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,283
Who made your favorite
Halloween creature?

703
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,319
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

704
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,307
I think the ears are very odd.

705
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,812
Oh, my God.

706
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:05,970
I love my make-up so much and
this last hour everything went so wrong.

707
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:10,550
I could be in bottom looks
because of my cotton candy hair.

708
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:15,989
I hate this part so much.

709
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:17,891
I'm just revealing

710
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,126
your superfluous
bony protuberances here.

711
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,162
- That served no purpose.
- None.

712
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,502
I've never seen this paint job
done on the show before.

713
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:32,705
Give us your wing.

714
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,173
- Bats have fur on them.
- Yeah.

715
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:36,876
It's kind of a cool idea.

716
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,613
See, this--
if there would have been

717
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,015
more black feathers,
that would have helped me.

718
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:43,249
Ooh.

719
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:44,551
It's hard to read that
that is what it is.

720
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:45,852
- 'Cause it's a cool idea.
- It sure is.

721
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:49,422
Thank you.

722
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:51,157
You just got a creepy grin,
don't you?

723
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:52,625
Yeah, I know.

724
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,794
Getting a little tired
of this motif.

725
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:56,863
It doesn't really connect nicely
in terms of your form.

726
00:31:56,897 --> 00:31:58,531
- Once-- twice.
- Not needed.

727
00:31:58,566 --> 00:32:02,035
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

728
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,469
I don't get what this face does

729
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:06,272
for the design that
we're supposed to be looking at.

730
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:08,140
It's totally disconnected.

731
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:12,178
I don't get it.

732
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:14,714
The sculptural details
are better close-up,

733
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:16,015
but he's obliterated them

734
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,051
with those really hard
red lines.

735
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:21,420
Mm-hmm.

736
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:24,457
- It's nice.
- Oh, the hands are cool.

737
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:25,592
It's well done up close.

738
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:29,963
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

739
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,735
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

740
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:37,369
Let's find out
what they thought.

741
00:32:37,704 --> 00:32:39,772
Laura.

742
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:41,573
Miranda.

743
00:32:41,608 --> 00:32:43,776
Eddie.

744
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,879
Frank.

745
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:48,881
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

746
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,249
and can head
back to the makeup room.

747
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:59,125
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

748
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,726
The judges would like to speak
with each of you

749
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,395
to learn more about your work.

750
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:04,596
Scott, please step up.

751
00:33:11,004 --> 00:33:12,671
Tell us about your concept.

752
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,407
Rather than just go
for a rather typical clown,

753
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:18,144
he's a reincarnation
of a serial killer.

754
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:22,982
It feels like artrite treatment
of the head form.

755
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:25,318
The sculpture is so wacky
and lopsided.

756
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:27,653
He's like a misshapen
Bert and Ernie.

757
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:28,821
I'm not thrilled with this.

758
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:29,888
Okay.

759
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:31,257
I would have maybe
taken advantage

760
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:33,826
of a bit more clown-like makeup,

761
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,428
and I know
that it's the classic red nose

762
00:33:35,462 --> 00:33:36,662
and red lips,

763
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:38,464
but it just looks
thrown together.

764
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:39,731
Okay.

765
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:41,200
I'm not sure exactly
what you were doing

766
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:43,169
with your paint
with the piercings,

767
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:45,071
but I do like the idea
of those pinched cheeks

768
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:46,072
pulling up his mouth.

769
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:47,706
Okay.

770
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,442
Scott, please step back.

771
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:50,776
Thank you.

772
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:57,683
Roy, please step up.

773
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:02,654
Tell us
about your devil concept.

774
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:04,923
The devil is chained into hell,

775
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,126
but every Halloween,
he's given the strength

776
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,295
to break his bonds
and walk among humans.

777
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,698
Raise your wings up.

778
00:34:12,732 --> 00:34:15,334
Yeah, I like it.

779
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:16,802
I'm really intrigued
by this paint job.

780
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:20,973
It's kind of like frozen lava.

781
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:23,075
To me, the highlight
is that facial sculpt.

782
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,677
I wish, color-wise,
it popped a little bit,

783
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:27,713
but overall, I do dig it.

784
00:34:27,747 --> 00:34:29,982
- Thanks.
- Roy, thank you.

785
00:34:30,017 --> 00:34:34,586
- Please step back.
- Thank you.

786
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:37,623
Laney, come forward.

787
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:43,195
Tell us about your character.

788
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,630
She's a killer clown.

789
00:34:44,664 --> 00:34:47,933
I absolutely loved this
until I realized

790
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:52,071
that cotton candy hair
was a terrible mistake.

791
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:54,140
If something goes
terribly wrong,

792
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,141
don't tell me about it.

793
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:56,742
That wasn't even on my radar.

794
00:34:56,776 --> 00:35:00,579
I really do love
what you've done with this.

795
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:02,214
There's a whole lot
of character design in this,

796
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:06,252
head to toe,
and it's powerful graphically.

797
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:09,621
The piece de resistance for me
was the hairy armpits.

798
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:12,991
Oh, my God.

799
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:14,226
You did a great job, Laney.

800
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:17,163
- Thank you.
- Laney, please step back.

801
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:19,631
Thank you.

802
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:26,638
Lyma, please step up.

803
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:33,379
Tell us about your concept
for this challenge.

804
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:35,981
He's a bat human,

805
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:39,118
and he's got this disease
in his skin.

806
00:35:39,152 --> 00:35:40,819
Are you happy
with your work this week?

807
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:42,488
I am happy, yes.

808
00:35:42,522 --> 00:35:46,058
Unfortunately,
I cannot agree with you.

809
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,860
I feel that it is
desperately starved

810
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:50,096
for greater sculptural detail,

811
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,799
as it is
for greater paint detail.

812
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,335
This is something that,
for me, never works,

813
00:35:56,369 --> 00:35:57,669
is when creatures have
glowing eyes.

814
00:35:57,704 --> 00:36:00,573
What this does is,
it cheapens it.

815
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:02,674
I do think the ears
are kind of interesting,

816
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,943
but there's a lot of stuff
going on below them

817
00:36:04,978 --> 00:36:06,678
that I'm not really sure about.

818
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:09,781
This has fallen a little short
this week, honey.

819
00:36:09,816 --> 00:36:12,818
- Lyma, thank you.
- Thank you.

820
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:17,756
Tate, come forward.

821
00:36:23,196 --> 00:36:25,897
Could you tell us about
your skeleton treatment here?

822
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:28,100
She's the shepherd
of the spirits in her cemetery.

823
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:29,301
She protects them.

824
00:36:29,336 --> 00:36:30,436
I don't even know
where to start.

825
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,838
It's really cool-looking.

826
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:34,873
I like the way you handled
the rotting fresh on her arms.

827
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:36,074
What did you use for that?

828
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:38,977
I painted on a layer
of old-age stipple.

829
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:41,280
- Very effective.
- Thank you.

830
00:36:41,314 --> 00:36:43,115
It's cohesive and balanced.

831
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,818
Even though the head is big,
it's not disproportionate.

832
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:51,223
This is a superb display
of visual storytelling.

833
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:53,058
I'm loving this makeup.

834
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:54,393
I appreciate it.

835
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:57,429
Tate, please step back.

836
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:03,702
Alana, you're next.

837
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:10,008
Tell us
about your character choice.

838
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:11,610
Well, I chose the devil.

839
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:13,812
For the face,
my inspiration was a ram.

840
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:15,381
I wanted to do something

841
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:18,050
like I've never seen the devil
interpreted like before.

842
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:20,719
You did give us
something unexpected,

843
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:24,456
but I'm not sure
if it's well resolved.

844
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:26,758
There's just things in the face

845
00:37:26,793 --> 00:37:31,363
that are not even close
to feeling like a devil.

846
00:37:31,398 --> 00:37:33,165
I love the idea

847
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,669
of taking the horns
and going lava-y rock.

848
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:38,003
That's a cool direction.

849
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:39,838
You could have taken that
through the whole makeup.

850
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:44,510
But overall, it's uninspired
and inadequate.

851
00:37:44,544 --> 00:37:47,913
Alana, please step back.

852
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:52,484
All right, guys.

853
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,885
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

854
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,053
Please head
back to the makeup room

855
00:37:55,088 --> 00:37:56,689
while they deliberate.

856
00:37:56,723 --> 00:37:57,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

857
00:37:57,724 --> 00:38:00,726
Thanks, guys.

858
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,364
Okay, let's start
with the looks

859
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:07,032
you liked the most this week.

860
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:08,234
How about Roy?

861
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:09,468
I really liked Roy's.

862
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:10,936
I just liked the fact
that it had

863
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,304
that lava look all over it.

864
00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:16,709
Just such a great idea to go
with a color palette

865
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:18,076
that is so not traditional.

866
00:38:18,111 --> 00:38:19,778
All right,
let's move on to Laney.

867
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:22,615
Creepy. Hairy armpits.
I don't know.

868
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:24,983
I loved it.

869
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:28,120
Everything she did was
such great character choices.

870
00:38:28,154 --> 00:38:29,855
All right, let's discuss Tate.

871
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:31,990
What he did with the skull
impressed me the most

872
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:34,627
because it all felt skeletal.

873
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,094
It's creepy, and it's fun.

874
00:38:36,129 --> 00:38:37,696
He did some really cool stuff,

875
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:38,997
like how he did
the rotten skin.

876
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:40,299
It worked really well.

877
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,533
Very cool makeup.

878
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:42,668
All right, let's move on

879
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:44,570
to the looks
you liked the least.

880
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:45,571
Why don't we start with Scott?

881
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:47,139
Oh, Scott's killing me.

882
00:38:47,173 --> 00:38:49,475
That sculpture was terrible.

883
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:51,543
The egghead shape
didn't make sense.

884
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:53,412
That thing could have been
as creepy as all get-out

885
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:55,681
with a drippy old
messed-up clown makeup.

886
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:57,149
All right,
let's move on to Lyma.

887
00:38:57,183 --> 00:38:59,017
I've seen her do better.

888
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:02,854
The lack of form
is unbelievable.

889
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:05,824
And it was all built up
way up on top of his head.

890
00:39:05,858 --> 00:39:07,459
- Yeah.
- Lastly, we have Alana.

891
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:09,461
This is a confusing makeup

892
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:11,697
because it is probably
her cleanest application

893
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:13,165
she's ever pulled off.

894
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,100
The fact that she thought
this looked like a ram

895
00:39:15,134 --> 00:39:16,302
freaks me out.

896
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:18,203
It looks like a tabby cat
with a turban on.

897
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:20,172
It doesn't look anything
like a ram.

898
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:22,508
She can't just tell us
it was supposed to be something

899
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:24,810
and then bang out
this super simple form

900
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:26,512
that she uses in every makeup.

901
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,280
That's not going to cut it.

902
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:29,381
All right, judges.

903
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,683
Have you made your decisions?

904
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:31,983
- Indeed.
- We have.

905
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:34,353
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

906
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:43,061
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

907
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:44,896
Tate, your character was filled

908
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:47,098
with smart, artistic decisions,

909
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:48,634
and they all came together
to tell

910
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:51,069
a very convincing story.

911
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:55,140
Laney, we loved the vivid,
graphic nature of your clown,

912
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:56,775
and everything on it
came together

913
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,344
with great synergy.

914
00:39:58,378 --> 00:40:01,747
Roy, there were some really cool
ideas in your makeup,

915
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:04,516
and it was a ton of work
in a very small amount of time.

916
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:07,118
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

917
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:09,120
The winner
of this week's challenge is...

918
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,450
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

919
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,652
The winner
of this week's challenge is...

920
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,791
Tate.

921
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:29,892
Yeah, Boo.

922
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,363
Thank you.

923
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,098
Your character fused elements

924
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,200
that were both artistic
and beautiful.

925
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,201
Well done.

926
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,235
Thanks a lot.

927
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,636
To win the Halloween challenge,

928
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,905
which is my one day
of the year?

929
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,940
It's fantastic.

930
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,008
I feel renewed,

931
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,809
and I feel like
I just won the title.

932
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,012
Tate, congratulations.

933
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:52,282
You, Roy, and Laney can head
back to the makeup room.

934
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:53,583
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you very much, guys.

935
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,918
Thanks, guys.
Appreciate it.

936
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,690
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

937
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:01,924
are on the bottom,

938
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,128
and one of you
will be eliminated.

939
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,196
Please step forward.

940
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,237
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

941
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,439
Scott, we understood
what it was

942
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,408
that you were going for
from afar,

943
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,575
but up close,

944
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,577
your painting and sculpture
on your clown

945
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,612
were really rough.

946
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,613
Okay.

947
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,615
Lyma, we felt that you made

948
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,885
some really odd sculptural
decisions this week,

949
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,620
and overall,
we weren't quite sure

950
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,288
what we were looking at.

951
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,426
Alana, the starting point
of your concept was interesting,

952
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,395
but none of that
was communicated

953
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,929
in your character tonight.

954
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:41,631
So who is going home tonight?

955
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,367
The person
going home tonight is...

956
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,773
Lyma.

957
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,742
There were many things
that weren't working

958
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,777
for you tonight,
but in the end,

959
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:57,680
it was your lack
of anatomical accuracy

960
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:59,482
that was your downfall.

961
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,385
Lyma, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

962
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,719
The rest of you are safe

963
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,922
and can head back
to the makeup room.

964
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,890
Thank you, guys.

965
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,259
Thank you.

966
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,760
Lyma...

967
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,329
you know, we've seen
some great work from you.

968
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,764
I'm pretty confident in saying

969
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,666
that the next time
we see your talents,

970
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,334
it's going to be
in a professional scenario.

971
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,070
Thank you, Neville.

972
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,338
Lyma, it's been really great
having you here with us,

973
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,474
but if you would please
head back to the makeup room

974
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,543
and pack up your kit.

975
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,611
Thank you, guys.
I had a lot of fun.

976
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:29,612
- Thank you.
- Good night.

977
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:30,613
- Thank you, Lyma.
- Good luck.

978
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:31,981
- Night, Lyma.
- Good luck.

979
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:33,649
Even though some of the stuff

980
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,185
wasn't good enough,

981
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,888
I'm very happy with myself.

982
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:42,425
- What?
- Aww, Lyma!

983
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,195
All these other artists are
now members of my family.

984
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,996
I don't have any regrets.

985
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,864
I learned a lot.

986
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,700
I feel like I grew.

987
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,969
This competition
changed my life,

988
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,306
and all I want to do
is redirect my career.
