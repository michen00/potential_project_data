1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,660
Previously on Face Off...

2
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:08,763
Tate's dark elf
brought him his fourth win.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,765
- Really smart decision.
- Thank you so much.

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:12,868
And Laney left the competition,

5
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:14,936
resulting in a shocking twist.

6
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:18,739
No one is going home tonight.

7
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:20,875
Now only four artists remain.

8
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:23,678
And tonight,
they'll soar to new heights

9
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:24,912
for a shot at the finale.

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,014
No way.

11
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:28,549
This is the most
pressure I've felt

12
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:31,284
because I want to win
this competition.

13
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:33,686
And some artists' hopes
will be shattered.

14
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,255
Oh, no, no, no, no!

15
00:00:35,322 --> 00:00:37,357
I can't believe
this is happening.

16
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:40,593
I realize I'm biting off
way more than I can chew.

17
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,970
This could definitely
be a train wreck.

18
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:46,399
This is a bad time
to be phoning it in.

19
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:48,434
I am astonished.

20
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,926
You absolutely amaze me.

21
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:54,639
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

22
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,474
from Kryolan
Professional Makeup

23
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:59,377
to one of their 85
international locations,

24
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:02,380
a 2013 Fiat 500,

25
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:05,616
and $100,000.

26
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:09,168
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic?

27
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:12,313
Only one will win Face Off.

28
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:49,080

29
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:57,600
How are you today?

30
00:01:57,668 --> 00:02:00,136
- Still here.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,340
- That was brutal last night.
- Oh, my gosh.

32
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:05,909
The last spotlight challenge,
the judges were very harsh.

33
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:07,677
We've got one more chance.

34
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,612
I mean, there's three spots
and four people.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,948
The top four is where I made it

36
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:14,283
in season three
before I got eliminated.

37
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:15,551
Even though there are three
other talented people here,

38
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,253
that's not happening again.

39
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,921
I'm making it all the way
through this time.

40
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,759
I have no intention of giving up
no matter what I have to do.

41
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:34,936
We roll up
to the Burbank airport,

42
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:38,507
and everyone is very aware
that this challenge right here,

43
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,410
this is what determines
who makes it to the finale.

44
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:45,314
So we're all very much on edge.

45
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,982
Hey, guys.

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,517
Hey.

47
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:53,154
Welcome to your last spotlight
challenge before the finale.

48
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:55,623
Throughout history, humankind
has been fascinated with flight,

49
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,592
and we've seen it
portrayed in creatures

50
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,527
from all types of film,

51
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:02,397
from the Wizard Of Oz's
flying monkeys

52
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,266
to the harpies
in Clash Of The Titans.

53
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,569
And before I tell you more
about your challenge,

54
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:08,938
I want to introduce you
to a special guest.

55
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:10,539
He's the expert
host of Animal Planet's

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,675
Savaged and Into The Pride.

57
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:16,412
Please give a warm welcome
for Dave Salmoni.

58
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,051
- Hi, Dave.
- How are ya?

59
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:22,985
- Hi. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

60
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,220
So who is this little guy?

61
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,223
This is an umbrella cockatoo
from Indonesia.

62
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,925
- Can I?
- Want to try to hold him?

63
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:31,128
Oh, yeah.
Nicely done.

64
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:33,930
Put your elbow in a little bit.
There you go.

65
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,533
Please don't bite me.

66
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,835
Oh, she thinks it's funny.

67
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:40,136
That's the best thing
about these guys,

68
00:03:40,204 --> 00:03:42,071
is the fact that they
are such good pets.

69
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,006
And it's also the worst
for them as a species

70
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,574
because they've been
getting stolen out of the wild.

71
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,842
Hi.

72
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,044
The reason
they're so liked as pets,

73
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,211
it's one of the only
kind of birds...

74
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,713
- Hi.
- That like to be snuggled.

75
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,247
- Really?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,749
Okay, let's go back
to Dave now.

77
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,183
- All right.
- Thank you.

78
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:56,618
As you may have guessed by now,

79
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:59,654
birds and flight are the basis
for your spotlight challenge.

80
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:01,589
Awesome.

81
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:04,059
This is a silvery-cheeked
hornbill.

82
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,093
Aw.

83
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,762
You find them in East Africa.

84
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,231
This is an Egyptian vulture.

85
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,965
His eyes are designed
to see carcasses a mile away.

86
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,066
Wow.

87
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:14,001
This is
a blue-throated macaw.

88
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:15,603
Their beak is so dexterous
that they can actually

89
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,338
take a grape
and just peel the skin off.

90
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,207
No way.

91
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,875
I'm excited
because I have an affinity

92
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:22,744
for animals and birds,

93
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:24,746
and anything nature-related
I like to sculpt.

94
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,381
So this is interesting to me.

95
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,283
This guy's a Chilean flamingo.

96
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,786
And they get their pink color
from their food.

97
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,921
Plankton, algae,
crustaceans, shrimp.

98
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,423
And that's what
causes the coloring.

99
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,225
There's a pigment in there
that makes 'em this color.

100
00:04:36,293 --> 00:04:39,061
All the birds
are so cool looking.

101
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,697
I love animals, so I'm excited.

102
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:43,466
For this spotlight challenge,

103
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,568
you will each select
one of these birds

104
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:49,072
as an inspiration for your
very own human-bird hybrid.

105
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,340
- Wow.
- Okay.

106
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,675
- Oh, cool, okay.
- All right.

107
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,510
Birds are not
a very easy makeup to do

108
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:55,912
'cause most birds
are covered with feathers,

109
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,248
and you can't sculpt feathers.

110
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,383
You have to sculpt everything
that's under the feather,

111
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:02,819
and then figure out
how to lay it on top of it.

112
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,220
That's a tall order.

113
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:05,989
All right,
let's choose your birds.

114
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,357
Laura, you're first.

115
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,727
I'll go with
the umbrella cockatoo.

116
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:11,261
- Tate?
- Egyptian vulture.

117
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,697
I've always wanted to do
a vulture creature.

118
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:14,965
It would be
a really interesting sculpt.

119
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:16,033
Roy, you're up.

120
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:18,102
I'm gonna go with the macaw.

121
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,872
- And Miranda.
- The silver-cheeked hornbill.

122
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,874
All right, it's time for
you guys to spend a little time

123
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,777
with your birds and start
working on your designs.

124
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:27,878
Dave here will be
coming around to tell you

125
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:29,213
more about your birds

126
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,814
and answer any questions
that you might have.

127
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,649
I'll see you guys later
back at the lab.

128
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:34,018
- Bye.
- Thank you, guys.

129
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:41,594
You can see he's not
posturing to be friendly.

130
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:44,196
- He's posturing to bite.
- Oh, yeah, I see that.

131
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,232
We start doing our sketches,
and Dave tells us a little bit

132
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:48,267
about each of the birds,
which is very helpful.

133
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,403
I notice that the bottom beak
goes up into the top one.

134
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:54,172
It fits in underneath the sort
of overbite that they have.

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,640
It helps 'em manipulate
what they're eating.

136
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,509
The blue-throat is
the most rare of all the macaws.

137
00:05:57,576 --> 00:06:00,111
My idea is to make this
a military bird

138
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,780
that does surveillance
in the jungles.

139
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:03,949
If you have a frickin'
bird-human hybrid,

140
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:05,484
it's got to be
a government experiment.

141
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:08,220
And since this is gonna be
a human-sized bird,

142
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:10,255
it's got to have
full, long realistic wings.

143
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:11,423
So this is gonna be
a very difficult challenge.

144
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,024
Beautiful bird.
He really is.

145
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,994
- I'm really happy to have him.
- All right.

146
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:17,462
Yeah.

147
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,130
He's making me show you
his big puffy head.

148
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:20,164
- Hi.
- Yeah.

149
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:21,499
See the yellow underneath here?

150
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:22,967
Yeah. I was also gonna ask,
do they molt?

151
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,168
Do they lose feathers?

152
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:25,336
They do have a molting time,

153
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:26,737
and, you know,
look a little rugged.

154
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:27,972
Dave tells me a lot

155
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,907
of very good stuff
about the cockatoo.

156
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,110
For one, males have blue
around their eyes.

157
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:33,611
Secondly, they get
to a very ripe, old age.

158
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,648
So my concept is an older bird

159
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:38,182
who's been molting
and even balding.

160
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,420
It's not just a bird makeup,
but it's an old-age makeup too.

161
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:44,422
It is supposed to be
a bird-human hybrid,

162
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,724
and there's always a fine line,

163
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,092
like should you
go more human with it?

164
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,460
Should you go
more bird with it?

165
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:52,097
And I feel like my bird
needs that human quality.

166
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,372
The most unique thing is that

167
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,340
big cask on the top
of their head.

168
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:03,974
You see how the front of it's
kind of all bashed up?

169
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,142
That's really typical.

170
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,244
They smash that thing
on everything.

171
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:08,546
So they always look
all beat up.

172
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:10,114
They're all very unique.

173
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:11,983
This was actually one of
the birds that I was instantly

174
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,485
attracted to at first
when they came out.

175
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:16,754
When you start thinking about
translating it into a makeup,

176
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:19,824
it gets a little tougher
because I have to incorporate

177
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:21,926
this bird's big cask,
and also his features

178
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:23,361
don't lend
to a human face at all.

179
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:24,929
And I think it'll be
a challenge to get

180
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:28,733
a human face to look like
this particular bird.

181
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:35,806
This is one of my favorites.
I'm a real vulture lover.

182
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,341
I'm a big fan as well.

183
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,676
The thing that's unique
to them is that sharp beak.

184
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:41,312
Vultures' beaks
aren't typically that hooked,

185
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:44,048
sharp feature, so that's
very Egyptian vulture.

186
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:47,084
I really want to focus
on having that hooked bill,

187
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:50,888
as well as the crest,
which is very noticeable.

188
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:53,658
So I know early on
I got a lot to do.

189
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:11,745
Day one in the lab, we only
have 5 1/2 hours to work.

190
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:13,213
I start sculpting this

191
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,783
giant full head, chest,
back, and arms.

192
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,319
I know the judges are going
to be expecting

193
00:08:19,387 --> 00:08:21,354
something fantastic,
and I want to give them that.

194
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:23,189
It's a huge piece,
and I have to

195
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:25,625
build it out bulky
because I want to actually

196
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:29,028
take real turkey features
and push them into the foam.

197
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:31,864
This is the most pressure
I've felt because

198
00:08:31,932 --> 00:08:34,934
I'm one challenge away
from being in the finale again.

199
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,544
My creature
is going to need a cowl,

200
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:49,247
a facial appliance, and a foot.

201
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:52,084
All of my pieces are going
to be run out of foam,

202
00:08:52,151 --> 00:08:54,620
except the foot
is gonna be out of poly foam.

203
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:58,257
The goal today
is to have everything

204
00:08:58,325 --> 00:08:59,925
blocked out
and partially detailed,

205
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:04,430
so by tomorrow, I can run
straight into the molding room.

206
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,902
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

207
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,471
It's gonna be a big one.

208
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:15,107
Tate has this design,
which is just humongous.

209
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:19,478
I wouldn't be able
to pull that off that quickly.

210
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:24,082
I'm really hoping
that I can manage my time

211
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,484
a little bit better this week.

212
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:26,685
I don't want to put forward
another thing

213
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:28,220
that just looks incomplete.

214
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:31,825
So this isn't gonna be an
overly-complicated character.

215
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:37,229
I'm just going to sculpt
one full face and neck appliance

216
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:38,997
and fabricate
feathers into a wig

217
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:43,535
to give it the same kind
of silhouette the bird has.

218
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:45,404
I've got a lot to do today.

219
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:46,939
I want to get
as much of the fabrication

220
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,240
out of the way that I can.

221
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:49,775
I want to definitely
get the feathers

222
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:52,344
knocked out of the way first,
and so I take the L200

223
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:56,649
and get my feathers cut out,
get 'em sanded down real quick.

224
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:02,322
The first time I did wings,
it took me 2 1/2 weeks

225
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,490
to just make the feathers.

226
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,158
This time,
I got less than 20 hours

227
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,393
to make the entire thing.

228
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:13,433
So I'm working
on my giant sculpture,

229
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,968
and it's getting
bigger and bigger.

230
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:19,839
And then I realize,
it's way too big.

231
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:22,041
I'm thinking that there's
not enough time

232
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:23,776
to mold and paint
this massive piece.

233
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:29,315
I've probably got 200 pounds
of clay on this mannequin,

234
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,350
and I still have hands and feet
and everything else to make.

235
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,152
So I'm biting off
way more than I can chew.

236
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:37,689
In this competition,
you can go big,

237
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:39,390
but you
have to finish your work

238
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,126
or the judges
will send you home.

239
00:10:41,193 --> 00:10:43,928
Suddenly, I could
feel my heart beating,

240
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:46,431
and I'm thinking,
"I've screwed up."

241
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:50,903
This could definitely
be a train wreck.

242
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,906
Coming up...

243
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,674
Oh, no, no, no, no!

244
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,775
I can't believe
this is happening.

245
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:00,244
I had such problems with this.

246
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:02,013
You absolutely amaze me.

247
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:05,583
This is a huge amount of work
to even attempt.

248
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,335
Day one in the lab,
I'm starting to look

249
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:14,737
at my creature and be like,
"Holy crap!

250
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:17,640
I'm biting off
way more than I can chew."

251
00:11:17,674 --> 00:11:20,276
It's a ridiculous amount
of work, and I'm definitely

252
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,078
taking some risks,
but I didn't come here to quit.

253
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:27,916
Season one, I was a finalist,
and I want to relive that,

254
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,617
and I want to win
this competition.

255
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:34,591
But I've got to focus
on this challenge first.

256
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,198
Hey, guys,
here for a walkthrough.

257
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:42,966
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey, Miranda.

259
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:46,669
Tell us about
your human-bird hybrid.

260
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:49,705
I'm doing
the silvery-cheeked hornbill.

261
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,907
I'm gonna take a wig,

262
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,642
and then
lay the feathers into it,

263
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:55,745
rather than sculpting a cowl.

264
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,614
I really want to make sure I can
finesse my sculpture this week,

265
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,549
'cause last week,
I did something

266
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,784
that I really wasn't proud of.

267
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:02,286
So I want to redeem myself.

268
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,755
Good.

269
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,724
- Hey, Tate.
- Hey, what's going on, guys?

270
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,259
- How are you?
- So yeah.

271
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,928
Okay, tell us about
your human-bird hybrid.

272
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,897
Well, my bird
is the Egyptian vulture.

273
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,999
I want to have the bottom jaw
where it sits

274
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,634
under the bottom jaw
of the actor

275
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,135
so the mouth can move.

276
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,104
When you finally
get this out in latex,

277
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,672
vacuform a little plastic cup,

278
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,674
and glue that inside here.

279
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,310
- Like a little chin piece.
- So a chin piece.

280
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,079
And so when you open the face,
it literally--

281
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,282
you get pressure
from the entire thing.

282
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,450
And it would cause
all of this to--

283
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,787
- Right.
- That's genius. Thank you.

284
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,722
- Hey, Roy.
- Hello.

285
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:38,990
Good to see you.

286
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,791
I chose the blue-throat macaw.

287
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,959
My idea is a military bird

288
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,560
that an army
uses for surveillance.

289
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:45,594
The last time
I was on the show,

290
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:47,129
I came up with an idea
of making wings.

291
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,631
I never got to make 'em on
the show, so it's like, "Great.

292
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:50,099
I get to make wings now."

293
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,802
And it's taking the EVA foam,
and you cut 'em out,

294
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,103
and you layer 'em
almost like...

295
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,538
- Oh, wow.
- ...an accordion.

296
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:56,539
So you actually spread it
with your arm,

297
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:57,840
- and they look fantastic.
- Oh, cool.

298
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,975
Then how are you
going to attach them?

299
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,910
The actor actually
wears it like a jacket.

300
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,345
- Very good.
- Well, thank you.

301
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,480
Well, I got
the umbrella cockatoo.

302
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,050
These birds can get very old.

303
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:09,619
Like, they can get to,
like, 60 or 70.

304
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:10,954
And I thought it might be cool

305
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:12,122
to have an older bird.

306
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:14,592
Now, since your bird
is primarily white,

307
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:17,195
it needs a break of color
to create a little contrast.

308
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,296
Mm-hmm.

309
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,664
How are you
going to incorporate--

310
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,898
Are you gonna add colors in?

311
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:22,666
You add feathers to it
or white feathers...

312
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
- Well, the skin is...
- ...totally or--

313
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:27,437
...gray, and then
around the eye will be blue.

314
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,005
And then there's yellow
right under the wings.

315
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,074
- Very good.
- All right, I can't wait.

316
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,075
- Good luck, Laura.
- This is a fun one.

317
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,476
Thank you.

318
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:34,878
I wasn't originally gonna
add a lot of bright color,

319
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:38,515
but Mr. Westmore encourages me
to punch out those blues,

320
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,083
and punch out those yellows.

321
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:43,154
And now I feel more
comfortable with that idea.

322
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:45,923
All right, guys.
Cannot wait to see this.

323
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:47,191
- Good luck.
- Yes, good luck.

324
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,191
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

325
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:50,226
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

326
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,303
After I get the feathers made,

327
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:03,907
I got to get a core made
to do my sculpture on.

328
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:06,009
So what I decide to do
is take a poultry wire

329
00:14:06,044 --> 00:14:08,712
and shape out the form
that I want to make.

330
00:14:08,746 --> 00:14:11,648
Then I'm gonna cover that
with plaster bandages

331
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,151
and then do a layer
of Ultracal on it.

332
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:15,618
This will definitely
be a lot lighter

333
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:18,520
than trying to do a big,
you know, heavy core piece.

334
00:14:18,555 --> 00:14:21,356
I'm in good shape
at this point.

335
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:26,795
At the end of day one,

336
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,864
I'm feeling like
this is a lot of work.

337
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:32,201
I'm doing a face,
and a cowl, and a foot,

338
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:35,270
and I've got to fabricate
two 4-foot wings for this,

339
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:38,974
and on top of that,
make incredible makeup.

340
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,313
That is nearly
impossible to do.

341
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:49,151
Time, everybody.
Let's go.

342
00:14:49,186 --> 00:14:51,020
There is no room
for error tomorrow,

343
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:54,023
and that terrifies me.

344
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:05,802
Day two, and we're in the lab
for 9 1/2 hours today,

345
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:08,637
and I got a lot to do
and little time to do it in.

346
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:10,705
I got to get
all this sculpture done.

347
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,075
I had the idea of getting
a tongue depressor

348
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,310
and notching out
a little feather shape

349
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:17,445
so I'm not sculpting out
each individual feather.

350
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,713
So that's a little added bonus.

351
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:22,618
And so, yeah,
it's going really quick.

352
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,455
I gave myself
the first hour of the day

353
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:28,691
to finish
the Egyptian vulture sculpt,

354
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:31,660
and then I have to go
to the molding room.

355
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:34,062
This is a gigantic mold
that will take up a lot of time.

356
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:35,629
So I just hope
that I can keep up

357
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:40,000
with the bar
that I set for myself.

358
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:45,572
I'm sculpting
the silvery-cheeked hornbill,

359
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:47,475
and I feel like
I have a lot to do.

360
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,645
And I know I'm taking
a lot longer than I should be.

361
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,114
I finally have to
pry myself away

362
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:55,551
to get started on these hands.

363
00:15:55,585 --> 00:15:57,920
And I get these blocked out
and sculpted really quickly,

364
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:58,921
and they look really good.

365
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:02,390
I go back to the detail
on the face,

366
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,425
and I'm really
into this sculpture,

367
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,993
and I just can't seem to stop.

368
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,328
The clock is ticking,
and I don't want

369
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:10,164
to end up in a place
like I was last challenge,

370
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,035
but I still have things
that I feel need to be fixed.

371
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,737
And it's just very hard
to put it down

372
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:19,508
when you know that
it could be so awesome.

373
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,810
Everybody
is in that mold room but me,

374
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:23,712
and so now I'm worried.

375
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,609
This could be bad.

376
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:29,752
This mold is the heart
of the makeup,

377
00:16:29,786 --> 00:16:33,688
you know, of my piece,
and I have to get this mold out.

378
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,323
I'm almost to the end of it,

379
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,125
and I see out
of the corner of my eye...

380
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,827
Oh, no, no, no, no!

381
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:40,663
Ah!

382
00:16:40,698 --> 00:16:43,567
Fuck!

383
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,169
What the fuck happened, man?

384
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,537
It just slid.

385
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:47,871
My heart just sank because

386
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,907
there goes my chances
right out the window.

387
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,209
Do you have enough hard stone,
do you think, that--

388
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:53,610
- Nope.
- No?

389
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,078
It hasn't even set yet.

390
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:57,314
I can't believe
this is happening.

391
00:16:57,348 --> 00:17:00,851
I feel like my chances
of being in the finale

392
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,587
are shattered along
with the bottom of this mold.

393
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:07,157
I don't know
what I'm gonna do now.

394
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,236
I might as well go home
and pack my bags right now.

395
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,385
Oh, no, no, no, no!

396
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,987
Ah!

397
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:20,154
It's day two,
and I feel like my chances

398
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:21,889
of being in the finale
are shattered

399
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,892
along with the bottom
of this mold.

400
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:27,929
As crushing as this is,
I can't give up on it.

401
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:32,033
I got to figure out some way
to solve this issue.

402
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:35,802
I can at least pour
the front half of it.

403
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:37,270
And if I have to, I can do
the back of it with fun fur.

404
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,972
And if it isn't that bad,

405
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,242
I can flip it over
to do the other half.

406
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,510
The time is just slipping away.

407
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:45,080
And so I go ahead
and make the front half of it,

408
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,181
and I do it really quick.

409
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:47,349
- Just gonna roll it over.
- Roll it over?

410
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:49,084
That's what we're gonna do.
Yep.

411
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,020
I get Tate to give me a hand
to turn my mold over,

412
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:57,025
and see what the damage is
on the back half that fell.

413
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,094
This back half
is just totally fucked.

414
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:00,095
Ah!

415
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:02,430
Well, maybe not.

416
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:03,431
There's some cracks,
and there's, you know,

417
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,666
some pieces
that have pulled up,

418
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,367
but the detail's still there.

419
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:10,205
If I can take it and do
a quick slap coat and then

420
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,275
put some more burlap on it,
I may be able to save it.

421
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,480
So I'm gonna grab my stuff,
and I'm gonna go mold it.

422
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,315
Even though I'd like
to keep detailing

423
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,551
on it for probably
a few more hours,

424
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:28,456
as always, but it's time
to get in the mold room.

425
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,426
My molds for this
bird-human hybrid are done,

426
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:35,796
and I have to start
working on the cockatoo's wings.

427
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,231
I have to cut out
every wing individually,

428
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:40,201
and there's at least
eight feathers per wing.

429
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,869
Then I have to sand
each feather.

430
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,838
And it just taking way more time
than I thought it would take.

431
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,406
It's only halfway done,

432
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,841
so it doesn't look good at all,
and that worries me.

433
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,176
Ugh!

434
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,213
It's nerve-wracking.
Extremely nerve-wracking.

435
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,153
My mold is setting,
and now I really want

436
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:02,623
to make the beak move,
because I've gotten some crap

437
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,992
in the past from Glenn
for making static stuff.

438
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:08,062
So I vacuform the beaks

439
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,531
to make them light enough
to move.

440
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,167
Mr. Westmore gave me
some really good advice

441
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,334
about getting the beak to move.

442
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,803
So I'm making
a vacuform chin piece

443
00:19:15,838 --> 00:19:17,572
just to give it infrastructure,

444
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:20,609
something for the foam
to push against.

445
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:31,620
Just hold together
a little bit longer.

446
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:34,990
If I don't get the mold open,
I might as well give up.

447
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,660
Come on, don't break on me.

448
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,861
And so I start taking
and start putting the pry bars

449
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:41,563
in the pry points,
I start trying to get it up,

450
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,299
and it's starting to crack.

451
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,368
Come on.

452
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:48,404
I normally wouldn't do
anything close to this stupid

453
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:51,074
as far as making a mold, but,
you know, desperate times

454
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,244
calls for desperate measures,
and I'm desperate.

455
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:58,514
I finally get it popped open,
and, you know,

456
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:01,049
there's cracks in it,
but I'll make that work.

457
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,884
There we go.
That's what I'm talking about.

458
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:06,053
- Whoo! Thank you, guys.
- No problem.

459
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,356
I've been trying the best
I can to salvage this makeup.

460
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,724
There's literally
just duct tape

461
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:11,992
and pins holding
this thing together.

462
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,595
I still got a lot
to do tomorrow.

463
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:17,631
It's gonna be
a long five hours.

464
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,640
Because I spent
so much time sculpting,

465
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:29,443
I'm really behind on everything
else that I need to get done.

466
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,678
And of course, I'm having
trouble with my face mold.

467
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:34,982
Can you help me
open this, Laura?

468
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,151
Oh, never mind.
I got it. Thank you.

469
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:38,652
I finally get it popped.

470
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,321
I run out to go clean it,

471
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:42,657
and there's
like three minutes left.

472
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,892
Oh, my God.

473
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:53,432
That's time.
Let's get out of here.

474
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:57,436
I'm able to get my face
baking in foam latex,

475
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,572
but I couldn't
get the hands ready.

476
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,041
So I'm going to have
to use standard latex,

477
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:05,511
which sucks because
they're not gonna move as well,

478
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:06,678
and they're not gonna
be the same shape

479
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:07,946
like I sculpted them.

480
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,983
I just hope that everything
comes together tomorrow.

481
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:19,758
- Holy crap!
- Oh, good.

482
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:20,759
Yeah, Roy!

483
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,194
Yay!

484
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:25,598
It's application day.
We've got four hours in the lab.

485
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,567
At least I have
something to work with.

486
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:28,801
It's rough looking.

487
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,069
There's all these seams
everywhere,

488
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,871
but I'm gonna make this work.

489
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:33,606
I'm making
some slush latex blenders

490
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,840
to take and cover up bad parts.

491
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,776
I'm not giving up on this one.

492
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,812
My bird will be onstage,
and it will be complete.

493
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,185
- What's up?
- How you doing, man? I'm Tate.

494
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:48,253
And by the end of the day,

495
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:49,822
you're gonna be
a blue-throat macaw.

496
00:21:49,856 --> 00:21:51,824
All right, let's see here.

497
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,992
The first thing I need to do
is open the mold

498
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:56,094
that I didn't finish
on day two.

499
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:57,829
If it doesn't work,
then I'll have to go to plan B,

500
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,532
which is using the performer's
actual feet,

501
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:04,269
but I don't want to do that.

502
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:05,737
Amazingly, it's okay.

503
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:08,773
I have two feet.
Yay!

504
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:18,850
There's a lot more to do
than I think I realized.

505
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,819
I still have to lay all
these feathers onto the wig,

506
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:24,722
then move onto the hands.

507
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:28,125
I have to finish painting
the entire piece.

508
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,960
But, you know, I put myself
in this position,

509
00:22:29,994 --> 00:22:32,730
and I'm paying for it.

510
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:34,565
Everybody has these
giant things going on,

511
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,467
and I only have
a face and hands.

512
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:41,039
I just hope it's gonna be enough
to make it to this finale.

513
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:44,142
Yep. That one's good.

514
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,277
My foam piece, it's perfect.

515
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:47,379
I'm able to get it on him,

516
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:49,814
but the one problem
is the model's head

517
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,983
is much smaller than
the mannequin's head was.

518
00:22:52,018 --> 00:22:53,218
Okay.

519
00:22:53,253 --> 00:22:55,421
There's a lot of room
and wobble in there,

520
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:57,256
which makes me worry
about getting the jaws moving.

521
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,357
Okay, we're gonna do it
the old-fashioned way.

522
00:22:59,392 --> 00:23:01,560
Stuff it full of shit.

523
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:03,062
So I grab a fistful
of pantyhose,

524
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:06,298
and I start stuffing pantyhose
around his head and neck.

525
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:09,867
It does misshape the head a bit
from the sculpt,

526
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:13,204
which definitely
makes me worry.

527
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:20,512
I'm looking around,
and Laura's applying

528
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:24,083
this full bird head,
and Tate's just looks fantastic,

529
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:26,653
and Miranda's got this beautiful
piece that she sculpted.

530
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:30,990
And me, I've got nothing out.

531
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:34,192
I've still got to put the suit
on her, get her cowl on,

532
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:35,427
get the rest
of her face painted,

533
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:36,928
get the bottom beak on.

534
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:40,699
- Time?
- 8 1/2 minutes.

535
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:54,079
For last looks,
I've got everything to do.

536
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,551
That's time, everybody!

537
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:03,271
I have an hour to make
the finale or go home.

538
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:08,387
I'm going into last looks
on a wing and a prayer.

539
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,497
Coming up...

540
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:14,900
I am so frantic.
I can't even focus.

541
00:24:14,934 --> 00:24:16,034
Shit.

542
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,870
I've got to make it
to top three.

543
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:20,072
I need that second chance.

544
00:24:20,107 --> 00:24:22,441
I absolutely
adore the ambition.

545
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:25,044
I think that you're
playing it kinda safe.

546
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:35,378
Okay.

547
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:37,513
Last looks, it's gonna
be a really short hour.

548
00:24:37,547 --> 00:24:39,915
I got to fix that too.
Damn it.

549
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,385
I'm gonna have to pull out
every trick that I know.

550
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,620
I get the head put on her,
and get her beak on,

551
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:49,158
and then start finishing up
my paint work.

552
00:24:49,192 --> 00:24:52,829
I might need
to spray your nose.

553
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:55,431
For me, a good
3/4 of last looks

554
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:57,300
needs to be focused
on the details.

555
00:24:57,334 --> 00:25:00,837
First, I airbrush
all the blue around the eyes.

556
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:03,173
And my cockatoo
has fun-looking feet.

557
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:05,642
I airbrush
the cracks all white.

558
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:07,143
And I'm going
back in with black

559
00:25:07,178 --> 00:25:10,213
to pop out
all the individual scales.

560
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,986
Come on.
Damn airbrush keeps clogging.

561
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,154
This hour is crucial to me.

562
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:20,523
I have to get
the wardrobe situated.

563
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:22,658
I got to get the hands on,
and I have lots

564
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,660
of detail painting to do,
with stencils.

565
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:27,063
I want to put little patterns
all over it,

566
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:28,798
as well as on the feathers,
'cause right now

567
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,067
they're just stark white
turkey feathers.

568
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:33,569
So lots of pressure.

569
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:36,105
- 30 minutes.
- Holy shit.

570
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:38,274
Do you think you could
try to paint your hands?

571
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:39,441
Thank you.

572
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,343
I am at that point
where I am so frantic,

573
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:43,432
I can't even focus anymore.

574
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,533
Shit.

575
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:47,883
I have to finish painting
the entire piece.

576
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,119
Okay, let's get
this wig on you.

577
00:25:50,153 --> 00:25:51,153
I have to lay
all these feathers

578
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:54,089
to blend the hair
and the wings.

579
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:56,726
Stand up, and just keep
pushing these down

580
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,628
if they start peeling up.

581
00:25:58,662 --> 00:26:01,530
There's just too much to do
and so little time.

582
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,462
15 minutes, everybody.

583
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:07,904
Your hair is just killing me.

584
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:10,640
Time!

585
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:11,975
Oh, God.
It looks so ridiculous.

586
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,910
No, it looks good, man.

587
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:16,246
I'm not really happy
with the paint job

588
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,082
just because
the colors don't match.

589
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:20,449
After looking
at the other pieces,

590
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:23,159
I'm not feeling confident
at all now.

591
00:26:34,532 --> 00:26:38,202
Welcome to the Face Off
reveal stage.

592
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:41,337
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated...

593
00:26:41,372 --> 00:26:43,906
and three of you will be
moving on to our finale.

594
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:47,142
First, let's say hello
to our judges.

595
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:50,011
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effect Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

596
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:52,212
- Good evening.
- Hi.

597
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:54,614
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

598
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:55,748
Hi, everybody.

599
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:56,916
- Hey.
- Hey, Ve.

600
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:59,218
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

601
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,252
Hello.

602
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,586
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey, Neville.

603
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,521
This week,
your spotlight challenge

604
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,290
was to choose one of the birds
Dave Salmoni presented to you

605
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:10,327
and use it as an inspiration
for a human-bird hybrid.

606
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,494
So let's take a look at them
while the audience at home

607
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:15,695
tweets about their favorites
using #FaceOff.

608
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,031
First up is Miranda's creation.

609
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:44,716
My character's
really striking onstage,

610
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,051
but it really is just up
to the judges at this point.

611
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:48,953
There will only be three
in the finale,

612
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:51,855
and I hope
that I'm one of them.

613
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:12,470
I'm extremely happy with it.

614
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:13,605
I've done all I can do
at this point,

615
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:15,639
so I hope the judges
see how bad

616
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:18,608
I want to be
in the final three.

617
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:38,056
I want to make it
to the finale,

618
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,624
and I think my creature
looks amazing,

619
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:43,260
and hopefully,
the judges like it.

620
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,708
I've got to make it
to the top three.

621
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:06,144
There's no option.
I need that second chance.

622
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,132
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look.

623
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,218
_

624
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:23,615
_

625
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,628
Oh, man, she's looking
at the hands.

626
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:30,830
You won't be doing
much flying with those wings.

627
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:33,300
No.

628
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:35,234
She's got an eye for symmetry.

629
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,603
It really is just
one color, I mean,

630
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:42,239
other than a little bit
of delineation there on the top.

631
00:29:42,273 --> 00:29:43,573
Such an opportunity.

632
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:46,009
You've got all these planes
to color on.

633
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,576
The judges
don't look very impressed.

634
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,844
I'm getting pretty scared
at this point

635
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,845
that I'm not gonna
get a spot in the finale.

636
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,447
Thanks.

637
00:29:58,651 --> 00:29:59,718
It's confusing.

638
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:01,752
He could have minimalized
this white area.

639
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:03,587
If you're gonna do
these squiggly black lines,

640
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:05,255
why not do it
right over that eye seam?

641
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,856
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

642
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,990
I'm looking at the judges,

643
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:09,958
and I'm not liking
what I'm seeing.

644
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:12,326
The lines on the face
look like crap.

645
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,227
It's just the black,
squiggly lines, really.

646
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:15,662
Just that one thing.

647
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:19,632
I'm almost, you know,
sure that I'm going home.

648
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:25,036
We want to know what you think
of tonight's transformations.

649
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:27,671
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

650
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:32,920
If you're gonna do
these squiggly black lines,

651
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,158
why not do it
right over that eye seam?

652
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,418
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

653
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:37,351
I'm looking at the judges

654
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:39,201
and I'm not feeling confident.

655
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:43,071
I just don't see myself
being in the final three.

656
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:47,175
Look at the amount
of detailed paint on this thing.

657
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,510
It's unreal.

658
00:30:48,544 --> 00:30:51,146
He's got those feathers
in everywhere.

659
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,247
This is exactly
how the feathers

660
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:53,248
- should have been handled.
- Yeah.

661
00:30:53,283 --> 00:30:55,284
Thanks.

662
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,622
I do like the paint job.
This is kinda cool.

663
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:03,491
This real subtle stuff
here with his eye.

664
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:06,661
I want you to emote more.
Show me angry, show me scared.

665
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:08,830
- There's a lot of character.
- Yeah.

666
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,732
Still has all these
bird aspects,

667
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,734
but we definitely
get a human character

668
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:13,735
through the makeup.

669
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,646
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

670
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,478
Okay, the judges
would like to speak

671
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,547
with each of you to learn
more about your work.

672
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:27,583
Laura, please step up.

673
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:37,760
Tell us about
your bird creation this week.

674
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:40,930
The bird that I chose
was the umbrella cockatoo.

675
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,433
They can get to a very old age,

676
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:47,003
so I decided to do
the elderly but lovable pet.

677
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,505
And he's obviously molting

678
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,639
and losing quite a bit
of feathers.

679
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:55,276
You have captured the essence
of the human-bird hybrid idea.

680
00:31:56,946 --> 00:32:00,281
I think the face
is really quite wonderful.

681
00:32:00,316 --> 00:32:03,151
It has so much character.

682
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:04,719
Thank you.

683
00:32:04,754 --> 00:32:06,154
I especially like some
of the coloring around the eyes,

684
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:07,990
which is what the bird
looks like.

685
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:09,458
That's really a nice touch.

686
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:11,861
I would, however, like to have
seen more feathers on his head,

687
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:14,296
'cause he almost
looks like a bald eagle

688
00:32:14,331 --> 00:32:16,298
that has no hair on his head
and feathers everywhere else.

689
00:32:16,332 --> 00:32:20,301
I had such problems with this,

690
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,470
but having mentioned
the molting thing,

691
00:32:22,505 --> 00:32:24,439
I totally get it.

692
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:27,009
It actually
ties it all together.

693
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:28,110
I like it now.

694
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:29,978
Thank you.

695
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,872
Laura, please step back.

696
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,953
Good job, girl.

697
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:40,189
Miranda, please step forward.

698
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:47,396
Can you tell us
what bird you got,

699
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:49,565
and how you went about creating
your little creature here?

700
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,334
I got the silvery-cheeked
hornbill,

701
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:53,869
which was a bird
I had never seen before.

702
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:56,305
It had a lot of really
interesting characteristics.

703
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,274
I really wanted
to try to make it look

704
00:32:58,308 --> 00:33:00,844
as much like the bird
as I could.

705
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,846
It's a beautiful sculpt, honey.

706
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:06,249
You did a beautiful job
sculpting the head.

707
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:09,452
It's beautiful and symmetrical,
like all your sculpts are,

708
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,921
but you didn't sculpt
any indentations to show

709
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,190
that maybe that's where
those feathers are coming out,

710
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:15,391
so it just looks like
somebody just--

711
00:33:15,425 --> 00:33:16,859
whoosh--
stuck 'em on there.

712
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:20,062
Other than that, well done.

713
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:22,098
The sculpture
is beautifully handled.

714
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:24,801
You got in there with some
really, really nice detail.

715
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,136
I do appreciate that.

716
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,505
However, that's
a really monotone paint job.

717
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,273
Very, very basic.

718
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,876
This is a bad time
to be phoning it in

719
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,411
and ending up in the safe zone.

720
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,614
I mean, the challenge
was so much bigger than that.

721
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:41,051
I do love a lot
of what's happening in the face,

722
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,120
but it does feel like
something's been stuck

723
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,455
on the outside of his guy arms.

724
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:48,858
But I think you're a brilliant
sculptor and designer,

725
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:53,296
and that really helps you
in this particular challenge.

726
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,634
Miranda, please step back.

727
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,841
Tate, let's talk to you.

728
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,016
So tell us about your bird.

729
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,618
I chose the Egyptian vulture.

730
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,386
It's just a bird
that I resonated with.

731
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,555
Also really like
the scavenger aspect,

732
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,091
and wanted to play with it
and see where it took me.

733
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,726
I think it took you
to a pretty cool place.

734
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,194
Cool.

735
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,130
Head to toe, this
is an incredible amount of work.

736
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,465
It was hard.

737
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,068
Yeah.
I am astonished.

738
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,302
Nice stuff.
Good going.

739
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,571
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Neville.

740
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,506
The best thing that you've done

741
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,409
is you made a very clear
decision to utilize

742
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:42,778
a theatrical approach to the way
the feathers are placed,

743
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:45,448
that whole treatment of the way
this thing is going to work.

744
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:46,916
That's extremely intelligent.

745
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,450
Thank you very much.

746
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:49,952
The only thing
that really bothered me

747
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:51,920
about this
is it's a little muddy.

748
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:53,689
You have so many really great

749
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:56,425
sculptural things going on,
like those bony shoulders.

750
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,395
It would have really been neat
to see some of these things

751
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,197
from afar, you know,
not having to get up close.

752
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:04,901
But dang, you really did a lot.
It's freaky.

753
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:07,470
Nice.
Thank you very much.

754
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:10,139
- Tate, please step back.
- Appreciate it, bud.

755
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,761
Roy, you're next.

756
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:26,155
Tell us about how you decided
to tackle this challenge.

757
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:27,991
Well, I got
the blue-throat macaw.

758
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,626
I just wanted to make it
as realistic as possible.

759
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,562
And I think if you have birds
that are human size

760
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:35,899
that fly around, they would
definitely be military.

761
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:41,736
I absolutely adore and applaud
the level of ambition.

762
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,639
It's a huge amount of work
to even attempt.

763
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:48,811
I think you've got a really
nice profile on the head.

764
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:52,114
I'm really digging the shapes
that you have going on there.

765
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:54,518
You have this white area
in here

766
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:58,088
with some pretty bad paint
going on in there,

767
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,957
but dang,
you did a lot of work.

768
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:04,261
You absolutely amaze me
with your fabricating skills.

769
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,995
I love the choice
of the contact lenses.

770
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,530
Somehow, those eyes
do work for me.

771
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:09,698
Not just the contact lenses,

772
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:11,133
but that whole region
is pretty cool.

773
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:14,236
The amount of work you've
put into this is impressive.

774
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,337
Thank you.

775
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:19,008
Roy, please step back.

776
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:24,481
- Good job, brother.
- Thank you.

777
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,949
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

778
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,618
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

779
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:31,353
while they decide
who will move on to the finale.

780
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:32,803
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

781
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:39,293
All right, judges, why don't
we talk about tonight's looks.

782
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:40,761
Let's start with Laura.

783
00:36:40,796 --> 00:36:42,864
I really liked
the character makeup

784
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:43,965
that she came up with.

785
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:46,268
I love the approach
to the face.

786
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:49,304
What does not work
is that big, furry suit.

787
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:51,540
I thought she did a really
nice job with the paint job.

788
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:53,041
I appreciated the fact that she

789
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:55,344
was trying to integrate
human qualities into a bird.

790
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:56,645
She was actually
the only person

791
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,415
that bothered to even
use any flesh tones at all.

792
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,351
I love that she's
an intelligent designer.

793
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:05,121
She's really smart
about her choices.

794
00:37:05,155 --> 00:37:06,890
She's come back
and outdone herself.

795
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,359
I think she was even stronger
throughout this season.

796
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,294
All right,
let's move on to Miranda.

797
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,163
We all agree that
the sculpture this week

798
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,699
is beautiful,
as it often is with her.

799
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,502
She is really
a phenomenal sculptor,

800
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,869
and I think a great designer.

801
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,505
The face is beautiful,
but it's just a face.

802
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,207
There's so little done anywhere
else on the rest of the body.

803
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:27,810
I think she might have
a problem with time management,

804
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,912
'cause she doesn't have
that much experience.

805
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,514
Yeah, for sure.

806
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,549
But in my opinion,
she's very talented.

807
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,119
Okay, let's move on to Tate.

808
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,854
The profile on that thing
was amazing.

809
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,022
It is.

810
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:41,091
So brilliant to approach
the feathers that way.

811
00:37:41,126 --> 00:37:43,027
Even the muscle forms
are a hybrid...

812
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,729
- Yeah.
- ...of human and bird anatomy.

813
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,765
I think this
is one of the best paint jobs

814
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,367
I've seen of his.

815
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:50,935
All right,
let's move on to Roy.

816
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,571
I don't love the choice
to have done it

817
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,606
all as a sculpt with latex.

818
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:56,974
I think it would be better
with feathers,

819
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,576
but week after week,

820
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,346
Roy comes up
with these gigantic ideas,

821
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:04,717
and somehow manages to finish
weeks of work in two days.

822
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,752
There were some moments
in his head sculpt

823
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:07,786
that I thought
were really good.

824
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:08,787
- The overall form.
- Yes.

825
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,956
The silhouette was very good.

826
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,891
I don't think Roy is
necessarily the best sculptor,

827
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:15,026
but I've seen it
getting better and better.

828
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:16,861
We have four
really strong artists

829
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:18,296
that have performed
wonderfully,

830
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:19,864
so we have to figure out

831
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:22,033
which three
we want to see more from.

832
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:23,335
Mm-hmm.

833
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,470
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

834
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:26,637
Yes.

835
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,740
Let's bring 'em back out.

836
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,716
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge

837
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,720
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

838
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:44,156
The winner of tonight's
challenge and the first person

839
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,425
moving on to our finale
this season is--

840
00:38:55,029 --> 00:38:56,763
- All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge

841
00:38:56,798 --> 00:39:00,167
and the first person
to make it to the finale?

842
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:02,803
The winner of tonight's
challenge and the first person

843
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:06,406
moving on to our finale
this season is...

844
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,109
Tate.

845
00:39:09,143 --> 00:39:11,679
Wow.
Thank you very much, guys.

846
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:12,813
Thank you.

847
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:14,816
Your ability to conceptualize

848
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,287
combined with your
high-caliber execution

849
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,688
could not have come
at a better time

850
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:20,689
in this competition.

851
00:39:20,723 --> 00:39:21,924
Congratulations.

852
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,158
Thank you, guys, very much.

853
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:25,160
Tate, congratulations.

854
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:26,395
Thank you.

855
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:28,797
I made it to the finale again.
I'm so excited.

856
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:31,933
I just got to make sure
to be on my game.

857
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:34,102
All right, Glenn,
who is the next person

858
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:35,637
to make it to the finale?

859
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:37,806
The second person
that will be joining us

860
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,842
in the finale this season is...

861
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:45,781
Laura.

862
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:48,128
Congratulations.

863
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:52,587
This is a great opportunity
to have twice.

864
00:39:52,621 --> 00:39:56,090
The decision to include age
was indeed a good one,

865
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,593
and you delivered
another beautiful makeup

866
00:39:58,627 --> 00:40:00,762
in an already
strong season for you.

867
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:03,564
- Thank you.
- Laura, congratulations.

868
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,901
I'm so grateful that
I get another opportunity,

869
00:40:06,935 --> 00:40:08,736
but I'm gonna
have to challenge myself

870
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:11,206
in ways that
I've never done before,

871
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,576
and that frightens
and terrifies me.

872
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:18,780
Well, we have two artists
and only one spot left.

873
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:21,250
The top four is where
I made it in season three,

874
00:40:21,284 --> 00:40:23,719
and I can't go home yet.

875
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,488
I'm really hoping
that they call my name.

876
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,057
I really want this,

877
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,425
and I think I deserve a spot
in the finale.

878
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:32,095
So, Glenn, who gets
the last spot in our finale?

879
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,998
The third and final person
that will be joining us

880
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,034
in this season's finale is...

881
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:41,805
Roy.

882
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:49,013
Thank you.

883
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,848
Oh, thank you, guys.

884
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,083
We liked the overall form
of your piece,

885
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,986
and the profile of the head
was very cool.

886
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,788
Once again, we marveled
at the amount of work

887
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:00,122
that you managed to get done.

888
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,524
- Thank you so much.
- Roy, congratulations.

889
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,461
You have our last finale spot.

890
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:06,596
Thank you.

891
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,832
He called my name.

892
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,822
Sorry.

893
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,472
It's one of the things
that I wanted

894
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,341
since I first got here,
to make it to that point.

895
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,778
So-- so I made it.

896
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,114
Unfortunately,
that means, Miranda,

897
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,016
you'll be leaving us tonight.

898
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,287
Miranda, your sculpture
was beautifully done,

899
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:34,156
but we felt that you
just played it way too safe

900
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,326
when we were really
looking to see

901
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,996
just how badly everyone wanted
to move onto the finale.

902
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,666
I just want to say
thank you guys so much.

903
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,171
This second chance has meant
more than I can even express.

904
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:49,573
Miranda, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

905
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:53,310
It has been so great
having you here with us.

906
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,345
Will you please
head back to the makeup room

907
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,646
and pack up your kit?

908
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,481
Thank you, guys.
Thank you.

909
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,817
- Bye, Miranda.
- Bye.

910
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:09,025
The three of you have done
incredibly well to get this far.

911
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,097
I will see you all soon for
your final spotlight challenge.

912
00:42:13,132 --> 00:42:14,732
You can all head back
to the makeup room.

913
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:15,900
- Thank you all.
- Thank you, guys.

914
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,134
- Good night, guys.
- Thank you very much.

915
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:20,170
Thank you.

916
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,773
Whoo!

917
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,741
Although I am upset,

918
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:26,377
I'm just really proud
of what I've done here.

919
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,178
Congratulations.

920
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,479
I've just learned so much,

921
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:32,416
and I'm just so grateful
to have made it this far.

922
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,551
You beat out 12 people.

923
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:35,920
It means a lot.
It really does.

924
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:39,457
And I feel like I won just
getting to learn from you guys.

925
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:42,293
This experience has been
so valuable to me

926
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:43,494
because I've created
some of the best makeups

927
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,829
I've ever done in my life here.

928
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:48,765
I know that I have
nowhere to go but up.

929
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,369
I believe that I can
continue to grow as an artist,

930
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,239
and I can't wait to see
where I am five years from now.
