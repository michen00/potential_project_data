00:00:01,413 --> 00:00:03,548
Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:03,582 --> 00:00:04,682
Eight talented new artists

3
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:06,350
challenged
eight returning veterans

4
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:08,219
in an outrageous
fantasy challenge.

5
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:10,555
Miranda's pretty pixie
brought her to victory...

6
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,390
Yeah!

7
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:15,393
...and newcomer Tolin
was sent home.

8
00:00:15,427 --> 00:00:19,097
Now 15 artists remain,
and tonight,

9
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:21,165
they'll tackle a pair
of classic characters.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,301
This week's spotlight
challenge is inspired

11
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:26,437
by the most influential
movie monster of them all.

12
00:00:26,472 --> 00:00:27,871
Yeah, buddy!

13
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,173
Hell, yes, I want to win this.

14
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,242
That would be so incredible.

15
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:33,511
But for some, the pressure
will be too much.

16
00:00:33,545 --> 00:00:35,146
- Whoa!
- No, no, no, no.

17
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,482
This problem, I really
don't have time to solve.

18
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:38,716
Not like that.

19
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,251
Let's stop that, please.

20
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:42,620
- We're screwed.
- I know what I'm doing!

21
00:00:42,654 --> 00:00:44,922
I'm getting
a little frustrated.

22
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:46,357
Really great
decision-making.

23
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,992
It looks very blown on.

24
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:50,495
How could I forget something
so crucial to the makeup?

25
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,264
In the end, one will win
a VIP trip

26
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:54,665
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

27
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:57,701
to one of their
85 international locations,

28
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:01,439
a 2013 Fiat 500,

29
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:04,542
and $100,000.

30
00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:07,845
Who will be the next
great name in movie magic?

31
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:10,014
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

32
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:47,347

33
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:57,127
So, it's the morning after
the first spotlight challenge.

34
00:01:57,162 --> 00:02:01,432
Being on bottom looks was
very hard for me and Adolfo.

35
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:04,235
Good morning.

36
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,603
- How are we?
- Good, man.

37
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:08,138
I mean, it's just disappointing
that I couldn't,

38
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,875
like, present something better
the first time.

39
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,344
We'll just have to
put that behind us,

40
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:14,945
and I mean-- But now
we're more acclimated

41
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:18,349
to what being onstage in front
of those judges is like, so--

42
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:20,451
You both have so much
potential here,

43
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:23,654
so just don't let this one thing
bring either of you down.

44
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,690
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

45
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,958
- Cheers for a new day.
- Yeah, seriously.

46
00:02:27,992 --> 00:02:30,695
So, it's the morning
of the next challenge,

47
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,062
and we arrive
at Universal Studios.

48
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:34,398
I'm psyched.
I've never been before.

49
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,034
We walk up, and we're
next to the House Of Horrors.

50
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,503
I can't wait to see what
our challenge is gonna be.

51
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:41,839
Welcome to the House Of Horrors

52
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:43,841
at Universal Studios,
Hollywood.

53
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,910
So, we're here to talk about
your next spotlight challenge,

54
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:49,847
which is tied to
the Halloween Horror Nights,

55
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:53,551
the scariest, most intense
and amazing Halloween event

56
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,320
in the country,
starting September 20th.

57
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:57,722
- That's so rad.
- All right.

58
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,324
The Universal Studios introduced
the horror genre

59
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,827
and movie monsters
with some truly iconic films,

60
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:06,264
so this week's spotlight
challenge is inspired by

61
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:09,933
probably the most influential
of them all...

62
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:11,402
<i>Frankenstein.</i>

63
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:13,971
Yes!

64
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:15,406
Awesome.

65
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,342
I grew up watching horror
and sci-fi movies with my dad,

66
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:20,878
and <i>Frankenstein</i>
was my favorite.

67
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:23,648
Mary Shelley's<i>Frankenstein</i>
was created in 1818

68
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,651
as the result of a science
experiment gone awry.

69
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:30,288
Since then, the monster has
come to life in over 50 films,

70
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:32,790
including <i>Young Frankenstein,</i>
<i>Monster Squad,</i>

71
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,892
and the upcoming
<i>I, Frankenstein,</i>

72
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:37,461
which follows the creature
to the present day.

73
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,630
Your spotlight challenge

74
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:42,733
is to create your own
future Frankenstein...

75
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:44,001
Wow!

76
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:46,504
...and his bride,
complete with backstory.

77
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:47,938
- Oh, wow!
- Wow.

78
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:51,175
You will be working
in teams of three this week.

79
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,880
Your randomly assigned teams are
Alana, Laney, and Laura.

80
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,115
- Oh.
- Yeah, ladies, let's get it!

81
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:01,786
- All right.
- Eddie, Miranda, and Sam.

82
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,422
I'm immediately
a little bit nervous,

83
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,524
because both of them
are new contestants,

84
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:09,560
and I just hope that's
not gonna be a problem.

85
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:13,531
Scott, Adolfo, and Roy.

86
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:15,633
- We got this.
- Let's do it.

87
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:19,069
- Frank, Eric, and Rick.
- Right on.

88
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:21,339
RJ, Lyma, and Tate.

89
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,540
Whoo!

90
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,742
Stand with your teammates.

91
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:25,976
Dude.

92
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,978
Now, I brought
a special guest today

93
00:04:28,012 --> 00:04:30,113
to give you some advice.

94
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:32,316
He's the writer and creator
of the <i>Underworld</i> franchise,

95
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,684
as well as the writer

96
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,620
and producer of the
upcoming film <i>I, Frankenstein.</i>

97
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:38,956
Please welcome Kevin Grevioux.

98
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,558
How you doing, McKenzie?

99
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:41,759
Good! Thank you so much
for being here.

100
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:44,094
- Nice to see you.
- I'm super excited.

101
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:46,597
I'm trying to follow in
his footsteps as a filmmaker,

102
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:49,967
so to have him here,
that's a real honor.

103
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,636
Kevin will be joining us
here onstage this week

104
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:55,305
to take a look
at your final creations.

105
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,375
Now, how can
these artists make sure

106
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,377
that their characters
truly impress you?

107
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:00,511
Mary Shelley
created the character

108
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,747
back in the early 1800s.

109
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:05,082
Using the technology
of that day,

110
00:05:05,116 --> 00:05:07,351
you guys are gonna
pick a point in the future

111
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:10,821
and create something unique,
without losing the aspect

112
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:12,956
that this is still
supposed to be a monster.

113
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,959
Now there's just
one big piece of information

114
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:17,327
that I left out.

115
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:19,029
Oh, crap.

116
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,665
The top team's characters
will be featured

117
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,802
in this year's
Halloween Horror Nights event

118
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:25,870
at Universal Studios,
Hollywood,

119
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:29,206
and Universal Orlando Resort.

120
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,775
Oh, my God!

121
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,777
That is such an honor, guys.
We got to get this one.

122
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:33,944
That's cool.

123
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,479
Oh, hell, yes,
I want to win this.

124
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:37,848
And to have those characters
running around the park?

125
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:39,683
That would be so incredible.

126
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:41,752
I really want to get you

127
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:42,820
in the right mindset

128
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:44,087
while you're working
on your designs,

129
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:45,322
so I'm gonna send you

130
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:46,957
into the House Of Horrors
to sketch.

131
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,492
- Yes.
- Oh, cool.

132
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:49,894
And I will
see you all tomorrow.

133
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:52,329
That's if you can
get out of there alive.

134
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:54,331
Get in the house!

135
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,701
The Frankenstein lab

136
00:05:57,736 --> 00:05:59,470
looks like it's
right out of the movie.

137
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,138
Oh, my God.

138
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:03,273
There's a huge
capacitor thing...

139
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:05,443
- Oh, this is great.
- ...and it's so inspirational

140
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:08,278
for what
we're getting ready to do.

141
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:11,014
I like the idea of coming
from 2040 kind of time frame.

142
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:12,416
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

143
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:13,951
What about putting a nuclear
reactor kind of thing,

144
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,553
like, in the middle
of their chest?

145
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,321
That, or you can put it
on their backs.

146
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:18,722
Our backstory is,

147
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:21,725
Frankenstein and his bride
perished in a crash.

148
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,495
The only parts that are left
of them are their hands,

149
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:26,396
which bind the lovers together,

150
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:29,299
and are needed genetically
to bring them back to life.

151
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,836
Could be, like,
300 years into the future, or--

152
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,070
- 300 is good.

153
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:36,106
Our story is that Frankenstein
is from the past.

154
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,642
A bolt of lightning
brings him to life,

155
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:41,612
and in the future,
he builds his bride,

156
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:44,381
and she is now going to be
his source of energy.

157
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,484
Maybe he should have
her heart in a jar.

158
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:47,952
Ooh, there could be,
like, a tube

159
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:49,854
where the heart is kind
of floating in the liquid.

160
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,322
This doctor secretly
is trying to

161
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:54,725
take over
this futuristic world.

162
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,695
I'm kind of-- I don't know.
I'm iffy on this idea.

163
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:59,530
Do you have another idea?

164
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:00,898
Maybe if they use, like,

165
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:03,601
some sort of nanotechnology
that went wrong.

166
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:05,970
I don't quite
know what you mean.

167
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,938
We're already having
so many problems

168
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:11,341
just moving forward as a team,
and it makes me very nervous.

169
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:15,112
I do like the idea of it
being futuristic enough

170
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:16,780
that there's alien parts
in the data.

171
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:17,915
Or it could be a lab.

172
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,583
They could have
this lab in the future.

173
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,218
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,253
Frankenstein has to have
energy to keep him alive, right?

175
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:24,488
Right.

176
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:27,791
What if the radiation
from the atomic explosion

177
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:29,593
is what keeps him going?

178
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:32,496
So our concept is,
Frankenstein and his bride,

179
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,698
they're part of a genetic
military experiment.

180
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,099
The problem is,

181
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:38,268
before they finished
the prototyping process,

182
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,670
the bomb drops.

183
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:42,272
That same fallout activates
something in the creatures,

184
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:43,541
and they awaken,

185
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:45,543
and they have no idea
what their purpose is.

186
00:07:45,577 --> 00:07:47,778
Him and his bride are two of
the only things left on Earth.

187
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:49,580
That could work.

188
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,314
All right, everybody,
gather your stuff!

189
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:53,017
Let's head back to the lab!

190
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,452
All right, let's do it, guys.

191
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:04,294
So, we get to the lab,
and we have five hours today.

192
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:05,896
First, we pick our models,

193
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:08,599
but my team left Universal
Studios without a concept,

194
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,268
so we've still got to decide on
one before we touch anything.

195
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:13,938
We have a scientist
and his wife, okay?

196
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,206
All right, she dies,
he freezes her,

197
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,275
then works
to get the technology

198
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,678
advanced enough to bring her
back out of cryo.

199
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:21,779
Okay.

200
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:22,980
Our Frankenstein monster

201
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:24,882
is only about
50 years into the future,

202
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,483
but then
the bride of Frankenstein

203
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:28,719
is actually going to be, like,
120 years in the future.

204
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:30,187
So if they look different,

205
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,755
there's a reason for them
to look different.

206
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,757
If you want to tackle
the female face,

207
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,358
I'd like to tackle his face,

208
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,094
and if you want to work
on his chest piece

209
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:39,797
and on her chest piece.

210
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,534
So, you're starting
on the face of her.

211
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:45,769
I'll start on the cowl.

212
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:47,571
You're starting
on her chest? Okay.

213
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:49,807
Laura is really
focused on Frankie,

214
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:52,142
and I'm like,
"Girl, run with it."

215
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,612
We still don't really have
a design for the characters,

216
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:57,447
and I'm a little nervous
because it's become evident

217
00:08:57,482 --> 00:09:00,350
that I'm going to have to
take a leadership role.

218
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:02,152
Instead of, like,
doing full heads,

219
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:04,822
they could be wearing
some sort of, like, mask.

220
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:07,491
I come up with this idea
set 50 years in the future.

221
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:09,960
This couple
that's extremely in love

222
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,294
want to be together forever,

223
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:14,098
and they go to this doctor
to become immortal.

224
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:16,366
This doctor is actually
an evil mastermind

225
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,435
who is plotting to take over
the world with them.

226
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:21,171
So what exactly--
What are we-- What is this?

227
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:24,174
I have mixed feelings
on our concept.

228
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,610
I don't fully grasp
the entire thing,

229
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,979
so I just take the backseat.

230
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:30,881
I let Miranda run with her idea

231
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:33,851
and try my best
to be a team player.

232
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,418
Do you want to do one of the
cowls, I'll do one of the cowls?

233
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:37,187
- Yeah.
- Then I can start on the faces?

234
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,456
That sounds good.

235
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:46,764
In this particular challenge,
I will be sculpting

236
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,932
the face of the Frankenstein
creature and the cowl,

237
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,802
Frank is gonna be sculpting
the face of the bride,

238
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:53,637
and Rick is creating
the technology

239
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:54,905
to bring them to life.

240
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:57,174
You're the mad scientist
of the bunch, eh?

241
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:01,611
As a team, I think we're
working great together.

242
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:03,547
I'm sculpting
Frankenstein's cowl,

243
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:05,448
Lyma's sculpting
the cowl for the bride,

244
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:09,019
and RJ is rocking the hell
out of our Frankenstein face.

245
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:11,855
- Gorgeous.
- We have, like, 41 minutes.

246
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:21,165
That's time, guys!
Let's bounce!

247
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,400
It's the end of day one,

248
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:25,502
and our team didn't finish
their sculptures.

249
00:10:25,536 --> 00:10:27,137
Good-bye, lab.
See you tomorrow.

250
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:28,371
I'm feeling a little nervous,
but I know

251
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,407
we're gonna pull through,
I really do.

252
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:41,819
Get it, guys!

253
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:44,922
So, it's day two, we walk in,
we have ten hours in the lab.

254
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:47,124
We have to mold
all of our sculptures

255
00:10:47,158 --> 00:10:49,626
and run them in foam latex.

256
00:10:51,662 --> 00:10:56,900
When you do a sculpture,
the next step is mold making.

257
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,236
One big batch of stone
is mixed.

258
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,272
You want to get full coverage
of stone all over the piece,

259
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:05,142
and then it takes time to set,
and when you release it,

260
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:06,610
you can put material into it

261
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,312
to keep replicating
that same sculpture.

262
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:12,983
As the day's going,
I'm helping on Laura's mold,

263
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:15,018
just trying to be
super careful,

264
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,087
because you could spend
all this time

265
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,322
making a beautiful sculpture,
and if your mold cracks,

266
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:21,491
then you have no way
of redeeming it

267
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,926
unless you start from scratch.

268
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,427
And I'm a little worried

269
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:27,097
because I am struggling
super hardcore,

270
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:29,800
trying to get this thing open,
and as I'm doing this...

271
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,101
Whoa!

272
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:32,836
I realize
it's starting to crack.

273
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:34,304
What?

274
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:36,840
If Laura sees this
and how bad it is,

275
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,009
she's gonna freak out.

276
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:40,277
Coming up...

277
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:41,478
I think that's
a little dark, Lyma.

278
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,712
Trust me.

279
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:44,081
- Stop that, please.
- Okay.

280
00:11:44,115 --> 00:11:45,548
Lyma's not painting
realistically.

281
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,051
I'm trying to keep it together
and not explode.

282
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,419
I like your character.

283
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:51,621
The design
doesn't make any sense.

284
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:01,744
It's the second day of our
Frankenstein challenge.

285
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,246
I'm helping on Laura's mold,

286
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:06,683
just trying to be super careful,
and as I'm doing this...

287
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:09,118
- Whoa!
- What?

288
00:12:09,153 --> 00:12:13,590
I realize
it's starting to crack.

289
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:17,294
I'm trying not to be too
panicky about it,

290
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:21,464
but it's definitely
a huge crack.

291
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:23,966
As soon as I finish
cleaning out the clay,

292
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:27,504
I'm going to try to take some
epoxy putty and mend the crack.

293
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,839
Then, when the foam comes out,

294
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:33,643
I might have to trim a little
bit extra around the chest area.

295
00:12:33,678 --> 00:12:35,512
That might work.
I don't know.

296
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,248
I don't know if I can do it,
but we'll see what happens.

297
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:59,669
- Hey, guys!
- Hey!

298
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:01,271
We're here
to do a walk-through.

299
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:03,172
It's absolutely incredible
to have

300
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:06,909
Academy Award-winning artist
Mr. Westmore in the lab.

301
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,010
How could you not listen

302
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,646
to someone of that caliber's
advice?

303
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,147
All right,
so what is your concept?

304
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:13,015
We went into the
not-too-distant future,

305
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,719
but after everything
had gone awry.

306
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,522
The only actual part that
remained were the lovers' hands,

307
00:13:19,557 --> 00:13:22,392
and from the DNA, they've been
able to reconstruct them.

308
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,927
This is the cowl sculpt
for the creature.

309
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:26,829
We're going
with an exposed brain,

310
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:28,298
so we have
a vacu-formed plate

311
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:29,666
that we're gonna put
over the brain.

312
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,067
You know,
it might be interesting

313
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,870
to maybe airbrush
a little fog inside of it

314
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:36,606
so it looks like there's
moisture and there's heat.

315
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,309
Our characters are a couple
that is so in love,

316
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:42,579
they go to this doctor
to be immortalized,

317
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,747
but he's trying to
take over the world

318
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,982
by creating
an army of these people

319
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:47,150
who have come to him
to become immortal.

320
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:49,218
Sam and I sculpted
these cowl pieces,

321
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:51,655
which are gonna be
part of the costume.

322
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,889
That's for the male character.

323
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:54,491
We're gonna paint both faces,

324
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:57,026
flesh-tone mixed with
a little bit of a green hint.

325
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,461
Could wind up
with a muddy color.

326
00:13:58,496 --> 00:14:01,097
You might be better doing your
flesh tone in either a wash

327
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,799
or airbrushing with a green.

328
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,234
This is really
an interesting sculpture.

329
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:06,670
What about your coloring?

330
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:09,406
We want to patch different
types of skin,

331
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,442
like it was different
types of people.

332
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,076
You know, with the Borg,

333
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:18,114
I had a character that was made
up of different alien species.

334
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,417
- The patches were very distinct.
- Oh, cool.

335
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:21,818
That's what you're
gonna have to do here,

336
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:23,386
if you're gonna
make a patchwork out of it.

337
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:24,954
All right, so let's start
with your Frank character.

338
00:14:24,988 --> 00:14:26,189
Okay.

339
00:14:26,223 --> 00:14:27,457
He's got a battery pack

340
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,991
that he has to constantly
recharge,

341
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,927
so she's gonna be able to
charge his batteries

342
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:32,228
by holding his hand.

343
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:33,797
- When they touch, they glow.
- Right.

344
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,533
But we wanted to know how you
think we should cover it

345
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:37,534
or if you think that's cool.

346
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:38,868
Yeah, I think it's cool.

347
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,870
This just gives it
more of a mechanical look

348
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:42,739
by having that exposed

349
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,907
and like it's
embedded into the skin.

350
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,443
I think it looks great.

351
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:47,711
Tell us about your concept.

352
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,046
Boy finds girl, boy loses girl,

353
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,014
boy reanimates girl.

354
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,116
This is our body
for our Frankenstein.

355
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:55,318
You can see his understructure.

356
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,319
It has pistons in it

357
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,320
to operate his head movements.

358
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,788
What about top of the head?

359
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:00,056
- What are you doing up here?
- Probably an exposed brain.

360
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,224
You do realize, though,

361
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:02,759
a lot of people are doing
exposed brains.

362
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:04,894
I know, and that's why
I may not even do that.

363
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:07,129
We may decide to sculpt just,
like, a skull cap.

364
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:08,465
- Exactly.
- Yeah, yeah.

365
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:10,099
You might give the skull
a different shape,

366
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:11,768
maybe some scars in it
or something,

367
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:14,003
where the head was opened
and operated on.

368
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:15,238
- Right, right.
- But it's basically--

369
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:16,239
Seams in the bone type
of thing.

370
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:17,440
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

371
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,376
So, Mr. Westmore really
likes our design,

372
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,579
and that justifies my feeling
that we're on the right track.

373
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:25,314
All right, guys,
it's looking amazing.

374
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:26,549
- Good luck.
- Thanks, McKenzie.

375
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:27,751
- Thank you.
- Bye.

376
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,259
I'm happy with that.

377
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:41,831
In our concept,
Frankenstein relies completely

378
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:44,434
on the bride
to charge his batteries,

379
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:47,970
and the bride uses an umbrella
to get energy from the clouds

380
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:49,639
and weather and the atmosphere.

381
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:53,676
One of the ideas that Alana has
is that, in the future,

382
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,345
human parts
are fashion accessories,

383
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,815
so she wants
the bride's umbrella

384
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:01,451
to have the handle
of a human hand.

385
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:04,621
Luckily for us,
Tate is able to help.

386
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,022
Never done it
with third degree.

387
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:07,490
This may or may not work.

388
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:11,227
And we cast up his hand
using third degree,

389
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,995
which is a silicone material.

390
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,331
Just press paper towels
into it to hold the form,

391
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,834
and then come around
with the plaster bandage.

392
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:20,403
I don't really
have time for this,

393
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,139
but I would love help
from her at some point,

394
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:24,874
and I will call that card in.

395
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,843
After we cut it off his arm...

396
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:28,812
Thank you!

397
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:33,115
I pour a rigid material
inside the soft silicone mold

398
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,519
and get
a rigid hand impression.

399
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:37,587
Here you go, Tate.

400
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,388
That came out dope, dude,

401
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,691
and you can see
my fucking arm hair in it.

402
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:44,594
- Holy crap!
- I know, I know.

403
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:47,196
How are you using this?

404
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,298
It looks perfect, just the way
I thought it would look.

405
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,301
- Look how cool that is!
- That's amazing.

406
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:54,571
Come on now, give me a hand!

407
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,049
You just want this all done.

408
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,251
Miranda brings us
her Frankenstein face,

409
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:10,653
and we go ahead and mold that

410
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,922
while she continues
working on the bride's face.

411
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,525
After it's set,
we open Miranda's mold,

412
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,296
and the nose to the life cast
is stuck inside the mold.

413
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,064
- Ooh.
- That's not good.

414
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,000
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God!

415
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:26,102
- The nose--
- The nose broke off.

416
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:29,205
The second I see the nose,
panic sets in for me,

417
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:33,275
because what we could end up
with is an extremely thick edge

418
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,713
in the most important area
of our makeup.

419
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:37,881
Can you get it out?

420
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,215
Like, is that gonna be okay?

421
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:42,218
This problem I really don't have
time to solve right now,

422
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:44,587
because I still have
an entire female face

423
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,322
that needs to get sculpted,

424
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,291
and if I don't
get that out in time...

425
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:50,292
Ugh!

426
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,461
I'm screwed.

427
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:57,506
Oh, my God!

428
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,575
- The nose--
- The nose broke off.

429
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:02,044
- I could take a dremel to it.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

430
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,481
I'm gonna talk to Frank.

431
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:07,817
I immediately think
to just go find Frank,

432
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:09,852
'cause Frank,
he's great at molds.

433
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,723
_

434
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:12,524
_

435
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,090
This is a lot of work for me,

436
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,758
and I'm gonna
continue on the bride,

437
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,827
'cause otherwise,
we will not have a bride.

438
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:19,295
Does it blend
underneath the nose?

439
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:21,898
I think it's around-- right
around where it broke off.

440
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:24,733
It's really hard not to get
nervous in a time like this.

441
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:26,035
This makeup was collaborative,

442
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:27,569
and a part of me
feels responsible,

443
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:30,006
so I really need to
find a way to fix this.

444
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,109
Do you think taking a dremel
to it would do anything?

445
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:35,577
No, it doesn't solve anything.

446
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:38,080
The thing that makes it hard is
that even if they get it out,

447
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,748
chances are, it's not
gonna be in one piece.

448
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:41,350
- Sorry, guys.
- It's cool.

449
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,311
It could be okay,
but it's a gamble.

450
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:52,094
There you go.

451
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:54,897
I really need to make the wig.

452
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:57,766
It's gonna be
pretty hard to construct,

453
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:00,736
because I want to have all
these glowing lights on it.

454
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,873
I want it to look a lot like
Laura's sketch that she did.

455
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,042
I'm thinking of adding more of
them, like one, two, three,

456
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:07,243
and then two
going down the back.

457
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:08,978
Do it, yeah.
The more, the merrier, right?

458
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:10,579
It's just gonna be
a really long process,

459
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,248
and I'm starting to think maybe

460
00:19:12,282 --> 00:19:15,318
I didn't give myself enough
time, but I got to get it out.

461
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,892
I feel like Dr. Frankenstein
in this lab.

462
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:25,094
I'm having to go scavenge
for parts and pieces

463
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:27,930
that I can use, just like our
character would in our story.

464
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,732
The backpack
that I'm fabricating

465
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:31,734
will be used
as their life force,

466
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:33,669
and the guys are saying,
"Run with that."

467
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:34,937
They're pretty badass.

468
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:35,938
Is this EL wire
all through this?

469
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:36,939
Yeah.

470
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:37,940
To make it look like they glow?

471
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,208
Yeah.

472
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:41,010
EL wire is
electroluminescent wire.

473
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:42,644
It's basically a portable neon.

474
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:45,114
I thread it
in between the coils,

475
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,384
where it actually looks like
it's a heating element.

476
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,921
- Eddie?
- Yeah?

477
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,256
You're being really careful
with that, though, right?

478
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,257
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,657
It's a perfect fit,

480
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:57,426
and we're gonna cut
the nostrils out anyways.

481
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,495
The nose of the life cast was
only a minor setback

482
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:01,931
because I ended up putting
some epoxy putty on the nose

483
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:06,735
to get it back to the cast,
and that works.

484
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,939
30 minutes, guys!

485
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:11,707
Hey, Roy.

486
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:16,779
Okay.

487
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:20,283
By the end of day two, I'm
just-- I'm kind of indifferent.

488
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,751
I don't really feel like
I'm pushing the envelope,

489
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:25,254
I don't really feel like I'm
putting in any creative input.

490
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,991
Time!
Time's up, everybody!

491
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:31,527
It really sucks, 'cause this
is not what I'm here to do.

492
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:44,106
Time to rock and roll.

493
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:45,774
It's application day.

494
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,644
We only get four hours
to work in the lab.

495
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:51,814
That means apply, build,
and finish everything,

496
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:55,217
and then we have one hour
of last looks at the stage.

497
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:58,187
Check out how thin this is.
The foam came out perfectly.

498
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,589
Holy crap!
That's nice, man.

499
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:03,326
Now it's just a matter
of doing an amazing paint job.

500
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,834
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

501
00:21:11,868 --> 00:21:14,370
Man, we got some great stuff
for you today, dude.

502
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,939
You're going for this
kind of big S&M look.

503
00:21:16,974 --> 00:21:19,508
So this is my cowl.

504
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,077
Because
I didn't have enough time,

505
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:23,245
my mold wasn't prepared
properly,

506
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,482
so my cowl does not
come out right.

507
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,250
It's in a million pieces.

508
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,518
Grab one of the cowls,

509
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:31,454
pull it over your
understructure, right?

510
00:21:31,488 --> 00:21:32,788
That way
you can put this on it,

511
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,457
and you can glue it down
to the understructure.

512
00:21:34,491 --> 00:21:35,624
It'll hold it together.

513
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,026
I'm a little concerned,

514
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,461
but the good thing is,
it's Frankenstein.

515
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:39,561
They have stitches.

516
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:41,230
It's all skin
pulled together anyway.

517
00:21:41,264 --> 00:21:46,402
I have to make it seem like it
was meant to be that way.

518
00:21:51,574 --> 00:21:54,043
Application day is crazy.

519
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:56,012
There's just-- there's so much
to do in so little time.

520
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,946
At this point,
we just have kind of

521
00:21:57,981 --> 00:22:00,682
a base color on these faces,
so I'm scrambling,

522
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:01,917
painting like a madman,

523
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:03,452
just trying to stay optimistic

524
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:06,555
that we're gonna be able to
bring our character together.

525
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:14,630
- You don't want that on him?
- Not like that.

526
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,432
- Let's stop that, please.
- Okay.

527
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:18,267
I mean, I love you, girl,

528
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:21,270
but I think we got different
philosophies about paint.

529
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:25,908
Lyma is painting these very
wide, airbrush-y lines,

530
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,844
and this is not how you paint
realistically.

531
00:22:28,878 --> 00:22:30,112
Yeah, you got it.

532
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:31,447
I'm looking over
and I'm seeing things

533
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,748
that I would do different.

534
00:22:32,782 --> 00:22:34,016
I think that's
a little dark, Lyma.

535
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:35,884
- No! Trust me.
- My eyes work.

536
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,087
It's dark.
It's black.

537
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:39,788
I mainly do body painting,

538
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:44,326
but Tate expects realism,
which I am not used to doing.

539
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:46,662
We're screwed.

540
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,168
We're trying to work
as fast as possible.

541
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:54,437
I'm trying to work on her back,

542
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:56,172
Scott is
trying to work on her face.

543
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:58,340
It's hard to work on the same
model at the same time,

544
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,276
so I'm getting
a little frustrated.

545
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,810
We don't have time
to do all this.

546
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:03,245
We can do this then.
I'm sorry.

547
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,680
No, no "Sorry,"
I'm just about--

548
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:06,582
- I understand.
- I know what I'm doing!

549
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:10,652
I can't work on the face
while he's doing the back,

550
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,422
and I guess my tone is snarky,
'cause he gets pretty pissed.

551
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:15,291
I'm just trying to
keep it together.

552
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,067
- How long do we have?
- Six minutes, guys.

553
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:35,944
That's time, guys!
Let's go!

554
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,946
If Adolfo
and I can't get it together,

555
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,916
I'm highly concerned that we
could be going home.

556
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:44,786
Coming up...

557
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:47,789
How could I forget something
so crucial to the makeup?

558
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:49,091
Really great
decision-making.

559
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,459
I like your characters.

560
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:53,095
You missed an opportunity
to be much more creative.

561
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:01,164
It's last looks.

562
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,266
We have one more hour,

563
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,267
and we have to finish
these makeups.

564
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:04,635
This is very stressful.

565
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:06,370
There's still a lot to do.

566
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,972
We still have to finish
our entire paint job.

567
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:11,275
- Roy, do we have Krazy Glue?
- I don't think so.

568
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:13,777
I'm trying to put these tubes
on the female character.

569
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:16,213
We try every type of glue.
It's not working.

570
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:17,548
They won't stay.

571
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,216
They're just, like--
they're just popping.

572
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:23,854
At this point,
I'm really worried

573
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:26,724
that I'm not painting the
female character the right way,

574
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:29,560
but I'm doing my best.

575
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,729
We slide the bride's cowl on.

576
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,096
Just carefully, keep going.

577
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:34,197
And we're trying to stretch it

578
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:35,198
so it's not hitting
the makeup...

579
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,368
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Ooh!

580
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:39,737
And we get a tear,
so I try my best to patch it.

581
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,712
Time!

582
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:50,481
Oh, my God, you look awesome.

583
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,517
Time's up, and I forgot to
put the bolts in the head.

584
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:56,387
How could I forget something
so crucial to the makeup?

585
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,289
If anyone on our team
has to suffer for that,

586
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:00,291
it should be me.

587
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,269
Welcome to
the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

588
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:15,839
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

589
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,641
First, say hello to our judges.

590
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:20,744
Owner of Optic Nerve Make-Up
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

591
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:23,046
- Good evening, guys.
- Hi, Glenn.

592
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,549
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

593
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,051
- Good evening.
- Hi, Ve.

594
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:30,788
And Neville is unable to join
us today, but we have actor,

595
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,957
writer, and producer
Kevin Grevioux back with us.

596
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,158
How you guys doin'?

597
00:25:35,193 --> 00:25:38,028
Kevin, thank you so much
for being here.

598
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:39,830
Your spotlight challenge
was to create

599
00:25:39,864 --> 00:25:42,733
your own futuristic
Frankenstein and his bride.

600
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,068
Let's take a look
at your monsters.

601
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:13,364
This is just a wonderful
collaboration,

602
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:16,400
and I'm very proud of us.

603
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:35,018
Our characters
really do look cool.

604
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,621
Just, when you compare them
to everything else,

605
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:39,690
they're just a lot simpler.

606
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:58,542
Our monsters look okay
from a distance,

607
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:02,078
but you never know what the
judges are going to like.

608
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,697
Our monsters
have this cute chemistry,

609
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:23,333
and I'm very happy with
how they look as a couple.

610
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:49,059
It doesn't look to me like
it was a group effort.

611
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:50,928
It looks like too much
individuality

612
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:53,931
is trying to come through.

613
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,972
Well, judges, it's time to
get up close to the monsters.

614
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,313
That's wild.

615
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:11,482
I've never seen
that kind of detail.

616
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:12,649
Like little braces
or something.

617
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:14,885
Our characters, I love them,

618
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,153
but the judges
might hate everything.

619
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:19,155
Let's see you emote
through that makeup,

620
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,024
and let's see
how well it moves.

621
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,326
- Oh, nice.
- That's nice, the eyes.

622
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:26,096
I want to see
what's on top of your head.

623
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,899
All right, cool.
Thanks.

624
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:33,002
_

625
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,303
_

626
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:36,239
Okay, turn to the side.

627
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:38,375
Okay, now this is just wrong,
guys.

628
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:40,076
Yeah.
It's very patchy.

629
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:41,912
I'm nervous.

630
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:44,280
I know, if we're
on bottom looks,

631
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,282
it's Eddie and I
on the chopping block.

632
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:51,722
I want to see
the range of motion.

633
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:55,358
Let's see your back.

634
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:56,827
Bionics. I like that.

635
00:28:56,861 --> 00:29:01,031
And turn around.

636
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:02,365
I like the arm.

637
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,802
Yeah.

638
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:08,805
That's cool.

639
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,775
Come all the way around.

640
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:13,744
See, all the pistons move,
which is cool.

641
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,712
Come back around.

642
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:19,382
All right.
Thank you.

643
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,952
I love this big, giant,
purposeful edge.

644
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:23,868
That's a great detail.

645
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,269
_

646
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,124
Oh, I see.

647
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,327
The jaw is
in the wrong place, guys.

648
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:33,730
Put your head down.

649
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:36,600
I wondered
what these holes were for.

650
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:38,602
I see the judges pointing out
missing pieces,

651
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:40,370
like the bolts
on top of his head,

652
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,607
and that is the makeup
that I was responsible for.

653
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:46,076
I just don't want any of my
teammates to have to pay for it.

654
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:50,847
What do you think of
tonight's monster couples?

655
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:53,650
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

656
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:59,956
I just wondered
what these holes were for.

657
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,842
Those rivets on top
were my responsibility,

658
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:04,861
so I'm a little nervous
about that.

659
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:09,315
She looks much better far away.

660
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,483
They blew it
with the paint job.

661
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:13,052
- I agree.
- That's too bad.

662
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:16,155
They're doing this cool,
stretchy burn victim.

663
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,373
The survivor of a plague
or something.

664
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:19,926
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

665
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,497
Okay, Kevin,
you told these guys

666
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,499
what it would take
to impress you today.

667
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,568
- Are you impressed?
- I am.

668
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:30,603
These guys did an amazing job
of meeting the challenge.

669
00:30:30,638 --> 00:30:31,988
Thank you.

670
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,340
The judges would like to
speak with each of you

671
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:35,975
to find out more
about your work.

672
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,395
Alana, Laura, and Laney,
please step up.

673
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:45,301
Please tell us the story
of this couple.

674
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:47,787
A mad scientist buried
a corpse in the ground,

675
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,223
then lightning struck
and regenerated him.

676
00:30:50,257 --> 00:30:53,859
He had to find another power
source, so he created the bride,

677
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:56,779
and she is the charger,
and he is the battery.

678
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,048
Neither one
can live without the other.

679
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,918
The face and the cowl
was sculpted by me.

680
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:03,369
I sculpted the face on her,

681
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,972
and I sculpted
the brain on Frank's head.

682
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:09,542
Alana and I tag-teamed
the scars and scrapes on her.

683
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,579
- Laney did the wig as well.
- They're a great couple.

684
00:31:12,613 --> 00:31:14,230
You've kept her beautiful

685
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:17,483
against the contrast
with your Frankenstein.

686
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:20,887
Her face is lighter than the
rest of her body. It pops out.

687
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,472
Really great
decision-making

688
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,641
in terms of how you balanced
those makeups.

689
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,392
- Well done.
- Thank you.

690
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,012
Ladies, I love the paint jobs.

691
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:30,863
I love the modeling
on both of them.

692
00:31:30,898 --> 00:31:32,531
I think they look
really good together.

693
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:34,751
- Congratulations, ladies.
- Thank you.

694
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:37,203
When I first saw the design,
I didn't think

695
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:39,389
they looked like
they belonged together,

696
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,757
but upon
hearing your backstory,

697
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:42,842
I see why you made the choices
that you did.

698
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:45,411
- You guys did a good job.
- Thank you so much.

699
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,830
You can step down.

700
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,719
Sam, Eddie, and Miranda.

701
00:31:57,324 --> 00:32:00,076
What was the concept
behind your design?

702
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,763
Our concept is about a man
and woman who are so in love

703
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,164
that they want to be
together forever,

704
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,599
so they approach a doctor

705
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:10,203
who performs an experimental
immortalization procedure,

706
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:12,989
but this doctor implanted
a mind-control device

707
00:32:13,023 --> 00:32:15,241
to create an army to
take over the whole world.

708
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:18,144
Right.
Now, who did what?

709
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:21,981
I sculpted, painted,
and applied the two faces,

710
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,802
Sam sculpted
the female headpiece,

711
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:28,187
and Eddie sculpted
the male headpiece.

712
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:29,572
I think you missed
an opportunity

713
00:32:29,606 --> 00:32:32,558
to be much more creative.

714
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:36,362
It's too Borg-inspired.
It's a little on the nose.

715
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:38,097
Who did the hands, by the way?

716
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:39,699
I did.
I sculpted hers.

717
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:41,634
You sculpted them,
and did you apply them as well?

718
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,469
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh, not such a good thing.

719
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:46,472
Her hands aren't painted
the same color as her face.

720
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,074
And did you mean to have tubes

721
00:32:48,108 --> 00:32:49,842
coming out of that
other hand as well?

722
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:52,428
- It was a time issue.
- Okay.

723
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,047
Miranda, I think with his face,

724
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:55,882
there's some great subtlety
and nuance

725
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:58,217
to some of the bumps and
textures that are going on,

726
00:32:58,252 --> 00:33:00,753
but I do not like the bride
of Frankenstein's head here.

727
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:02,689
It is bulbous.

728
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:05,758
The design
doesn't make any sense.

729
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:08,311
Okay, you can head back.

730
00:33:08,312 --> 00:33:09,366
Thank you, guys.

731
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:15,034
Roy, Adolfo, and Scott.

732
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:21,340
Could you please
tell me your backstory?

733
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:24,410
This is our doctor.
This is the woman that he loves.

734
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:26,379
She dies unexpectedly.

735
00:33:26,413 --> 00:33:29,315
He works at a cryo lab,
and stores her so, hopefully,

736
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,067
in the future,
he can bring her back.

737
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:34,286
He dies, and another scientist
builds him a robotic body

738
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,172
and covers him with flesh.

739
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,673
Since his head was severed,

740
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,675
he has pistons that help him
move his head around.

741
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:40,827
I like your character.

742
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:42,995
It looks like his shoulders
are square,

743
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,664
but his head is offset because
of the way you have the collar.

744
00:33:45,682 --> 00:33:46,933
That's really cool,
the way you did it,

745
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:49,085
and I'm glad that
the arm's articulated.

746
00:33:49,136 --> 00:33:50,703
That's really cool as well.

747
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:53,473
I like the tubing
coming from her brain.

748
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:55,758
Who thought of that idea?

749
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,843
The bride's energy
is coming from the tubes

750
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,679
to her chest, heart, back.

751
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:01,731
It's also meant to
symbolize hair.

752
00:34:01,782 --> 00:34:05,017
I think that's interesting.
Good job.

753
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:06,753
With the female,
you've gotten caught

754
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:10,056
between making her really
horrifying or really beautiful.

755
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,327
The Frankenstein, I love the
idea of moving that shoulder

756
00:34:14,361 --> 00:34:17,997
and the way his arm is hidden,
but he's so top-heavy.

757
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:20,700
So, mixed bag for me
this week, guys.

758
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:22,535
Thank you.
You can step down.

759
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:29,959
Tate, RJ, and Lyma.

760
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:35,214
Let's hear the backstory.

761
00:34:35,249 --> 00:34:37,099
Well, Third World War,

762
00:34:37,151 --> 00:34:39,101
scientists cull the bodies
of dead soldiers

763
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:43,156
and create super soldiers
out of those remnants,

764
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,991
but the scientists don't
finish the project.

765
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:46,526
Humanity has perished.

766
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,844
They find this book,
which is the notes

767
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:49,946
of the biomechanics
of the creatures themselves.

768
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,764
We've been calling them
"Adam and Eve."

769
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,400
There's some really strong
sculptural ideas

770
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:55,651
with Frankenstein.

771
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:59,021
On the female, however,
not so much.

772
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,324
There's a lack of logical
decision-making

773
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:02,975
in terms of the anatomy.

774
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,361
That is exacerbated
by that paint job.

775
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:11,083
That contrasty airbrushing
would never hold up on camera.

776
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:12,652
And who painted which makeup?

777
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:15,872
Tate started
the pre-paint on the cowl first,

778
00:35:15,923 --> 00:35:19,292
and then Lyma applied and
painted the girl character.

779
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,377
Okay, Lyma, I got to ask,

780
00:35:21,428 --> 00:35:22,862
are you primarily
a body painter?

781
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:24,447
- Yes.
- Okay.

782
00:35:24,481 --> 00:35:26,031
It's very evident
in this makeup

783
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,600
that you do a lot
of airbrushing and,

784
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:29,569
unfortunately,
it doesn't look organic.

785
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:32,588
It looks very blown on.

786
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:35,074
- Thank you.
- Thank you, judges.

787
00:35:36,943 --> 00:35:40,913
Frank, Rick, and Eric,
please come to the center.

788
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,601
All right, guys,
so what's your backstory?

789
00:35:45,636 --> 00:35:48,604
They are actually terraformers
in a future world,

790
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:50,172
and they have a crash,

791
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:52,742
and the only parts left are
the hands of the two lovers,

792
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,777
which they use
to reanimate themselves.

793
00:35:54,828 --> 00:35:58,030
I sculpted the male,
and Frank sculpted the female.

794
00:35:58,065 --> 00:36:01,567
What's with the jawpiece?
It doesn't fit him properly.

795
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:03,469
I thought it might be funny
to have his lip showing,

796
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,805
so I suggested maybe glue it
a little higher.

797
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,939
Dude, what were you thinking?

798
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:09,158
You thought his lip
would be funny showing,

799
00:36:09,192 --> 00:36:11,744
when his whole chin's
hanging out of a chinpiece?

800
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,112
One more question.

801
00:36:13,146 --> 00:36:15,865
There's all these little dots
around the top.

802
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:17,917
Yes, that's 100% my fault.

803
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:19,619
There was meant
to be rivets on there.

804
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:20,920
That was something
that I forgot to do.

805
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:21,921
Well, that's too bad.

806
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:24,123
That would have been
really cool.

807
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:25,942
I like it.

808
00:36:25,993 --> 00:36:27,226
I think
they look good together.

809
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:30,162
They share skin tones.
That's important.

810
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:31,814
- Good job.
- Thank you.

811
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:33,916
On the female, I think
that the application

812
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:35,401
is handled really well,

813
00:36:35,435 --> 00:36:37,736
and I love the subtlety
of the sculpture.

814
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:39,956
However, I don't understand

815
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,741
what's going on
with Frankenstein.

816
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:43,993
He either looks really,
really, really sad

817
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:45,628
or absolutely confused,

818
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,130
and that's because of the way
that the eyes are sculpted,

819
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,799
and that's a huge problem
for me.

820
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,168
Thank you.
You can step back.

821
00:36:52,219 --> 00:36:55,221
- Thank you all.
- Thank you, judges.

822
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,223
Okay, will you please
head backstage

823
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,809
so the judges can make
their decisions?

824
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:06,098
Let's talk
about tonight's looks.

825
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:09,735
Why don't we start with Alana,
Laura, and Laney?

826
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,305
I think as a team,
it was very successful.

827
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:13,906
I thought the bride
really stood out.

828
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,409
Everything was highlighted
and lowlighted

829
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,810
exactly how
it should have been.

830
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,712
It's about the face for me.

831
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:22,448
That's the best thing
about that team's makeup.

832
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:26,619
Okay, let's move on to Adolfo,
Roy, and Scott.

833
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:28,487
I really liked the paint job
on the bride.

834
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:30,823
There's beautiful color accents
all over.

835
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:32,625
It was really nicely done.

836
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,743
Yeah, I actually liked

837
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:35,161
some of the more interesting
things they did

838
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:36,562
with the
Frankenstein character--

839
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:38,464
The attached arm,
the use of hydraulics.

840
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:41,200
I really liked the way
his head was offset.

841
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:43,769
Yes. Creating all those layers
on that guy really worked.

842
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,872
Okay, let's move on to Eddie,
Miranda, and Sam.

843
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,241
I don't think we could have
asked any more out of Miranda.

844
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:51,744
The sculpts are very nice,
and the color is very nice,

845
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,946
and that seems to be all her.

846
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,815
A much as I
loved the headpiece,

847
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:57,183
that seemed to be
Eddie's thing.

848
00:37:57,217 --> 00:38:00,119
Not quite sure how Sam
participated in all of this.

849
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,054
She sculpted the headpiece
on the female.

850
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:05,358
It was bulbous, it lacked
detail, it lacked anatomy.

851
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:07,727
She sculpted those weird
little pieces on the arms.

852
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:09,362
They weren't even glued
and blended in,

853
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:12,098
and then there wasn't even
any hoses in the one of them.

854
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:15,568
Okay, let's move on to RJ,
Lyma, and Tate.

855
00:38:15,602 --> 00:38:17,937
The Frankenstein character
was my favorite.

856
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,806
- The makeup told a story.
- I liked him, too.

857
00:38:20,841 --> 00:38:23,092
The "Eve" paint job
was unacceptable.

858
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,910
Those hard color transitions,

859
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,612
that's not what
we were looking for.

860
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:27,680
I absolutely agree.

861
00:38:27,714 --> 00:38:30,132
Okay.
Frank, Eric, and Rick.

862
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,251
Eric said that
he didn't have a chance

863
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:34,387
to put the rivets on top
of the head, which I think

864
00:38:34,421 --> 00:38:36,822
really would greatly
have helped that makeup.

865
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:40,426
The way that the eyes are
sculpted, he looks bewildered.

866
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,578
It makes no sense to me
whatsoever.

867
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,230
Judges, have you
made your decisions?

868
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,766
- Yeah, we have.
- Let's bring them back out.

869
00:38:54,224 --> 00:38:57,643
So, Glenn,
tell us about the top teams.

870
00:38:57,677 --> 00:39:01,247
Actually, there was just
one team that stood out

871
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:02,715
above all the others tonight.

872
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:13,045
So, Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

873
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,664
Actually, there was
just one team

874
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:17,966
that stood out above
all the others tonight.

875
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:22,871
Alana, Laney, and Laura.

876
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:25,507
Yeah, girls!

877
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:33,582
You had a lot of good things
going on for you tonight.

878
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:35,684
They were fun
without being silly,

879
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:38,520
and the paint scheme
was beautiful.

880
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:39,888
Congratulations.

881
00:39:39,906 --> 00:39:42,274
As the winners of this week's
spotlight challenge,

882
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:43,609
your characters
will be featured

883
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,944
in this year's
Halloween Horror Nights events

884
00:39:45,995 --> 00:39:47,830
at Universal Studios,
Hollywood,

885
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:50,115
and Universal Orlando Resort.

886
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,284
I just want to cry.

887
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:54,086
This is the most
overwhelming experience.

888
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,872
My piece is going to be
at Halloween Horror Nights.

889
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:58,090
Great job, ladies,

890
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:02,144
but as you know, we can
only have one winner.

891
00:40:02,178 --> 00:40:05,113
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

892
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:06,965
- Alana.
- What?

893
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,917
That's awesome, dude!
That's so rad!

894
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:14,356
We had to pick
one thing that we liked best,

895
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,925
and that was the face
of the bride.

896
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,127
- Congratulations.
- Oh, wow.

897
00:40:19,162 --> 00:40:20,329
I feel great.

898
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:22,247
All this hard work
I've been doing all year

899
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:25,450
is really paying off,
and I'm so proud of myself.

900
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:29,338
Alana, you and your team are
safe and can head backstage.

901
00:40:29,372 --> 00:40:30,772
Thank you.

902
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:38,514
Sam...

903
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:41,183
Eric, Lyma,

904
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:42,184
unfortunately,

905
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:44,987
you are on the bottom
this week,

906
00:40:45,021 --> 00:40:46,972
and one of you will be
eliminated.

907
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:48,490
The rest of you are safe.

908
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:51,360
Will you please head backstage?

909
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,534
Please step forward.

910
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:06,742
All right, Glenn,

911
00:41:06,776 --> 00:41:08,877
why don't you tell us
about the bottom looks?

912
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:11,079
Lyma, we realize that you made

913
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,048
significant contributions
to your team,

914
00:41:13,082 --> 00:41:17,152
but your paint job was just
too harsh and unrealistic.

915
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,821
Eric, with that Frankenstein,

916
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:22,307
we really didn't like the way
that the eyes were sculpted,

917
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:26,328
and the missing rivets left
your makeup feeling unfinished.

918
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:31,366
Sam, your bride's cowl sculpture
was strangely shaped,

919
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:34,202
and the hand sculpts were
less than impressive.

920
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:36,154
So, who's going home tonight?

921
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,889
The person going home
tonight is...

922
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:43,262
Sam.

923
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:47,182
Unfortunately, it seemed that
you didn't participate enough,

924
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:52,654
and what we did see from you
this week, we had issues with.

925
00:41:52,689 --> 00:41:56,592
Sam, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

926
00:41:56,626 --> 00:41:58,610
Eric, Lyma, you're safe.

927
00:41:58,645 --> 00:42:00,662
Will you please head backstage?

928
00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:08,870
Sam, we did enjoy
having you with us,

929
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:10,672
even though it was a short time,
and it seems that

930
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:12,407
you've got a lot of passion.

931
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:13,742
It's just a really,
really tough season.

932
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:15,627
There's a lot
of great competitors.

933
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:17,629
I had a great time,
so thank you for that.

934
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,581
Sam, it's been great
having you here with us.

935
00:42:19,616 --> 00:42:22,451
If you'd please head backstage
and pack up your kit.

936
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:23,652
Bye, guys.
It was nice to meet you.

937
00:42:23,686 --> 00:42:24,653
- Good luck.
- Take care.

938
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:25,854
Thank you.

939
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:27,489
It sucks to have my
time up so soon.

940
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:30,284
I really wanted to show
what I could do individually.

941
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:34,546
- No!
- Bye, guys.

942
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:35,731
No!

943
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:36,798
I've learned so much.

944
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,384
This is such
a humbling experience.

945
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:40,969
I had so much fun
meeting all you guys.

946
00:42:41,003 --> 00:42:42,904
This is definitely
a challenging competition,

947
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:46,058
and I didn't realize how intense
this was gonna be.

948
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:47,359
I'm definitely
not giving this up.

949
00:42:47,393 --> 00:42:50,696
This is my dream,
and I know I can do it.

950
00:42:50,747 --> 00:42:52,648
I'm sad that I'm going home,

951
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:55,448
but I already feel like
I've won just getting here.
