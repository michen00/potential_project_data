1
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,403
Welcome to the season finale
of Face Off.

2
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:19,064
Tonight, the stage is set
for a sensational showdown.

3
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:23,539
In the battle of veterans
versus newcomers,

4
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:26,864
just three veterans remain,
but only one will win it all.

5
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:29,597
This is it.
This is for all the marbles.

6
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,066
Laura.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,500
She's come back
and outdone herself.

8
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:36,172
I'm not just doing it
for myself.

9
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:38,807
I'm doing it
for my husband and my mom.

10
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:39,974
Tate.

11
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,374
You did some really cool stuff.

12
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,968
Very cool makeup.

13
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:45,742
This is not
about redemption to me.

14
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:48,443
Winning Face Off is exactly
what I need for my career.

15
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:50,177
Roy.

16
00:00:50,212 --> 00:00:52,446
Roy comes up
with these gigantic ideas.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,782
I want to win this for me
and my wife and for my kids.

18
00:00:56,816 --> 00:00:59,753
But in the struggle
to be crowned champion,

19
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:01,321
some will crumble
under the pressure.

20
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:02,889
You need to get on
the same page.

21
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:05,090
It's difficult to explain
a concept that doesn't exist.

22
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:07,024
- Wow.
- The seams are horrible.

23
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:08,159
Fuck.

24
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,160
There's so many holes
in that mold.

25
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:13,295
This is the worst position
I've ever been in.

26
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,765
It all comes down
to one final dance with destiny.

27
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,939
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

28
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:25,941
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

29
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:28,776
to one of their
85 international locations,

30
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:31,545
a 2013 Fiat 500,

31
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,872
and $100,000.

32
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:37,984
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

33
00:01:38,018 --> 00:01:40,719
Only one will win Face Off.

35
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,400
Being in the finale,
I still can't believe it.

36
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,335
After being almost in this place
before, it's very exciting.

37
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,806
I'm pinching myself
to make sure I'm awake.

38
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,108
Hi, baby.

39
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:07,276
I come downstairs,
and I see my wife, Melissa.

40
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:08,277
I made it!

41
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,312
I am so proud of you.

42
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:12,154
I knew you could do it.

43
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,289
_

44
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,566
_

45
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,453
I see not only my mother,

46
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,655
but there's also my husband.

47
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:20,722
Are you sleeping, eating?

48
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,624
Calm down.
It's all good, mom.

49
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:24,426
I see my mom and dad
on the laptop.

50
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,594
It's definitely what I need,

51
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:26,794
you know, to power me
through the finale.

52
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,796
I got one more challenge.
That's it.

53
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,965
You need to go win this thing
and come home to me.

54
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,166
I'm gonna do my best.

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,301
My wife, Melissa,
she's been supportive

56
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,970
in every aspect of my career.

57
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,373
I want to win this for her
and for my kids and for me.

58
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,677
This is it.
This is redemption.

59
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,613
- Never give up.
- Never surrender.

60
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,250
It's such a treat,
such a nice thing, to see them

61
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:51,452
and know that they're
rootin' for me back home.

62
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:52,687
You got it this time.

63
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:54,288
_

64
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:56,890
The one thing
that makes us love you

65
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:59,025
like we do is your heart.

66
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,560
- Thank you.
- Go Bubba go.

67
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:02,861
It's good to talk to my family

68
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:04,329
because they remind me
of the person that I am.

69
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:05,631
After seeing them,

70
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:08,000
I feel renewed and definitely
ready for the challenge.

71
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:10,636
- Bye. Love you.
- Love you.

72
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,003
- Sci-five.
- Sci-five.

73
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,059
I just want to make 'em proud.

74
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:29,352
We walk into the lab,
and this is it.

75
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:30,586
This is the last time.

76
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,388
This is the last challenge.

77
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:34,557
I've got to be the best,

78
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:37,427
so hopefully there's enough
creative energy for a win.

79
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:40,630
Congratulations,
and welcome to the finale.

80
00:03:40,664 --> 00:03:42,131
Thank you.

81
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,533
At the beginning
of this season,

82
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:46,302
we pitted the veterans
against the newcomers.

83
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:48,070
Now, only veterans remain.

84
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,575
Your final spotlight challenge

85
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:54,710
will delve into
the classical world,

86
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,213
where dance is one
of the highest forms

87
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:58,314
of expression.

88
00:03:58,348 --> 00:03:59,782
While special effects makeup

89
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:02,485
is typically
associated with film,

90
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,687
it is also often
used on the stage.

91
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,391
So, with that in mind,
you will be creating makeups

92
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,459
for a unique performance
of one of the most

93
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:13,429
iconic ballets of all time...

94
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:15,330
Swan Lake.

95
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,766
Aw!

96
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:40,089
That was phenomenal.
Thank you so much.

97
00:04:40,124 --> 00:04:43,593
The tragic plot of Swan Lake
involves a beautiful maiden

98
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,462
who is cursed
by an evil sorcerer

99
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,097
to live out her days as a swan

100
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:50,100
and only return
to her human form at night.

101
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:53,537
Your spotlight challenge
is to create two characters,

102
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:56,473
the maiden as she
is transforming into a swan,

103
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,976
and the wicked sorcerer
who cast the spell on her.

104
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,510
Ooh.

105
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:02,345
You will be
applying your makeups

106
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,048
to principal dancers
from the Los Angeles Ballet,

107
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:06,483
and three days from now,

108
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:09,152
they will be performing
in front of a live audience.

109
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,488
It's amazing.

110
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:14,357
Oh, crap.
Ballet.

111
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:16,792
Dance will restrict
so many ideas that I want to do.

112
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:18,527
This is definitely
a difficult challenge.

113
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,963
Obviously, there is a lot
on the line this week,

114
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:23,399
so I brought you some help.

115
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,268
Come on out, guys!

116
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:27,003
Yeah!

117
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:30,106
Yay!

118
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:33,943
All right, now you
will each get to choose

119
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:37,646
one veteran and one newcomer
to join your team.

120
00:05:38,982 --> 00:05:40,683
Laura, you get to chose first.

121
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:43,886
- Miranda.
- Let's do it, girl.

122
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:46,122
- Roy.
- I got to take Frank.

123
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:48,257
I gotta pick somebody
as crazy as I am.

124
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,025
- Tate.
- Alana, get over here.

125
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
I got you, Master Tate.
We're gonna do this.

126
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,060
What's up, punk?

127
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:53,495
I'm gonna go with Eddie.

128
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,963
I'll take Scott.

129
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,967
Lyma.

130
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,769
We're about to work
for this, Boo.

131
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:03,105
You are almost ready to go,
but I got a twist for you.

132
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,674
Always.

133
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,176
Swan Lake
found blockbuster success

134
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,879
in Darren Aronofsky's
Black Swan,

135
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:11,714
which was set
in modern-day New York.

136
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:14,050
However, the story
was originally set

137
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:16,553
in the middle ages,
which shows that this tale

138
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,921
can be set anywhere.

139
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,322
So with that in mind,

140
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:21,524
you will each
select a unique era

141
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:24,327
that must be incorporated
into your designs.

142
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,661
They are...

143
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:28,431
The Roaring '20s...

144
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:31,367
the Industrial Revolution...

145
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:33,403
the Ming Dynasty...

146
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,672
and the Italian Renaissance.

147
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:37,640
Tate, you're first to pick.

148
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,843
Industrial Revolution.

149
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:41,477
- How did I know?
- Laura, you're next.

150
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:43,479
Italian Renaissance.

151
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:45,649
And Roy.

152
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:48,584
- Ming Dynasty.
- Cool.

153
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:51,687
Okay, go ahead and get started
on your designs.

154
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,923
I'll be back later on
with my dad

155
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:54,957
to see how everything
is coming along.

156
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,726
- Cool.
- Bye-bye.

157
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,271
- Thank you.
- See you.

158
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,366
I'm gonna put out a concept,
and feel free to add to that.

159
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,035
When we sit down to sketch,

160
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,369
I'm trying to make
characters look like

161
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,504
they have elements

162
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,672
of the Italian Renaissance
within them.

163
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:12,342
For the female,
it's all golds and pearls,

164
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:14,076
and I would like
to put a crown,

165
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,912
slightly alter
the shape of her head,

166
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:18,080
and make it look
as though her clothing

167
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:20,116
is starting to melt
into her skin.

168
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,186
Let's go on
to the evil sorcerer.

169
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,388
Sorcerers, in my head anyway,

170
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:28,191
always have those
very pointed shoulders,

171
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,059
and they have a crown.

172
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:32,028
Dark features, and of course

173
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:33,696
he's gonna have
a staff of power.

174
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,497
If you got a good fabric
that will flow...

175
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:36,665
Mm-hmm.

176
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,133
It'll extenuate
his whole dance.

177
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,768
Yeah.
That might be good.

178
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:41,804
Since we're doing
the Industrial Revolution...

179
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,205
Industrial Revolution.

180
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,108
I really want to emphasize
the pollution versus purity.

181
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:48,244
With my sorcerer,
I'm incorporating

182
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:50,412
the Industrial Revolution
into his character

183
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,381
by making him smokey
and soot-covered

184
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,882
and putting smoke stacks
into his head and chest.

185
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:58,220
I want the swan to be purity.
You know what I mean?

186
00:07:58,254 --> 00:07:59,955
So there's that contrast
between them.

187
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:02,724
I'm making the swan feel like
it's pulling out of her,

188
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,893
so I come up with this idea
of putting the swan

189
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,561
on the arm
and a wing in the head,

190
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:08,363
and a swan profile
coming out of her chest.

191
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,432
And then on the face,
I want to keep it--

192
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:13,435
- Soft?
- Soft but beautiful.

193
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:15,470
Okay, do I look like
I go to the ballet a lot?

194
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:17,472
So, I sit down with my team.

195
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,307
We start going over ideas.

196
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,676
I feel like I'm definitely
struggling on this one.

197
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,677
You know...

198
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,078
I'm just not feeling it.

199
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,613
I don't know if it's
just because it is ballet

200
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:28,283
and Ming Dynasty that, you know,
I'm just-- I feel lost.

201
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm open to any ideas
and input.

202
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:33,555
So maybe instead of it
being she's enchanted,

203
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,191
maybe he's turning her
into an automaton.

204
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,793
Yeah.

205
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:39,528
Since I don't know where
I'm gonna go with this makeup,

206
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,163
I'm going with Frank's concept
of the automaton.

207
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:43,933
So our sorcerer
is really an inventor,

208
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:47,336
and he creates mechanical pieces
that people think are magic,

209
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:49,505
and he's actually
created this automaton,

210
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,507
which is mechanical,

211
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,310
that's turning from
a human form into a swan.

212
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:56,212
So I just go ahead

213
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:58,215
and let Frank and Scott
start sculpting.

214
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,584
Frank starts working
on our sorcerer

215
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:03,120
and Scott starts workin' on
the face appliance for our swan,

216
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:04,888
and I pull some clay
and start trying

217
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:07,592
to work on some feather pieces.

218
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:09,661
What are you thinking about
for her body?

219
00:09:09,695 --> 00:09:11,162
I'm not--
I'm thinking about it.

220
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,632
Yeah.

221
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,201
This is blocking-out day.

222
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:17,536
Miranda
is blocking out the cowl

223
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,505
and Eddie is blocking out
the chest of the sorcerer,

224
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:23,609
and I start on the chest piece
for our swan.

225
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,077
I'm going to try to get as much

226
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:28,615
blocked out in clay
as I possibly can today.

227
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:32,452
That's looking really nice.

228
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,853
I'd still bring the beak out
just a little bit.

229
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:35,755
The most important part
as team leader

230
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,990
is that I see my vision
through the way I want it to be,

231
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,625
which means that
I'm going to have my hand

232
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,293
in all the sculptures.

233
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:44,529
Um, Tate?

234
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:47,466
I have Lyma working on
some bird scaling textures

235
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
for the hand and for the arms.

236
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:50,401
It's not going well.

237
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,571
Lyma's sculpting very flat,
and I don't like it.

238
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,073
Can I say something?
Check this out.

239
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,142
On some of 'em,
add a little piece

240
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:58,443
on the top to get
some dimension.

241
00:09:58,478 --> 00:09:59,444
- You sure you want that?
- Yeah.

242
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,480
It's my ass on the line.

243
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,082
She needs to stop
thinking for herself

244
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:04,216
and start listening
to my delegation.

245
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,551
They don't have to overlap,

246
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,152
but some of 'em, just
raise up above the others.

247
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,188
Okay.

248
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:12,190
Hey, guys!

249
00:10:12,224 --> 00:10:13,691
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

250
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:16,293
Here for
a final walk-through.

251
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:18,496
How are you showing us

252
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,832
that there is a morphing
going into the swan?

253
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,700
The thought
was to take the wings

254
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,102
so they're coming forward

255
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:26,671
and wrapping around
her body this way.

256
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,973
Is it going to wind up
being beautiful,

257
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,708
or is it gonna look
like a bony chest

258
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,643
from a horror movie?

259
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:34,244
This isn't monster.
It's not alien.

260
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,213
- It's the ballet.
- All right.

261
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:38,082
The era we picked was
the Industrial Revolution,

262
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:40,650
so I really want to work in
a lot of metal fabrication

263
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,686
as well as gears and things
of that nature,

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,753
kind of steam-punky.

265
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:46,089
One thing I want
to warn you on is,

266
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,891
because it's pollution,
because it's smoke,

267
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:49,292
because it's dirt and grime
and all like that,

268
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,161
don't get it too dark.

269
00:10:51,195 --> 00:10:52,262
I feel it's the one thing

270
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:53,930
that you've
been doing all season.

271
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:56,333
You've been lucky,
so be careful right here

272
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,168
because something like that
could be a problem.

273
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:00,136
Yeah.
That's a good idea.

274
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:02,172
Frank had this great idea
of our guy being, like,

275
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:04,140
an alchemist
and turning the swan

276
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:07,076
into an... automaton.

277
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:09,112
- Automaton.
- Automaton.

278
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,346
Do you have any sketches
of the swan?

279
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,081
We're still trying
to figure all that out.

280
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,250
Now, this is one of the things
that's happened in the past.

281
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:17,787
The person that was in charge
didn't keep it all coordinated.

282
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:19,255
The thing about
team challenges is that

283
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,790
you want to make sure
that it looks like

284
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:22,225
the same person did everything,

285
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,693
especially in the finale,
which right now,

286
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:25,328
that's not what I'm doing,
'cause I got one person

287
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,097
doing one character
and one person doing the other,

288
00:11:27,131 --> 00:11:29,132
and then I'm oblivious
to what's going on.

289
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,834
I want to win,

290
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,857
but if I don't figure this out,
I'm really screwed.

291
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:36,707
Coming up...

292
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:38,108
There's so many holes
in this mold.

293
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:39,910
I think my swan is ruined.

294
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,913
The seams on the cowl
are horrible.

295
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,815
- There's no next week.
- Yeah.

296
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,016
You need to get
on the same page.

297
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,951
The winner of Face Off is....

298
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:55,999
So, tell us
about your whole concept

299
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,233
and what you're working on.

300
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:58,901
We're still trying
to figure all that out.

301
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,504
Today's the first day
of the finale challenge.

302
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,905
We have to create a sorcerer

303
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,806
and a swan that's
in mid-transformation,

304
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:07,876
but it's difficult to explain
a concept that doesn't exist.

305
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,044
There's no next week...

306
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:11,346
- Yeah.
- ...and it has to work.

307
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,614
Really get on the same page.

308
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,049
We're not off
to a good start...

309
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,551
Can't wait to see it.

310
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:16,852
...but I've never been
the type to give up.

311
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:17,887
I'll figure something out.

312
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:20,189
All right, everybody.
Good luck!

313
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:22,225
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

314
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,361
_

315
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:27,697
Cool. Yeah.
Love it.

316
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:30,867
End of day one, and we've
got a good pace going on.

317
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,935
I feel like everybody
is working very smoothly,

318
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,071
and I feel like we've
started out on a high note.

319
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,776
All right.
That's time, everybody.

320
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,744
Today could have been
much better.

321
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,881
I'm not jiving
with the concept for my swan.

322
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm not sure
where this is gonna go,

323
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:51,137
but I really want
to win this time.

324
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,061
Whoo!

325
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:02,263
It's day two in the lab.
We've got ten hours today,

326
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:03,464
and there's a lot to do.

327
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:05,232
- Don't have that curve in it.
- Oh, okay.

328
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,134
Getting home and, you know,
gettin' a little bit of rest

329
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:09,336
last night really cleared up
a lot of things,

330
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,173
and I'm afraid Frank's idea
of doing a mechanical swan

331
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,776
is gonna look too much
like what Tate is doing,

332
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,610
so my new concept
is that our sorcerer

333
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,245
is a Chinese alchemist,

334
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,882
and the girl turns
from human to gold to swan.

335
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,017
That way, we can still go

336
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,351
with what we've got going

337
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,586
and we're not losing any time

338
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,689
with anything
that we've already started.

339
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,827
This is a long lab day,
and the goal

340
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,095
is to get
these two chest pieces molded,

341
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,899
and Miranda and I are done
with the detail on the chest,

342
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:39,100
so Eddie gets to take those

343
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:42,170
back into the molding room
and start molding.

344
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,375
I was thinking
about it last night.

345
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,077
These guys, we're gonna
have to put on hold because...

346
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,679
we're shifting
over to porcelain.

347
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:52,047
Okay.

348
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,515
I've decided that
I didn't feel comfortable

349
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:54,549
with the Industrial Revolution

350
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,785
not being integrated
into my swan.

351
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:59,254
So my new concept
is that the sorcerer wants

352
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:02,091
to capture the spirit
of the princess

353
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,327
inside this mechanized vessel,

354
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,762
so she's
a porcelain-skinned doll

355
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,565
with all these underlying
brass gears and stuff.

356
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,034
And I want to see you
paint some of these.

357
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:13,037
Deciding to go
with the mechanized swan

358
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,904
eliminates the need
for the skin textures

359
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,340
that Lyma's been working on,
which is unfortunate,

360
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:18,441
but I'm going
to give her some feathers

361
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:19,642
and I'm gonna
tell her what color

362
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:22,144
and we'll see how that goes.

363
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:30,900
_

364
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,655
Time's almost up
and we're pushing it

365
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,757
on the swan's cowl.

366
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,358
It's crackin' everywhere.

367
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:37,760
It's just-- it's fallin'
all to pieces.

368
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,761
Fuck.

369
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,662
There's just no way
to salvage this thing,

370
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:43,531
so we'll have
to re-do this one.

371
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:44,532
Oh, damn.

372
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,566
I'm pretty ticked.

373
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:47,101
I feel like I've let Roy down.

374
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,004
I really wanted this cowl mold
to come out nice.

375
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,038
We'll make it
beautiful tomorrow.

376
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:53,807
_

377
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:58,445
Okay! Time.
That's it!

378
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,912
I'm trying to be laid back
on this one.

379
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,414
I don't want to be, like,
a tyrant, but that cost us

380
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,815
at least three hours,

381
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,484
and that's
a pretty good-sized hit.

382
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:16,795
Oh, yeah.

383
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,397
Day three, we have
9 1/2 hours in the lab.

384
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:21,299
I'll start on this puppy
and figure out what's goin' on.

385
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:23,101
We have to get the cowls

386
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:24,803
into the mold room
as fast as possible.

387
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,938
- This okay, like, how it is?
- Yeah.

388
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:29,240
So Miranda is finishing up
the cowl for the sorcerer.

389
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,983
I'm going to finish up
the cowl for our swan.

390
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:35,246
We've got a lot
of things to do today.

391
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,249
Scott's got to re-sculpt
the cowl and get that mold made,

392
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,650
and I want him to take time.

393
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:40,952
I want to make sure
that it gets done right,

394
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,054
so I tell Scott,
"As long as it's ready

395
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,278
by the end of the day,
that's fine."

396
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:49,561
Frank still has to make the mold
on his cowl that's sculpted.

397
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:51,363
I'm starting making stuff
for the armor

398
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:54,099
and start working on the cloak.

399
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:58,071
Do you want them
to be uneven like that...

400
00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:59,205
Yeah.

401
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,340
...or do you want me
to round them? Okay.

402
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:01,375
No, I want them to look like

403
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:02,576
- the brick has chipped at the top.
- Okay.

404
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,545
Alana and I
bounce back and forth

405
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,115
on the sorcerer's crown
and shoulder pads.

406
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,819
I'm going to have Lyma feathering up
the chest, feathering the head,

407
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,520
and beginning the arm feathers.

408
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,290
You might want to start
with the long feathers first

409
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:17,858
and work your way backwards.

410
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,666
That way, they lay correctly
over each other.

411
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,130
Here you go.

412
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:25,766
We finish up the cowls,
so Eddie begins molding,

413
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,101
and Miranda and I
continue to work on the faces.

414
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,602
Yeah.
We got three hours.

415
00:16:29,637 --> 00:16:33,340
The sorcerer's cowl
has two horns that intertwine

416
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:34,975
and one horn
coming up the front.

417
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:38,278
This is very difficult to mold,
so I create a plug

418
00:16:38,313 --> 00:16:41,749
that I'm gonna cut out
once the piece is run in foam.

419
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,050
Everything seems
to be going well,

420
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,319
but I'm rushing and rushing
just to make sure

421
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,222
that everyone gets done
by the end of the day.

422
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:55,095
Looking good, girl.
Looking good.

423
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,664
Our sorcerer has a chest piece,

424
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:59,734
and Frank has sculpted
out chest armor.

425
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,636
Then we're gonna take some L200
and cut out the swan design

426
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,506
that he came up with and glue it
directly to the chest

427
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,708
so it looks
like it's all one piece.

428
00:17:07,742 --> 00:17:09,777
Take it out and hit it
with the spray gun.

429
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,278
It'll spray
that water clay right out.

430
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:12,780
So, while I'm molding the cowl
for the sorcerer,

431
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:16,818
Alana runs outside to clean
the cowl mold for my swan.

432
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:18,453
Fuck.

433
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,722
And all the sudden, she comes
running back in, white-faced.

434
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:22,891
There's so many fucking
holes in that mold.

435
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,726
- It's fucked up.
- Really?

436
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,629
And I-I can't even
get the fucking L200 out.

437
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,130
The clock's dwindling down.

438
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:30,832
I still have a lot to do.

439
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:31,833
Let me go take a look.

440
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:32,867
I'm worried.

441
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:34,436
I don't have time
to re-sculpt it,

442
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,772
and I definitely
don't have time to re-mold it.

443
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,008
The inside of the mold
is full of holes,

444
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:42,443
so when you run foam in it,
all you're gonna get

445
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:45,112
is the shape of the swan head
but none of the details,

446
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:46,780
so at this point,
the overall look

447
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:48,682
of the swan character
could be ruined.

448
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,851
I can't go out like this.

449
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:57,538
It's day three, and the inside
of the swan's cowl mold

450
00:17:57,573 --> 00:17:59,574
is full of holes,

451
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:02,309
so instead of finishing
my piece for the sorcerer,

452
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:05,146
I'm outside stuffing clay
into holes in my mold.

453
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,915
I'm trying to keep
myself together,

454
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:10,785
but I'm just really upset.

455
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,488
- Did you finish the cowl?
- Yeah.

456
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:14,889
Because I had to waste
a lot of time

457
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:17,391
fixing the swan's cowl mold.

458
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,227
I don't think I'm gonna get
my sorcerer mold done in time.

459
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,195
15 minutes!

460
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,537
That's time, everybody!

461
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:33,774
I don't get my sorcerer mold
done in time for foam,

462
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,163
which means that tomorrow,
on the day of application,

463
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:39,179
I'm going to have to run it
in latex and polyfoam.

464
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:41,115
21 challenges on Face Off,

465
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:44,334
and this is the worst position
I've ever been in.

466
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:58,900
All right, it looks like we've
got everything in good shape.

467
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:00,535
It's application day
for the finale.

468
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:01,836
We've got four hours
in the lab,

469
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,404
and then one hour
at last looks.

470
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:05,139
Oh, that's great.

471
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:06,541
She may actually be able
to dance with it.

472
00:19:06,575 --> 00:19:07,742
This is definitely
the most important day

473
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:09,276
that I've had on Face Off.

474
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,712
It's make-it-or-break-it time.

475
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:15,950
The seams on the cowls
are horrible.

476
00:19:15,984 --> 00:19:17,685
- Wow.
- Yeah.

477
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,420
It's on the other side too.

478
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,589
There's foam where there
should not be foam.

479
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:23,924
But the good news
is we still have

480
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,558
the same form
that we started out with.

481
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:28,261
It's just gonna set us back
maybe an hour.

482
00:19:31,464 --> 00:19:32,765
We're gonna get you guys
into wardrobe.

483
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,966
- They're gonna take care of you.
- Tate.

484
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,201
I have a few things
to do outside.

485
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:36,469
Which wardrobe do you like
the best for him?

486
00:19:36,503 --> 00:19:37,603
Ooh.

487
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,205
This is the day
that defines all of my work,

488
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:41,607
and yesterday was a setback

489
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,209
because I didn't get
my sorcerer mold done in time.

490
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:46,679
So, while I'm finishing that,

491
00:19:46,714 --> 00:19:49,449
I've got Lyma beginning
the arm feathers and Alana

492
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:52,519
on pre-application
on the sorcerer's face.

493
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:54,387
There's $100,000 on the line.

494
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:56,856
Isn't that fucking insane?

495
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,491
That's pretty cool, Roy.

496
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:01,694
Oh, yeah.
That looks so good.

497
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:05,197
2:52 on the clock,
everybody!

498
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:07,666
Yeah, it fits great.

499
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,435
Okay, can you get
some sort of-- Oh, perfect.

500
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,877
The seams on the cowls
were very rough,

501
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,378
but once we get past that,

502
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:25,039
we are really good on time,
and there's a wonderful thing

503
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:26,716
that we add
to the swan's wardrobe,

504
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,518
and that's
the giant pearl choker.

505
00:20:28,553 --> 00:20:31,388
There's six edges now
that I don't have to cover up

506
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:32,957
because I'm covering them
with wardrobe.

507
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,193
Strategically, that's probably

508
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:36,728
the smartest thing
I do all season.

509
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:38,329
That looks great, Laura.

510
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,798
It's coming together.

511
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:44,100
Black, red, yellow, orange!

512
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:48,271
Do you need to go jump on that?

513
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,706
Application's taking a lot
longer than what I thought.

514
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:51,641
All right, I got to start
layin' feathers now.

515
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,476
If not, we're not
gonna get 'em laid.

516
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:54,677
I'm gonna start
putting the feathers

517
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,312
up the back and on the cowl.

518
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:58,948
Yeah, as you move,
they'll ripple.

519
00:20:58,983 --> 00:21:01,051
The time's just slippin' away.

520
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:03,601
That's one hour, everybody!

521
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:04,840
One hour!

522
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,592
We're gettin' there.
We're gettin' there.

523
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:12,494
Okay.
We're good back here.

524
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:13,895
Everything's starting
to come together.

525
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,664
The appliances look nice.

526
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:18,400
Lyma's doing the body paint.
It looks good.

527
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:19,768
I'm starting to see
a little light

528
00:21:19,802 --> 00:21:20,802
at the end of the tunnel here.

529
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:23,872
- How long do we have?
- Seven minutes.

530
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:29,479
Um-- oh!
Teeth.

531
00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:31,882
- I am busy.
- You got feathered hair.

532
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,884
Literally feathered hair.

533
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,919
I'm here.

534
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,323
- Time! That's it!
- All right, guys.

535
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,791
- Let's get out of here, man.
- Whoo.

536
00:21:41,826 --> 00:21:44,194
Got a lot done.
Still have a lot to go.

537
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:45,863
We're not in a great spot.

538
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:49,099
There are details that could
make or break my characters.

539
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,500
This is reminding me
a lot of season three.

540
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:53,902
I was at the finish line,
and I tripped,

541
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:56,659
and gosh, I don't want that
to happen again.

542
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,480
We're at the theater where
the performance is gonna be at,

543
00:22:05,515 --> 00:22:06,581
and this is it.

544
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,016
This is for all the marbles.

545
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,518
Honestly, I'm as nervous
as I was

546
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:13,297
the very first challenge
that we had on Face Off.

547
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:18,393
This last hour
is tremendously important.

548
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:21,396
I have to apply
and completely paint the crown

549
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:24,165
and the shoulder pads
that I just made this morning

550
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,834
out of latex and polyfoam.

551
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:28,503
So, lots of pressure.

552
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:30,499
I just hope that it
fits my model correctly.

553
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:38,414
Frank is gonna handle
the application on the sorcerer,

554
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:40,816
'cause it's gonna take me
and Scott both to apply

555
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,751
all the feathers and to get
everything painted on the swan.

556
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:44,219
Yeah, let's see
what we got goin' here.

557
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:45,521
There is so much work to do.

558
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:48,757
Eddie and Miranda
are double-teaming the sorcerer,

559
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:50,192
and I'm working on the swan.

560
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:52,861
I need to give her
lipstick, eyeliner,

561
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:54,530
all these details
that, hopefully,

562
00:22:54,564 --> 00:22:56,899
the judges will appreciate.

563
00:22:59,135 --> 00:23:00,870
That's time, guys!

564
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,272
Drop the brushes!
We're done!

565
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,009
Roy, it's time.

566
00:23:06,044 --> 00:23:08,146
Time's up, and I feel
really good about these makeups.

567
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,647
They both look incredible.

568
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:10,949
I think that we have met

569
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,717
every part of this challenge
as a team.

570
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,986
- Thank you.
- They look so fucking good.

571
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,121
Finally, it's over.

572
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:17,822
It's just a wash of relief.

573
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:20,659
We made exactly what I wanted.

574
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:21,894
Doing this in two days...

575
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:22,928
- Let's see him.
- ...is insane.

576
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:23,929
That looks so good.

577
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:26,199
My biggest concern

578
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,701
is the latex and polyfoam
crown flying off.

579
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:32,205
If it was foam latex, it would
have been custom fit to him,

580
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:35,374
so I'm not out
of heart-attack-land yet.

581
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:36,675
Coming up...

582
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:40,112
I'm nervous.
I can't stop shaking.

583
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:41,146
This is the finale.

584
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:43,415
You achieved an iconic look.

585
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:45,684
She may be the strongest
one on stage tonight.

586
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:48,720
The two of 'em together,
the dance was exquisite.

587
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:57,379
Ladies and gentlemen,

588
00:23:57,413 --> 00:24:00,182
please welcome
McKenzie Westmore.

589
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:10,258
Welcome to the Face Off
season finale.

590
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:16,832
Tonight, we are celebrating
one of the dance world's

591
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:19,969
highest art forms
with a spectacular performance

592
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:22,039
of Swan Lake.

593
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,744
Now, for their final
spotlight challenge,

594
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,982
we asked each of our finalists
to create two original makeups.

595
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:35,018
A beautiful maiden as she
is transforming into a swan,

596
00:24:35,052 --> 00:24:37,654
and the evil sorcerer
who cast the spell on her.

597
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:40,457
We also asked the artists
to incorporate

598
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:42,893
a unique era
into their designs.

599
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:44,628
Now, with that,
I would like to introduce

600
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:46,231
our panel of judges.

601
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:48,233
First off, we have owner
of Optic Nerve

602
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:51,003
Makeup Effects Studio
Glenn Hetrick.

603
00:24:55,074 --> 00:24:59,310
Three-time Oscar winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

604
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:08,219
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

605
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:15,093
All right, everybody.
It is time to get started.

606
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:17,495
Our first pair of makeups
is from Roy,

607
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,430
and he chose the Ming Dynasty.

608
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:20,731
Let's take a look.

609
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:01,172
I feel really good
about these makeups.

610
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:02,874
It fits ballet,

611
00:26:02,908 --> 00:26:04,943
but it also fits
the Ming Dynasty,

612
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:06,177
so I think that we have met

613
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:09,814
every part of this challenge
as a team.

614
00:26:39,676 --> 00:26:44,011
The female character
is beautiful yet striking,

615
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:46,348
and the sorcerer's
got a lot of fine details.

616
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:49,818
I'm feeling very proud
for myself, but also my team.

617
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:20,884
Wow.
We pulled it off.

618
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:23,153
I spent three days thinking

619
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:25,089
I was about to put
a dead goose on stage,

620
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:26,156
and instead, I end up

621
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,492
with really
remarkable-looking swan.

622
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:32,329
I'm actually very proud
of both makeups.

623
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:35,666
All right, everybody.

624
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:37,535
Well, that was
just the beginning,

625
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,138
because now it's time
to put them all to the test

626
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,475
in a unique performance
from the Los Angeles Ballet.

627
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:44,542
Yes.

628
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:47,379
I present to you, Swan Lake.

629
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:46,488
Wow!

630
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:49,042
That was amazing!

631
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:53,862
I want to give a huge thank you
to the Los Angeles Ballet

632
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:56,899
for creating
such a beautiful piece.

633
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,734
And to our studio audience,

634
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:01,336
thank you
for being with us tonight,

635
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,539
now it's time for the judges
to take a closer look

636
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:07,309
at the makeups
and deliberate in private.

637
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,643
So, good night everybody,

638
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:10,611
and thank you again
for being here.

639
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,715
Thank you, guys!

640
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:20,522
Judges, why don't you come

641
00:31:20,556 --> 00:31:22,976
take a closer look
at tonight's characters.

642
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:29,564
From far away, the makeups
look like they held up,

643
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,667
but during the performance,
anything could have happened,

644
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:34,069
so I'm nervous.

645
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:37,106
This is the finale.
I can't stop shaking.

646
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:39,375
We want to know what you think

647
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,143
of tonight's transformations.

648
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:44,180
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

649
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:51,159
I like the way it comes
like feathers.

650
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:52,834
And the gold here, I like that.

651
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,970
- Can you turn around, please?
- The wing thing's pretty cool.

652
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:57,804
I like the hair in feathers.
It's a really cool shape.

653
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,839
You can come back around,
honey.

654
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:04,508
That's a very cool art piece.

655
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:07,110
And I do love the palette.

656
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,244
I want you to try
to emote through the makeup.

657
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,612
It moves all right.

658
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,616
It looks like gilded ceilings
with ivory molding.

659
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:19,753
It's theatrical enough that
it's working from a distance.

660
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,590
Whoa.
That's a lot of work on him.

661
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:27,725
- Can you tilt your head down?
- Wow.

662
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,160
I mean, it creates
such a unique character.

663
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:31,747
Thank you.

664
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:36,698
Look at all the little gears
and stuff.

665
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:37,732
This is really
beautifully handled.

666
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:38,833
Can you turn
to the side for us?

667
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:40,268
Look at that.
It's quite amazing.

668
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:43,070
Really does
a subtle Industrial.

669
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:45,670
This is really interesting.

670
00:32:45,705 --> 00:32:47,904
Wow.

671
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:49,572
It's a great beard.

672
00:32:49,606 --> 00:32:52,675
Can you turn
to the side for us?

673
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:55,043
- That's a great profile.
- Yeah.

674
00:32:55,077 --> 00:32:57,745
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

675
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:04,783
So, judges.

676
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,084
How did they do tonight?

677
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,619
I think it was
absolutely fantastic.

678
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,587
I feel very confident

679
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,055
that we have the right people
here tonight.

680
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,890
I'm just really happy with
the way the makeups turned out.

681
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,457
Good work, guys.

682
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,158
I think it's some
of the most beautiful work

683
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:19,026
that I've seen to date.

684
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:21,362
Well, the judges
would like to speak

685
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:23,596
with each of you
to learn more about your work.

686
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:26,632
Roy, you're up first.

687
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:35,139
Roy, tell us
about your concept.

688
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:36,540
I chose the Ming Dynasty.

689
00:33:36,574 --> 00:33:37,774
What I decided to do

690
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:40,543
is make my sorcerer
also an alchemist,

691
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:42,778
and so whenever
he takes and casts a spell

692
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,646
she actually turns to gold
before she turns into feathers.

693
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:47,147
I think
it's absolutely gorgeous,

694
00:33:47,182 --> 00:33:49,849
particularly your sorcerer.

695
00:33:49,883 --> 00:33:52,384
Shrouding him
with all the swan forms

696
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,319
is quite brilliant,

697
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:57,254
and it makes this really cool
profile and silhouette

698
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:59,756
for your sorcerer and gives it
a very Asian flare.

699
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,525
With your swan,

700
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,193
you could have handled
that feather transition

701
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:05,528
into her skin
a little bit better,

702
00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:07,163
but they certainly
look like they go together

703
00:34:07,197 --> 00:34:09,097
and they looked absolutely
gorgeous dancing together.

704
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:10,465
Thank you.

705
00:34:10,499 --> 00:34:12,166
I noticed that you did
a little treatment on her nose.

706
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Now, what was that meant to be?

707
00:34:14,235 --> 00:34:15,634
That's meant
to start progressing

708
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:16,869
into the bill,
because that--

709
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,937
I didn't want to take
and add to the nose,

710
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:20,571
you know, so much, 'cause I
didn't want it to look comical.

711
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:22,373
I think that
was very successful.

712
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:23,740
I like the way you integrated

713
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:25,985
the black eye makeup
above the cheekbone.

714
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,276
That's really a neat transition.

715
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:29,078
I think you did a great job.

716
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:30,812
Thank you, thank you.

717
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:33,448
The female character,
a little odd for me in places,

718
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:36,317
but the overall design
of your characters

719
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:38,452
is so profoundly strong

720
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:42,356
that you achieved
your own iconic look,

721
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,958
and that's one
of the greatest things

722
00:34:43,992 --> 00:34:46,060
you can ask for
in character design.

723
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:47,562
Thank you.

724
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:49,332
Roy, please step back.

725
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:56,007
Laura.

726
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,110
Please tell us how you brought
all of this to life for us.

727
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,780
I wanted to make
a conjurer sorcerer

728
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,781
who could morph other people.

729
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,585
So, we gave her a crown
and gold leaf

730
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,354
to bring home the Renaissance,

731
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:15,890
and we tried to have her
mimic a Roman statue.

732
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:19,327
I think that you did
a really marvelous job.

733
00:35:21,297 --> 00:35:23,930
I absolutely love
how her bodice

734
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:26,065
looks like it's morphing
into something,

735
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,469
and then the shoulder piece
is like the start of wings.

736
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:31,038
I would have liked
to have seen a little bit

737
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:33,073
more feather action
on her head, I think,

738
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:35,475
because it's getting
a little helmet-y,

739
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,777
but the two of them together,

740
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:38,579
the dance
was absolutely exquisite.

741
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:39,847
Thank you.

742
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:42,183
You've got some
great texturing happening.

743
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:45,419
There's a real beautiful,
classic silhouette that she has.

744
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:47,854
With regard to his head,

745
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:49,690
there's a massing
that's occurring

746
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:53,293
that is changing the beauty
of the person underneath,

747
00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:55,829
but there's
such wonderful detailing,

748
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:57,164
I look beyond that.

749
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,165
Fantastic work.

750
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,434
Thank you.

751
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:01,270
The savage grace with which

752
00:36:01,304 --> 00:36:04,940
you approach the swan
is so unique.

753
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:07,109
A little bit more fantasy
would have been too much,

754
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:10,212
so I think
you hit a perfect balance

755
00:36:10,246 --> 00:36:12,213
with the Renaissance
art concept.

756
00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:13,848
Thank you.

757
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:17,252
Laura, if you'd
please step back.

758
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:22,490
Tate, please step forward.

759
00:36:22,524 --> 00:36:24,525
Okay.

760
00:36:29,164 --> 00:36:31,666
So, tell us
about your time period

761
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,267
and how that influenced
your concept.

762
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:34,669
We had the Industrial
Revolution.

763
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:37,405
Our sorcerer built
this gear-driven vessel

764
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:40,207
and cast a spell
to conjure her soul into it,

765
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:43,177
and she started transforming
into this metallic swan.

766
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:45,012
There's some
really bold choices

767
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:49,050
that create exceptionally
strong characters.

768
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,823
You have a very unique
silhouette on both of them,

769
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:55,391
but particularly your swan,

770
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:57,392
and even with your sorcerer

771
00:36:57,427 --> 00:36:59,561
feeling a bit dry
in terms of paint,

772
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:00,896
it feels appropriate
because he's all dusty

773
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,499
and void of life,
hence the cataract eyes.

774
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,567
- I'm really pleased to see this.
- Thank you.

775
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,769
I think that your swan
is quite beautiful.

776
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:12,206
This is the epitome
of asymmetry working properly.

777
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:14,976
She may be the strongest swan
that we have onstage tonight.

778
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,878
With the sorcerer,

779
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,813
I think that it was headed
in the right direction,

780
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:21,583
but I think the towers, to me,
seem a bit medieval.

781
00:37:21,618 --> 00:37:24,019
I think that it needed
to speak more directly

782
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:26,522
to the architecture
of the Industrial Revolution.

783
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:27,890
She is stunning.

784
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:29,225
Could you put your arm
out again for me?

785
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,859
Look at that.
It's, like, the long neck,

786
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:32,660
and then these wings
sweeping back.

787
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:35,096
I-- She-- I think
she's absolutely stunning.

788
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,831
- Thank you very much.
- Tate, please step back.

789
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:40,434
Okay. Thank you all.
Appreciate it.

790
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:43,170
Thank you, guys.

791
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:45,439
All right, guys.

792
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,275
The judges have heard
what you have to say.

793
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:49,411
If you'd please head backstage
while they decide

794
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:52,281
who will become
this season's champion.

795
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:02,957
All right, let's talk about
our finalists' makeups.

796
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,191
Why don't we start with Roy?

797
00:38:04,226 --> 00:38:06,593
Remember, he had Ming Dynasty.

798
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:10,364
Roy's ability to not only
give it an incredible silhouette

799
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:12,466
and profile, but to integrate

800
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,335
all of the swans throughout it.

801
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:17,505
I think that was quite beautiful
and well thought out.

802
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:21,142
His overall palette
on both really worked

803
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:22,377
and was quite harmonious.

804
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:24,578
I liked how they handled
the covering the breasts

805
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:26,714
with the sculpted
feather action.

806
00:38:26,748 --> 00:38:28,115
I think they probably
could have used

807
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,685
a few more feathers
within that area,

808
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,353
but all in all,

809
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:35,790
I think that it created
a really pretty profile for her.

810
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:37,992
That is a good point,
because even though the face

811
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:39,995
did not feel very pretty,

812
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:43,098
treating her
with an open breastbone

813
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:46,601
and stomach was actually
very sexy and very provocative.

814
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:48,236
All right,
let's move on to Laura.

815
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,138
She had
the Italian Renaissance.

816
00:38:50,172 --> 00:38:52,807
They're both so stunning
and so well done.

817
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:54,843
Her swan is exquisite.

818
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,411
Her treatment with the feathers

819
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:57,946
and working all that
in together,

820
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,015
and the beautiful
breast plate is just amazing.

821
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:03,852
And her sorcerer
was unbelievably gorgeous.

822
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:07,722
There was so much work in that.
I'm-- I was very impressed.

823
00:39:07,756 --> 00:39:10,425
The facial detailing
was pretty incredible.

824
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:12,326
- It's quite beautiful.
- I'll tell you what.

825
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,662
When you saw the two of them
dancing together,

826
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:16,531
that was the highlight
of the performance for me.

827
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:17,532
Mm-hmm.

828
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:18,801
And they were of the same world

829
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:21,905
in the context of a cohesive
set of characters.

830
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:23,707
Yes, ultimately,
they look like great makeups

831
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,608
on ballet performers,
which is what...

832
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:27,510
- Oh, yeah.
- ...in essence, our challenge was.

833
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:29,211
All right,
let's move on to Tate.

834
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:31,847
He had
the Industrial Revolution.

835
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:34,916
- I loved Tate's swan.
- Oh.

836
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:36,918
I thought
it was really ingenious

837
00:39:36,952 --> 00:39:39,320
how he pulled it all
off to the side.

838
00:39:39,354 --> 00:39:41,455
I mean, what a great idea.

839
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,258
The storytelling was great.
The reveal on the arm...

840
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:45,427
- Yes.
- ...on the knee.

841
00:39:45,462 --> 00:39:46,929
All those little details.

842
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:48,264
Those are some
really good ideas.

843
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:49,498
So much of it's
concentrated on the swan...

844
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:50,532
Yeah.

845
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:51,767
...and not enough of it
on the sorcerer.

846
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:52,935
Just a little peek-a-boo
of a gear.

847
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,603
- Yes.
- And I was like, "Oh! That--"

848
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:57,639
If you just took that
and magnified it throughout.

849
00:39:57,673 --> 00:40:00,474
The sorcerer I struggle with.
He looks like a derelict.

850
00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:03,474
Like a transient or something,
instead of a powerful sorcerer.

851
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:04,645
That's in the facial sculpt.

852
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,647
It didn't read like
what it was supposed to.

853
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:09,384
Even though we struggled
with the sorcerer,

854
00:40:09,418 --> 00:40:10,919
that silhouette,

855
00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:15,123
the fact that he broke it up
so intentionally asymmetric

856
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:18,293
gave them one
of the most unique silhouettes.

857
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:20,228
And that is so important
in performance art.

858
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:21,429
- Yes.
- Yeah.

859
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:23,532
This is so difficult,
because we've got

860
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:26,835
three amazing artists,
each of them representing

861
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:28,570
their particular skill set
so well,

862
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:30,905
and I'd have to say this
is the tightest race

863
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,841
that we've had
on the show to date.

864
00:40:32,876 --> 00:40:34,877
All right, judges,
have you made your decision?

865
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:37,414
- Yes.
- Yes, we have.

866
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:39,216
Let's bring them back out.

867
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:45,354
One of you will become
the winner of Face Off.

868
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:48,657
So, Glenn, why don't you tell us
about tonight's makeups?

869
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:52,193
Roy, your color palette
was a perfect fit

870
00:40:52,227 --> 00:40:54,429
for the Ming Dynasty,
and your characters

871
00:40:54,463 --> 00:40:57,266
really felt like they
were from the same world.

872
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,204
Laura, we loved the unexpected
ideas in your design,

873
00:41:01,238 --> 00:41:02,872
and we felt
that they complimented

874
00:41:02,906 --> 00:41:05,174
the Italian Renaissance
incredibly well.

875
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,643
Tate, your swan character

876
00:41:07,678 --> 00:41:10,012
had a truly fantastic
silhouette,

877
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:12,081
and the use of gears
was a great way

878
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,350
to communicate
the Industrial Revolution.

879
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,219
Glenn, who is the winner
of Face Off?

880
00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:19,795
The winner of Face Off is...

881
00:41:28,729 --> 00:41:31,364
Glenn, who is the winner
of Face Off?

882
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:33,299
The winner of Face Off is...

883
00:41:39,507 --> 00:41:41,275
Laura.

884
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,010
Yeah!

885
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:44,879
Look at that!

886
00:41:44,913 --> 00:41:48,115
You did it.

887
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:50,717
Congratulations, sweetheart.

888
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,154
- Laura, congratulations!
- Thank you so much.

889
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:57,324
You are the winner of Face Off!

890
00:41:57,358 --> 00:41:59,259
I win!
I win, finally!

891
00:41:59,293 --> 00:42:02,229
I can't believe it.
That was pretty awesome.

892
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:05,432
Here are the keys
to your new Fiat.

893
00:42:05,466 --> 00:42:07,301
Wow.

894
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:08,302
Congratulations,

895
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:10,003
and nice work, gentlemen,
as well.

896
00:42:10,037 --> 00:42:11,371
Thank you.

897
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:13,572
I feel really proud
of every makeup I've created.

898
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:16,475
I feel really proud
of the obstacles I've overcome.

899
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,110
Congratulations.

900
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:20,713
This was, again,
a fantastic experience

901
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,415
that will probably go down

902
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:23,977
as one of the best
I've ever been through.

903
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,688
I came here
to make it this far.

904
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:29,557
That's where I wanted to be
in season three,

905
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,492
so given this second chance
to do it again

906
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:33,794
and actually get there
is icing on the cake.

907
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:35,829
Sometimes you have to eat
your cake without icing,

908
00:42:35,863 --> 00:42:37,430
but it's still cake.

909
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:39,465
My family and friends
deserve this win

910
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,035
as much as I do
for supporting me

911
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:45,338
on this crazy career choice
that I've chosen.

912
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:47,473
That's all I ever
wanted in life anyway,

913
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:48,941
was just to be an artist,

914
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:51,477
but I'm so lucky
that I get to use my craft

915
00:42:51,512 --> 00:42:54,514
and create creatures
every day and have fun.
