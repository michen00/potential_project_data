1
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:04,418
Previously, on Face Off...

2
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:09,874
Roy's comedic ghost
brought him his first win...

3
00:00:09,908 --> 00:00:11,941
Hey!

4
00:00:11,976 --> 00:00:15,242
And Eddie was sent home.

5
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:18,510
Now just five artists remain,
and tonight,

6
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:20,912
they will delve into the world
of lore and mysticism.

7
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:22,047
Oh, sweet.

8
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:23,314
I'm instantly excited.

9
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,279
Yes!

10
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:25,545
But an unprecedented event

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,045
leaves our artists
in a state of shock.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,676
- Everything okay?
- I don't think so.

13
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:30,875
So the question is,

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,674
now, what does this do
about this challenge?

15
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:37,241
It's a disaster
on so many levels.

16
00:00:37,276 --> 00:00:39,174
Why would you even go there?

17
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:42,143
And the judges are forced
to make a surprising decision.

18
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:43,713
Very tough decision this week.

19
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:44,848
Mm, horrible.

20
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:47,449
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:49,250
from Kryolan
Professional Makeup

22
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:52,351
to one of their
85 international locations,

23
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:57,684
a 2013 Fiat 500, and $100,000.

24
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:02,152
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

25
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:04,220
Only one will win Face Off.

27
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,493
It's kind of weird, Eddie
not being here this morning.

28
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,728
Yeah.
I miss his smile already.

29
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:58,131
Eddie is such a good person,
and I'm gonna miss him smiling

30
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,266
and always having
something good to say.

31
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:01,900
He just-- he has
such a great attitude,

32
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,501
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:07,169
Yo.
How you doing?

34
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:09,471
- Not feeling so hot?
- Mm-mmm.

35
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:11,705
Last night,
after Eddie went home

36
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:13,506
and I was on bottom with him,

37
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,440
something really changed in me.

38
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:19,642
Being on bottom was weird.
I'm not having fun anymore.

39
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,978
I like it here.
I love all the challenges,

40
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,980
but I'm also
just really homesick.

41
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:28,016
What do you think
you're gonna do?

42
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:31,119
Maybe this challenge
will wake me up.

43
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:32,787
I'm really gonna try and focus.

44
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:36,458
I want to put it all aside
and just get today over with.

45
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:45,466
We're at Kenneth Hahn
state park.

46
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,601
I don't know what it is,
but it's cool.

47
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:51,238
There's McKenzie standing
by all these giant stones,

48
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54,107
and it looks like Stonehenge,
and I really have no idea

49
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:55,342
what this challenge
is gonna be,

50
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,744
but I can't wait to find out.

51
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,046
- Hey, guys.
- Good morning.

52
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:03,349
From Mayan temples
to Egyptian pyramids,

53
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,686
ancient stone structures
are covered in images

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,989
depicting very different
mythologies

55
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:13,060
and showcasing traditions
filled with magic and mystery.

56
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,396
The stones and symbols
that you see here

57
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,966
are no different and come
from another very rich culture.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,002
You'll be creating one of
the most recognizable creatures

59
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:27,173
seen in Norse mythology,
dark elves.

60
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,041
Ah, yes!

61
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,409
Sorry.

62
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,478
If there's one thing
that I know really well,

63
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,047
it's elves.

64
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,482
I'm gonna sound
like the biggest nerd,

65
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:39,119
but I've studied them
extensively, and I think

66
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:42,423
I might have an advantage
on this particular challenge.

67
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:44,892
While elves have become popular

68
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,060
in films like
The Lord Of The Rings trilogy,

69
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,629
they have roots
in Norse mythology,

70
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:53,133
like in the upcoming film
Thor The Dark World.

71
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,169
The Norse tradition
describes the use of runes,

72
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,471
which are symbols
that the Vikings believed

73
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:01,240
would grant them special powers
or abilities in battle.

74
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,408
This week,
your spotlight challenge

75
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:07,113
is to select one of these runes
and use it to inspire

76
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:10,451
a dark elf warrior that embodies
the symbol's attributes.

77
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,320
Oh, sweet.

78
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:16,090
I love old, mythical stuff,
so I'm instantly excited.

79
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:20,161
But of course,
there's the catch.

80
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:22,931
I'm not gonna tell you
what any of the symbols mean

81
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,333
until after you've
made your selections.

82
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:28,637
So we have no idea
what it is that we're pickin'.

83
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:30,773
Right off the bat, I'm having
a bad feeling about this.

84
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:34,277
Laura, you're up first.
Stand next to your selection.

85
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,778
Okay.

86
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:38,815
Laney.

87
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,683
Roy.

88
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:42,885
Tate.

89
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,353
Miranda.

90
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:48,523
Laney,
you've selected "Eihwaz."

91
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:50,291
It means immortality.

92
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:53,194
Tate,
you have "Berkano."

93
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:55,463
- It means regeneration.
- Wow.

94
00:04:55,498 --> 00:05:01,170
Roy, you have "Laguz,"
and it means psychic powers.

95
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:05,040
Miranda, you have "Thurisaz,"
and it means chaos.

96
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:09,611
Laura, you have "Perthro."
It means occult abilities.

97
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:12,680
All right, it's time
to get started on your designs.

98
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:15,950
These rune stones should serve
as fantastic inspiration

99
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,351
for your dark elves.

100
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,519
Good luck, you guys.
I'll see you later at the lab.

101
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:22,022
Good-bye.

102
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,597
My rune means
"occult abilities,"

103
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,766
which means magic.

104
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,403
In Nordic culture, they believed
when you wrote a rune down,

105
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,572
it would imbue that object
with magic,

106
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,475
so I'm going to try
to incorporate the runes

107
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,677
into the helm
as if it's a magical helm.

108
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:49,847
It's gonna have armor, a corset,
and of course, ears.

109
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,852
I'm feeling like
I already did two dark elves.

110
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,488
I did the pixie
with the pointy ears, and then

111
00:05:57,522 --> 00:06:00,124
an elf-like character on
the seven deadly sins challenge,

112
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,458
so I'm feeling kind of confused

113
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,527
as to how I can
make something different.

114
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:07,031
So when I see my symbol,
it looks very Mayan,

115
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,934
so I take inspiration
immediately

116
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,537
from the symbol itself,
and I am going to make him

117
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,607
this God-like warrior
that everybody worships

118
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:20,845
in a civilization that's already
chaotic and war-driven.

119
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:25,583
So the rune I pick
symbolizes immortality,

120
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,085
so I want to keep it
really young,

121
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:30,488
and I want to give him
lots of armor

122
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:33,258
that'll look like human bones
have been dipped in gold

123
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,495
for the people
that he has killed.

124
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,598
All right, everybody,
let's head back to the lab!

125
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,739
Whew.
Thank you.

126
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,808
We get back to the lab,
and we have 5 1/2 hours today.

127
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,943
I'm not gonna go
the route of doing

128
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,779
the traditional cowl
and then separate face piece.

129
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,481
I want to do it
all in one piece

130
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:58,483
and sculpt the face
really, really thin

131
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:00,485
so I can get the movement
that I need,

132
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,621
and the rune that I picked
is "Laguz."

133
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,556
It symbolizes psychic power.

134
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,225
The easiest way to convey
psychic power is enlarged head.

135
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,093
I've seen
The Lord Of The Rings,

136
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,529
and so I know that elves
are supposed to be human-like,

137
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:16,433
so I'm thinking I can
de-evolve them a little bit.

138
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:20,504
You know, maybe they
came from a primate.

139
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:25,543
The rune that I selected
symbolizes regeneration.

140
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,844
I want to do
a female character.

141
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,647
She's the queen of her tribe
of elves.

142
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:32,583
The regeneration is she selects
the strongest male elves

143
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,485
and breeds with them
to create a stronger race.

144
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,653
Also they're metal smiths,

145
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,021
so they're constantly
around heat,

146
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:40,790
and I want her to have
this burnt-and-new flesh,

147
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:44,161
like a snake skin, which is also
a play on the regeneration.

148
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:49,300
I really don't want to go
with the typical elf

149
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,903
because usually, the judges
are looking for us

150
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:54,839
to do something different,
and so my character

151
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:58,643
is going to do have
this Mayan headpiece.

152
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:02,380
And it's pretty much mandatory
for an elf to have pointy ears,

153
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:06,016
so I'm also gonna
have to incorporate the ears.

154
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,654
I feel a tremendous amount
of pressure with this challenge,

155
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:14,257
more than any other, because
I know a lot about dark elves.

156
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,260
That might actually hinder me
from doing a good job,

157
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,829
and that worries me
tremendously.

158
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,201
I look over at Laney,
and she's just kind of

159
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:26,168
pushing her sculpture around.

160
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:27,937
She's not her inspired self.

161
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:31,340
I start sculpting the face,
and I'm not even into it.

162
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,775
Like, I love
my character's sketch,

163
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,414
but I just don't want
to be doing this.

164
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:40,617
Tate has already sculpted
this most beautiful cowl,

165
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,987
and Miranda's, like,
halfway done with her cowl,

166
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:47,124
and it looks amazing.

167
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:51,228
I can feel, like, my passion's
just not there today.

168
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,600
- Laura?
- Yeah?

169
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,869
More elf-like quality,
big ear or smaller ear?

170
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:00,137
I want to make it
to the finale,

171
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:02,406
and this challenge
is totally out of my element.

172
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,944
I couldn't tell you an elf
from a dwarf from anything else.

173
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,378
I like the smaller one.

174
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,980
I've seen people
dress as dark elves

175
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,114
at conventions
and things like that,

176
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,817
but I'm not really
into that genre.

177
00:09:12,851 --> 00:09:15,052
Yeah, I think
the big one's too orc-ish.

178
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,653
Yeah, yeah, there's a fine line

179
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:18,589
between goblin and elf.

180
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:19,957
Yeah.

181
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:21,891
I don't know what's gonna
happen with this makeup,

182
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:23,059
so yeah, I'm worried
about this one.

183
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,829
Gotta line up this ear.

184
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,474
Tate, where's Laney?

185
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:38,444
Well, I'll just check.

186
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,046
I walk by the bathroom
and I hear crying.

187
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:43,653
_

188
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:45,225
_

189
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,268
_

190
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:49,488
She's breaking down.

191
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,011
_

192
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,550
_

193
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:54,656
_

194
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:58,332
It sucks.
I don't know how to help her.

195
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:01,435
She just wants to be left alone.
Just give her some time.

196
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:05,505
- Hey, everything okay?
- I-I don't think so.

197
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:07,139
Worried about her.

198
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,076
I don't know what's going on
with Laney or if she's okay,

199
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,178
but if she doesn't come back,

200
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,547
I don't know if she
can finish this makeup,

201
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:17,952
and I think she'll be through.

202
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,186
Coming up...

203
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:21,155
I have to get my head
back in the game.

204
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,190
I am disappointed in myself.

205
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:25,726
It's a disaster
on so many levels.

206
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,195
Why would you even go there?

207
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,111
Today's the first day
of our dark elves challenge,

208
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:37,279
and I'm gettin' worried.

209
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,514
Laney don't seem to be
doing too well.

210
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,411
_

211
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:44,336
_

212
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:47,077
_

213
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,750
_

214
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,499
_

215
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:51,614
_

216
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:53,137
_

217
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,425
_

218
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:56,604
_

219
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:57,760
_

220
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:02,403
I just decide to just,
like, give it one more shot.

221
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:10,912
So Laney comes back out,
and she seems collected,

222
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,781
and she starts
back on her sculpture.

223
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:14,432
_

224
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:15,917
I'm fine.

225
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,852
I know that she's still
going through things,

226
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,790
but I'm happy that she's
come back to her work.

227
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,768
Hey, guys,
here for a walkthrough.

228
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:35,170
- Let's take a look.
- Ready?

229
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:37,473
I got occult abilities.

230
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:39,709
I'm definitely going
more traditional.

231
00:11:39,743 --> 00:11:43,979
Probably do some scarification
runes around her collar,

232
00:11:44,014 --> 00:11:46,782
maybe along the helm as well.

233
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:49,384
- What do these symbolize?
- In most Celtic mythologies,

234
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,187
they worship, like,
deer and stags,

235
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:53,922
and so I wanted to represent
all of that.

236
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:56,091
You've got so much
going on here

237
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:58,728
that you want to be able
for those to read.

238
00:11:58,763 --> 00:12:01,899
- You can't paint everything dark.
- Okay.

239
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,333
I picked chaos.

240
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,435
I wanted to do
something different

241
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,305
than the typical elven armor
for my character.

242
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,439
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:11,475
- My symbol looks like this...
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:14,044
And when I saw it,
it felt very Mayan,

245
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,447
so I was thinking
I would do a Mayan warrior.

246
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:19,015
Interesting.

247
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:21,284
I chose regeneration,

248
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:24,586
which led me to the queen
of these dark elves.

249
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:27,023
She's responsible for
the reproduction of the hive.

250
00:12:27,057 --> 00:12:28,191
- What about color?
- Yeah.

251
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,893
The flesh is gonna be black
and crackly,

252
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:32,328
and the metal itself,
I wanted to go

253
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,163
with sort of an antiqued bronze
of that nature.

254
00:12:34,197 --> 00:12:35,130
Well, that'll be
a great contrast.

255
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,666
- Nice.
- Oh, cool.

256
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,502
Yeah, because you'll
definitely see the difference

257
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:42,372
between what's skin and what
you have created as a helmet.

258
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:43,539
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

259
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:48,144
I have "Laguz,"
and it is psychic power,

260
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:50,280
so I enlarged the head to show
that the brain is larger

261
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:52,181
and has the psychic abilities.

262
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:55,184
You've got so much contour
going on here

263
00:12:55,218 --> 00:12:57,486
that by going to, say, black,

264
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,955
you're gonna lose
a lot of your good detail,

265
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,691
so you need to keep that
on a lighter shade

266
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,493
in this part of the face here.

267
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:06,529
I've got "Eihwaz."

268
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:09,466
He is the dark elf
of immortality.

269
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,802
I like what you're doing
in the forehead and the nose,

270
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,071
but as opposed to putting
a lot of human face

271
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:17,274
just over human face,
do something

272
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:18,808
to take it away from the model.

273
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,210
Okay, cool.

274
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:21,878
All right, everybody,
we're heading out.

275
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:23,780
- Thank you!
- Keep the clay goin'.

276
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:25,582
- Have a good one.
- Bye!

277
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:33,190
What you doin', Tate?
Ooh, that's pretty.

278
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,925
Thanks, man.

279
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,594
Ten minutes!

280
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:45,436
Holy fuck,
you sculpted that fast.

281
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:48,372
Oh, cool.

282
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:52,109
Traditional.
Maybe too traditional.

283
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,213
Time's up, everybody!
Let's go home.

284
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:58,482
At the end of day one,
I'm a little nervous.

285
00:13:58,516 --> 00:14:00,884
There are some people in there
taking their concepts

286
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:03,787
in a different direction,
and I'm staying so traditional

287
00:14:03,821 --> 00:14:06,456
that it might not be
interesting.

288
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:09,893
So I'm leaving a lot of time
tomorrow to experiment.

289
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:11,795
I have all the tools I need.

290
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:14,830
Now, I just need to figure out
how to utilize them.

291
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:25,140
I wake up in the morning,
and there's a note on the table.

292
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:28,143
My first reaction
is maybe McKenzie left it

293
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:31,446
and there's a new twist
to this dark elf challenge.

294
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:32,748
What's that?

295
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:35,217
Unfortunately, it's not that.

296
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,585
She's gone.

297
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,222
It's a letter from Laney
saying that she's quit.

298
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:44,391
She didn't expect to stay here
as long as she did.

299
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,593
I just have
this decision in my head,

300
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:47,894
right when I wake up,

301
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,229
that I'm gonna
be leaving today.

302
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,332
I just know that I can't stay
any longer.

303
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,901
At this point,
she'd pay $100,000

304
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,937
just to see her family again.

305
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,372
Wow.

306
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:01,508
It's hard being homesick,
but, you know, I mean,

307
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,210
you know what you sign up for
whenever you come

308
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,079
and do something like this.

309
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,348
- What's going on?
- Laney left.

310
00:15:07,382 --> 00:15:09,517
- Laney left?
- Yup.

311
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:11,386
I'm sad that she walked away.

312
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,320
It's one of those experiences
in life

313
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,356
that most people
will never have.

314
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,324
So the question is now,
what does this do

315
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,859
about this challenge?

316
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:22,063
With Laney leaving,
it creates a big issue.

317
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:23,598
Everybody gonna be safe
this challenge,

318
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,834
or are they gonna go ahead
and eliminate somebody?

319
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:28,271
We have no idea, and,
I mean, my thought is,

320
00:15:28,305 --> 00:15:30,106
you know, just treat it
like everything was normal,

321
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,409
'cause honestly, she's gone,
but that's not my problem.

322
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:35,110
My problem
is winning this challenge.

323
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,611
I'm gonna get dressed,
'cause...

324
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:38,112
- Yeah.
- We gotta be at the lab

325
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,381
- in a little bit.
- Got a lot of work to do.

326
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:50,560
Day two in the lab,
and we have 9 1/2 hours,

327
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:52,328
and today is gonna be hard

328
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,197
after finding
this note from Laney.

329
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,965
I think there's a lot going
through all of our heads,

330
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,566
and I miss her already,

331
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,967
but I have so much to do today,

332
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:02,204
so I just got to keep moving
forward and focus

333
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:05,107
on what I need to do,
so I have to start on this face.

334
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,611
- That's really sweet.
- Thank you.

335
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:12,647
I'm still a little confused
about the whole Mayan direction,

336
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:14,816
but hopefully,
they're gonna like it,

337
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:18,220
'cause I'm not changing it now.

338
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:23,360
I have to finish my sculpts.

339
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:25,962
I need to get those sculpts
in the molding room

340
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:28,464
as fast as possible so that
I can get them ready for foam,

341
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:31,401
'cause I got a lot
of other stuff to do.

342
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:35,805
I'm a little off my game
today, to be honest.

343
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,408
Laney's work is still there.
It's a bit, um--

344
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:41,243
I don't know, it's like
a headstone or something,

345
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:44,613
but I have to get my head
back in the game.

346
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:46,048
I finish up my sculpts and I go

347
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,083
back to the molding room
and start molding.

348
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,787
- Wow, that looks sick.
- Thanks, dude.

349
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,059
I really want
to get the mold done

350
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,295
so I can go ahead and run maybe,
like, a poly foam copy of it

351
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,332
so I can start trying
to work my paint scheme out.

352
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:09,171
I want to make a lot
of scarification prosthetics

353
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,507
in order to imbue her
with a sense of magic,

354
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,977
so I start working
on my Pros-Aide transfers.

355
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:17,314
All you have to do is sculpt
something on a flat surface

356
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,316
and then make a mold
out of silicone.

357
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,285
Once the silicone sets,
you pour Pros-Aide,

358
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,054
which is the medical adhesive
that we use,

359
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,522
inside the compartment.

360
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,190
You put it in a refrigerator,

361
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:29,359
and once that's sat
for 24 hours,

362
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:32,563
it can look like some
really kickass-looking scars.

363
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,507
It's a little difficult
to know where to go

364
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,243
with this challenge,
and I'm just fiddling

365
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,178
with this cowl
over and over again,

366
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:50,347
and I know I'm taking
way too long.

367
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:53,250
It's like I keep putting things
on and then wiping them off,

368
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:56,153
and I don't like
anything I'm doing.

369
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:59,156
All of a sudden, I realize
I am the only one

370
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,926
who's not in the mold room.

371
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,561
This mold is gonna take
quite a while,

372
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:06,263
and I've never been so scared.

373
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:08,665
I don't know
if I'm gonna have anything

374
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,033
to put on the stage.

375
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,845
_

376
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:21,642
It's day two,
and I'm just so behind.

377
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,910
Everyone else
is in the mold room.

378
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:27,012
I need to start molding,
or else I won't have anything

379
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:30,014
to put on the stage.

380
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:32,016
I just start molding this
faster than I've ever molded

381
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,484
anything in my life.

382
00:18:33,518 --> 00:18:37,019
Like, I am literally throwing
Ultracal at the mold.

383
00:18:37,054 --> 00:18:40,988
I can't run this
in latex and poly foam.

384
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,923
This piece has to move.

385
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,492
Okay.

386
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,798
My poly foam is done
and it looks great,

387
00:18:55,832 --> 00:18:59,400
so I can do a little,
you know, paint test on it.

388
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,034
The judges have really
been giving me a lot of crap

389
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:03,536
about having rough paint jobs,
and so I want to give 'em

390
00:19:03,571 --> 00:19:05,438
a lot of detail in this.

391
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:22,219
Down to the last minute, huh?

392
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:24,287
Oh, my God.
It's only a few minutes

393
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:26,323
before the end of the day
and there's no way

394
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:29,492
that I'm gonna
get this cowl finished.

395
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:34,063
All right, guys, that's time.
Let's get out of here.

396
00:19:35,732 --> 00:19:37,299
So now, I have to figure out

397
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:42,438
somehow to make this cowl work
with latex.

398
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,507
Tomorrow's gonna be
the hardest application day

399
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,543
I've ever had by far,
and I don't even know

400
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,712
if I'm gonna have a piece
to show the judges,

401
00:19:49,746 --> 00:19:52,014
and at this point,
I am pretty much sure

402
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:54,549
that I'm going home.

403
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,795
All right,
let's see what we got.

404
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,897
Application day,
we have four hours in the lab

405
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,532
and one hour in last looks,

406
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,369
and I'm going to have
to get that facial prosthetic

407
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:17,238
and that cowl down

408
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:18,773
as quickly as possible,
'cause there is

409
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,242
a lot of painting to do.

410
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,615
Hello!

411
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,216
What's up, girl?

412
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,684
Hey, Kirk.
How you doing?

413
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:33,720
So I'm extremely behind today.

414
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,855
And I need help opening a mold.

415
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,224
Thank God Vince is here,
thank God he's strong,

416
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:43,030
because I am so in trouble today
and I physically can't lift--

417
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:45,732
even lift this mold,
much less open it on my own.

418
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,100
Keep pulling.

419
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:48,801
Awesome.
Fuck yes.

420
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:51,571
Here, I'll show you
how this power washer works.

421
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:54,806
I feel terrible to be
putting him in this position,

422
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,441
but I only have one shot
at this now,

423
00:20:57,475 --> 00:21:00,142
because I'm doing it today,
and if I mess it up,

424
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:01,177
it's not gonna work at all.

425
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:02,611
You can just hang on to that.

426
00:21:02,646 --> 00:21:04,747
We're just gonna carry him in.

427
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:08,584
Thank God
he's such a good sport.

428
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:09,819
I notice that, you know,

429
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,422
Miranda is running around
and so is her model.

430
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:14,590
Here, you can--
Yeah, you can do that.

431
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,325
And as thick as possible.

432
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,260
Maybe could you
blow-dry this one?

433
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,262
I'm pretty sure he'll
be a contestant on season eight,

434
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,564
'cause he's learning so much
in the lab today.

435
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,798
Is this your first season here?

436
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,166
Yeah.

437
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,568
- How do you like it?
- Oh, I love it.

438
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,012
I'm right on schedule.

439
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,916
Let's do this.
Let's get it on there.

440
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,085
The piece, you know,
goes on fairly easy,

441
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,754
and it's almost flawless,

442
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:49,524
but I don't know
if it's a dark elf.

443
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,593
Hmm.

444
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:56,698
The Pros-Aide transfers
that I had made for the arms

445
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,769
are not as stiff
as I had intended.

446
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:01,070
These didn't work out.

447
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:03,706
I'm going to have
to physically paint them on

448
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,174
when I get to last looks.

449
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:07,877
It's a good thing I have backup
options for everything I do,

450
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:11,047
'cause otherwise,
I would be capital "F."

451
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,555
Could you start
putting on your costume?

452
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,796
Let me get you
into your body texture.

453
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,997
In order to achieve

454
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,965
the regenerative
snake-like texture,

455
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,367
I put down a base layer
of prosthetic adhesive,

456
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:37,838
and then I smear a wet layer
of powder over the top of it,

457
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:39,073
and then I take a hair dryer

458
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,608
and I dry the moisture
out of it,

459
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:42,242
which causes it
to crack and spread.

460
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:46,076
_

461
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:47,077
_

462
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:48,950
Then you can powder it
with charcoal power.

463
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,752
It grabs in in the cracks,
so you just have

464
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,221
this really successful-looking
cracked finish.

465
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:56,524
Try not to bend your arms
too much until that dries, okay?

466
00:22:58,094 --> 00:23:01,262
- Like, my whole hand too?
- Uh, you can wait on the hand,

467
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,963
just 'cause you might
need to use it.

468
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,632
At this point,
really all I can do is laugh.

469
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,768
I mean, I even have Vince
trying to paint his own legs.

470
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:11,104
Vince, like, has done
as much of this as I have,

471
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:15,609
and I feel like a failure.

472
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,912
Ten minutes!
Ten minutes left!

473
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,854
Help me grab 'em by the door.

474
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,969
That's time, everybody!

475
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,206
I really am scared
at this point.

476
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,709
It's not painted.
It's not even blended.

477
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:48,877
This was my idea, originally.

478
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:52,547
I'm going home tonight,
but I'm not gonna just

479
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,150
give up on the makeup,
because that's not who I am.

480
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:59,522
I'm gonna do the best I can
and hope for the best.

481
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:02,491
Coming up...

482
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,026
That's really messed up.

483
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,594
I can't find
my airbrush compressor.

484
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:08,030
- Yeah, that's really good.
- It looks fantastic.

485
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:10,100
If you try to do that
to a director,

486
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:12,903
you won't be there tomorrow.

487
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:23,389
We're at last looks,
and we got one hour left.

488
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:27,160
All that I really got to do
is touch-ups.

489
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:32,399
I still have to paint all
of the symbols all over my elf,

490
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:35,268
and that's gonna take up
the majority of my time.

491
00:24:35,303 --> 00:24:37,070
Ugh, it's stressful.

492
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:43,275
I can barely pull this cowl
out of the mold,

493
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,379
and I'm trying to cut the seam
off as quickly as I can.

494
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:47,981
I think I've set a record

495
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:51,184
for most behind ever
for last looks.

496
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:53,887
This is a disaster.

497
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,089
That's really messed up.

498
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,991
I can't find
my airbrush compressor.

499
00:24:58,025 --> 00:24:59,225
Now, I have to hand-paint
everything,

500
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,961
and it's definitely hurting me,

501
00:25:00,995 --> 00:25:03,129
but I have to make
with what I have.

502
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:05,031
I'm freaking out.

503
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:15,375
That's time!

504
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:16,943
Fuck.

505
00:25:16,978 --> 00:25:19,279
I never thought
I would ever do a makeup

506
00:25:19,313 --> 00:25:20,580
that was this unfinished.

507
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,182
I'm so embarrassed.

508
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:25,819
It's the worst makeup
I have ever, ever done.

509
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:39,333
Welcome
to the Face Off reveal stage.

510
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:42,703
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

511
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:45,139
Let's first say hello
to our talented judges.

512
00:25:45,173 --> 00:25:49,143
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

513
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:50,211
Good evening, guys.

514
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:51,446
- Hi.
- Hi.

515
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,849
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

516
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:54,916
Hi, everybody.

517
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:56,117
- Hey, Ve.
- Hey.

518
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:58,653
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

519
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:00,288
- Hello.
- Hey, Neville.

520
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:03,157
This week,
your spotlight challenge

521
00:26:03,192 --> 00:26:06,527
was to choose a Norse rune
and create a dark elf warrior

522
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,697
that embodies
the symbol's attributes.

523
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:12,734
Let's see
what you've come up with.

524
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:38,261
I really, really love
the fact that my dark elf

525
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,296
is a full character
from top to bottom.

526
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:41,998
She looks beautiful.
She looks elegant,

527
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:45,968
so I'm excited to hear
what the judges have to say.

528
00:27:02,952 --> 00:27:05,988
I'm really happy and impressed

529
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:08,792
with the overall look,
the silhouette.

530
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:12,296
I think I have
one of the best ones.

531
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,116
This is so painful.
I don't want to look.

532
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,819
I just want to go
to a different place in my head

533
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:37,788
and pretend
that this is not mine

534
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,057
and I didn't do this.

535
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,478
It looks
a little un-proportioned.

536
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,347
He's got a big head,
so I'm concerned about that,

537
00:28:04,381 --> 00:28:08,184
but overall, I'm happy
with the way that it looks.

538
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,660
Judges, it's time
to take a closer look

539
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,996
at our elven warriors.

540
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,937
Look at how beautiful
that blends up around there.

541
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,005
Is this all one piece?

542
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,674
Yeah, it's a face piece,
and then the cowl

543
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,143
glues down to it, so she gets
all those nice blending edges.

544
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:34,477
- Man, that's really good.
- Yeah.

545
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,947
That foam edge there
is so nice.

546
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,682
Look at on the nose
and above her eye.

547
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,717
Oh, yeah,
it goes down the nose.

548
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:44,520
- Can't even tell.
- Seamless.

549
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:47,290
Really solid too, she's not
getting any rub on anything,

550
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:48,624
- it's sealed nicely.
- Yeah, it's good.

551
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,427
Very clean.
Thank you.

552
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,533
This is beautifully weathered.

553
00:28:57,568 --> 00:28:59,502
- These colors here are great.
- Yeah.

554
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:02,872
I really, really, really love
the way that the color

555
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:06,008
of the makeup goes
into the color of the armor.

556
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:07,743
I think the armor could have
more color on it...

557
00:29:07,778 --> 00:29:10,946
- Yeah, yeah.
- But they work so well together.

558
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,448
Open your mouth for us.

559
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:15,217
- Can we just see that bottom?
- Oh, that's cool.

560
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,754
- And that is you, right?
- No, no.

561
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:20,957
Okay, thank you.

562
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:22,992
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

563
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:29,831
Didn't finish up the paint job.

564
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:31,133
The gold comes down--
I thought I saw that

565
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,669
from far away-- like,
onto the ear for some reason.

566
00:29:33,703 --> 00:29:36,905
- Like, what the--
- Is it part of the same sculpt?

567
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,140
- Interesting.
- Is it separated?

568
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:40,008
- All over it?
- I don't know.

569
00:29:40,043 --> 00:29:41,309
What the hell
was she doing this week?

570
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:42,711
I don't know.

571
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:44,512
- Can you turn sideways?
- Sideways?

572
00:29:44,547 --> 00:29:45,847
Yeah.

573
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:48,249
Oh, no, don't look at the back.

574
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:49,550
Oh, yeah, bizarre.

575
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,285
It's so bad.

576
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,288
I am totally, totally disgusted
and disappointed in myself.

577
00:29:55,323 --> 00:30:00,427
It looked bad from afar,
but it is inexcusable up close,

578
00:30:00,462 --> 00:30:02,997
and this will be
my first time on the bottom

579
00:30:03,032 --> 00:30:05,867
and probably my last.

580
00:30:08,504 --> 00:30:11,639
Who made your favorite
elven warrior tonight?

581
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:14,507
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

582
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:19,229
- Yeah, bizarre.
- Yeah.

583
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:20,964
The whole thing is quite bizarre.

584
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,370
I don't understand
the mousy shape of the nose.

585
00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:26,018
Turn all the way around for us.

586
00:30:26,052 --> 00:30:27,952
Okay.

587
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,086
Eesh.

588
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:34,056
I screwed up so badly,

589
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:36,459
and there's only
four of us here,

590
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:38,495
so there's no scraping by.

591
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:40,530
I know I'm going home.

592
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:42,299
- Okay.
- All right.

593
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:45,602
What are we looking at?
I mean, basically,

594
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:46,837
it's just this head, really.

595
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,239
I mean, clearly,
he fabricated this.

596
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:49,807
- Yeah, he did that too.
- Yeah.

597
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:51,175
It's a good silhouette.

598
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:53,277
This is a hairpiece
that wasn't even laid in.

599
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,812
Those are all hair pieces.

600
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:56,480
I do actually like
the form language,

601
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:58,215
it's just the proportions.

602
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:00,618
I just hope that the judges
take it for what it is.

603
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:03,654
I'm happy with it,
so I guess we'll find out.

604
00:31:07,392 --> 00:31:09,760
The judges would like
to speak with each of you

605
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:11,595
to learn more about your work.

606
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:13,630
Laura, please step up.

607
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:20,670
Laura, tell us
about your character.

608
00:31:20,704 --> 00:31:24,640
The rune that I was given
meant occult abilities.

609
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,276
I translated
occult ability in that

610
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:31,381
I would put runes
on various parts of the armor

611
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:33,483
to imbue my warrior with magic.

612
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:36,619
I think it's stunning.

613
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:39,055
You understood the concept
so well

614
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,559
that it allowed you to flow
right into the construction

615
00:31:42,594 --> 00:31:45,095
of your character,
and it shows.

616
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:47,897
Tell us why
you chose that color.

617
00:31:47,932 --> 00:31:51,401
I wanted to get that dark elf
aesthetic in there, so--

618
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:53,035
because they're underground,

619
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,670
the skin tone
is a light lavender.

620
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,373
- It's beautifully done.
- Thank you.

621
00:31:57,407 --> 00:32:01,143
My ignorance really
is enjoying your awareness,

622
00:32:01,178 --> 00:32:04,080
and also how you back up
those choices.

623
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:06,216
Your intellect,
and the way you think through

624
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,253
why she would be that color,
is spot-on.

625
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:11,421
Thank you.

626
00:32:11,456 --> 00:32:13,590
One of my favorite things
on this makeup

627
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:16,326
is the aesthetic of that
tribal tattooing you did.

628
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,194
I love the swirling effect
of it.

629
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,930
It's so graceful and really
subtle and really pretty.

630
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,932
- Beautiful makeup.
- Thank you.

631
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:26,735
Laura, please step back.

632
00:32:31,674 --> 00:32:34,677
Roy, please come forward.

633
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,782
Tell us about your elf

634
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:42,118
and your concept
behind your creation, please.

635
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:44,353
The rune
that I chose was "Laguz,"

636
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:46,488
which is psychic power,

637
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:49,525
which is the reason
for the enlarged head.

638
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:53,562
This, to me,
doesn't really work as an elf.

639
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,331
It looks more
like a creature as opposed

640
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:58,633
to something that has
more of a humanistic form.

641
00:32:58,668 --> 00:33:01,136
Because you made his head
so big,

642
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:03,672
you didn't adapt
the rest of his physique

643
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:05,174
to carry that big,
giant head around,

644
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,875
so it's made his body
look very small.

645
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,343
It's a pretty cool makeup,

646
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,978
I just don't think
it's for this challenge, honey.

647
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:12,613
Okay.

648
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:15,148
I think of the elf
almost as a toy,

649
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:18,919
and this is
a dullsville action figure.

650
00:33:20,656 --> 00:33:24,926
I appreciate the concept
of the paint technique

651
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,394
that you were trying
to apply here.

652
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:27,762
I think that
that was right thinking.

653
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,663
That's the good part.

654
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:31,966
What in the hell caused you
to make a decision

655
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,803
to go so far away from
the very core of this challenge?

656
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:37,337
You were asked to do an elf.

657
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:38,572
I'm not familiar
with dark elves.

658
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:40,440
You know the idea
of what an elf looks like,

659
00:33:40,475 --> 00:33:42,509
long ears, pointy nose.

660
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,178
If you do that
to a director--

661
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:46,481
he asks for an elf
and you give him this--

662
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:47,950
you won't be there tomorrow.

663
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,652
My apologies.

664
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:51,520
Roy, please step back.

665
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,526
Tate, you're next.

666
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:05,765
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Tate.

667
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,668
So tell us about your elf
and your rune choice.

668
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:11,071
Well, my rune
symbolized regeneration,

669
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:13,707
so I decided to go
with my interpretation

670
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:16,243
of what would be
the queen of the dark elves.

671
00:34:16,278 --> 00:34:19,113
It's her job to find
the healthiest specimen

672
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:21,281
and sire
the rest of their tribes.

673
00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:22,882
'Cause I know that
they're master metal workers,

674
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:25,085
they're constantly around heat,
I really wanted to do

675
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,187
the dry, cracked skin
and to make it look

676
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:30,157
like the skin regenerates.

677
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:32,559
It looks fantastic.

678
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:35,028
The helmet design
that you've done,

679
00:34:35,063 --> 00:34:36,029
I love the fact
that it's starting

680
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:38,899
to almost integrate
into her face,

681
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:40,300
and some of the details
that you have,

682
00:34:40,335 --> 00:34:42,837
like this flaky, dry skin,

683
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:46,474
it looks authentic
at a distance, even up close.

684
00:34:46,508 --> 00:34:48,009
You have a very successful
makeup in here.

685
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:50,011
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

686
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:53,347
I absolutely adore the fact
that you've taken your rune

687
00:34:53,381 --> 00:34:55,616
and allowed it to motivate you

688
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,818
to go so much further
with the character.

689
00:34:57,852 --> 00:35:00,987
You were able to do all this
cool stuff with her body.

690
00:35:01,022 --> 00:35:03,123
I love what you've done
with the armor.

691
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:04,592
I appreciate it.

692
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:07,195
I think the choice
of that gorgeous red

693
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:09,998
against all this silver
is just really cool.

694
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:11,300
That a great decision that was.

695
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:14,904
She looks really dark.
She's sexy, she's strong.

696
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:17,874
She really says
"dark, warrior elf" to me.

697
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,342
Thank you very much, Ve.

698
00:35:19,376 --> 00:35:20,943
Tate, please step back.

699
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:29,184
Let's talk to Miranda.

700
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:37,994
Miranda, tell us
about your character

701
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:39,295
and how you integrated
the rune.

702
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,065
Well, my symbol was chaos,

703
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,868
and I was really
initially inspired

704
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:48,070
by the actual symbol itself.

705
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,973
It had a Mayan vibe to it.

706
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:52,675
It's obviously very incomplete.

707
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:55,011
What happened this week?
Why is this such a wreck?

708
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:58,981
I-I don't really
have a good answer.

709
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:01,083
I feel like I just really
messed up this week,

710
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,885
and I'm really disappointed
in myself.

711
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:07,990
There is what
I'm going to kindly call

712
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:11,059
an inadequate decision
regarding the ears

713
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:13,062
and their support
of the headdress.

714
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:14,964
It seems to me
like you've done it

715
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:16,932
so that you could split the mold
with a two-piece

716
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,735
so that it's the ears
and the helmet and the-- it--

717
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,738
Horrible decision.

718
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:24,274
The planes
that the ears lie upon

719
00:36:24,308 --> 00:36:28,645
no longer work at all,
anatomically.

720
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,747
This is kind of
a blue-ish green makeup

721
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:31,848
that I really don't like.

722
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,917
Why would you even go there

723
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:36,452
knowing that you
couldn't finish this color?

724
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:38,321
I mean, you didn't even
get the base color

725
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:39,822
on him all the way today.

726
00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:41,090
I'm just so disappointed.

727
00:36:41,124 --> 00:36:43,259
You've done so many
awesome makeups,

728
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:47,063
and now, all of a sudden,
you put this out here.

729
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:49,232
It's a disaster
on so many levels

730
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:52,035
that you've already addressed
and accepted,

731
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:55,004
but I don't want you
to lose sight of the successes

732
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,340
that actually have occurred
within it.

733
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:59,675
The overall sculpt,
pretty good,

734
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:02,244
but it's just a sketch.

735
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:04,947
If this was due on the day
as a final design,

736
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:06,749
camera-ready,
you're screwed.

737
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:08,217
I feel really bad about this.

738
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:13,289
I just hope that I get
the chance to continue.

739
00:37:13,324 --> 00:37:16,659
Miranda, please step back.

740
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,798
Sorry, girl.

741
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:25,034
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

742
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,902
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

743
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:28,070
while they deliberate.

744
00:37:28,104 --> 00:37:31,106
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

745
00:37:33,276 --> 00:37:35,778
All right, judges,
let's talk about the looks

746
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:37,380
you liked the most this week.

747
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:38,848
Why don't we start with Laura?

748
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,818
I particularly like her
intelligence behind her choices.

749
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:45,553
Her justification
is so spot-on.

750
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:49,023
I especially liked that sort
of tribal paint job she did.

751
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:50,992
Absolutely perfectly blended.

752
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:53,061
One thing I think was lacking

753
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:55,463
was her ability
to integrate her rune.

754
00:37:55,497 --> 00:37:59,801
It was there in an incredibly
just basic, rudimentary way.

755
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:03,839
Yeah, I don't think it had
a real dark connotation to me.

756
00:38:03,873 --> 00:38:06,041
I-- It sort of just felt
sort of elfen.

757
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:07,543
All right,
let's move on to Tate.

758
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,845
For me, that is a dark elf.

759
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,247
The skin was dark.
It was aged.

760
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:14,015
The fact that he used his rune

761
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:16,217
to create another level
of the makeup,

762
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:18,619
to make it look like
cracking flesh, was brilliant.

763
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:20,154
What a great way
to integrate the rune.

764
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:22,623
That, to me,
was a really good-looking,

765
00:38:22,658 --> 00:38:23,825
complete character.

766
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:24,959
All right,
let's move on to the looks

767
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:26,360
you liked the least this week.

768
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:27,595
Why don't we start with Roy?

769
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,764
It was an interesting design

770
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:32,100
for a completely different
challenge altogether.

771
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:35,069
He did do a pretty decent job
of painting that thing,

772
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,004
and at least he finished
his character.

773
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,572
It just doesn't matter
how good the paint

774
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:39,773
is on something.

775
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:41,274
When it doesn't even fit
into the challenge,

776
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,376
it's sort of the end
of the conversation for me.

777
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,311
All right,
let's move on to Miranda.

778
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:47,413
Oh, man, I don't know
what happened to her this week.

779
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:49,081
- Wow.
- What was she doing?

780
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:50,716
It was an atrocity.

781
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,454
That felt so atypical,
to be so incredibly indecisive.

782
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:59,159
How is it that she
mismanaged her time so badly

783
00:38:59,194 --> 00:39:01,461
to allow just a few minutes
to paint it?

784
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:06,299
It is one of, if not the,
worst time management issues

785
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:07,734
we've ever seen on the show.

786
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:10,636
She had a good idea, but guys,
that's as far as it went.

787
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,172
All right, so now,
with Laney's departure,

788
00:39:13,206 --> 00:39:16,108
it begs the question,
what happens now?

789
00:39:16,142 --> 00:39:17,910
Since we have somebody
who has left,

790
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:20,614
we've essentially
got a free elimination.

791
00:39:20,648 --> 00:39:23,249
Do we end up
allowing someone to progress

792
00:39:23,284 --> 00:39:26,686
even though they've done
less than acceptable

793
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,854
- with their makeup this week?
- Right.

794
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:29,055
That seems unfair as well.

795
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:30,656
If you do a substandard makeup,

796
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,757
typically,
what we do is let them go.

797
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:35,460
It's a very, very,
very tough decision this week.

798
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:37,395
- Mm.
- Horrible.

799
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,567
All right then, judges,
have you made your decisions?

800
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:44,304
Very difficult one,
but yes, we have.

801
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,206
Let's bring 'em back out.

802
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:54,348
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

803
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:58,352
Laura, we love
how well-thought-out

804
00:39:58,386 --> 00:40:00,454
all of your
creative decisions were,

805
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:01,788
and we were blown away

806
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:03,590
by the quality
of your edge work tonight.

807
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,825
Thank you.

808
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:09,263
Tate, the shapes
in your armor were so cool,

809
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:13,267
and your character's story
was both obvious and impactful

810
00:40:13,302 --> 00:40:15,302
- at first glance.
- Thank you.

811
00:40:15,337 --> 00:40:18,205
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

812
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,241
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

813
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:29,962
Glenn, who is the winner
of this challenge?

814
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:34,633
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

815
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,403
Tate.

816
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:40,105
Wow.

817
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:42,940
We love how you
incorporated the rune

818
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:45,009
by adding a second level
to your makeup.

819
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,378
- Smart decision.
- Thank you very much.

820
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:48,379
I'm really blown away.

821
00:40:48,414 --> 00:40:50,515
I've won three challenges

822
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,616
and I'm feeling pretty good.

823
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,451
Tate, congratulations.

824
00:40:53,486 --> 00:40:55,653
You and Laura can head back
to the makeup room.

825
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:58,056
Thank you, guys.

826
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:03,228
Unfortunately,
that means Roy and Miranda,

827
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:05,196
you are on the bottom
this week.

828
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:08,231
Please step forward.

829
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,175
All right, Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

830
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,947
Roy, the proportions
and sculpture of the head

831
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,915
were way off,
and the design decisions

832
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:25,418
were wholly inappropriate
for this challenge.

833
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:29,922
Miranda, you really struggled
with time management this week,

834
00:41:29,956 --> 00:41:33,759
and it's almost impossible
for us to get past the fact

835
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:35,828
that it was so unfinished.

836
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:38,364
So who is going home tonight?

837
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:41,400
The person going home
tonight is...

838
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,407
No one is going home tonight.

839
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,646
Thank you, guys.

840
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:54,981
In light of Laney's departure,

841
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:58,084
you will move forward this week
for one reason only.

842
00:41:58,118 --> 00:42:01,454
You did not give up.

843
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:04,425
We cannot express to you
strongly enough

844
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:06,726
how hard you both
need to work next week

845
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:07,894
to redeem yourselves.

846
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:10,030
- Thank you guys so much.
- Thank you.

847
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:12,699
All right, guys,
that means you are both safe

848
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:14,201
and can head back
to the makeup room.

849
00:42:14,235 --> 00:42:17,003
- Thank you very much.
- Get ready to kill it, guys.

850
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:18,505
We will.

851
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:21,741
I deserve to go home this week
for that disaster

852
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:24,543
that I put forward on the stage,
so I'm just thankful

853
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:27,847
that I have one more chance,
and this one's got to count.

854
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:32,151
Well, you got us both
for one more challenge.

855
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:33,553
It's a huge relief, you know,

856
00:42:33,588 --> 00:42:35,222
knowing that neither one of us
are gonna go home tonight.

857
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,556
Oh, my God.

858
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:38,892
The top four is where
I made it in season three

859
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,193
and I'm not gonna be
in that spot again.

860
00:42:40,228 --> 00:42:42,529
It's really exciting
that we're the final four.

861
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:44,297
I feel honored to be here
with you guys.

862
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:45,465
Here's to second chances.

863
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:46,466
That's right.

864
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,301
That works for me.

865
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:50,037
The person that doesn't give up

866
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:51,605
is the one that will
make it through,

867
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:53,006
you know, to the final three,

868
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,941
and "Quit"
is not in my vocabulary.

869
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:57,688
Congratulations to everyone.
