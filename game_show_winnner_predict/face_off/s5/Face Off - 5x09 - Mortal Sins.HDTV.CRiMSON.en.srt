1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,676
Previously, on <i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,502 --> 00:00:08,437
Miranda earned
an incredible fourth win

3
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:09,872
with her sexy circus alien...

4
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:11,273
Thank you.

5
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:14,310
And veteran Alana
was sent home.

6
00:00:14,344 --> 00:00:17,746
Now, only five veterans
and two newcomers remain.

7
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,115
Tonight, the artists
face a challenge

8
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,417
of biblical proportions...

9
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,785
This is my challenge to win.

10
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:25,321
And for some,
it will be pure hell.

11
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:27,523
Frank, can you please help me?
Please?

12
00:00:27,557 --> 00:00:28,757
Miranda, I'm gluing shit!

13
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:31,627
I'm literally
on the verge of tears.

14
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:34,296
The sculpt is gorgeous.

15
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:36,398
There's almost nothing here.

16
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:37,967
It's an exceptional job
this week.

17
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,836
In the end one,
will win a VIP trip

18
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,571
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up,

19
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:45,674
to one of their
85 international locations,

20
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:50,813
a 2013 Fiat 500C, and $100,000.

21
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:55,484
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

22
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:57,553
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

23
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,443
Sync and corrections by n17t01

24
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,498
Are you more bummed out
about you being in the bottom

25
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:45,051
or more bummed out
that Alana's gone?

26
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:48,104
I'm just bummed out the way
that everything happened.

27
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:50,239
Like, it was a disaster.

28
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:54,744
I am so insanely heartbroken
that Alana is sent home.

29
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:56,946
I definitely think Alana and I
could have done something

30
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,149
way better, but we just weren't
able to pull it together.

31
00:02:00,183 --> 00:02:02,418
Being on bottom
was really scary.

32
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,819
- Mm-hmm.
- I just hope

33
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:07,523
this next challenge, I can
get back to where I should be.

34
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:09,775
After being on top,
I'm definitely more motivated

35
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:12,361
to try to be there again
this week, so--

36
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:13,913
- But you can't have this one,
because this one's mine.

37
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:14,914
I'm winning this one.

38
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,048
The one that's coming up,

39
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,550
I don't care what it is,
it's mine.

40
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,702
In the last challenge,
I was safe,

41
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,504
but I didn't come
to play it safe.

42
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:24,523
It's time to step up.

43
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:41,791
We walk into Saint Brendan's,
a Gothic Revival church.

44
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:46,362
There's lots
of stained glass windows.

45
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:47,797
I love the chandeliers.

46
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:52,902
It's absolutely gorgeous,

47
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:55,271
but at the same time,
it's very creepy.

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,110
Hey, guys.

49
00:03:01,144 --> 00:03:02,111
Hey.

50
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:04,948
Welcome to Saint Brendan.

51
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:07,250
This church was built in 1927,

52
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:09,519
and it has been
a popular filming location

53
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:12,889
for many blockbuster films
including <i>Spiderman 3,</i>

54
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:15,525
<i>Fight Club,</i> and <i>Armageddon.</i>

55
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,710
The stain glass windows
that are all around you

56
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:20,530
depict scenes
from biblical times.

57
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,732
Those ancient stories
are tied directly

58
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,985
to this week's
spotlight challenge.

59
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,340
The concept of Original Sin
was born in the Garden Of Eden,

60
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:33,376
but since then,
sins have only multiplied.

61
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,079
Many works of art, literature,
films, and television shows

62
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:40,717
have highlighted
the most famous of them all.

63
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,453
The seven deadly sins.

64
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:45,455
Wow, awesome.

65
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,791
This is something that I said
I wanted, and I'm so excited.

66
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:53,896
Your spotlight challenge is
to create a forbidding character

67
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:56,916
that embodies one
of the seven deadly sins.

68
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:03,172
Greed, envy, sloth, gluttony,
wrath, pride, and lust.

69
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:05,675
I am a big fan
of<i>Dante's Inferno</i>

70
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,777
and the story
of the seven deadly sins,

71
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:09,379
so this is my challenge to win.

72
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,664
Historically,
ch of the seven deadly sins

73
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,083
has been represented
by a unique color.

74
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:17,854
When Glenn calls your name,
make a selection

75
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,856
and tell us your sin.

76
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,626
Laney, you're up first.

77
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,897
Greed.

78
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:29,015
Pride.

79
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,166
Wrath.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,167
Envy.

81
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,535
Sloth.

82
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,637
Gluttony.
Fat kids gets gluttony.

83
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,842
Lust.

84
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:42,161
Glenn, how would you approach
designing a makeup

85
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,913
based on a single word?

86
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:48,101
It's so important to find
the exact essence of that word

87
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:50,787
before you start designing,
but I challenge you

88
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:54,357
to bring it to life while
trying to avoid the obvious.

89
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,025
All right, guys.
Before you leave,

90
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,462
there's just one more thing
you need to know.

91
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,381
You'll each need
to incorporate the color

92
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:04,567
that's associated with your sin
into your designs this week.

93
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,769
Oh, great.
I have no idea

94
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:09,005
how to incorporate lust
and royal blue.

95
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,606
All right,
we're going to leave you here

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,908
to work on your designs.

97
00:05:11,942 --> 00:05:13,843
Grab your apples
and get started.

98
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,813
- Good luck.
- Thank you, good luck.

99
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,419
When you hear gluttony,
and the first thing

100
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,654
that comes to mind
is a big, fat person,

101
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,256
so I want to build
a full body fat suit.

102
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,759
My mind just starts going
to all the technical aspects.

103
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:32,662
Like, how to build it
as big as I possibly can,

104
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:33,963
but I'm still trying
to figure out a way

105
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:38,201
to incorporate the sin's color
into the makeup.

106
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:40,903
When someone's greedy,
I think it makes them ugly,

107
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:44,707
so I'm going to make a woman
who's being boiled alive in oil

108
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:45,875
for eternity.

109
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,277
She's gonna have
a dress made out of money.

110
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,413
There'll be blisters
all over her face.

111
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:54,550
I'm gonna paint the skin tone
and her boils yellow.

112
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:59,689
<i>Dante's Inferno</i>described
sloth as spiritual laziness.

113
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:02,825
The consequence
is running into pits

114
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:05,461
full of venomous snakes,
being bitten and constricted,

115
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:08,464
and then eviscerated into ash,
reformed, and do it all again.

116
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,366
One of the things
in the cathedral

117
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,919
that's really inspiring me
is this giant crown

118
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,054
that's above the crucifix
of Jesus,

119
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:19,042
so my character will be bound
to a spiral staircase,

120
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,877
which leads up to the crown

121
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:23,513
with the eye of God
looking down and judging.

122
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:25,548
I'm gonna go
with an ashy flesh tone

123
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,950
and use the light blue
as my highlight tones.

124
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:33,322
Well, my concept is a demon
who committed the sin of envy

125
00:06:33,357 --> 00:06:34,891
and has turned
into this hybrid of human

126
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,859
and the church
he was unfaithful to.

127
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,027
At this point, I'm not sure

128
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:39,429
how I'm gonna incorporate
the green,

129
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:42,131
but in <i>Dante's Inferno,</i>
people who committed envy

130
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,800
had their eyes wired shut,
so I decided

131
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,302
to make my character's eyes
broken stain glass windows

132
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,037
to represent that.

133
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,872
Okay, everybody.

134
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:02,401
So we get back to the lab,
we pick our models,

135
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:05,421
and we have six hours
to work today.

136
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:11,060
Immediately, I start sculpting
a cowl and a facial prosthetic.

137
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,362
Wrath is the physical embodiment
of hatred.

138
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:16,632
It's most sinful
when done upon yourself,

139
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:21,037
so I make my design
a woman tearing her own face off

140
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,306
and revealing
this demon within,

141
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,541
and then for the color,
this could be

142
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,677
a very bloody character.

143
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:31,981
Pride is also known as vanity.

144
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:34,117
My idea is to create somebody
who is so vain,

145
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:36,586
that they've so many things
to make themselves thin

146
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,056
and beautiful that they actually
have become a monster.

147
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,358
I know how I'm gonna
incorporate the color

148
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:44,393
'cause bruising is purple,

149
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:46,429
and I'm also gonna put her
in a purple dress.

150
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:49,582
The punishment for lust

151
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:52,635
is to get swept
in this eternal whirlwind,

152
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,172
and so I'm thinking I can do
this sweeping head shape

153
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,341
that goes into horns.

154
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,644
I've got blue, and it's
just not really my aesthetic

155
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,579
quite as much,
so the wheels are turning,

156
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:05,481
and I'm trying to figure out
how to use this color

157
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,984
and make it work for lust.

158
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,519
Basically, lay up here.

159
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,270
To get this fat suit started,
I asked Tate

160
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:13,105
to lay down on the table
so I could trace him out.

161
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,391
I have to make sure that things
are lining up correctly,

162
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,593
'cause otherwise,
when I put it on the person,

163
00:08:17,628 --> 00:08:19,495
it could be a disaster.

164
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:21,214
I'm sculpting this fat suit

165
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:22,715
pretty much from the neck
to the knees.

166
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,033
I'm gonna sculpt it flat

167
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,503
and then glue it
around some wardrobe.

168
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,121
I'm gonna probably make
the fattest makeup

169
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,541
that anybody's made
on the show so far.

170
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,342
Go big or go home, huh?

171
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:43,252
Hey, guys.
Here for a walkthrough.

172
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:44,353
Well, I got sloth.

173
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:45,755
It's gonna be
two separate snakes,

174
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:47,223
one that constricts
the breathing

175
00:08:47,257 --> 00:08:49,492
and another that binds the arms
behind the back.

176
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:51,260
That snake head's sticking out.

177
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:54,647
You might chop it off and just
make a little two-piece mold.

178
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,232
Yup, I already
got my armature ready.

179
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,299
Oh, okay.

180
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,401
Very good.

181
00:08:58,435 --> 00:08:59,402
- Oh, my God.
- All right,

182
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,204
so remind us again
what you picked?

183
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:02,871
- Uh, gluttony.
- Uh-huh.

184
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,291
You know, first thing comes
to mind is a big, fat person,

185
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:08,578
so... Well, I'm trying to go
a little bit extreme,

186
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:10,947
because Glenn doesn't want it
to be the lowest hanging fruit.

187
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,266
I'm trying to go,
like, morbidly big.

188
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:15,017
You're lucky
in that when the character

189
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,637
is revealed to the judges,
they know instantly what it is.

190
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,055
- They don't have to be told.
- Yeah.

191
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,673
The color, how are you
gonna incorporate your color?

192
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:21,724
Still trying
to figure that out.

193
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:22,758
- Are you? Okay.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:23,960
- Hope it works out.
- Yeah.

195
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:25,061
What sin did you get?

196
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,229
I got pride.

197
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:27,630
I want to do sparse hair,

198
00:09:27,664 --> 00:09:29,265
so I want to punch
individual hairs into it

199
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:30,666
instead of using
one of the lace wigs.

200
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,568
- It'll look a lot better.
- Yeah, it's a good idea.

201
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:35,421
Just use coarse hair, so then
you don't have to punch as much

202
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:37,540
as opposed to,
you know, a fine hair.

203
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:38,941
My sin is lust.

204
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:41,277
The color that I got
is this royal blue,

205
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:43,212
which I don't want to paint
the creature that color,

206
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:46,432
so I'm thinking I'm gonna do
the wardrobe in the royal blue.

207
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:48,317
I was thinking lavender
for the skin tones,

208
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:49,952
then fading up into the blues.

209
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:51,387
And then you're gonna do
a beauty makeup on her?

210
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:53,456
I am, so I was thinking
to use the blues in that

211
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,690
- as well.
- Very good.

212
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:55,841
- Good luck. - Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

213
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:56,859
Thank you guys.

214
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,611
I have wrath.
This is obviously

215
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:00,062
all gonna be exposed muscle.

216
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:01,497
Should I cover it in blood

217
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,899
or maybe just keep the blood
around the edges?

218
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,935
I would go minimal
with the blood,

219
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,903
- using the blood as an accent.
- Right.

220
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:10,139
Not as a Halloween character.

221
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:13,025
I got greed.
I took this youthful model,

222
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:15,194
and I'm going to make her
very old aged.

223
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,414
My concept with that is
she gets greedy, like,

224
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:19,682
her youthful
is drained from her.

225
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:21,050
You say you're gonna do
an old-age.

226
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:23,619
The wrinkles have to be right,
or it's wrong.

227
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:25,755
- You got a long way to go.
- Yeah.

228
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,873
So I got envy,
and I was really inspired

229
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:29,492
by the cathedral
that we were win,

230
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:31,127
so I'm definitely
incorporating that.

231
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:32,862
When you first look at it,
are the judges

232
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:35,331
gonna be able to understand
this is envy?

233
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:38,100
I-I hope so. I mean--

234
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:39,635
- I mean, that's something
to think about, you know,

235
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,087
- as you're doing it.
- That's gonna be tough, yeah.

236
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,504
Michael Westmore
is worried that my design

237
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:45,041
does not read "envy,"
and that's not a good thing.

238
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:47,476
I'm starting to doubt
my concept.

239
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:50,212
What are you going to do
to have the feel

240
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:51,480
of your particular challenge?

241
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:53,416
I might have led myself
in the wrong direction.

242
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,800
Were you thinking of that?

243
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:56,952
And this is terrifying,
because I'm gonna have to

244
00:10:56,987 --> 00:11:00,022
change a lot of things
in order for this to work.

245
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:02,992
Coming up...

246
00:11:03,026 --> 00:11:04,010
You saying
it's a quick-connect

247
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,444
isn't helping me at all.

248
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,263
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle
of gluing shit.

249
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:10,199
This is an amazing,
gorgeous makeup.

250
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,735
You're so far off from
an out-of-the-box approach

251
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,270
to the challenge.

252
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,968
When you first look at it,
are the judges gonna

253
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:24,003
be able to understand
this is envy?

254
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,905
I-I hope so.

255
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:28,141
It's day one of
a seven deadly sins challenge,

256
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:29,876
and I think
Michael Westmore is worried

257
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,644
that my design is too abstract.

258
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:33,529
A part of me is worried
that the judges

259
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,882
won't initially read "envy,"

260
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,183
but I really want to take
Glenn's advice

261
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:38,384
and do something different.

262
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,119
- Take care.
- Thank you.

263
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:41,754
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

264
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:42,855
Good luck.

265
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,256
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

266
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:45,825
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

267
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,263
So what's your concept, Frank?

268
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:51,864
Fat people.

269
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,966
I'm able to get this sculpture
done in about three hours,

270
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:55,034
which gives me plenty of time

271
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,170
to get it molded
and cleaned out today.

272
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:58,370
There's a lot of things
that can go wrong

273
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,056
on a mold this big.
You need to make sure

274
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,375
that it's re-enforced properly
so that it doesn't crack

275
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,211
when I have to take the mold off
the table and move it.

276
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:07,280
Your art piece?

277
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:09,682
Frank is doing a big fat suit.

278
00:12:09,716 --> 00:12:12,018
He's doing what the judges
told him not to do.

279
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:13,252
He's dancing to Frank's tune,

280
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:15,655
and I think
he could be in trouble.

281
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:20,960
Since my character
is tearing her own face off,

282
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,529
the cowl needs to have
a lot of wrinkles,

283
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:24,730
I want to make sure
I get it right.

284
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:28,284
I want it stretched
and buckling and pulling

285
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:31,137
and there's a--
I guess I could let you--

286
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:39,862
Okay, who wants
to give me some help?

287
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,082
This is a big mold
that needs to get flipped.

288
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:45,118
Frank already molded
that thing?

289
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:46,853
- Yeah.
- Holy shit.

290
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,105
One, two, three.

291
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:54,460
- Look at that.
- I hate you so much.

292
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,895
It's sickening how quickly

293
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:57,396
the clay just falls
out of the mold.

294
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:00,333
He didn't have to clean out
a damn thing.

295
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,425
It's time!

296
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:12,061
Day one, and I got my fat suit
molded and ready for foam,

297
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,980
and I'm feeling pretty good.

298
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:16,482
I know Glenn said to not go
with the obvious route,

299
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:20,586
but with gluttony, I guess
it's got to be a fat person,

300
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:23,472
but I think that
because I'm going so extreme

301
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:26,759
with how ambitious this is,
I think that I'll be okay.

302
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,221
It's second day in the lab.

303
00:13:38,272 --> 00:13:41,407
We have 9 1/2 hours,
and I have to make sure

304
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,875
all of my pieces are detailed.

305
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,428
I have to mold my pieces,
and then after that,

306
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,413
I have to fabricate
a few costume pieces.

307
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,652
It's normally not this quiet.

308
00:13:52,686 --> 00:13:55,321
Everybody is just
so into their work.

309
00:13:55,355 --> 00:13:56,956
There's a lot riding
on this makeup,

310
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,624
and you don't want to be
the one going home on this one.

311
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:02,662
So I've got to get my sculptures
finished up and molds made

312
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,363
and start running silicone.

313
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:05,882
I decide to go with silicone
all the way around

314
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:09,001
because I want to have
that translucent skin look,

315
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,536
but the last time I used
silicone in the lab

316
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:12,605
was on the <i>Grimm</i> challenge
that I got eliminated on,

317
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,674
so I'm taking a risk,
but you know what?

318
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,542
I'm gonna take it and run it
till I get it right.

319
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:20,913
I'm done with the face
and I'm gonna mold that.

320
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:23,983
While that mold is setting,
I'm gonna sculpt the arms

321
00:14:24,017 --> 00:14:25,851
and the back of the neck
fat roll.

322
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:27,620
It's an enormous
amount of work.

323
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:29,538
I really want to go
outside of my comfort level

324
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:31,490
and really, really,
really push myself,

325
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:34,393
and this is about as big
and crazy as I can fathom.

326
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:40,600
I don't know
how to do wrinkles.

327
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,868
I'm really nervous
to be sculpting old age.

328
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:45,855
I've never really done wrinkles
or skin texture before,

329
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:48,274
but I'm hoping that
it will just impress the judges

330
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:49,675
that I'm trying to do
something different.

331
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,477
Looks really cool.

332
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:57,917
Time is ticking away,
and I'm just kind of

333
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:01,037
hopping back and forth
between the face and the cowl,

334
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:03,789
and just trying to get them done
as quickly as possible

335
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,626
because I know this cowl mold
is gonna take me a long time.

336
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:12,598
I've got three main components
that I need to fabricate today.

337
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:13,666
I've got to make the crown,

338
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,468
I have to make
the spiral staircase,

339
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:17,670
and I have to make
this giant snake

340
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:19,822
that kind of corsets
my character together.

341
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:22,241
I find
this foam-like tubing.

342
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,793
Then I find
this really cool fabric

343
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:26,211
that's almost like
a snake-scale sort of pattern,

344
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,847
and I spray-glue that down.

345
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:30,683
I use a soldering iron
to create some scale details.

346
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:33,052
Then I latex it over and
it looks just like snake scales.

347
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,060
Sculpting something
so geometric

348
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,963
has taken so much time
that I'm feeling very behind,

349
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,965
so I decide that I have to mold

350
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,467
the face, the cowl,
and a buttress.

351
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:50,836
This is a lot of work
in a short amount of time,

352
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:53,255
and I really want
to get it done.

353
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,843
Can one of you guys help me
just strength-wise?

354
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:00,246
I've got my mold open.
I just need to pick it up.

355
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,647
I've got ridiculous amounts
of work to do,

356
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,115
but I want to see
everyone succeed.

357
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,918
- It's so heavy I can't lift it.
- Oh, okay.

358
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,703
So I'm gonna help her
get this out.

359
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,955
Oh, shit.
It's cracking right here.

360
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,257
Yeah, I see a crack
over here too.

361
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:14,560
It's starting to crack
in a few little areas,

362
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:16,228
and I'm getting
a little scared.

363
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:19,832
You know what you should do?
Go to the power washer,

364
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:23,402
and shoot all along there
so you can loosen that clay up.

365
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:25,637
- Can you help me carry this?
- Yeah, you can carry that,

366
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:26,805
- I'll carry this one, yeah.
- Thank you.

367
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:29,175
So I run outside
to go power wash it.

368
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,043
Thank God for Tate.

369
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:34,347
Frank, how are you gonna
incorporate your co--

370
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:36,548
- You're what, orange?
- Orange.

371
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:37,716
How are you gonna
incorporate that?

372
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,268
Fuck if I know.

373
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,155
I'm so excited
to be building this fat suit.

374
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:44,874
Now, how do I
get this thing off?

375
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,492
I know that I have to come up
with a way

376
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,978
to incorporate the orange,
but at this point,

377
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:50,796
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

378
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:53,766
How do you change these?

379
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,684
I have to get these molds
cleaned out.

380
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,686
I am just frantic right now.

381
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:59,889
Oh!

382
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,508
The hose comes loose
and is spraying me everywhere.

383
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,076
It's just absolutely
terrifying.

384
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,978
How do I turn this off?

385
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:08,564
I don't know what to do.

386
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,049
Fuck!

387
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,269
Frank, you know how to change
this-- the head of this thing?

388
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:14,837
Oh, you just gotta
pull the thing down.

389
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:17,323
It's just like a quick-connect,
Miranda, like on the airbrushes.

390
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:19,892
Yeah, okay, well,
it's not working, so thanks.

391
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,261
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle
of gluing shit.

392
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,613
It's an individual challenge.
We're all busy as hell,

393
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:26,232
and she's screaming for help.

394
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:27,917
Frank, can you please help me?
Please?

395
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,335
Miranda, I'm gluing shit!

396
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,870
Oh, my God.

397
00:17:30,904 --> 00:17:33,155
I don't know how the fuck
to connect this thing.

398
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,707
It's a quick-connect,
like the fucking airbrush.

399
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:36,158
Yeah, well, it's not working.

400
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:39,311
You saying it's a quick-connect
isn't helping me at all.

401
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:42,465
If I don't get this mold out,
I'm not gonna have any pieces.

402
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,917
I'm screwed.

403
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:50,885
I don't know
how the fuck to do this!

404
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,154
It's day two on the seven
deadly sins challenge,

405
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,590
and panic is starting to set in.
I'm like, "Oh, my God."

406
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:59,811
I've got to get this mold
cleaned out.

407
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:02,363
I'm literally
on the verge of tears right now.

408
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:03,631
- Tate.
- Hmm?

409
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,550
Will you please help me
to change this nozzle?

410
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,235
- Please?
- You just--

411
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,520
I've been trying
for, like, ten minutes.

412
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,556
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm sorry.

413
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,275
Tate, of course,
comes and helps me.

414
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,181
Which one do you want?

415
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:23,334
It's just really tough
for me to say no.

416
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,420
Oh, you don't change
the actual gun.

417
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,888
Leave the gun on,
but this part right here,

418
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,057
pull that down, pop that off.

419
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,393
I guess the problem was
that I had

420
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:35,747
unattached the actual hose part
rather than just the nozzle?

421
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,065
There you go, yup.

422
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,334
I still don't get
that damn power washer,

423
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,386
but thank God Tate does.

424
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,173
She took the whole gun apart

425
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,375
instead of the tip.

426
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,932
I'm really feeling inspired
by the idea

427
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:55,950
of prayer candles in a church,

428
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,418
so I'm trying to figure out

429
00:18:57,453 --> 00:19:00,154
how to make these PVC pipes
look like drippy wax candles,

430
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,608
and Tate gives me a good idea
of using friendly plastic.

431
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,160
Friendly plastic are
little beads

432
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:09,664
where you can drop them in water
and heat up the water,

433
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:12,150
and it will
turn into liquid plastic

434
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,534
that you can shape
into anything you want.

435
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:17,205
Ten minutes left.

436
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:27,615
That's time, everyone.
Time's up.

437
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,916
By the end of the day,
I've got, you know,

438
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,452
both of my silicone pieces run,
I've got the cowl

439
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,471
partially painted
and some hair punched in it.

440
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,207
I can spend an hour tomorrow
finishing up the hair

441
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,691
and punching in the eyebrows,

442
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,960
and applying it
and getting it done,

443
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:40,962
so I think
I'm in a really good place.

444
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,790
After watching Tate
help Miranda in the lab today,

445
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,810
we're sitting at the house
and I just told him,

446
00:19:55,844 --> 00:19:57,845
"You're gonna end up
out of this competition

447
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,147
because you keep
helping people."

448
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:02,083
Miranda's got four wins.
Us guys have one.

449
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,185
- Yeah.
- It's a competition.

450
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,453
Outside of here,
we can be friends,

451
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,004
but in here we're competitors

452
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,623
and there's $100,000
on the line.

453
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:10,892
I've got to figure out
how to say no.

454
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:13,628
Grow some balls.

455
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,731
He's right, you know?
I'm only hurting myself.

456
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:17,849
We're at the end
of the game now.

457
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,433
It's time for me to win.

458
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,103
- Let's go in, get some dinner.
- Yeah, let's make some food.

459
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,064
- Good luck.
- Thanks, man.

460
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,382
It's application day.

461
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,667
We have four hours in the lab,
one hour last-looks.

462
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:38,118
That's pretty fucked.

463
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,755
Application day
is terrifying because

464
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,524
I still have to fully paint
that 15-foot-long snake,

465
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,328
paint the spiral staircase,
and apply a chest piece, a cowl.

466
00:20:47,362 --> 00:20:50,131
I've got ridiculous amounts
of work to do.

467
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,534
- How are you?
- Good.

468
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:54,869
It's so good to finally
get to work with you.

469
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,570
- I'm so excited!
- Same here.

470
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,772
It's an honor.

471
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:59,757
It's, uh--
it's gonna be exciting.

472
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:04,145
First thing up, I need a jump
on painting the fat suit.

473
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,880
So, my paint scheme
is basically

474
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:08,182
just a really irritated
and sickly skin tone.

475
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,884
That looks sick, Frankie.

476
00:21:09,918 --> 00:21:11,886
Skin tones are tough
for some people to do

477
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,988
because it's not like
it's an alien

478
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,673
where you can just paint it
whatever color you want.

479
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,391
We all know what skin tones
look like,

480
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:20,628
so to put the subtleties
and the color breakups

481
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:22,964
and make it look correct
can sometimes be tricky.

482
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,333
All right, man.
Ready to get into this?

483
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,570
Let's see if it lights on fire.

484
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:32,673
I decide to make my wardrobe
look like it's been burned,

485
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,075
like she's been
through hell and back,

486
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:36,810
so I get some 99% alcohol.

487
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:37,995
Should work.

488
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,347
And I start spraying that.

489
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:45,052
I have a lot of experience
burning things.

490
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,854
It's just fun to me.

491
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,089
Ah ha!

492
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:51,125
My cowl did not
turn out very well.

493
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,461
It's in multiple pieces.
Not only do I have to

494
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,329
still do all of this
insane amount of work,

495
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,164
but now, I have to take the time
to re-patch

496
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,799
and re-fit this thing
together on her,

497
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,068
and the clock's dwindling down.

498
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:03,037
I'm just trying to do
everything I can

499
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,874
without making any mistakes.

500
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,178
When I get to my cowl piece,

501
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,115
the entire thing has
a second skin.

502
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:17,118
"Second skin" is when
you have the foam latex

503
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,036
and then the skin,
and they're not attached.

504
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,689
I have to cut off
the entire second skin

505
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:24,392
and then very carefully
glue it back on

506
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,311
so that the detail actually
matches up where it should.

507
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:29,930
I'm gonna have to spend
quite a bit of time

508
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:32,133
patching this, and I'm scared.

509
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,002
I don't think this sculpt
is gonna even look good.

510
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,275
Oh, man.
So much painting to do!

511
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:46,981
My edges on my application,

512
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:48,582
they're not as smooth
as I want 'em to be.

513
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,384
I need to fix that.

514
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,520
I'm just having issues, but I'm
gonna work my way through it.

515
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,989
There's gonna be makeup onstage

516
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:57,325
that at least I'm happy with.

517
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:59,226
15 freakin' minutes.

518
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:04,648
At the end of application,
I've still got

519
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,101
a ridiculous amount of work
to do.

520
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,803
I have all of my pieces
laid down,

521
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:12,056
but the paint job
isn't even halfway done.

522
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,692
I don't have any detail,
but more importantly,

523
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,278
there is absolutely
no light blue,

524
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,246
which is the color to my sin.

525
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:21,215
I still gotta paint
a giant snake too.

526
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:24,018
All right,
that's time, everybody!

527
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,821
My fate comes down
to one hour at last looks.

528
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,923
That's all I have.

529
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:31,659
Coming up...

530
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:32,960
Son of a bitch.

531
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,096
I'm almost expecting
to go home with this one.

532
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,464
There's no way
I'm gonna get it done.

533
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,100
I am just slapping
this paint on.

534
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:41,369
There's almost nothing here.

535
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:44,572
I think that the sculpt
is absolutely gorgeous.

536
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:52,286
Let's do it, guys.

537
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,624
Going into last looks,
I have to incorporate

538
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:58,475
some green tones
closer to the face.

539
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:01,762
I'm very unhappy with how
my makeup looks right now.

540
00:24:01,796 --> 00:24:04,832
This hour is crucial to me,
so I go crazy.

541
00:24:04,866 --> 00:24:07,768
I start laying down lights
and shadows.

542
00:24:07,802 --> 00:24:09,903
I bring in that baby blue
for contouring.

543
00:24:09,938 --> 00:24:11,055
Perfect.

544
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:12,339
I just hope I can get it
really quickly.

545
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:14,491
I just gotta zone in
to the painting for now,

546
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,377
'cause otherwise, there's
no way I'm gonna get it done.

547
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:19,747
I am just slapping
this paint on her,

548
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:21,548
and it's starting
to actually come together.

549
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,817
15 minutes, guys.
15 minutes.

550
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:26,153
I did not just do that.
Son of a bitch.

551
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:28,022
I got all these stitches
to put in,

552
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:29,873
and I don't really
have the time,

553
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:32,259
so I just paint them in.

554
00:24:36,531 --> 00:24:38,465
I only have one minute.

555
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:43,227
It's time, everyone!

556
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:45,589
- Pbbt!
- Yours came together.

557
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,141
- Mine's terrible.
- No, it really

558
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:48,759
- didn't come together.
- It's so bad, I should've had--

559
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,144
I'm really nervous.
Shit.

560
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:53,814
Hopefully,
the judges will like it.

561
00:25:01,656 --> 00:25:05,592
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

562
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:09,063
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

563
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,732
Let's say hello
to our talented judges.

564
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:14,768
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

565
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:15,969
Good evening.

566
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:17,204
Hey.

567
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:19,806
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

568
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,875
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Ve.

569
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,928
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

570
00:25:24,963 --> 00:25:26,013
Hello.

571
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:27,181
- Hello.
- Hey, Neville.

572
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:29,750
And this week,
we have a very special guest.

573
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:33,020
He's a two-time Emmy-nominated
writer and producer

574
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:37,357
whose work includes <i>Wonderfalls,</i>
<i>Dead Like Me, Pushing Daisies,</i>

575
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:41,595
and the critically acclaimed
NBC thriller, <i>Hannibal.</i>

576
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:45,265
Please give a warm welcome
to Bryan Fuller.

577
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,885
Thank you.
I'm so excited.

578
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:49,887
I've been a fan of this show
since the first season.

579
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:52,906
It's really exciting to have
somebody like Bryan here,

580
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:55,542
'cause he knows about edges
and seams and paintjobs.

581
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:57,377
He does deal with it
almost on a daily basis.

582
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:59,146
Bryan, a lot of your work

583
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,198
tends to lean
towards the darker side,

584
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:03,817
so I have a feeling
you're gonna really enjoy

585
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:05,836
- tonight's makeups.
- I'm so excited

586
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,756
to see what sinful things
you guys are conjuring up.

587
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,693
All right, guys, so this week,
your spotlight challenge

588
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,895
was to create
a forbidding character

589
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,599
that embodied one
of the seven deadly sins.

590
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:21,568
Now, we also asked you
to incorporate the color

591
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:25,272
that's historically associated
with your sin into your makeup.

592
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:28,208
So let's see
what you've come up with.

593
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,184
I think the makeup looks good
from a distance.

594
00:26:54,219 --> 00:26:55,836
I should at least be safe.

595
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,038
I guess we'll see.

596
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:21,328
I can't believe
I pulled this together.

597
00:27:21,346 --> 00:27:24,331
I was expecting safe
or bottom looks.

598
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:27,367
Now, I feel like I could
take maybe the whole thing.

599
00:27:46,588 --> 00:27:49,823
I think it's so cool.
It's so big and so ridiculous.

600
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:53,627
All of the pieces came together,
and it's really badass.

601
00:28:11,145 --> 00:28:12,712
I think I've completely
missed the mark.

602
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,047
It's a lame design, and

603
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:17,617
it's one of the worst things
I've ever done.

604
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:41,325
I think that they may
have problems with it

605
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:43,911
'cause maybe
they won't get lust from it,

606
00:28:43,945 --> 00:28:46,980
but overall,
it's a good makeup.

607
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,170
I really like my makeup a lot.

608
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:12,306
My only concern is
if there's enough yellow,

609
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,842
and that could be a bad thing.

610
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:38,098
My makeup is definitely
the creepiest,

611
00:29:38,132 --> 00:29:40,651
and if that was
one of the challenge parameters

612
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:43,704
that the judges are looking for,
I'm in good shape.

613
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:49,309
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

614
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,211
at tonight's characters?

615
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:01,538
Oh, my goodness.
What's going on here?

616
00:30:01,572 --> 00:30:03,590
The judges are going
directly to the places

617
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:05,158
I was hoping
they would not see.

618
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:07,661
- This edge is really rough.
- I almost want to think

619
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:08,979
that it's intentional.

620
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,564
- No, it's not.
- No, no.

621
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:13,600
I'm almost expecting
to go home on this one.

622
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:18,438
Who made your favorite
forbidding character tonight?

623
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:21,291
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

624
00:30:23,311 --> 00:30:25,195
Oh, my goodness.
What's going on here?

625
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:26,880
The judges are going
directly to the places

626
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:28,281
I was hoping
they would not see.

627
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:30,867
These eyebrows
look like brushes.

628
00:30:30,902 --> 00:30:33,520
This edge is really rough
and it shouldn't be.

629
00:30:33,554 --> 00:30:34,971
Wow.

630
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:38,291
- I don't get it.
- Thank you.

631
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:43,813
- Boy.
- This is a lot of work.

632
00:30:43,848 --> 00:30:45,332
There's a lot of storytelling
going on.

633
00:30:45,366 --> 00:30:48,151
I love the spiral staircase
to the unachievable crown.

634
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:49,436
- Mm-hmm.
- And the entire snake

635
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,521
- was sculpted as well.
- Yeah.

636
00:30:51,572 --> 00:30:53,573
- Thank you.
- All right, thanks.

637
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,577
I'm utterly confused
by this shape

638
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:00,280
and why it doesn't carry
onto the forehead.

639
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:02,816
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

640
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:07,454
I love the structural quality
blending into the makeup.

641
00:31:07,488 --> 00:31:09,022
This could do
with a bit more definition.

642
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,658
Yeah, it's pretty rough,
but it's a good idea.

643
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:13,677
Thank you.

644
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:18,114
- Very pretty.
- It's really nice work.

645
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:20,433
- Yeah.
- It's certainly clean,

646
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:22,435
and the edges
are really well done.

647
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:24,454
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

648
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:28,608
Wow.

649
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:31,144
Because there's layers
of flesh tones,

650
00:31:31,178 --> 00:31:34,698
it feels like foam.
It's such a singular color.

651
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,116
Actually pretty darn
through the neck.

652
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,051
Yeah.

653
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,222
I think it's very clever.
She so wrathful,

654
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,757
she's ripping her face off.

655
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,425
Not a ton of work, though.
I mean,

656
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,010
a lot of this is
on-the-day stuff,

657
00:31:47,044 --> 00:31:48,895
so basically,
we're just looking at this.

658
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:50,930
Yeah, thanks.

659
00:31:53,467 --> 00:31:55,151
So Bryan, how do you feel
they did tonight

660
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:57,070
embracing
the seven deadly sins?

661
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:58,505
Looking across
all these makeups,

662
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:01,107
there are so many ideas
and clever notions

663
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:03,827
embedded in all of them,
that I am very impressed

664
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,179
with all of your work.
Congratulations.

665
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:07,981
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

666
00:32:08,015 --> 00:32:10,600
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

667
00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:12,402
Let's find out
what they thought.

668
00:32:12,436 --> 00:32:15,322
Laura,

669
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:17,190
Eddie,

670
00:32:17,224 --> 00:32:19,192
Laney.

671
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:21,628
Congratulations,
you are all safe

672
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:23,630
and can head
back to the makeup room.

673
00:32:23,664 --> 00:32:25,348
Thank you.

674
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:35,208
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

675
00:32:35,242 --> 00:32:37,009
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

676
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:38,528
to learn more about your work.

677
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:41,381
Miranda, please step up.

678
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:48,355
Tell us about your concept

679
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:50,623
and how you integrated
the sin of lust.

680
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:53,360
Well, my character is a demon

681
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:55,795
who has a lust
for eternal youth.

682
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,397
She lures in men,
and then kills them

683
00:32:57,431 --> 00:33:01,017
and drinks their blood
so that she can stay youthful.

684
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:03,703
I think that the sculpt
is absolutely gorgeous.

685
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:06,790
Oh, okay.

686
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:10,543
The symmetry is beautiful.
That is a massive amount of work

687
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:11,644
to do at that level...

688
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,480
...in the time that you had.

689
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:16,983
This is an amazing,
gorgeous makeup.

690
00:33:17,017 --> 00:33:18,735
This whole area
right in the face,

691
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:21,121
I love the luminous lavender
of her forehead

692
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:24,374
and how your paint job brought
the tips darker at the top.

693
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:26,976
- Quite gorgeous.
- Thank you, Ve.

694
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:30,130
The lipstick makeup is
a little murky in there for me.

695
00:33:30,164 --> 00:33:32,098
It's beautiful, though.
It is drop-dead gorgeous

696
00:33:32,132 --> 00:33:33,466
as a piece.

697
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:35,101
If you're selling lust,

698
00:33:35,136 --> 00:33:37,437
we need to see
a little more "T" and "A"...

699
00:33:37,471 --> 00:33:39,172
But I think

700
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:41,107
you really succeed
with the makeup.

701
00:33:41,142 --> 00:33:42,709
- Thank you.
- Miranda,

702
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:43,810
please step back.

703
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:46,830
Thank you.

704
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:50,884
Frank, please step forward.

705
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:57,507
So tell us about the sin
that you got

706
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:00,794
and how you integrated the color
orange into your makeup.

707
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:03,196
Clearly, this is gluttony,

708
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,131
and I glued
our little orange apple

709
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:08,435
that we got onto here,
so there's some orange for ya.

710
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,620
So basically, you didn't put
any orange into your makeup.

711
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:13,173
- Uh--
- This just

712
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:17,177
is a misshapen fat guy to me,
unfortunately.

713
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:20,597
I have problems
with the goiter.

714
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,016
How did you come about
this anatomy choice?

715
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,518
When Glenn said
that we shouldn't go

716
00:34:25,553 --> 00:34:28,688
after the low-hanging fruit and
do the completely obvious thing,

717
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:31,458
I didn't want to go
too far from a fat suit,

718
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:32,659
'cause I thought
it would be fun,

719
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:36,029
so I tried to make it
as extreme as I could.

720
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:38,598
Do goiters have
anything to do with being fat?

721
00:34:38,632 --> 00:34:42,051
No.
That's a medical problem.

722
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:44,204
From a creative concept
standpoint,

723
00:34:44,238 --> 00:34:48,508
there's almost nothing here,
and the touch of the apple

724
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:51,678
feels like
"Here's your orange, guys."

725
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:53,446
The paint that you have
on the chest

726
00:34:53,481 --> 00:34:54,714
is absolutely gorgeous.

727
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,249
The tones
couldn't be done better.

728
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:58,785
That said,
I think you were close

729
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:03,089
with the technical approach,
but so far off with a clever,

730
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:04,824
out-of-the-box way
of approaching the challenge.

731
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,110
Yeah, I understand.

732
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:09,162
Frank,
if you'd please step back.

733
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:18,137
Roy, please step up.

734
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,012
Tell us about your sin and how
the color is utilized in this.

735
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,547
The apple that I chose
was pride.

736
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:29,048
It's also known as "vanity,"

737
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:30,884
and every time that she looked
in a mirror,

738
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,085
she just keep seeing flaws,

739
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,836
so she kept getting
cosmetic surgeries,

740
00:35:33,871 --> 00:35:36,122
so now her skin is so sensitive
that when ever you touch it,

741
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:39,325
it bruises, and that's the way
I worked the purple into it

742
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,728
is the purple bruising
of her skin.

743
00:35:41,762 --> 00:35:44,230
The overall appearance
is pretty good,

744
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:48,034
but up close
is a real problem for me.

745
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:51,104
The application
is incredibly coarse,

746
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:53,639
and the details--
the stitches for example,

747
00:35:53,657 --> 00:35:55,525
they're rudimentary
or nonexistent,

748
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,711
and that's what's
killing it for me.

749
00:35:58,746 --> 00:36:00,413
This was one of those makeups

750
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:03,650
that was a little abstracted
from its concepts.

751
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:06,786
It wasn't quite as literal
as gluttony was,

752
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,489
so I felt that you were being
very thoughtful with it.

753
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:13,660
It's just-- on close inspection,
it wouldn't hold up to camera.

754
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:15,161
I understand.

755
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:18,364
It would have been so simple
to have created

756
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:20,767
more of the plastic surgery
story.

757
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:23,519
It feels like a zombie makeup,
and I don't feel

758
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:27,607
like that really encapsulates
your story about pride.

759
00:36:27,641 --> 00:36:30,627
Roy, please step back.

760
00:36:34,865 --> 00:36:37,350
Tate, you're up.

761
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:45,024
- Hello.
- Hi, Tate.

762
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:47,143
Tell us about your concept
and let us know

763
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:49,562
how you worked your color
into the overall aesthetic.

764
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:50,930
Well, I had sloth.

765
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:53,549
I wanted to embody
that torturous feeling.

766
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:55,251
I also read
that one of the tortures

767
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:56,919
was to fall into the pit
full of snakes,

768
00:36:56,971 --> 00:36:59,372
hence all the snakebites
on the head and chest.

769
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,957
I took this reference
from the church,

770
00:37:01,008 --> 00:37:03,610
behind the giant crucifix
of Jesus there was this crown,

771
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:05,428
so I wanted to use that
to interpret

772
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:08,815
the eye of God watching the soul
in eternal damnation.

773
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:11,234
It keeps my interest
and it keeps telling a story,

774
00:37:11,285 --> 00:37:14,520
which I really appreciate.

775
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:15,805
Where did you incorporate
your color,

776
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:17,840
- which was light blue?
- I took the baby blue

777
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:21,144
and I took a stipple sponge, and
I put it over the high points

778
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:23,146
to use that
as my highlight tone.

779
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,898
Up close, it's definitely
apparent where you did it,

780
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:28,284
and I love the fact that you've
highlighted the forehead

781
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:29,786
so that stands out.

782
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,170
I think you did
a great job, honey.

783
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:32,922
Thank you, Ve.
I appreciate that.

784
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:36,409
There's a sophisticated
integration of the concept.

785
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:38,177
It's not too literal.

786
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:40,446
I understood the crown
having been at the church,

787
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:43,533
and the amount of work,
very impressive.

788
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,918
Wow, thank you very much,
Glenn.

789
00:37:45,936 --> 00:37:49,322
Tate, you may step back.

790
00:37:53,444 --> 00:37:55,511
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

791
00:37:55,546 --> 00:37:57,130
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

792
00:37:57,164 --> 00:38:00,149
while they deliberate.

793
00:38:03,937 --> 00:38:06,606
Okay, judges, why don't we start
with some of the looks you like

794
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,275
the most this week?
How about Miranda?

795
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:10,677
The painting was beautiful.

796
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:14,414
The way it gets darker
towards the tips, gorgeous.

797
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:17,417
Technically speaking, that is
the most beautiful makeup

798
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:21,421
on this stage, but it's not
recognizable as lust.

799
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:24,223
She seemed prude
for a lusty demon.

800
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:25,391
Yeah.

801
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:26,926
All right,
let's move on to Tate.

802
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,813
I dig Tate's makeup.
I think it's creepy.

803
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:32,648
I love the coloring on it.

804
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,835
He did a really good job
embodying sloth.

805
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:37,804
- It was incredibly clever.
- Yeah.

806
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,840
It's just a huge success
in terms of telling the story

807
00:38:40,874 --> 00:38:42,992
and fulfilling
the challenge parameters.

808
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:45,812
Okay, let's talk about
the looks you like the least.

809
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:47,080
Let's start with Frank.

810
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:50,183
Frank used the expression
"Low-hanging fruit."

811
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:53,219
It felt like the fruit
was on the ground.

812
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:56,289
There was no gluttony
inspiration behind it.

813
00:38:56,323 --> 00:38:58,157
He didn't have
the little, tweaky thing

814
00:38:58,192 --> 00:38:59,392
that would have made it cool.

815
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:01,828
There's no connection
of the actual gravity

816
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:05,665
pulling on his flesh, so
it looks like a stuck-on piece.

817
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:07,483
And what about Roy?

818
00:39:07,534 --> 00:39:09,502
The key to his version of pride

819
00:39:09,536 --> 00:39:11,504
is plastic surgery gone wrong,

820
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:13,272
but he didn't pull any of it.

821
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,841
He didn't yank
her eyebrows back.

822
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:15,908
- Yeah.
- You know, all the things

823
00:39:15,943 --> 00:39:17,443
that you would do
to tell that story

824
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:19,245
are absent in the makeup,

825
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,247
so it's just a zombie makeup
with stitches glued to it.

826
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,166
Yeah, and they're
not even glued to it.

827
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:24,917
- They're painted on.
- Oh, even worse.

828
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:27,920
- And the paint job was so bad.
- Yeah.

829
00:39:27,955 --> 00:39:30,139
Lot of bad decisions
by Roy this week.

830
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:31,791
So judges,
have you made your decisions?

831
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:33,009
We have.

832
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:35,728
Okay,
let's bring them back out.

833
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:45,421
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

834
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:48,608
Miranda, we really appreciate

835
00:39:48,642 --> 00:39:51,244
all of the intricate detail
in your head sculpt,

836
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:54,113
and you delivered
an outstanding paint job.

837
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:57,817
Tate, your character hit
on many, many levels

838
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:59,919
for us this week,
from your high concept

839
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:03,105
to the way that it was executed.
It all worked really well.

840
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,224
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

841
00:40:05,259 --> 00:40:08,661
Tonight's winner is...

842
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:16,195
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

843
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:19,999
Tonight's winner is...

844
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:23,302
Tate.

845
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:25,104
Wow.
Thank you very much, guys.

846
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,973
This challenge seemed like
it was a perfect fit for you,

847
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,175
and it was really obvious
that you listened

848
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,578
to what I asked for.
Well done.

849
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,046
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

850
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,048
I did exactly what I wanted
to do in this.

851
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:38,584
I didn't hold anything back,
so it's extremely rewarding

852
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:41,220
that I was able to pull together
something that the judges liked.

853
00:40:41,254 --> 00:40:42,955
Tate, congratulations.

854
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:45,157
You and Miranda can
head back to the makeup room.

855
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:46,425
- Thanks.
- Thank you, guys.

856
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,434
Unfortunately, that means

857
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:57,569
the two of you
are on the bottom this week,

858
00:40:57,604 --> 00:41:00,039
and one of you
will be eliminated.

859
00:41:00,073 --> 00:41:02,474
Please step forward, guys.

860
00:41:07,013 --> 00:41:10,182
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

861
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:13,585
Frank,
we had significant problems

862
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,988
with the shape of the face
and the chin

863
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:19,925
and found the character lacking
overall in terms of concept.

864
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:23,362
Roy, despite looking okay
from afar,

865
00:41:23,396 --> 00:41:25,798
up close, the sculpting,
blending,

866
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:29,535
and paint job on your character
this week were all really rough.

867
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:31,937
So who is going home tonight?

868
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:34,973
The person going home
tonight is...

869
00:41:38,378 --> 00:41:41,246
Frank.

870
00:41:41,281 --> 00:41:43,182
You did
an absolute ton of work,

871
00:41:43,216 --> 00:41:44,817
but we could not get past
the sculptural

872
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,985
and creative choices
that you made this week.

873
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,455
I'm sorry, man.

874
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:52,991
Frank, I am so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

875
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:56,161
Roy, you are safe this week.

876
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:57,913
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room.

877
00:41:57,964 --> 00:41:59,832
Okay.

878
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,571
Frankie, I couldn't be prouder

879
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:07,840
of all the stuff that you've
done on the show this season,

880
00:42:07,874 --> 00:42:11,076
and you're gonna go on
to do great things.

881
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,879
Frank, it's been great
having you here with us,

882
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:16,348
and if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

883
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:18,784
and pack up your kit.

884
00:42:18,818 --> 00:42:21,520
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Frank.

885
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:25,040
I would rather go out
on a big, crazy, technical,

886
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:28,043
awesome makeup than go out
on some big, giant mistake,

887
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:30,212
and I didn't make
a big, giant mistake.

888
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:33,265
I made a big, giant,
crazy makeup.

889
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:35,033
- I'm out, bitches!
- What?

890
00:42:35,068 --> 00:42:36,468
I'm proud of the fact

891
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:38,470
that I helped a lot of people
out this season.

892
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:40,139
Hey, no, don't.

893
00:42:40,173 --> 00:42:42,057
Get out of here! No!

894
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,042
Hopefully, this time
people see the real me

895
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,561
instead of me goofing around

896
00:42:45,612 --> 00:42:47,751
like I did the first time
I was on <i>Face Off.</i>

897
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:50,182
I'm proud of a lot of the work
that I've done.

898
00:42:50,216 --> 00:42:51,984
I pushed myself as an artist

899
00:42:52,018 --> 00:42:53,585
and I got to make
some really crazy things,

900
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,229
so it's been a lot of fun.
