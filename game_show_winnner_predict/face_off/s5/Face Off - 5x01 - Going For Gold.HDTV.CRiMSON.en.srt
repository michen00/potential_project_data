1
00:00:05,026 --> 00:00:08,062
<i>Face Off</i> is back
for a jaw-dropping new season.

2
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:13,133
The search for the next
great name in movie magic

3
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:15,825
takes a shocking twist.

4
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:19,321
Veterans versus the newcomers.

5
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,875
Eight talented newcomers
will battle

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,611
eight hungry veterans
back for redemption...

7
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,146
I just don't want to make
the newbs feel bad.

8
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:28,653
It's war between them and us.

9
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:32,005
...in a competition
unlike any other.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,071
They'll face
breathtaking obstacles...

11
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:35,823
- Oh, my God.
- I'm freaking out.

12
00:00:35,857 --> 00:00:37,691
...unbelievable deadlines...

13
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:38,892
It's a quick connect, like--
Fuck!

14
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,561
Yeah, well, it's not working.

15
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:41,762
This is harder than I thought.

16
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:43,964
...and the most heart-stopping
challenges

17
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:45,766
in <i>Face Off</i> history.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,884
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:48,969
Get the fuck out.

20
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:50,637
Along the way,
they'll come face to face

21
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,339
with legends.

22
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:53,707
What?

23
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,509
But to come out on top,

24
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:58,746
they'll have to impress our
award-winning panel of judges--

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,715
Ve Neill, three-time
Oscar-winning makeup artist

26
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,350
whose work includes <i>Beetlejuice,</i>

27
00:01:03,385 --> 00:01:04,918
<i>The Hunger Games Catching Fire,</i>

28
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,186
and <i>The Amazing Spiderman...</i>

29
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,855
This is an immaculate makeup.

30
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:09,923
Glenn Hetrick,
cutting-edge makeup artist

31
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,125
on <i>CSI NY,</i>

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,526
<i>The Hunger Games Catching Fire,</i>

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,428
and custom designer
for Lady Gaga...

34
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,796
I dig it a lot.

35
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,481
And Neville Page,

36
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:19,633
creature and concept designer
on <i>Avatar,</i>

37
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,302
<i>Prometheus,</i>
and <i>Star Trek Into Darkness.</i>

38
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:23,404
That's fantastic.

39
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,372
In the end, only one will win

40
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,607
a VIP trip from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

41
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:30,410
to one of their 85
international locations,

42
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:33,680
a 2013 Fiat 500C,

43
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:37,584
and $100,000.

44
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:40,353
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

45
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,289
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

46
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:22,961
Sync and corrections by n17t01

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,767
<i>Face Off</i> is back,

48
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:30,404
but the game has changed.

49
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,926
I invited our new contestants
to a masquerade ball

50
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,611
here at the Park Plaza

51
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:41,915
to tell them about this season's
big twist.

52
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:45,385
Whoo!

53
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,403
I am Adolfo.

54
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:48,121
I was born and raised
in Puerto Rico.

55
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:50,123
I like to make everything
look glamorous

56
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:51,325
and shiny and sparkly.

57
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:54,728
I've been working my ass off
to be here,

58
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:57,097
and I just want to win this.

59
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:59,366
My name is Rick,
and I'm 38 years old.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,268
I'm self-taught.

61
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:02,903
After high school,
I've been making a living

62
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:03,904
doing effects.

63
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,639
I'm in this competition
to prove

64
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:07,941
I have earned my place
in this field.

65
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:08,942
Rick.
Nice to meet you.

66
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,028
Nice to meet you.

67
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:12,145
My name's Sam.

68
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,314
I attended
the Tom Savini School,

69
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:16,717
where I graduated in 2012.

70
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,251
I'd say a few
of my strong points are

71
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:21,021
sculpting, mold making,
and I've got a lot of heart.

72
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:22,022
So don't count me out.

73
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:23,273
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up? Sam.

74
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:25,592
Mwah! Adolfo.

75
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:26,593
My name is Steve Tolin.

76
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:27,661
I go by Tolin.

77
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:29,096
I own and operate

78
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,098
a specialized design
and fabrication shop.

79
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:32,399
I live in Pittsburgh
with my wife

80
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,000
and my two beautiful girls.

81
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:35,969
Winning <i>Face Off</i> could really
set me and my family up

82
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:40,240
in a way that I would never be
able to do on my own.

83
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:41,241
- Adolfo.
- Eddie.

84
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,275
- Eddie.
- Nice to meet you.

85
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,576
I'm currently a student

86
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:44,745
at Savannah College
of Art and Design,

87
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,947
studying CG and visual effects.

88
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,616
My strengths right now
are my concept development

89
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,418
and design, and I think I have

90
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:55,405
a great shot at winning.

91
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:56,890
My name is Laney,

92
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:58,959
and I moved to LA
about four years ago.

93
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:01,628
Right now, I'm just working
in this tiny little cubicle

94
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:03,730
in my garage, making messes.

95
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,649
For me, winning <i>Face Off</i>

96
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,900
could open a door for me

97
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:08,335
to start getting the jobs
that I really need.

98
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:11,104
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm Rick.

99
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:12,355
Hi, Rick. Scott.

100
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:13,824
My name is Scott,

101
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:17,110
and I started Scream Team
back in 1996.

102
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:20,714
And I sell prosthetics
all over the world.

103
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:21,948
Champagne for Scott.

104
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,600
Winning<i>Face Off</i>
would be a dream

105
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,103
because customers of mine
would finally put a face

106
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,489
with my business.

107
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,125
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,594
I'm Lyma.
I'm originally from Mexico.

109
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:35,829
<i>Merci.</i>

110
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:38,231
I practiced as a dentist.

111
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,234
Then I started doing teeth
for Halloween, vampires.

112
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:43,870
Then, eventually,
I became a makeup artist.

113
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:45,605
I have
a one-year-old daughter,

114
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,140
and she's my whole life.

115
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:50,777
So I would like
to win this for her.

116
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,252
- Here we go.
- Uh-oh.

117
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:00,520
Hello.

118
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:01,922
Here comes McKenzie.

119
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:03,490
Oh, my gosh.

120
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:05,859
- Whoo!
- Hey, guys.

121
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:08,762
- Hello.
- Welcome to <i>Face Off.</i>

122
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:09,930
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

123
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:10,931
I'm stunned.

124
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:12,632
She looks even prettier
in person,

125
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,633
and this is <i>Face Off.</i>

126
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:14,968
It's about to begin.

127
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:17,671
This is the legendary
Park Plaza hotel.

128
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,756
Through the years, it's served
as a filming location

129
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,041
for popular movies

130
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:23,276
and been a hot spot
for Hollywood's elite.

131
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:25,295
Now, I'm sure you've noticed
that there are only

132
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:26,412
eight of you here.

133
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,583
Well, let's meet
the rest of the cast.

134
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:31,151
Guys, come on out.

135
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,063
- Oh, yeah.
- No way.

136
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,933
The other cast members
are people

137
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:49,703
that have been on <i>Face Off.</i>

138
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:52,255
I am so scared.

139
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,373
That's right.

140
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:55,325
This season, we've got veterans

141
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,444
versus newcomers.

142
00:05:57,478 --> 00:05:59,012
Ohh.

143
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:01,064
That's... great.

144
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,783
We have RJ, Tate,

145
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:07,320
Miranda, Frank, Laura, Alana...

146
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:08,622
Ooh, girl.

147
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:10,657
Eric, and Roy.

148
00:06:10,691 --> 00:06:13,359
Well, why don't you
go stand now

149
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:14,995
with your fellow competitors?

150
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,496
- Oh.
- Hello.

151
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:17,931
- Hi.
- Welcome.

152
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,233
The old-timers walk in,

153
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:22,435
and I'm actually
not too nervous.

154
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,870
I'm confident in my abilities,

155
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,105
and I think I'm gonna be

156
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,373
the next <i>Face Off</i> champion.

157
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:27,707
Now, you all know

158
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:29,192
that professional
movie makeup artists

159
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:32,045
create unforgettable characters

160
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,781
through their collaboration
with other creative departments.

161
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,534
But nowhere is this more true

162
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:41,020
than with the symbiotic union
of makeup and wardrobe.

163
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,490
And I have a few special guests
here with me tonight

164
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:44,925
who are perfect examples

165
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,260
of the extraordinary way
that costumes

166
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,362
can completely transform
a character.

167
00:06:49,397 --> 00:06:52,215
They are the stars
of SyFy's new series

168
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,833
<i>Heroes of Cosplay,</i>

169
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:56,102
which premieres tonight
after <i>Face Off.</i>

170
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:57,370
Thank you so much
for being here.

171
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,989
Thank you for having us.

172
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,073
So, Yaya,

173
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:01,391
you obviously know
what it takes

174
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:03,243
to make a head-to-toe
finished look,

175
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:05,729
but how important
is makeup to you?

176
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,897
Makeup is an intricate part
of costuming

177
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,483
because, in the end,
it is about the face.

178
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:11,618
If the makeup is well done,

179
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:13,253
it can transform a costume

180
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:14,354
into a character.

181
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:16,189
That's a great way to put it.

182
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,440
Thank you for being here.

183
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:18,758
Thank you.

184
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:22,562
So for your first
foundation challenge,

185
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:24,581
you'll be creating
an original character

186
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:27,033
inspired by one
of these costumed partygoers.

187
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:30,704
Now, this is your chance
to show off who you are

188
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:31,871
as an artist.

189
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,356
Today's winner
will receive immunity

190
00:07:33,391 --> 00:07:35,809
and cannot be eliminated
this week.

191
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:37,477
Winning immunity
straight out of the gate,

192
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,312
that would be
a big stress relief.

193
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:40,647
Before you make
your selections,

194
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,799
we gotta have a judge.

195
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,851
She's a screenwriter,
a producer,

196
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:47,654
and the director
of <i>Red Riding Hood,</i>

197
00:07:47,688 --> 00:07:50,156
<i>Lords of Dogtown,</i> and <i>Thirteen.</i>

198
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,959
She's also the most
commercially successful

199
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,761
female director of all time,

200
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:58,198
with the epic
vampire film <i>Twilight.</i>

201
00:07:58,232 --> 00:08:00,233
Please welcome
Catherine Hardwicke.

202
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:05,438
Oh, my God.

203
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:07,540
Catherine, thank you so much
for being here.

204
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:10,143
Thank you for having me.
It's super exciting.

205
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:14,114
Catherine Hardwicke
is such a great screenwriter

206
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:17,233
and director,
so I am blown away.

207
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:18,718
Your films have featured

208
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,453
some incredibly
iconic characters.

209
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:23,456
How important is that union
of makeup and wardrobe?

210
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:25,775
For me, it's important
because that's what helps

211
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,495
an actor really understand
who they're gonna be,

212
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,897
and that helps them
launch right into the film.

213
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:33,400
So I'm just interested to see
what you guys are gonna do.

214
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:35,068
All right, now,
you'll have only your kits

215
00:08:35,102 --> 00:08:37,821
and a few tables of supplies
to work with.

216
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:40,340
And you've got two hours
to complete your makeups.

217
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:43,126
Good luck, guys,
because your time starts...

218
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,144
now.

219
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,081
Ooh, girl.

220
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,299
Taking you.

221
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,251
I would like you, please.

222
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:52,402
- Cool.
- You and me. I'm Rick.

223
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:54,054
How you doing?

224
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:55,188
Have a seat.

225
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,506
Have you ever had
a prosthetic on before?

226
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,892
- Yeah.
- My name is Eric.

227
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:00,927
Out of all the veterans
coming back this season,

228
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,997
I'm the only contestant
from season four.

229
00:09:04,031 --> 00:09:06,032
I earned my way back
by winning the web series

230
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,734
<i>Face Off Redemption.</i>

231
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:10,236
It's a chance not everybody gets
to come back

232
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:11,905
and do this again,
and this time,

233
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,106
I am a stronger artist.

234
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,274
I know what I want,
and I'm 100% sure

235
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:15,975
that I know how to get there.

236
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:22,549
I'm thankful to come back
and show

237
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,983
what I've learned
over the year.

238
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,218
My name's Alana Rose,

239
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:28,138
and I was on <i>Face Off</i>
season three.

240
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:30,457
When I got eliminated,
I walked out of that stage,

241
00:09:30,491 --> 00:09:32,075
and I looked around,
and I just thought,

242
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,960
"This isn't over."

243
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:35,445
I never want to lose again.

244
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,230
I want to be
the winner of <i>Face Off.</i>

245
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:39,566
My character is gonna represent
a strong warrior

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,985
who's kicking ass
and taking names.

247
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:49,642
I picked his wardrobe
because he's jungle-oriented

248
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:50,943
and he had
a lot of skin exposed.

249
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,796
He also has this big cowl piece

250
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,280
that drapes across the back.

251
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:56,983
So I'm going with a tribal
hunter paint scheme,

252
00:09:57,017 --> 00:09:59,986
out for the hunt.

253
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,889
He'll look pretty old
and pretty scraggly, I hope.

254
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:04,774
I'm RJ, and I was a finalist

255
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:05,792
on season two of <i>Face Off.</i>

256
00:10:05,826 --> 00:10:08,027
To get that far and not win

257
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:09,362
was a little heartbreaking.

258
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,731
Last time, I was doing it
for my dad.

259
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:13,866
This time,
I'm doing it for my mom.

260
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:16,519
If I can win,
then I can help her retire.

261
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:19,405
I picked this soldier,
so I'm making him

262
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,941
this old, crusty general.

263
00:10:24,145 --> 00:10:25,845
I chose to go
with a matador character.

264
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,882
I'm turning him into the bull
that he's been fighting.

265
00:10:34,454 --> 00:10:36,723
I'm Tate.
I'm from season one, finalist.

266
00:10:36,757 --> 00:10:38,291
It was tough not winning,

267
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:39,659
but since I was on the show,

268
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,261
I've learned
a ridiculous amount,

269
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:43,530
and I think I can actually make
a run at that title.

270
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:45,131
I chose this model because

271
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,467
she had this amazing locket
that gave me an idea

272
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,601
about her character.

273
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:51,371
I'm doing a princess
who was stolen

274
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:52,705
from her wedding by a sorcerer.

275
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,307
The sorcerer then put
a curse on her

276
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,909
and took her heart out

277
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:58,911
and replaced it
with this poison locket.

278
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,046
My name is Roy.

279
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,447
I was on season three
of <i>Face Off,</i>

280
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:03,416
and I made it
almost to the finale.

281
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,051
I'm really excited for this
chance to come back

282
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:07,136
'cause I get to make
some really cool stuff again.

283
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,621
And I still got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

284
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:11,474
My model has this uniform on

285
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:12,859
that looks like
it's a caricature.

286
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:14,427
So I'm going
to accentuate his face

287
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,830
and then paint this same kind
of pattern into it

288
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,898
so it looks like he stepped
out of a comic book.

289
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,920
Guys, you have one hour left.

290
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:29,175
This character is

291
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,643
a phantom of the opera-like
thing.

292
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:32,612
He was involved
in this very bad accident,

293
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:35,131
which caused his face
to be all gruesome.

294
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:40,186
I'm Miranda, and I was
on season two of<i>Face Off.</i>

295
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:43,957
I was really lacking
mainly in self-confidence

296
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:45,224
the first time around,

297
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:47,226
but I know
that I am a good artist,

298
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:49,562
and I came back to show
what I felt I was capable of.

299
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:53,099
I picked a matador
from some different time.

300
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:56,736
So I decided to do a matador
from another planet.

301
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,775
I'm doing a version

302
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,912
of a very old
and dead Cleopatra.

303
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,353
My name is Frank.
I was on season one.

304
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,755
And I was eliminated too soon.

305
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,423
My character's a sorceress.

306
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,524
She's at a big party,

307
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,193
and she sees a guy
that she likes

308
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:21,277
making out with another girl.

309
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:22,996
So as the rage builds,

310
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,196
all the heat's forming
into her hand,

311
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:26,549
and she's gonna shoot
a fireball at him.

312
00:12:26,584 --> 00:12:28,051
Pow!

313
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,219
My dad was a big influence
for my career,

314
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:32,805
and he was--
he was a big cheerleader.

315
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,324
When I watched
how much of an ass

316
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:35,975
I made of myself
on the first season,

317
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,577
I know I let him down.

318
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:39,612
My dad passed away
almost a year ago.

319
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:41,564
So when this opportunity
came back up,

320
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,900
I said, "I have to do it
for dad."

321
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,753
I hope I can stick around
long enough this time.

322
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,225
My name is Laura.

323
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,561
I was a finalist
on season three.

324
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:57,931
Since <i>Face Off,</i>
I feel like I've grown

325
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,165
by leaps and bounds.

326
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,884
The character sort of looks
like a queen,

327
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:04,103
so I thought I'd make her
like a demon queen

328
00:13:04,138 --> 00:13:05,371
of some sort.

329
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:07,473
I am definitely not here
to play it safe.

330
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:10,226
I am here to show new things,

331
00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:12,278
but also some old things
with a new twist.

332
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,103
That is time.
Brushes down.

333
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,754
So time's up,
I look at my character,

334
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:23,990
and I'm really happy
with what I've put together.

335
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,125
Tell us about your creation
today.

336
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,276
She had this amazing locket,

337
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:30,296
and that gave me the idea
of evil sorcerer

338
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,597
was in love with her,
and he took her heart

339
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:33,466
and replaced it
with a poison locket.

340
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,800
Yes, and I like the hair.

341
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,002
I like what you did
with the hair,

342
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,470
and I like the brows.

343
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,571
They're just so haunting.

344
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:41,574
- Mm-hmm.
- Very interesting.

345
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:42,709
That's great.

346
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:44,260
My model had on--
has on this costume

347
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:45,278
that looks like a caricature.

348
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,080
- Uh-huh.
- And so I thought,

349
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:49,315
let's have him become
like a living caricature,

350
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,616
like he's just been pulled
out of the pages.

351
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:51,834
I love it.

352
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:53,286
It's kind of commedia dell'arte.

353
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,788
I think it's great how you
really carried it through.

354
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:56,789
Thank you very much.

355
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:59,192
Well, she had a costume on

356
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:00,443
that reminded me very much
of royalty,

357
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:02,078
but since it was so tattered,
I was like,

358
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:05,231
well, maybe she's
from a demon underworld.

359
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:06,899
I think you made a great choice

360
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,267
doing so much airbrush work

361
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:10,803
because it looks
quite finished and polished

362
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,405
and quite beautiful,

363
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:13,840
and the colors are stunning.

364
00:14:13,874 --> 00:14:16,242
I found this Egyptian outfit,

365
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:19,445
and then I applied
the forehead and the nose.

366
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,147
I think it brings
everything together.

367
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:25,584
I like your choice to make her
very creepy and old.

368
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:28,021
I was wondering
if you had thought of trying

369
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:29,856
to carry that
through to her hands.

370
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,074
That might have been nice
'cause you've made

371
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,026
so many sculptural shapes.

372
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,229
This is a hindu royal bride.

373
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:39,432
It's very simple
and very elegant,

374
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,869
and it really flows
with the costume.

375
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:44,771
This is Princess Natala,

376
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:47,290
and it is
her birthday party tonight.

377
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,425
I always like to keep
that girly feel

378
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,510
to my makeups.

379
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:51,878
I love the concept.

380
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:54,847
I'm interested in the design
of these ears

381
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:57,350
coming out of this
Marie Antoinette hairstyle.

382
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,986
I think that's
a very cool idea,

383
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,421
and I don't think
I've seen that before.

384
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,990
This is my guy.
He's a tribal warrior.

385
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:06,659
I chose really bold stripes
and natural colors

386
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,328
and then a harsh black
to really give it that pop.

387
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:10,463
I think it's interesting.

388
00:15:10,497 --> 00:15:13,066
To me, it's a little...

389
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,801
simplistic,
I would maybe even say.

390
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:16,436
- Okay.
- You know, I guess I,

391
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,106
you know, wanted to just
see it go further.

392
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,408
I can see what
Ms. Hardwicke is saying.

393
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:25,678
Uh, and it-- it's a little tough
to hear that criticism.

394
00:15:25,712 --> 00:15:27,513
I'm looking around,

395
00:15:27,548 --> 00:15:28,865
and there are

396
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:29,899
some really good makeups

397
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,184
in this room.

398
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:32,718
Some of these things
are amazing.

399
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:33,986
That's a big realization for me

400
00:15:34,004 --> 00:15:35,955
that I really need to improve,

401
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:36,956
'cause this competition

402
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,659
is gonna be really tough.

403
00:15:39,693 --> 00:15:41,461
Catherine, these guys made

404
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:43,896
quite a cast
of characters today.

405
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,198
Who created your top looks?

406
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:46,299
Everybody here did a great job,

407
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,001
but I do think
that the veterans

408
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,419
kind of kicked some butt today.

409
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:58,010
One of my top looks
was created by Tate.

410
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,696
He really did
an overall complete look,

411
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:02,148
top to bottom.

412
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:04,383
And I really liked
Roy's character.

413
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:06,219
It just turned into a sketch

414
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,354
and felt very immediate
and fresh

415
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:10,790
and really interesting.

416
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,325
And then, Laura,

417
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:14,594
yours was exquisite.

418
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:17,630
The colors were just dreamy
and gorgeous,

419
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:19,265
and the whole character
really came together.

420
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:20,800
Beautiful job.

421
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,085
All right, Catherine,
who is the winner

422
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,253
of today's challenge?

423
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:25,638
The winner is...

424
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:31,511
Coming up...

425
00:16:31,545 --> 00:16:33,162
- Is that gonna be okay?
- I'm sweating bullets.

426
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:34,197
The whole piece
could be ruined.

427
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:35,882
- Oh, God.
- Is that cracked?

428
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,583
I'm running out of time, and I
don't know what's gonna happen.

429
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:40,153
I'm truly impressed.

430
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:46,822
All right, Catherine,

431
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:49,524
who is the winner
of today's challenge?

432
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:51,093
The winner is...

433
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,650
Tate.

434
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,420
Wow.

435
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,804
I loved your makeup

436
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,123
because it was
an overall powerful concept.

437
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:08,644
She was scary,
the way she stared at us,

438
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,245
and the eyes and the brow
that you created--

439
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,380
It was beautiful.

440
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,415
I appreciate that.
Thank you very much.

441
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,883
Tate, congratulations.

442
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,952
As the winner
of this foundation challenge,

443
00:17:16,986 --> 00:17:18,687
you have won immunity

444
00:17:18,721 --> 00:17:19,855
and cannot be eliminated.

445
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,657
Fantastic.

446
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:22,991
Winning this first
foundation challenge--

447
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:24,092
it's awesome.

448
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,827
It puts me
on the top of the pack,

449
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,362
and that's where
I hope I'm gonna stay.

450
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,281
All right, guys,
it is time to check out

451
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,516
your new digs
and get some rest.

452
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,303
I have big things
in store for you tomorrow.

453
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:35,287
See you soon.

454
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,272
- Bye.
- Thank you.

455
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,575
Bye-bye, thank you.

456
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,416
- Oh, my God.
- Where's Edward Scissorhands?

457
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,917
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

458
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,303
From the second
I look at this house,

459
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,888
I'm completely blown away.

460
00:17:52,922 --> 00:17:54,289
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

461
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,445
The downstairs alone
is amazing.

462
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,568
We haven't even seen
our bedrooms yet.

463
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:07,803
Oh, wow.

464
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,171
- Yay!
- Gentlemen.

465
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:10,539
Oh.

466
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:13,775
All eight of us new people
are in one room.

467
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,876
Whoo!

468
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,078
I haven't slept in a bunk bed

469
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:17,346
for a long time.

470
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,398
What? You guys have, like, cool p--

471
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,750
Hey, look, it's my makeup.

472
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:22,918
We actually have photos

473
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:25,187
of some of the works
that the veterans did

474
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,655
in our room.

475
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,725
It's a little mind teaser.

476
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,461
<i>Face Off!</i>

477
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:50,929
- Ooh, it's foggy.
- Ooh.

478
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,214
How lovely.

479
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:54,049
The Academy Awards.

480
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,084
Yeah, it is the Oscar stage.

481
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,869
I walk into the Dolby Theatre.

482
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,688
This is a dream come true.

483
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,807
It's just a gorgeous theater.

484
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:03,375
You know, there's this
billowing of fog

485
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,659
all over the stage,

486
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,361
and we're like, okay,

487
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,464
something's gonna happen.

488
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:19,207
McKenzie actually rises
out of the floor.

489
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,242
Wow, what an awesome entrance.

490
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,679
Hey, guys.

491
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:26,581
Why don't you
come join me onstage?

492
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:27,616
- Yes, please.
- Wow.

493
00:19:29,318 --> 00:19:32,788
Awesome.

494
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:35,824
Welcome to the iconic
Dolby Theatre,

495
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,692
home of the Academy Awards.

496
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,796
I've brought you here today
because, with any luck,

497
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,598
this will be the beginning
of your own path

498
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,200
to Oscar gold.

499
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:47,636
For your first
spotlight challenge,

500
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,837
we're delving into the world

501
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,640
of hyper-stylized
fantasy films.

502
00:19:51,674 --> 00:19:52,941
Now, we've seen
some incredible creations

503
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:55,544
in everything
from <i>The Chronicles Of Narnia,</i>

504
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:58,013
<i>Pan's Labyrinth,</i> even <i>Avatar.</i>

505
00:19:58,047 --> 00:20:00,232
These Oscar-winning
fantasy epics

506
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,634
all evoke an emotional response

507
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:05,320
with distinct
and stunning visuals.

508
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:06,555
So with that in mind,

509
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:09,458
your spotlight challenge
is to create

510
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,259
original fantasy characters

511
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,929
that would live in their own
hyper-stylized world.

512
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,447
I like this one.

513
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,532
Fantasy is right up my alley.

514
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:18,767
I'm very excited,

515
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,836
and I'm ready to get to it.

516
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,273
This will also be
a team challenge.

517
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,942
Veterans versus newcomers.

518
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:31,913
I'm very terrified of the vets,

519
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,748
but I'm also excited
to show them what we can do

520
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:34,783
and to see what my team can do.

521
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,001
I don't know them at all.

522
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,586
But I think we're gonna rise
to the occasion,

523
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,703
and we're gonna give the vets

524
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,539
a run for their money.

525
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,390
Okay, now, each team
will create

526
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:44,226
five original
fantasy characters.

527
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,760
- Wow.
- Wow.

528
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:46,845
All right.

529
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,063
They are...

530
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,748
Ogre, Pixie,

531
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,917
Faun, Troll,

532
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,001
and Witch.

533
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:54,469
Holy cow.

534
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,037
Gonna be great.

535
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:57,672
Now, I've brought
a special guest

536
00:20:57,706 --> 00:20:59,674
to give you
some guidance today,

537
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,660
an Academy Award-winning
makeup artist

538
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:04,296
who has made his name
creating unforgettable looks

539
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,781
in films like
<i>The Amazing Spiderman,</i>

540
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:10,519
<i>Lemony Snicket's A Series</i>
<i>Of Unfortunate Events,</i>

541
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,621
and <i>Indiana Jones</i>
<i>And The Kingdom</i>

542
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:14,089
<i>Of The Crystal Skull.</i>

543
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:17,526
Please give a warm welcome
to Bill Corso.

544
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,195
Oh, my God!

545
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:23,448
Bill Corso inspired me
to do makeup,

546
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,068
so it's extremely
overwhelming for me.

547
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:28,603
I'm trying
to hold back my tears.

548
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,305
Hi, Bill. Thank you so much
for being here today.

549
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:31,690
Oh, my pleasure.
My pleasure.

550
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,008
Oh, my God.

551
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,292
So what does it take to create

552
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:35,844
an Oscar-worthy
fantasy makeup?

553
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,445
Collaboration
is very important.

554
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,914
When you see
Oscar-winning work,

555
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:40,582
it's because
everybody's been involved

556
00:21:40,616 --> 00:21:43,151
to raise the bar
to the highest possible level.

557
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:45,403
How can they make sure
that their characters

558
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:47,155
all look like
they belong together?

559
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:49,991
It's very important
that you find

560
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,159
a cohesive quality,

561
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,377
whether it be
textural palettes,

562
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,713
whether it be some sort
of visual motif

563
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:55,830
that carries through.

564
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:56,998
There's nothing worse
in a movie

565
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,433
than when characters feel
like they belong

566
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,467
in different movies.

567
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:00,835
That was some great advice.

568
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,970
Thank you so much
for being here today.

569
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:05,890
- Oh, my pleasure.
- Thank you, Bill.

570
00:22:05,942 --> 00:22:07,726
All right, why don't you guys
go check out the lab

571
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:08,743
and get started?

572
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,121
Aah!

573
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,392
Walking into the lab
for the first time

574
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,894
is absolutely amazing.

575
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,963
There is everything
you could possibly think

576
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,164
that you want to work with.

577
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:30,899
I've never been in a shop
this big before.

578
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,467
- It's like Christmas!
- I know.

579
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:33,568
I'm just so excited.

580
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,970
I just want to get
my hands dirty.

581
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,554
Walking through the lab

582
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:37,839
is really special for me.

583
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,708
It's like coming home.

584
00:22:39,742 --> 00:22:42,110
Wigs and wigs
and wigs and wigs.

585
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,850
One of the first things
that we have to do

586
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:50,819
is choose our models
from the life casts.

587
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,088
Yeah, I think that we got
exactly what we want.

588
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,624
And then it's time
to start our designs.

589
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:57,792
Essentially, then,
what we've got is

590
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,160
Scott and Sam doing the witch.

591
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,996
Lyma's doing the pixie,
Laney and Rick doing the faun,

592
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,197
Adolfo doing the troll,
and you guys are doing

593
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:03,365
the ogre, okay?

594
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,883
And, Adolfo and Lyma,
you're comfortable

595
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,052
having the character
all to yourself, right?

596
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:09,771
I'm a little nervous
that me and Adolfo

597
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,039
are the only newcomers

598
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:14,175
working on a complete character
by ourselves.

599
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,646
It's just
a little overwhelming.

600
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,347
You've come up
with a general concept,

601
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:20,749
so we need to come up
with, like,

602
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,467
what our-- our--
our world is.

603
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:25,136
It is a big challenge
to take eight artists

604
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:26,554
who don't know one another,

605
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:27,922
um, to create five characters

606
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,524
who all feel like
they're from the same world.

607
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:31,259
Here's what I would propose,
is that all these characters

608
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:33,561
are a member of, like,
some kind of a council,

609
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:35,430
and that there's something
incorporated into their makeups,

610
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,481
you know, like a tattoo--

611
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:38,233
How about a sacred stone

612
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:40,802
embedded into the skin somehow,
with light behind it?

613
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,370
There you go.
I like that.

614
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:44,372
Our team concept
is each character

615
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:46,374
is gonna be a member
of a high council

616
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:47,776
of their species,

617
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,377
and each one is gonna have
a gemstone

618
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:50,478
on their chest.

619
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,830
It brings them into a family.

620
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,348
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

621
00:23:53,382 --> 00:23:54,849
Of the characters,
the troll is the smallest.

622
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,501
- Is that correct?
- That's the shortest guy.

623
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,786
I came up with the concept

624
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,521
that the troll,
he's gonna be living

625
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:01,389
and working in the cave,

626
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:03,191
and he collect the stones
that goes

627
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:04,659
in the chests
of the characters.

628
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,112
The ogre is obviously
the bigger guy.

629
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:08,446
I think we get big
in the shoulders,

630
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:09,614
under the costume, though,

631
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,765
so we don't have to worry
about edges.

632
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,467
Our concept for the ogre

633
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:13,501
is kind of like a primate,

634
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,869
and he's going to walk

635
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:17,539
on these big, gnarly arms.

636
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,040
I was thinking
it would be cool if the mouth

637
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,558
was in the neck

638
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,060
so that you can open
and close the mouth...

639
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,344
- That would be really nice.
- ...with your head.

640
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,379
That would be great.

641
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:25,430
- You know.
- That would be great.

642
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,765
Both of you
are designing the ogre.

643
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,916
I'm working on the troll.

644
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,067
There's a lot
of powerhouse artists

645
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:30,568
in this group, so right away,

646
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,736
people are opening
their sketchbooks.

647
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,655
They have ideas
right off the bat.

648
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:34,689
I just had a great idea.

649
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,908
Make the witch without any eyes

650
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,243
and have her eyes
be in the eyes

651
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:39,661
in all the other creatures.

652
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,895
Oh, that's amazing.

653
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,197
So basically,
all of the creatures

654
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,198
are the witch's minions.

655
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,199
- Yes.
- Yeah.

656
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,366
I love it.
That's awesome.

657
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,367
- Done. Done.
- Nice.

658
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,469
I'll block out the cowl,

659
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:48,603
just so that we can start
playing with it.

660
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:49,670
Do you guys want
to start blocking out

661
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,106
- the hands and the feet?
- Yeah, sure.

662
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,476
Okay, cool.
Well, let's go.

663
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,944
We've only got
five hours today,

664
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,145
so it's very important for us

665
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,414
to bust out
some sculpts real quick.

666
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,766
You want to do the foot,
and I'll do the hand?

667
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:02,884
Yeah.
RJ and Frank and I

668
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,986
sort of spearhead
the ogre character.

669
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,988
RJ and Frank have
two different designs

670
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:07,989
for the ogre,

671
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:09,657
so we sort of integrate
the two.

672
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,159
So he has this little
kind of pinhead

673
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,495
and then these big arms
and big feet.

674
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:15,313
I got the--
the cowl formed.

675
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,564
I'm starting on the chest

676
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,399
so I can make sure
the muscles work together.

677
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,902
My cave trolls steal babies

678
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,337
and swallow them whole.

679
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:24,372
And that culminates
into these little

680
00:25:24,406 --> 00:25:25,774
placenta-like baby sacs.

681
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:28,810
You're an animal, Tate.
You're an animal.

682
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,079
That's what my wife tells me.

683
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,087
_

684
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,389
Laney and I decide
that we're gonna go

685
00:25:41,423 --> 00:25:42,807
with a lot of pieces

686
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,159
in order to pull
this character off--

687
00:25:44,193 --> 00:25:47,095
a face sculpt, ears, horns,

688
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,163
chest piece,

689
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:51,065
as well as
hand appliances and feet.

690
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,900
So I immediately start
with the face.

691
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,736
How big are the horns gonna be?

692
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,854
6-8 inches,

693
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:57,906
starting at about
a 2-inch diameter.

694
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,324
If we're going to start
sculpting today,

695
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,109
then we're all gonna need
the stone today.

696
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,379
So I sculpt very quickly
the gemstone

697
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:05,980
that each one is gonna have
on their chest.

698
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:07,215
So I'm gonna vacuform them now

699
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,050
so you guys can incorporate them
into the sculpts.

700
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,336
Awesome, okay.
Thank you, sweetheart.

701
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,788
I don't have time
to mold five pieces.

702
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:19,844
So I'm gonna use the vacuform
to create copies

703
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:23,832
for each person to use
in their makeups.

704
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,855
What do you think
about the idea

705
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,891
of making his hand
really elongated?

706
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,108
Yeah, that would be
really cool.

707
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:36,477
For the ogre,
I'm doing the head.

708
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,879
Eddie's gonna do the arm,
and we're trying

709
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:40,582
to bang these sculptures out
as fast as we can.

710
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:44,385
I'm working on the faun.

711
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,020
A faun is a creature that is

712
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:48,056
half goat, half human.

713
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,557
He is a woodland creature,

714
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:51,826
so his horns look
more like tree branches

715
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,596
so he blends in,
so kind of like camouflage.

716
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,536
It's difficult
looking across the room

717
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,622
at the veterans
and the wall of clay going up.

718
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:09,544
They are going big
right out of the gate.

719
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:10,645
Looking across,

720
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,848
that's a lot
of scale over there.

721
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:17,185
Everything's really big
on that side.

722
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,622
I'm concerned maybe we're
not going big enough,

723
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:23,258
and that's--
that's a morale sapper.

724
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:25,693
This could be
what sinks our ship.

725
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:35,483
It's day one of our
fantasy creature challenge,

726
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:38,552
and it's newcomers versus vets.

727
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:40,254
The vets are going big
right out of the gate,

728
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:42,223
and we are going for beautiful.

729
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:44,775
So we'll just have to see
if the judges like

730
00:27:44,826 --> 00:27:46,340
the direction we're taking.

731
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:48,242
_

732
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:49,803
_

733
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:51,732
Sweet.

734
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,139
Jeez, how are you gonna
mold that thing?

735
00:27:58,173 --> 00:27:59,840
Very carefully.

736
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,576
Roy's got this enormous,
complicated sculpture.

737
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:03,978
Because of that,
during the molding process,

738
00:28:04,012 --> 00:28:05,346
there's always a risk

739
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:06,814
because there's more things
that can go wrong.

740
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:07,882
Just gotta get the look right.

741
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,049
Yeah.

742
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,351
We both looked at this
and said this could be

743
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:11,819
either, like,
rusted iron or--

744
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:13,571
- I was thinking wood or stone.

745
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:15,156
Well, it could be wood too.
We love it.

746
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,157
Anyway, we'll mold it for you.

747
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:17,441
So that gives you
the time today

748
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,776
to start working on the basic
shape of your head.

749
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,161
- This one with water clay too.
- Yeah.

750
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:21,962
Lyma has got a piece
ready to mold.

751
00:28:21,997 --> 00:28:24,031
But she has a lot of pieces

752
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:26,200
and is working by herself
just like Adolfo.

753
00:28:26,234 --> 00:28:28,569
So Scott and I
are gonna be molding.

754
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:31,439
Once you are perfectly happy
with your sculpture,

755
00:28:31,473 --> 00:28:33,541
then it's time to start making
your mold.

756
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:36,377
We use a plaster-type product.

757
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:37,778
When that's fully cured,

758
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:39,747
that's where you put
your foam latex

759
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:40,981
or your silicone or whatever

760
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:43,551
that you want to make
your prosthetic out of.

761
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:48,322
Hey, are they making
a mold over there?

762
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:50,725
Yeah. They don't play around.

763
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:03,838
That's time, everybody!

764
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,673
Let's go home!

765
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:08,909
At the end of the first day,
I'm really surprised

766
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:09,910
'cause the new guys,
they've already got

767
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,295
a couple molds completed

768
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:12,713
and some pieces ready to mold

769
00:29:12,748 --> 00:29:13,914
for first thing in the morning.

770
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:14,899
It looks like they're
in better shape

771
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,133
than we are at the moment.

772
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:19,053
So I think us vets
should be very worried.

773
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:26,744
Whoo!

774
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,629
All right.

775
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:32,900
It's day two, and we've got
ten hours in the lab.

776
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:35,436
We have to finish
all of our sculptures today,

777
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,104
we've got to get
all of our molds made,

778
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:39,039
and we've got to open them up.

779
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:40,641
We've got to clean
all the clay out.

780
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:43,394
There's a lot of stuff
that has to be done.

781
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,948
I'm just getting a basic shape.

782
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,550
Then I'm gonna start pulling it
tight over the skin.

783
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,018
Sam and I have this concept

784
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,387
that the witch is ancient.

785
00:29:53,422 --> 00:29:57,291
Her clothes and her body
are fusing together.

786
00:29:57,325 --> 00:29:59,677
But we want to show
both beauty and age,

787
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,163
which is gonna be
a heck of a challenge.

788
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:03,864
I think we're doing awesome.

789
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:06,050
I think we're a good team.

790
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:12,339
I'd say her eyebrows
are gonna be

791
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:13,607
popping out right there.

792
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:15,709
- You think?
- Possibly, yeah.

793
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:17,578
Miranda and I
are doing the pixie,

794
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:19,246
and we want her to be
sexy and creepy,

795
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:20,915
have multiple sets of ears

796
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:22,783
and plates sculpted
into her head.

797
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:25,085
We need to make sure
that this cowl is flawless,

798
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,456
our face is flawless
and molded today.

799
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,640
I got a lot to do,

800
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:32,626
so I'm just gonna plow
forward on this.

801
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:39,934
Eric and I are really tackling

802
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,185
a lot of molds today.

803
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:43,270
My face, my cowl, Laura's cowl,

804
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:45,606
and then whatever else
people need help with.

805
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,413
Hey, guys.

806
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:54,398
We're here
for our first walkthrough.

807
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:55,399
Hi, everybody.

808
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,550
Hey.

809
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:57,585
How are you?

810
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:58,752
Mr. Westmore

811
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:00,804
is a very recognized
makeup artist.

812
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,807
It's so wonderful
to have him here,

813
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:06,760
and I'm looking forward
to hear what he has to say.

814
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:07,761
This is a pixie.

815
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:10,197
I'm working on having her face

816
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,932
very humanoid.

817
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,834
Now, in-- in looking
at your sculpture,

818
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:15,085
I'm seeing all
the little texture

819
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,203
you're getting there.

820
00:31:16,238 --> 00:31:17,705
I'm afraid
you're gonna lose that.

821
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:20,608
I would dig a little deeper
and be bold with it.

822
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:22,393
We're dealing in fantasy,
not subtle fantasy.

823
00:31:22,444 --> 00:31:23,444
- Okay.
- So you want to bring it out.

824
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:24,545
- Yeah.
- All right.

825
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:25,579
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

826
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,715
We are working
on the faun character.

827
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:29,517
We decided
not to go with texture

828
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:31,752
'cause we're gonna be doing
fur transfer.

829
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:33,621
Now, important
with the fur--

830
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:35,155
on your edges of it,

831
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:37,258
if you can lay a little bit
around the edge

832
00:31:37,292 --> 00:31:39,126
so it doesn't look
like a glove...

833
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,327
- Mm-hmm.
- Or it doesn't look like...

834
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:41,545
- There's a blend to it.
- A shawl or something.

835
00:31:41,596 --> 00:31:42,546
- Oh, yeah.
- Maybe trim it a little bit

836
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:43,697
so it blends into the arm.

837
00:31:43,732 --> 00:31:44,748
Doesn't look like a hair glove.

838
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,933
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

839
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,167
I'm working on the troll.

840
00:31:47,202 --> 00:31:48,936
He lives in a cave.
He works in the cave.

841
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,471
He only goes out at night

842
00:31:50,505 --> 00:31:52,706
to meet with the other people.

843
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:55,726
It's awfully human
back in here.

844
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,211
I think you ought to beef
your neck up a little bit

845
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:59,246
to give this-- the whole thing
more power.

846
00:31:59,281 --> 00:32:00,347
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

847
00:32:00,382 --> 00:32:01,498
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

848
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,484
- Looks nice.
- Mr. Westmore is right.

849
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:04,735
So I'm gonna do the changes.

850
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,420
But this is hard for me
because I'm almost done

851
00:32:06,454 --> 00:32:08,088
with the sculpture,
so the little time

852
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:10,474
that I have to mold
is even less now.

853
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:13,160
We are collectively
doing the witch,

854
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:16,230
which is the high priestess
of this entire council.

855
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:17,565
As far as the back
of the neck goes,

856
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,333
have you taken it down
far enough that the costume--

857
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,168
We're probably gonna take it
down a little more, yeah.

858
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:22,453
Yeah, make sure you get it
below the costume line.

859
00:32:22,504 --> 00:32:23,470
Yeah.

860
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:25,039
We're gonna extend the arms.

861
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,408
The actor's arms
will come down to the elbows

862
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:28,842
so that we can have, like,

863
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:30,177
- kind of a gorilla stance.
- Yeah.

864
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:32,546
And the mouth opening
that we created for the face

865
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:34,982
is below the neck
so that the actor is able to--

866
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:36,033
- Oh, I was gonna say--
- Oh, okay.

867
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,117
So it will be able to move.

868
00:32:37,152 --> 00:32:38,352
I would be concerned
with the mouth

869
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:39,353
if you didn't do that.

870
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:40,387
As opposed to just
hanging there--

871
00:32:40,422 --> 00:32:41,388
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

872
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:42,406
- All right.
- Good luck.

873
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:43,591
Thank you.
A real pleasure.

874
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,960
- I was given the witch.
- Okay.

875
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:47,328
And it's got a fusion

876
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:48,529
of a lot of different elements.

877
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:49,730
What is your purpose
with the back?

878
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:50,897
Are these supposed
to be fingers?

879
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:51,932
Yes.

880
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:53,183
Spikes have been done
many times.

881
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:54,184
Yeah.

882
00:32:54,235 --> 00:32:56,637
Doing fingers
is really different.

883
00:32:56,671 --> 00:32:59,406
I think that would impress
the judges tremendously.

884
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:00,741
The faun is actually
a wood creature.

885
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:02,275
- Okay.
- So it hides in the woods.

886
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:03,544
And so, instead of doing,
like, you know,

887
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:05,245
antlers, I decided to do, like,

888
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,647
like branches growing out.

889
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:08,849
Yep, instead
of symmetrical horns.

890
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:10,384
You may have to put
something down there

891
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:11,385
to keep them from bouncing.

892
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:12,720
Ours is the pixie,

893
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,588
and basically,
she wanders through the woods

894
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:16,390
when she's hunting
for lost stragglers

895
00:33:16,424 --> 00:33:17,591
that she can take into her lair

896
00:33:17,626 --> 00:33:19,560
and devour their souls.

897
00:33:19,594 --> 00:33:21,228
We want it to look
almost like a mohawk.

898
00:33:21,262 --> 00:33:23,330
If you're doing a mohawk,
poking the dreads in

899
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:24,665
might not be a bad idea,
'cause otherwise,

900
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:25,983
you're gonna glue it on,
you're gonna hate it,

901
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:27,117
and then you're gonna be
spending time

902
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:28,669
- trying to work the edge out.
- Thank you.

903
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:29,670
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

904
00:33:29,704 --> 00:33:30,938
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

905
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,172
Yay.

906
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:33,891
All right, guys,
it's all looking great.

907
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:35,559
Good luck tomorrow.

908
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,444
Thank you,
Westmore and Westmore.

909
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,581
Bye.

910
00:33:40,615 --> 00:33:41,582
Oh, hey.

911
00:33:41,616 --> 00:33:43,851
Good God.

912
00:33:43,885 --> 00:33:45,540
Got it?

913
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:49,757
We're all
in the mold room at once.

914
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:52,042
It's just madness,
sheer madness.

915
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:54,061
I'm climbing
on top of the table.

916
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:55,863
I'm molding my piece,
helping Adolfo.

917
00:33:55,897 --> 00:33:57,197
I'm reaching over molds.

918
00:33:57,232 --> 00:33:59,566
It's pretty intense.

919
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:00,750
Oh, my gosh.

920
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:02,764
_

921
00:34:02,765 --> 00:34:03,920
_

922
00:34:04,739 --> 00:34:06,073
I mean, that's pretty good.

923
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,074
- I would say get the--
- Yeah.

924
00:34:07,092 --> 00:34:08,258
The flange more.

925
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:09,943
Laura has this back piece
on her witch

926
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:11,545
that has these fingers
coming out of it.

927
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,414
Miranda gets the mold started,

928
00:34:13,448 --> 00:34:15,416
but she gets to the very edge
of the fingers...

929
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:17,786
_

930
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:19,787
_

931
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:22,172
Our splash coat is hardening
and cracking apart.

932
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:23,290
No, no, no, don't pull it off.

933
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:24,291
Is that gonna be okay?

934
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:25,943
This is a very important piece.

935
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:27,628
It's very important
to the aesthetic of the witch,

936
00:34:27,662 --> 00:34:29,163
and I don't want
to let Laura down.

937
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,297
Do you want to fix this?

938
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,398
Do you feel more comfortable
doing that?

939
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:32,883
Yeah.
I'm keeping a straight face,

940
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:34,868
but inside, I'm stressing out.

941
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:37,121
It's cracking,
and I'm sweating bullets.

942
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:38,639
I have to figure out
how to fix this now,

943
00:34:38,673 --> 00:34:40,674
or else our whole piece
could be ruined.

944
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,295
It's the second day of our
fantasy character challenge.

945
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,764
Miranda's molding Laura's
back piece for the witch,

946
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,425
the most powerful being
on this particular world.

947
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,826
_

948
00:34:56,936 --> 00:34:59,175
And our hemp
starts falling apart.

949
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:00,194
_

950
00:35:00,195 --> 00:35:01,395
_

951
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:02,406
_

952
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:04,009
I just say screw it,
it's now or never,

953
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:06,111
and I take that whole piece
of hemp,

954
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:08,380
and I just lay it
over the part that's cracking.

955
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:09,781
Here, we'll do this.

956
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,950
I'm scared it's gonna take away
some of the detail,

957
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,885
but it's not as bad as I thought
it was gonna be,

958
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,837
and I'm so happy
that it's worked out,

959
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:18,557
'cause I was very scared.

960
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,744
Anytime you have a mold
that has

961
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:23,996
that size of a head
with all these

962
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,063
little smaller pieces
going out,

963
00:35:25,098 --> 00:35:27,399
there's a chance
of it breaking.

964
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,734
I'm gonna hope for the best,
and I hope that

965
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:30,419
it doesn't break
when I open it.

966
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,970
Oh, my God.

967
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,839
Thank God.
It actually worked.

968
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:35,140
That's a miracle.

969
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,642
Roy's just awesome.

970
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:41,011
_

971
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:41,805
_

972
00:35:41,814 --> 00:35:42,998
I'm getting a little nervous.

973
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,733
It's time crunch,
and I'm pretty sure

974
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:46,948
my mold is ready to be opened.

975
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:51,289
Oh, God.

976
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:52,858
My mold is just--

977
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,526
Is that cracked?

978
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,144
This piece is cracked for sure.

979
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,363
I mean, this comes
all the way down through here.

980
00:35:58,398 --> 00:35:59,965
That's it.
It's done.

981
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:01,500
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to be,

982
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,569
like, the one leaving
the competition this soon.

983
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:07,105
But this is just going down.

984
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,640
Oh, God.

985
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:10,442
Yeah, I would--
I would not touch this

986
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:11,476
and deal with this
in the morning.

987
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:12,477
I have two options.

988
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:13,829
I need to either fix it

989
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,330
or just not use it,
and I don't want

990
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,832
to sacrifice the look
of the character

991
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,183
just because the mold cracked.

992
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,018
So I decide
to just reinforce it

993
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:23,789
and just wait overnight
to run the poly foam.

994
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:29,828
Here, can I see this thing
on you, Eddie?

995
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,096
I'm really excited
about the way

996
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,181
Eddie and I's casts came out.

997
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,332
I think that there's
a really good chance

998
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,358
of being in the top looks.

999
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,659
_

1000
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:38,887
Yeah, it fits you great, man.

1001
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:40,572
We certainly have
one of the strongest pieces,

1002
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:43,975
and I think it's gonna really
fit into this council.

1003
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,744
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1004
00:36:45,778 --> 00:36:47,813
- What's time?
- Five minutes!

1005
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:55,537
Whoop.

1006
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:04,229
That's time, guys!

1007
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,231
- Whew.
- By now, I'm just thinking

1008
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,066
there's so many things
that are going wrong,

1009
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,236
it's gonna take a lot of time
from my application day.

1010
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,139
It's just stressful.
It's just disappointing.

1011
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:27,519
Application day,
we have four hours to apply

1012
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:28,920
and one hour at last looks.

1013
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,123
Wow, this is a disaster.

1014
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,024
I look at my foam piece,
and I notice

1015
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,793
the cowl edges are
just all sorts of busted up.

1016
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:36,978
So I start trying
to patch it up,

1017
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:38,780
and it's definitely taking time
out of painting,

1018
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:40,148
and that's making me
a little anxious.

1019
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:42,300
A lot anxious.

1020
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:49,207
Hello, hello.

1021
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:50,742
- Good to see you.
- You too.

1022
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:52,294
It's really nice
to meet you, darling.

1023
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:53,628
- Nice to meet you too!
- I want to hug you.

1024
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:56,681
First thing I do is just run

1025
00:37:56,716 --> 00:37:58,083
straight to the molding room
and get my piece

1026
00:37:58,117 --> 00:37:59,651
because I have to run
in poly foam.

1027
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:01,086
I'm running out of time,

1028
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,921
and I don't know
what's gonna happen.

1029
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:06,908
My crew,
how's everybody feeling?

1030
00:38:06,943 --> 00:38:08,260
Nobody's answering.

1031
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,167
That looks terrible.

1032
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:16,751
It does right now,
but it won't when it's dried

1033
00:38:16,786 --> 00:38:17,836
and it's painted,
I promise you.

1034
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,380
All right, I got this.

1035
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,008
That looks awesome, man.

1036
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:24,059
Application day is going great.

1037
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,444
Eddie begins painting the arms,

1038
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,547
and we go for some very bold
color choices.

1039
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:32,918
If you could hold it up
for a second, that'd be great.

1040
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,070
- Here you go.
- Oh, that looks great.

1041
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,404
- That's awesome.
- Ahh, okay.

1042
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,774
Cool.

1043
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:41,459
Keep your eyes closed for me.

1044
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:42,661
This is--
might be a problem, though,

1045
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,929
how thin it is
around her mouth.

1046
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:45,430
It's crinkling.

1047
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:47,265
Our face has a bubble,

1048
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,217
and there is going to be
a gigantic edge on her lip

1049
00:38:49,268 --> 00:38:51,136
if we don't do something
about this now.

1050
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,312
Let's just rip it.

1051
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:53,606
_

1052
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:54,307
_

1053
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,057
I literally rip the mouth off.

1054
00:38:56,092 --> 00:38:57,309
It's a scary thing.

1055
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:59,044
I've never done this
to a prosthetic before.

1056
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:00,996
You're gonna have to bevel it
with scissors.

1057
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,081
You're gonna have to re-smooth
all that down.

1058
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:04,182
I'm getting nervous.

1059
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,183
She's like,
"Fear not, my friend.

1060
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,908
We have this."

1061
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,388
Two hours pass,

1062
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:12,724
and finally it's time
to open the mold.

1063
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:15,343
Come on, baby.

1064
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:18,980
I'm very concerned
because it's just stuck.

1065
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:20,937
It's just not working.

1066
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,587
So I'm looking around--

1067
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:27,399
Hey, guys,
can I have some help?

1068
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:31,197
Eddie and RJ come back
and start helping out.

1069
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,912
Damn.

1070
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:34,996
There it goes.

1071
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:36,748
We got it.

1072
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:37,749
Awesome.

1073
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:39,047
Cool.

1074
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:40,730
How's it looking?

1075
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:42,387
It's all broken.

1076
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:44,089
It's broken here and here,

1077
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:45,440
and it's all ripped.

1078
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:47,102
Motherfucker.

1079
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:48,393
I'm like, this is
not happening to me.

1080
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,722
I'm just gonna fix it
as much as I can.

1081
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:55,984
I should just airbrush it.

1082
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:57,902
No, it's much faster this way.

1083
00:39:57,936 --> 00:39:59,237
I promise you.

1084
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,622
You know, we have
two completely different

1085
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:01,706
painting techniques.

1086
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:03,408
He wants me to brush
a lot of things

1087
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,843
that I'd be more comfortable
airbrushing.

1088
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:06,628
Why don't we get
one of those big guns

1089
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,179
and just base her out
like that?

1090
00:40:08,214 --> 00:40:09,848
That's not even coverage.

1091
00:40:09,882 --> 00:40:11,066
So I just go in,
and I follow his lead,

1092
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,217
and I'm just watching the time.

1093
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:13,251
I'm thinking,

1094
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,686
we really need
to bang this out.

1095
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,853
What's that?

1096
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,372
- Pros-aide.
- For what?

1097
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:19,424
To cover the seal
so the color goes on

1098
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,792
a little better.

1099
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:22,594
That is not an issue right now.

1100
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,212
Look at the rest of this.

1101
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:26,097
I'm looking at it.
It's fine.

1102
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,432
It's not even close to fine.

1103
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,517
Oh, honey, please trust.

1104
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,304
We still have to apply
the crystal,

1105
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:33,305
the chest piece.

1106
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:34,656
It's not looking good.

1107
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:40,779
I feel like the clock
is just against me right now.

1108
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,515
Time is passing so fast,
it's just ridiculous.

1109
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:49,861
Ten minutes, gang.
Ten minutes left.

1110
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,589
Make sure everyone's got
their gemstones.

1111
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:54,381
Make sure everyone has theirs.

1112
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,728
I finally have
my two pieces applied.

1113
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:59,893
The edges are awful,
and there's no paint on him.

1114
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,352
That's time, everybody.
Let's go!

1115
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:09,040
I'm gonna have to, like,
paint all of it

1116
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,443
on final looks,
and it's just one hour.

1117
00:41:13,952 --> 00:41:14,916
Coming up...

1118
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,148
It's a beautiful, solid job.

1119
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,851
Something went horribly wrong
with this character.

1120
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:21,953
I find it hard
to get behind any decision

1121
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:23,630
you made...

1122
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,325
We get to last looks,
and at last looks, that's it.

1123
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,309
You get one hour,

1124
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,029
and that hour
goes by like that.

1125
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,797
Oh, those eyes.

1126
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:41,799
This is such a big gap
in between the eyes.

1127
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,369
I need a brown
that's not orange.

1128
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,570
Use this.

1129
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,705
Everybody else is dressed

1130
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,707
and half-painted,
and our model is naked.

1131
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:50,975
Where's the black?

1132
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,727
Maybe we put it
in the other box, Alana.

1133
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:54,061
Dude, I've checked
all the boxes.

1134
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:56,113
Just keep painting.

1135
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,951
_

1136
00:41:59,668 --> 00:42:01,018
The crystal's not there.

1137
00:42:01,053 --> 00:42:03,487
Look hard, man.
That's vitally important.

1138
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:04,689
Time's running out,

1139
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:06,590
and I can't find the stone.

1140
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:07,591
You're killing me.

1141
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:08,893
I have to let go

1142
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,696
and just continue
the paint job.

1143
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,064
We got 15 minutes.

1144
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:14,799
- Ugh.
- Uh...

1145
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,221
I'm trying to make
this creature come to life,

1146
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:21,522
but I'm running out of time,

1147
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:23,240
and the creature's not
looking good at all.

1148
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,981
- Time! That's it, guys!
- Whoo!

1149
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:33,334
There's no chance in hell
that I'm winning this challenge.

1150
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:34,986
I'm just praying
that somebody's...

1151
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,989
is worse than mine.

1152
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:52,136
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

1153
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,806
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

1154
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:59,410
Let me introduce you
to our panel of judges.

1155
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,412
First up, multi-talented
makeup effects artist

1156
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,130
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hey, guys, good to see you.

1157
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,348
- Hello, Glenn.
- Hi, Glenn.

1158
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:06,167
Our very own makeup legend

1159
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:07,385
Ms. Ve Neill.

1160
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:08,952
Welcome back for some of you,

1161
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,304
and hello, our newbies.

1162
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,355
- Hi.
- Hi.

1163
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,607
And creative
powerhouse designer

1164
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:14,959
- Neville Page.
- Hello, everyone.

1165
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:16,127
Hello, Neville.

1166
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:17,795
Now, this week, we pitted

1167
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:20,731
the veterans
against the newcomers.

1168
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:23,184
And for your first
spotlight challenge,

1169
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:24,535
each team was asked to create

1170
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:26,620
five original
fantasy characters

1171
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:29,957
that all live in the same
hyper-stylized world.

1172
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:32,209
First up, the veterans' work.

1173
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:58,069
The ogre runs out on stage,

1174
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,286
and I think he looks
really cool.

1175
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:00,771
There's obviously
some more finessing

1176
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,873
that could've been done,
but I think it's great.

1177
00:44:24,112 --> 00:44:25,246
I'm looking at my faun,

1178
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,563
and I like the profile.

1179
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:29,266
I like the color.

1180
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:31,364
I'm liking everything
about this makeup.

1181
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,191
My character looks so inhuman.

1182
00:44:54,226 --> 00:44:55,910
He's holding the baby,

1183
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,578
and it's something
out of one of my nightmares.

1184
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,430
It's perfect.

1185
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:20,434
Our pixie looks amazing,
considering an hour ago,

1186
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:21,769
she didn't look like anything.

1187
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,189
So Alana and I
are feeling really good.

1188
00:45:48,296 --> 00:45:50,347
My witch is acting very creepy,

1189
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:53,350
really embodying
this evil character,

1190
00:45:53,385 --> 00:45:55,986
so I'm excited to see what
the judges have to say.

1191
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,394
That is so cool.

1192
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,562
We have all
of these common elements.

1193
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:06,230
Our characters look like
they belong together

1194
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,566
on the same planet.

1195
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,001
And now let's take a look
at the newcomers' work.

1196
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:33,891
I think he's a cool character.

1197
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:36,477
I think ve especially
is gonna respond

1198
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:37,611
to this whimsical,

1199
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:38,896
henson-esque character
that we've made.

1200
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,080
I think that
she's really gonna get

1201
00:46:40,115 --> 00:46:42,766
a kick out of him.

1202
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:06,090
That faun is exactly
what I want to see.

1203
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:07,424
Beautiful, statuesque.

1204
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:10,060
Laney and I carried
our weight on the team.

1205
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:33,117
With the little paint
that he has,

1206
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:36,120
he looks like a pig,
as opposed to a troll.

1207
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:38,055
I just know I can do
so much better than this.

1208
00:47:57,976 --> 00:47:58,976
I feel so guilty

1209
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,378
that my character
is the only one

1210
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:02,713
without the stone.

1211
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,381
But it's still
a finished makeup

1212
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:06,450
that I like.

1213
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:26,970
From the distance,
the witch looks okay.

1214
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,439
But I'm afraid that up close,

1215
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:29,940
they're gonna see the flaws.

1216
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:32,976
I don't think we're gonna be
in the bottom looks.

1217
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:39,850
Now that I'm seeing our ogre

1218
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:41,485
with the rest of the group,

1219
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,020
I'm really worried
it might not be

1220
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:46,256
cohesive enough.

1221
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,828
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

1222
00:48:57,802 --> 00:48:58,836
Open your mouth.

1223
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:00,287
Quickly, like you're trying
to talk.

1224
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:02,207
Yeah.
That's it, huh?

1225
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,588
_

1226
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:06,128
_

1227
00:49:07,846 --> 00:49:09,196
- Great shape.
- Yeah, that's fantastic.

1228
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,448
But the front view is just
a big-nosed creature.

1229
00:49:14,586 --> 00:49:16,587
Can you open your mouth?

1230
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:17,588
This is a cool treatment,

1231
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,857
leaving this huge
negative space.

1232
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,828
It's really nice and precise

1233
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:26,663
in terms of the actual sculpt
work that's going on.

1234
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:28,593
_

1235
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:32,786
Can you turn around, please?

1236
00:49:32,821 --> 00:49:35,406
Oh, yeah, that's cool.
Fingers.

1237
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,543
Close your eyes.
I can-- Oh, yeah.

1238
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,912
There's so much space in there.

1239
00:49:44,616 --> 00:49:46,283
It's just really cool,

1240
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,367
the way the hair
is brought down.

1241
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,635
- Mm-hmm.
- I want to know

1242
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:49,820
if it's purposeful or not.
What do you think?

1243
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:51,188
- I hope it's purposeful...
- So do I.

1244
00:49:51,206 --> 00:49:55,025
- Because it looks really good.
- So do I.

1245
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,360
Wrinkle your face,
close your eyes,

1246
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:57,361
scrunch your brow.

1247
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:58,429
Man, oh, man.

1248
00:49:58,463 --> 00:49:59,496
They're just looking

1249
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:00,998
and touching and squishing.

1250
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:03,100
Uh-oh.

1251
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:04,435
Somebody's going home tonight,

1252
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:08,205
and there's a big chance
that it's me.

1253
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,441
What do you think
of tonight's designs?

1254
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:13,110
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

1255
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:16,316
Man, oh, man.

1256
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,384
They're just looking

1257
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:18,885
and touching and squishing.

1258
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,304
I'm just hoping,
please don't lift the shirt.

1259
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:23,023
Please don't lift the shirt.

1260
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:25,659
Uh-oh, massive leaking
and cratering.

1261
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:27,494
Oh, my God.

1262
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:30,864
Thanks.

1263
00:50:30,898 --> 00:50:32,799
I think the breast covers
are really good.

1264
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:35,168
It looks like it's a morph
between metal

1265
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,638
and something else.

1266
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:40,157
That's classic<i>Alien.</i>

1267
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:43,844
Can we see the other side?

1268
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:46,530
Looks like
two different paint jobs.

1269
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:47,547
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1270
00:50:54,455 --> 00:50:56,590
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations

1271
00:50:56,624 --> 00:50:57,991
and would like to speak
with some of you

1272
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:00,427
to find out more
about your work.

1273
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:04,064
Alana and Miranda, you're up.

1274
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,320
Could you begin by explaining

1275
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:12,789
the team concept to us?

1276
00:51:12,824 --> 00:51:14,107
We have our witch character,

1277
00:51:14,142 --> 00:51:15,642
who's the queen.

1278
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:18,245
Our witch is blind,
so the incorporation

1279
00:51:18,279 --> 00:51:19,613
of the eyes
in all the characters is,

1280
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:22,616
they're her eyes for her.

1281
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:24,684
Our specific character
is the pixie,

1282
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:26,553
so she wanders through these
woods at night and...

1283
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:27,754
Loiterers...

1284
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:29,222
- Stragglers.
- Lost stragglers,

1285
00:51:29,257 --> 00:51:30,857
like a moth to the flame.

1286
00:51:30,892 --> 00:51:33,093
It's really wonderfully done.

1287
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:34,861
I'm truly impressed
with the subtlety

1288
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:36,329
of the appliances--

1289
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:37,697
They're not too thick--

1290
00:51:37,732 --> 00:51:39,349
and the multi-tiered ears.

1291
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:41,718
I think that's
a great design concept.

1292
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,970
Thank you so much.

1293
00:51:45,106 --> 00:51:46,239
Who did what on your character?

1294
00:51:46,274 --> 00:51:48,642
I sculpted the cowl.
Alana sculpted the face.

1295
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:50,643
Alana did the awesome hair work

1296
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:53,413
while I worked on the headpiece
with the paint job.

1297
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,882
All in all, I think
this makeup's really nice.

1298
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:57,384
You got everything painted.

1299
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:59,402
You have texture
all over her body.

1300
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,104
I think it's great.

1301
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:04,291
She is cohesive
in so many ways,

1302
00:52:04,325 --> 00:52:07,861
from concept, execution,
the palette.

1303
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:10,297
It's a beautiful, solid job.

1304
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:12,299
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1305
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,467
Ladies, thank you very much.
Please step back.

1306
00:52:14,502 --> 00:52:16,903
Thank you, lovely.

1307
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:18,104
Good job, girls.

1308
00:52:18,122 --> 00:52:19,739
Good job.

1309
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:22,642
Tolin and Eddie, you're next.

1310
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:30,517
Tell me what your team's
overall concept was.

1311
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:31,985
All of these characters
have come

1312
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:34,721
from different regions
of the planet Telesis 5

1313
00:52:34,755 --> 00:52:37,073
to form a high council.

1314
00:52:37,108 --> 00:52:38,859
This illuminated crystal
is a symbol

1315
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:39,860
of this high council.

1316
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:41,194
Who was in charge of doing

1317
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:42,529
this particular character?

1318
00:52:42,563 --> 00:52:43,630
I sculpted the head.

1319
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:44,931
Eddie sculpted the hands.

1320
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:46,983
And we both fought
the uphill battle

1321
00:52:47,018 --> 00:52:49,803
of trying to get
those eye edges down.

1322
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:52,205
His proportions
are so off to me.

1323
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,373
I think something went
horribly wrong

1324
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:55,542
with this character.

1325
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:57,878
His shoulders aren't
big enough to carry

1326
00:52:57,912 --> 00:52:59,112
that head and those arms.

1327
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:01,514
He should have had much more
girth across here

1328
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:02,883
to support
all these other things

1329
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:04,501
that he has going on.

1330
00:53:04,552 --> 00:53:05,835
I think that, proportionally,

1331
00:53:05,887 --> 00:53:08,138
when he's in a primate position,
I feel like--

1332
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:09,956
I don't know if that changes
anything for you,

1333
00:53:09,974 --> 00:53:11,975
but it--
it kind of does for me.

1334
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:14,060
He just looks like a blob
with a big head on top

1335
00:53:14,095 --> 00:53:15,328
when he's down there like that.

1336
00:53:15,363 --> 00:53:16,930
I hate to hear that.

1337
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:18,565
I find it so substandard

1338
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,000
on so many levels,

1339
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:22,068
sculpturally being
the biggest one.

1340
00:53:22,103 --> 00:53:23,837
It does not have any finesse

1341
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:24,971
nor surfacing.

1342
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:27,807
It's just a static rubber head.

1343
00:53:27,842 --> 00:53:30,327
Ouch.

1344
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:32,362
How do you two think
that came out?

1345
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:33,597
Not that bad.

1346
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:37,317
I would've given us a 7 1/2.

1347
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:39,185
That's what scares me.

1348
00:53:39,203 --> 00:53:41,655
Sculpturally, the fact
that I can stick a finger

1349
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:45,125
in between the edge
of that foam and his brow--

1350
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,693
- Yeah, that was horrible.
- I find it hard

1351
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:48,929
to get behind any decision
you made

1352
00:53:48,963 --> 00:53:52,132
with this makeup at all.

1353
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:54,467
- Gentlemen, please step back.
- Thanks, guys.

1354
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:56,553
Thank you.

1355
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:03,460
Frank, RJ, and Eric.

1356
00:54:09,784 --> 00:54:11,151
Specifically to this character,

1357
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:12,886
what's the concept about?

1358
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,889
He is the guardian
for the witch.

1359
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,691
I came up with the idea
that it should be

1360
00:54:17,725 --> 00:54:20,460
like a big, heavy thing
with a knuckle-dragger,

1361
00:54:20,494 --> 00:54:21,661
like a gorilla.

1362
00:54:21,696 --> 00:54:22,662
So who did what?

1363
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:24,431
Well, I sculpted the head

1364
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:25,982
and the face.

1365
00:54:26,017 --> 00:54:27,984
RJ sculpted the hands,

1366
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:29,969
and Eric sculpted the feet.

1367
00:54:29,987 --> 00:54:31,938
Always for me,
the most important thing

1368
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:34,040
is the overall silhouette,
the balance,

1369
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:35,475
the proportion of something.

1370
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:37,711
Sadly, that's where
this just screams,

1371
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:40,947
"disproportionate."

1372
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:42,248
It would seem to me
that there would've been

1373
00:54:42,283 --> 00:54:44,617
an opportunity to stop and say,

1374
00:54:44,635 --> 00:54:45,752
legs and feet
getting way too big,

1375
00:54:45,786 --> 00:54:47,137
or head is too small.

1376
00:54:47,171 --> 00:54:50,023
That being said,
I think independently

1377
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:51,257
there are some good moments.

1378
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:53,259
It's just the proportion
and the overall concept

1379
00:54:53,294 --> 00:54:57,764
is just not very appealing
nor interesting.

1380
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:00,200
My initial reaction to this

1381
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:02,602
is that the whole body
is missing.

1382
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,855
It's hands and feet and head

1383
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:07,340
covered with a blanket.

1384
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:08,941
The basic mistakes
are what haunt me--

1385
00:55:08,959 --> 00:55:11,111
the static mouth,
which every one of you

1386
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,430
has heard me
complain about sometime.

1387
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:14,597
I just expected more,

1388
00:55:14,632 --> 00:55:17,584
is what it boils down to.

1389
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:18,985
- Please step back.
- Thank you, guys.

1390
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,920
Thank you, guys.

1391
00:55:24,665 --> 00:55:26,256
_

1392
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,129
Rick and Laney, you're up.

1393
00:55:35,803 --> 00:55:37,103
Please explain to me

1394
00:55:37,138 --> 00:55:38,805
who did what on your character

1395
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:40,540
and what your premise was.

1396
00:55:40,574 --> 00:55:43,410
We went with the disheveled
woodland creature.

1397
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:44,611
I did the sculpting
on the face,

1398
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:46,346
the ears, and the horns,

1399
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,765
and she did the sculpting
on the chest piece,

1400
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,934
the hands, and the feet.

1401
00:55:50,985 --> 00:55:52,635
And who did the painting
on the face?

1402
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,104
- I did.
- Well, I gotta tell you,

1403
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:55,955
I really like this faun.

1404
00:55:58,476 --> 00:56:00,193
I'm a little concerned
about the paint on the stomach.

1405
00:56:00,227 --> 00:56:01,344
That's the only thing
that bothers me,

1406
00:56:01,378 --> 00:56:02,429
'cause it's kind of like

1407
00:56:02,463 --> 00:56:03,730
there's no rhyme
nor reason to it.

1408
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:06,032
But I love the way
it all comes together.

1409
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:07,700
Everything looks great
to me on this.

1410
00:56:07,735 --> 00:56:09,936
- Thank you.
- Whew.

1411
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:10,987
Whose decision was it

1412
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:13,440
to pull the hair
down across the face?

1413
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:14,858
That was mine.

1414
00:56:14,892 --> 00:56:16,476
We wanted her to have
a smooth face,

1415
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,978
not much texture,
so I could put hair on her.

1416
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:20,196
Brilliant stroke

1417
00:56:20,247 --> 00:56:23,016
because it really helps
with the treatment

1418
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,984
of the nose,
which I think is quite clever,

1419
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:27,687
because you've maintained
not only the humanity,

1420
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:30,356
but also the feminine aspect
of this character.

1421
00:56:30,391 --> 00:56:31,458
Well done.

1422
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:32,459
Thank you so much.

1423
00:56:32,493 --> 00:56:33,626
All of you, thank you.

1424
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,662
Rick and Laney,
please step back.

1425
00:56:38,866 --> 00:56:41,234
Great, great job.

1426
00:56:41,268 --> 00:56:43,970
Adolfo, you're next.

1427
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,677
So tell us about the concept

1428
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,579
of this guy specifically.

1429
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:53,880
He works in a mine.

1430
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:55,949
He's in charge
of just collecting the stones.

1431
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:58,151
I had a lot of problems
with the cowl--

1432
00:56:58,169 --> 00:57:00,153
specifically, taking it
out of the mold,

1433
00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:01,254
my mold broke.

1434
00:57:01,288 --> 00:57:02,489
I-I get all that.

1435
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:05,692
Because you only focused
on the head,

1436
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:08,077
you have an opportunity
to really showcase

1437
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:10,413
the sculpt, application,
and the paint.

1438
00:57:10,464 --> 00:57:14,350
And none of those,
especially the sculpt,

1439
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:17,253
work at all.

1440
00:57:17,288 --> 00:57:20,006
There's nothing
about the facial anatomy

1441
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,209
that rings true
of it being humanoid.

1442
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:26,813
It's got all the features
of human characteristics

1443
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:30,116
but no sense of prowess
on your behalf

1444
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:31,784
to be able to execute that.

1445
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:33,319
I agree.

1446
00:57:33,354 --> 00:57:36,722
My main issue with this
is not only the sculpture,

1447
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,242
but you didn't even put
a good paint job on it.

1448
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:41,244
You can take a crappy appliance

1449
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:42,962
and turn it into something
halfway decent

1450
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:45,081
if you put a really good
paint job on it.

1451
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:46,633
I want to applaud
your willingness

1452
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,251
to go it on your own
when you're in a competition

1453
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:50,803
against people
that have been here before.

1454
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:52,672
So I think that's worthy
of note.

1455
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:55,642
- Thank you.
- Adolfo, please step back.

1456
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:06,769
Laura, please step forward.

1457
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,858
Hey, girl.

1458
00:58:12,877 --> 00:58:15,762
Start by giving us
an explanation of the character

1459
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:16,863
and its story, please.

1460
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:18,281
My concept going in was that

1461
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,750
she's gathering her strength
from people that she ate.

1462
00:58:20,784 --> 00:58:22,085
The people
that she was consuming

1463
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:23,086
were trying to get out,

1464
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,038
and these things
are actually fingers

1465
00:58:25,072 --> 00:58:26,706
coming out from the back.

1466
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,107
I dig it a lot.

1467
00:58:28,142 --> 00:58:29,392
Thank you.
Thank you.

1468
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:30,827
You are presenting something

1469
00:58:30,861 --> 00:58:32,345
that's completely fresh.

1470
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:34,264
It's not what I've seen
from you before.

1471
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:37,000
And that is testament
to the depth

1472
00:58:37,034 --> 00:58:38,318
of your design capabilities.

1473
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:40,954
I think the design
is really interesting.

1474
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:42,822
I am, however,
really disappointed

1475
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,991
in your paint job on your face.

1476
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:46,192
This is so beautifully painted,

1477
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:47,744
and if that would have just
been traveled

1478
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:48,878
right up onto the face,

1479
00:58:48,913 --> 00:58:51,197
it would have been
really exquisite.

1480
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:52,799
- I totally, totally agree.
- But, I mean,

1481
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,501
the costuming, everything else
is just beautiful.

1482
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:56,903
Thank you.

1483
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:59,372
- Laura, please step back.
- Thank you.

1484
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:04,627
All right, thank you, guys.

1485
00:59:04,662 --> 00:59:06,312
Please head backstage
so the judges

1486
00:59:06,347 --> 00:59:07,680
can make their decisions.

1487
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:08,982
Thank you.

1488
00:59:09,016 --> 00:59:10,717
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you, guys.

1489
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:16,589
All right, judges,
why don't we start

1490
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:17,857
with Alana and Miranda?

1491
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:19,192
It focused on the face.

1492
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:20,510
Nothing was a distraction.

1493
00:59:20,544 --> 00:59:22,395
The treatment of the ears
and the jaw line

1494
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:24,130
is absolutely gorgeous.

1495
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:27,166
Miranda's got incredible
precision to her sculpting.

1496
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:29,969
That cowl piece
was quite impressive.

1497
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:31,638
All right, let's move on
to Rick and Laney.

1498
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:33,239
What are your thoughts?

1499
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:35,391
I love that makeup.

1500
00:59:35,442 --> 00:59:37,143
The fur coming
down onto the face

1501
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:39,362
and then that shattered
pixie hair--

1502
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:41,314
I thought it was fabulous.

1503
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:42,448
And what a success.

1504
00:59:42,483 --> 00:59:43,599
They're competing immediately

1505
00:59:43,651 --> 00:59:45,101
against people
that have been here before.

1506
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,919
- Yeah.
- Let's move on to Laura.

1507
00:59:46,954 --> 00:59:47,937
Well, as usual,

1508
00:59:47,988 --> 00:59:50,323
she did a really
amazing design.

1509
00:59:50,357 --> 00:59:51,924
She let herself go
technically a little bit

1510
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:55,028
in order to present
this massive amount of work.

1511
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:56,496
What she was doing
with those horns

1512
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,798
and that transition
down into the forehead

1513
00:59:58,832 --> 01:00:00,033
was beautiful.

1514
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:03,536
Okay, let's move on
to Tolin and Eddie.

1515
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,288
It looked like
a papier-mache sculpt.

1516
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:08,091
Regardless of who did
the actual sculpting,

1517
01:00:08,142 --> 01:00:10,176
just the concept
was so substandard.

1518
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,711
And Tolin couldn't see

1519
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:13,379
that there was something
wrong with it.

1520
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:14,380
I'm bewildered by the fact

1521
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:16,516
that he does not
readily acknowledge

1522
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,735
that things went wrong
for him this week.

1523
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:22,388
Okay, let's move on
to Frank, RJ, and Eric.

1524
01:00:22,423 --> 01:00:24,857
I didn't understand
why they couldn't see

1525
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:27,426
at the onset
this huge disparity

1526
01:00:27,444 --> 01:00:28,594
with proportion.

1527
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:31,614
Or why the torso
was covered in a tarp

1528
01:00:31,648 --> 01:00:32,832
with a rope tied around it.

1529
01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:34,133
I was disappointed.

1530
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:36,869
All right, let's talk
about Adolfo.

1531
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:38,371
There was a lot of things
he could have done

1532
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:39,806
to really beef up that makeup.

1533
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,974
If you have a problem,
figure out a way to cover it up.

1534
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:43,743
He's very inexperienced,
but I think

1535
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:45,545
he really wants to be better...

1536
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:46,979
- Sure.
- ...than what he did this week.

1537
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:49,582
But the point
still doesn't change.

1538
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:52,635
That was a substandard sculpt
with no character.

1539
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:54,237
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

1540
01:00:54,288 --> 01:00:56,305
Have you made your decisions?

1541
01:00:56,357 --> 01:00:57,590
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1542
01:00:57,608 --> 01:01:00,259
Okay, let's bring them
back out.

1543
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:12,038
So, Glenn, which team
came out on top?

1544
01:01:12,072 --> 01:01:13,940
The veterans or the newcomers?

1545
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:16,743
The top team tonight is...

1546
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:27,573
So, Glenn, which team
came out on top?

1547
01:01:27,608 --> 01:01:29,492
The veterans or the newcomers?

1548
01:01:29,526 --> 01:01:31,777
The top team tonight...

1549
01:01:34,147 --> 01:01:35,247
is the veterans.

1550
01:01:35,282 --> 01:01:36,515
Yeah, buddy.

1551
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:38,918
Congratulations, guys.

1552
01:01:38,952 --> 01:01:40,786
Not only did you guys have

1553
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:43,823
a really great grouping
of characters tonight,

1554
01:01:43,857 --> 01:01:45,691
but it really seemed
like they belonged together.

1555
01:01:45,726 --> 01:01:46,692
Congratulations.

1556
01:01:46,727 --> 01:01:48,194
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1557
01:01:48,228 --> 01:01:50,229
Okay, who is the winner
of this challenge?

1558
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:55,951
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

1559
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,453
Miranda.

1560
01:01:57,504 --> 01:01:59,505
- Hey, girl.
- Yeah!

1561
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:03,242
Whoo!

1562
01:02:03,276 --> 01:02:04,877
The pixie
was a great character,

1563
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:07,780
but our favorite part
was the cowl sculpture

1564
01:02:07,814 --> 01:02:09,649
and the paint job.
Well done.

1565
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:11,283
Thank you so much, you guys.

1566
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:12,885
Just so exciting
to come right out

1567
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:14,970
and win
the very first challenge.

1568
01:02:15,005 --> 01:02:17,122
It's gonna give me confidence
and a motivation

1569
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,791
that I never had before.

1570
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:20,126
Congratulations.

1571
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,827
You and the rest
of the veterans

1572
01:02:21,861 --> 01:02:23,479
can head backstage.

1573
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,914
- Thank you, guys.
- Whoo, Miranda!

1574
01:02:24,965 --> 01:02:27,199
I can't believe that!

1575
01:02:31,338 --> 01:02:32,855
Unfortunately, that means,
newcomers,

1576
01:02:32,906 --> 01:02:35,908
you are the losing team
this week.

1577
01:02:35,942 --> 01:02:38,277
Rick, Laney, Lyma,

1578
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:40,846
Scott, Sam,

1579
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:44,617
you are all safe
and can head backstage.

1580
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:46,352
That means the rest of you

1581
01:02:46,386 --> 01:02:47,703
are on the bottom this week,

1582
01:02:47,754 --> 01:02:51,090
and one of you
will be eliminated.

1583
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:52,091
Please step forward.

1584
01:02:57,034 --> 01:03:00,156
So Glenn, tell us about
the bottom artists.

1585
01:03:00,434 --> 01:03:03,169
Eddie and Tolin,
your character's proportions

1586
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:04,570
were way off,

1587
01:03:04,604 --> 01:03:06,889
and he didn't feel
like he fit in

1588
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,174
with the rest of the group.

1589
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:11,310
Adolfo, we had a hard time
identifying

1590
01:03:11,344 --> 01:03:13,679
any anatomy in your sculpture,

1591
01:03:13,714 --> 01:03:16,749
and your paint job just
didn't have any life to it.

1592
01:03:16,783 --> 01:03:19,151
So who is going home tonight?

1593
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:20,820
The person going home
tonight is...

1594
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:28,194
Tolin.

1595
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:29,595
What we found disturbing

1596
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:31,263
was the lack of precision
and form

1597
01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:33,299
in your head sculpt.

1598
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:35,217
Well, thank you
for the opportunity, guys.

1599
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:37,536
It's been... insane.

1600
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:40,005
Tolin, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

1601
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,374
The rest of you are safe
and can head backstage.

1602
01:03:49,616 --> 01:03:51,434
Well, Tolin,
I'm sorry we won't get to see

1603
01:03:51,468 --> 01:03:52,435
any more of your work,

1604
01:03:52,469 --> 01:03:54,303
and we wish you the best
in your career.

1605
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:55,654
Thanks, guys.

1606
01:03:55,689 --> 01:03:57,323
Tolin, it's been great
having you here with us.

1607
01:03:57,357 --> 01:04:00,726
Will you please head backstage
and pack up your kit?

1608
01:04:00,761 --> 01:04:03,429
Thanks, McKenzie.

1609
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:07,032
Getting eliminated first sucks.

1610
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,350
This guy.

1611
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:09,702
I felt like I was
in a good position

1612
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:10,970
to take it all the way.

1613
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:12,004
You guys are awesome,

1614
01:04:12,038 --> 01:04:13,939
and I hope I get to see
everyone again.

1615
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:15,808
I feel badly
I wasn't able to show

1616
01:04:15,842 --> 01:04:18,043
a greater breadth of work,

1617
01:04:18,078 --> 01:04:20,579
but this is the field
that I was meant to be in.

1618
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:21,630
I don't have any doubts

1619
01:04:21,665 --> 01:04:22,748
about my ability as an artist.

1620
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:24,049
I think I did the best work

1621
01:04:24,084 --> 01:04:25,751
that I was capable of,

1622
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:27,432
and that's all
that anybody can ask.
