1
00:00:01,685 --> 00:00:03,652
I love this makeup.

2
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:06,288
It's-- it's a stunning makeup.
You did a great job.

3
00:00:06,322 --> 00:00:10,058
It is so good.
This is camera-ready.

4
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,700
Tonight, the all-time
best makeups

5
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:21,703
ever featured on <i>Face Off.</i>

6
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:33,080
Throughout five amazing seasons,

7
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:37,418
60 talented artists have created
nearly 700 works of living art.

8
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:42,289
From cyborgs to
extraterrestrials...

9
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,360
and underwater creatures
to things

10
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:50,631
that go bump in the night,

11
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:52,333
our judges have seen it all--

12
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:56,803
Ve Neill, Glenn Hetrick,
and Neville Page.

13
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,239
I'm really blown away.

14
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:00,874
Now, they'll count down
their personal favorites,

15
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:02,910
and you don't want
to miss number one.

16
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:09,249
There will be lots of awesome,
bitchin', and groovy.

17
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:12,019
And creations that
almost defy description.

18
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:16,122
This one is focused, myopic,
truly deranged.

19
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,191
What? Oh, man.

20
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,863
We'll hear from our judges
like never before...

21
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:25,031
Is that you laughing?

22
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:27,100
- It is.
- Wow!

23
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:30,841

28
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:55,294
We kick off the countdown with
an eye-popping makeup

29
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:59,131
from <i>Face Off's</i> season five
champion, Laura.

30
00:01:59,165 --> 00:02:03,602
Number 20 on our list shows off
her artist within.

31
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:07,271
The challenge was
to bring Classic art to life,

32
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,307
and Laura had chosen Cubism.

33
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,579
I loved it,
Laura's Cubism piece.

34
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:17,181
She really dialed it in
perfectly.

35
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,183
The colors were amazing.

36
00:02:19,218 --> 00:02:21,452
The fact that she fabricated
on top of the suit,

37
00:02:21,487 --> 00:02:23,721
and the construction on the back
of the head,

38
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:25,523
it was just so well done.

39
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:26,957
Laura's Cubism makeup is

40
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:30,694
a perfect synthesis of sculpture
and fabrication.

41
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,163
I feel like Cubism was created

42
00:02:32,197 --> 00:02:35,466
because people wanted
to transcend 2-D art.

43
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,568
Cubism is three-dimensional
squares.

44
00:02:37,603 --> 00:02:38,969
You can't think of this as
a makeup.

45
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,071
You have to think of this as
a work of art.

46
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:43,841
One of the things that you see
Laura demonstrating here is

47
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:47,678
her uncanny ability
to do hard color transition.

48
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:50,114
- Amazing paint job.
- It really is.

49
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:53,751
There's so many colors on the
thing, and at no point do they

50
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,386
slam against one another
in an obtuse way.

51
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,554
They just flow.

52
00:02:57,588 --> 00:03:00,990
It was so asymmetrical
and so well developed.

53
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:04,761
Just the whole Cubism idea
was just so well put together.

54
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:06,863
The face that she designed
and sculpted

55
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,932
really looked like
it was trapped

56
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,468
within a moment of Cubism.

57
00:03:11,502 --> 00:03:13,235
This is an immaculate makeup.

58
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,671
Stunning job.

59
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:17,306
Everything they said,
times ten.

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,607
You perfectly met
this challenge

61
00:03:18,642 --> 00:03:22,211
and integrated your movement.
It truly is living art.

62
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,380
My Ve rating, two bitchin's.

63
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:27,349
From avant-garde art
to strange new worlds,

64
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:31,687
next is one of the best silicone
creations ever seen on <i>Face Off.</i>

65
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,189
Check out this elegant
extraterrestrial

66
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,924
that earned the number 19 spot.

67
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,793
All right, guys.
This is your chance

68
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,761
to do something literally out
of this world.

69
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:42,030
You will work in teams
of two and create

70
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:44,766
an alien species that
might actually exist on what

71
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,535
appears to be the first planet,
besides Earth,

72
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,705
capable of sustaining life.

73
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:55,343
Conor and Jo's alien
automatically feels like

74
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:56,912
it belongs to a world.

75
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,915
It, to me, was very reminiscent
of some of

76
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,018
the <i>Star Trek, Next Generation</i>
makeups that Mr. Westmore did.

77
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,621
This was our third episode
in our first season.

78
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,789
The thing that made it
so unique was the fact

79
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:12,059
that they used silicone,
which very few

80
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:14,562
makeup artists in
a starting-out period

81
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,698
of their career would attempt.

82
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:17,998
I would have guessed that they

83
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:20,534
bit off more than they can chew
taking this approach.

84
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,569
It doesn't seem like they should
have been able to do it

85
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:25,305
as quickly as they did,
but they did.

86
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,543
They really did far beyond
what we ever had expected.

87
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:32,012
This was an incredible makeup.

88
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:34,949
You did a beautiful job.
Congratulations.

89
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,317
- Thank you.
- It's got a great profile.

90
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:41,388
It's got a great level of detail
in terms of texturing,

91
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:43,257
and then one of
the most important things that

92
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,825
so many people forget to do
is graphic design

93
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,396
that nature does with stripes,
patterns, dots, what have you,

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,998
and this makeup encapsulates
all of that.

95
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:55,201
And this was only the third
episode for this makeup?

96
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:56,836
Damn.

97
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:58,571
Next, a makeup that added
royal flare

98
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,506
to the world of <i>Resident Evil.</i>

99
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,243
Number 18 on our countdown comes
from a competitor

100
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:06,679
who was a fan-favorite in season
three and again in season five.

101
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:11,950
Roy's red queen zombie is
a multi-layered beauty.

102
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,421
This was important for us
to see Roy do because

103
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:18,257
of his ability to fabricate,
be stellar, that--

104
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:20,626
We needed to see
a makeup from him.

105
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,662
He finally delivered.

106
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:27,565
This is the queen, and she's
been infected with a virus

107
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,901
and so she's starting to mutate.

108
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,903
It was a really great concept

109
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:33,272
that her flesh turned into
this crown.

110
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:34,940
And Roy, the fabrication king,

111
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:36,008
where did this come from,
from him?

112
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,876
I was totally blown away.

113
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:41,146
The character really feels
like it stepped out of

114
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:44,649
a <i>Resident Evil</i> or <i>Silent Hill,</i>
cutting-edge video game.

115
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:47,552
Paul WS Anderson was
so impressed with this makeup.

116
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:48,986
If I was making a movie,

117
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:51,088
I'd be delighted to see
a design like this,

118
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:53,758
but also I'd be expecting
a team of, like,

119
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:55,092
six or seven people
to execute it.

120
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,528
I think Paul was accurate,

121
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:59,530
saying that
it would take six people,

122
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:03,100
because Roy, everything he does
is the power of some multiple,

123
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:06,838
so unique in his ability

124
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:10,741
to pull off
the "un-pull-off-able."

125
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:14,111
Roy, we loved
your hyper-stylized queen,

126
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,546
and we thought that
you accomplished

127
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,682
an absolutely amazing amount of
work in the time that you had.

128
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,551
The winner is... Roy.

129
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:21,652
Thank you very much.

130
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:22,886
Thank you.

131
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,422
This is the best moment
I've had on the show.

132
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:28,726
My Ve rating
for Roy's queen is--

133
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,395
I'd have to give it, like,
at least three bitchin's.

134
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:33,864
Since our premier,
<i>Face Off</i>artists

135
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:38,601
have created 280 incredible
foundation challenge makeups.

136
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,570
One memorable creation
from season three

137
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:43,806
earned an artist her ticket back
into the competition.

138
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,508
That spectacular look is
the judges' pick

139
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:48,411
for the very best foundation
challenge makeup.

140
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:51,748
The best foundation challenge
goes to Nicole

141
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:53,082
for her Day Of The Dead makeup.

142
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,149
- They're back! They're back!
- Oh, my God.

143
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:55,651
Oh, my God!

144
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,689
The winner of today's
foundation challenge will

145
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:01,491
rejoin the cast and earn

146
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,559
another chance at winning
our grand prize.

147
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,528
It's the first glimmer of hope
that we see out of her.

148
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:10,266
She goes into that challenge and
really decides that she's going

149
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,068
to do better than
she was previously.

150
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:14,436
I'm thinking mariachi guy.

151
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,705
The first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna draw out

152
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:19,441
the shapes that I want,
and then go into the color.

153
00:07:19,475 --> 00:07:21,643
This is obviously
the best foundation challenge.

154
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:24,413
It was colorful.
They were at Olvera Street.

155
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:27,816
- It was really, really fun.
- It was precise.

156
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,250
It was beautiful.

157
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,953
It encapsulated all the things
that we recognize

158
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:33,021
as the Day Of The Dead makeup.

159
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,123
- This is really cool.
- Thank you.

160
00:07:35,157 --> 00:07:39,127
So, who is the winner
of today's foundation challenge?

161
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:40,929
Nicole.

162
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:43,298
Oh, my God!

163
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm back!

164
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:49,837
You first see Nicole working
at what her true level is

165
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,406
in that foundation challenge.

166
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,841
We just saw the best
foundation challenge makeup,

167
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:57,010
courtesy of our season three
champion, Nicole.

168
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:59,112
Now, let's check out one of
her signature makeups

169
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:01,214
that became an instant
audience favorite.

170
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:04,084
It's number 17 on our top 20.

171
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:06,420
Welcome to the junk yard.

172
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:08,756
This week's challenge is
to create

173
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,591
an original cyborg character.

174
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,592
- Oh, all right.
- Oh, my gosh!

175
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,793
Yay!
That's cool, yeah.

176
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,735
Nicole's cyborg is
a truly unique piece of art,

177
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,704
but at the same time, it really

178
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,573
had a lot of composite elements

179
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,407
from beloved science fiction
sources.

180
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:31,043
Also, Nicole managed
to integrate the piece

181
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,612
from the junkyard seamlessly.

182
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,348
It didn't feel obtuse
or glued on.

183
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,316
She used it to inspire her,

184
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,619
so when the whole thing was done
it didn't really feel

185
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,888
like that was an element that
was forced upon her,

186
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,889
or that it was requisite
to use it.

187
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,791
It felt very natural within
the build.

188
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,427
I want her to be basically
this, like, cyborg princess

189
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,630
from another planet.
Elegant and tough.

190
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,267
I have a mechanism on her eye
which has a-- all different types

191
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,837
of plugs, but, like, she can
hook herself up and, like,

192
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,372
through her eye, like, have
different types of,

193
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,640
like, way of seeing.

194
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,775
I thought that was one of
the coolest things

195
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,810
I'd seen on the show.

196
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,545
Gale Anne Hurd and I
both loved it.

197
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,280
It was elegant,
and it read cyborg to me.

198
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,483
It was real delicate
and real female-looking.

199
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,051
It didn't shout at you.

200
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,020
Everything looked really
beautiful.

201
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,188
I wanted to write
a story around it.

202
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,589
I mean, that's how inspiring
I think it was.

203
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,857
- Awesome.
- Wow.

204
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,461
The junkyard cyborg for Nicole
was a turning point,

205
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,764
and she proved it on
this particular makeup,

206
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,267
and those who saw this makeup
fell in love with it.

207
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,302
It's a fan-favorite, obviously.

208
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:35,372
Up next, it was a makeup
from season two that looked like

209
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:38,576
it was headed for disaster, but
wound up winning the challenge.

210
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,946
It earns the number 16 spot
on our judges' countdown.

211
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,750
So, this week, your
spotlight challenge was to use

212
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:47,952
one of Patrick's
concept sketches

213
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:49,886
as the basis for
an original alien.

214
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,055
Ian's bat alien was certainly

215
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,257
one of the best things
he did on the show.

216
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,527
Bringing Patrick's drawings
to life is really difficult.

217
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:57,761
I'm nervous as heck.

218
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,396
It's gonna be a hell of
a challenge to do this.

219
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,398
Well, I know that Ian
was having some hesitation

220
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,599
about this makeup,

221
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,601
but he was smart enough
to turn around

222
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:07,103
his things that went wrong
and really make it

223
00:10:07,137 --> 00:10:09,305
a positive attribute
to the character.

224
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,441
This piece did not come out
at all.

225
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,476
Immediately I can see both ears
are missing.

226
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,778
They didn't fill.

227
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:17,981
It's got a huge tear in
the shoulder to the neck.

228
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:19,883
It's fucked up.

229
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:21,818
I'm doin' everything I can
to hold this thing together.

230
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:24,820
I take the ears that are torn
off and I glue one back on,

231
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:27,022
and the other one
is just not salvageable,

232
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:29,024
so it's got to be
a wound or something.

233
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:31,294
So many points of that makeup
I was gonna give up.

234
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:37,166
I think this is
a stellar makeup.

235
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:39,868
Awesome, bitchin', and groovy.

236
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:41,737
The hands were as beautiful as
the face.

237
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,472
The character felt lived-in.

238
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,840
It felt like it had a story.

239
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:47,009
I wasn't a judge
on this particular season,

240
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:50,012
but I was a fan.
I sat back

241
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,981
impressed with the amount
of work that he did on it.

242
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:55,150
Ian's bat alien chick
was so cool.

243
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:58,420
Got to give him a ten
on the creepy scale for sure.

244
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:00,922
As the countdown continues,

245
00:11:00,956 --> 00:11:02,991
let us know if you agree with
our judges' choices

246
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:05,660
on Twitter using #FaceOff.
Coming up, we'll find out

247
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:08,563
which <i>Star Wars</i> makeup landed
a spot in our top 20,

248
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:11,299
and we'll see what
Tim Burton-inspired look

249
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:13,835
still makes Ve laugh today.

250
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,870
These and many more incredible
<i>Face Off</i> makeups

251
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:18,272
as we count down to
number one on

252
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:21,509
<i>Face Off's Top 20 Countdown,</i>
<i>Judges' Favorites.</i>

253
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,176
Welcome back.
We're counting down

254
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:29,179
our judges' top 20 favorite
<i>Face Off</i> makeups.

255
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:32,550
For our expert panel to pick
the very best creations,

256
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:35,819
they chose from over
120 zombies and ghosts,

257
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:38,556
31 demons, 28 hybrid creatures,

258
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,624
and 43 aliens.

259
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,594
Number 15 on our countdown is an
out-of-this world alien makeup

260
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:48,331
inspired by our season three's
epic premier challenge.

261
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,400
Your first spotlight challenge

262
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:52,535
is based on the most influential

263
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,573
film franchise in history,
<i>Star Wars.</i>

264
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:58,341
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God.

265
00:11:58,376 --> 00:11:59,842
All right.

266
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,645
You're going to need
to create an alien

267
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,480
that would fit in
a modern version

268
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,649
of that classic cantina scene.

269
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:09,952
Wow.
Roy and Rod's<i>Star Wars</i>alien

270
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:12,756
was probably the biggest
fabrication we had seen.

271
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,325
I start right in
on sculpting the face

272
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:20,296
and the little fat body that's
gonna be in the exoskeleton.

273
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,365
You've got Roy, who is, like,
the king of fabrication,

274
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,969
who can build that whole critter
around that little baby thing,

275
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:30,439
and then Rod with that kind
of sculpting sense that he had.

276
00:12:30,473 --> 00:12:32,240
It was like
a perfect combination.

277
00:12:32,275 --> 00:12:34,443
Those two worked
so well together.

278
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,978
Roy is describing
his exoskeleton.

279
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:40,582
I'm describing my little guy,
and they fit perfectly together.

280
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:42,117
This was really fun.

281
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:44,820
These two guys decided to be
a little bit lighthearted

282
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:47,088
about the whole thing,
and that's wise.

283
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:49,024
When you look back at those
films and you look at some

284
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:51,726
of the characters,
they're not all super serious.

285
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,595
Just the idea, the approach
of putting a small man

286
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,265
inside of a big robot body
is genius.

287
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,302
There were so many
moving parts, and the fact

288
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:02,937
that they pulled this off in
the time that they did

289
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:08,008
and still did a good makeup,
which was the face, of course,

290
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,544
it was really impressive.

291
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:12,347
Winning the spotlight
challenge feels great

292
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:14,281
to have my work acknowledged
in that way.

293
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:15,817
Your character will be featured

294
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,320
on the official <i>Star Wars</i>
website in its original design,

295
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:22,556
and re-created in the style of
<i>The Clone Wars.</i>

296
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,160
To have won and now have
their designs that were

297
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:29,096
originally a <i>Face Off</i> creation
on the <i>Star Wars</i> site?

298
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,131
That's pretty special.

299
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,935
Our next makeup unleashed some
ancient magic in season three

300
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,573
of <i>Face Off,</i> and now this
inspired Chinese dragon

301
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:43,744
brings good fortune to our
judges' countdown at number 14.

302
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:47,347
Tommy and Derek's
monkey-ox creation

303
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:49,783
just hit the nail on the head.

304
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:51,017
Your spotlight challenge

305
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:52,886
is to create
a completely original take

306
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,022
on the traditional Chinese
new year dragon.

307
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:57,690
Awesome.

308
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:59,458
For our concept,
it's the face of a dragon with

309
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:01,594
a bull ring out of
a baboon nose.

310
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:03,930
Derek starts painting
the face piece,

311
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:05,598
and I'm gonna focus
on painting the cowl.

312
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:07,666
It's a huge risk to have
two different paint jobs.

313
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:10,703
You're just really counting on
each other to pull it together.

314
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:14,507
When it came out onto
the stage,

315
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,509
the whole stage just lit up.

316
00:14:16,543 --> 00:14:19,712
That gold train,
great color choices.

317
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:21,280
I love that whisker detail.

318
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:22,715
- Yeah.
- Especially in profile.

319
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:24,750
It's just badass.

320
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:27,352
When these guys did
the dragon dance,

321
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:30,755
they were doing summersaults
and jumping over one another

322
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,924
and landing on each other.

323
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,592
This makeup held up
extraordinarily well.

324
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:37,495
Awesome!

325
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,331
I'm pretty thrilled
with this thing.

326
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:42,500
I also feel that it has
a Japanese aesthetic.

327
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:45,002
I'm a tattoo artist and a lot
of the stuff I draw

328
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:46,404
- is Japanese style.
- That's awesome!

329
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,239
That seems to me like
it's transcending what it is

330
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:49,474
that we asked you to do.

331
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:50,975
Derek, being a tattoo artist,

332
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,645
he's obviously studied dragons
quite a bit.

333
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,513
He knew what triggers to pull.

334
00:14:55,548 --> 00:14:56,714
It was spectacular.

335
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:57,949
I can't even
put a bitchin' to it

336
00:14:57,983 --> 00:14:59,350
'cause it was just
too beautiful.

337
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:00,717
For this makeup?

338
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:03,487
Terrifying, titillating
tenacity.

339
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,823
From the mystical
to the whimsical,

340
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:07,491
coming in at number 13,

341
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:11,595
it's one of <i>Face Off's</i> most
iconic and humorous makeups.

342
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:12,997
Your spotlight challenge
this week is to create

343
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:16,600
a whimsical character inspired
by an everyday profession

344
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,969
worthy of being featured in
a Tim Burton film.

345
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,772
- RJ.
- Bellhop.

346
00:15:21,806 --> 00:15:24,174
RJ's bellhop is
a perfect example

347
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,543
of success through forethought.

348
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:30,113
I'm thinking the bellhop has
become part of the luggage,

349
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:33,316
so he has drawers in his chest
like a trunk would have,

350
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,818
and he can open his drawers
and pull out clothing.

351
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,155
RJ, your makeup was
a very complete vision

352
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,757
and had some really great
stylistic elements.

353
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,892
This guy gets the challenge.

354
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:44,060
He looks at it and he goes,

355
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:46,896
"Look, I know Burton,
and I know how to do it.

356
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,764
I can do it with simple
form language.

357
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,867
I can do it with simple colors,
so I'm gonna do that,

358
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:52,067
and it's gonna feel like
a Burton character

359
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:53,435
when you look at the face,

360
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,271
but I'm not going to spend all
of my time on it.

361
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:58,040
I'm gonna spend
a lot of time fabricating

362
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:01,043
this really intricate
and extraordinary costume

363
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,145
that's as much a part of
the character as the makeup."

364
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:07,582
It was so cute, so well done,
so Burton-esque.

365
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:11,320
When we went up for
closer inspection, oh, my God.

366
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:13,822
He just started pulling all
these things out of this drawer.

367
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:15,357
At one point he took out a bra

368
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:16,825
and put it over my head.

369
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,361
I thought I was gonna die.
It was so bloody funny.

370
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,662
Thank you.

371
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:23,031
He didn't need to strap
that bra over her head.

372
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,234
RJ's bellhop is the embodiment
of Tim Burton aesthetic,

373
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:29,170
but where this really
came together was

374
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:32,206
in his overall
character development.

375
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,976
The little details and
in directing the performer...

376
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,545
...to also convey

377
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,780
a Burton-esque type
of performance.

378
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:42,383
RJ's bellhop is the embodiment
of Dark Whimsy.

379
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:46,220
The laughter continues
on our countdown

380
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,391
as we check out a comedic look
that won over our expert panel.

381
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:54,428
Here it is, the judges' pick for
the funniest makeup of all time.

382
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:58,566
Roy's laughing-dead character,
hands down,

383
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,135
wins for the funniest makeup.

384
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:06,373
It's a humorous concept,

385
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:09,577
but none of it really got to me
until it started dancing.

386
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:16,749
Glenn's even crackin' a smile.
Look it.

387
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,487
Is that you laughing?

388
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:22,989
- It is.
- Wow!

389
00:17:23,023 --> 00:17:26,493
Roy's stacked ghost character,

390
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,660
so funny.

391
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:31,831
- Shows he has a sense of humor.
- Oh, my God!

392
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,833
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

393
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,034
These are the Caine Brothers,

394
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:36,869
and they were Vaudevillian
performers.

395
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,838
They had a drinkin' problem,
and one night they stepped

396
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,907
into traffic and got hit by
a street car,

397
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:43,009
so this is how they have to live
in the afterlife.

398
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:46,445
This is a quintessential
Vaudevillian trick.

399
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,148
They would put two little kids
on top of each other

400
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:52,551
to create an adult, and you
pulled it off with one person.

401
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:55,087
When we first saw it,
all three of us,

402
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:57,223
it was a complete
laugh-out-loud moment.

403
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:58,724
Well, I chuckled.
I wouldn't say laughed out loud.

404
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,025
- I think I screamed.
- Glenn--

405
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,028
Glenn was crying like
a little girl with laughter.

406
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:06,632
Coming up, we'll see how
a season one

407
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,768
body paint challenge inspired
both a jaw-dropping work of art

408
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:12,738
and one of the most bewildering
makeups ever on <i>Face Off.</i>

409
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,874
All this and more dazzling
creations when

410
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:20,161
<i>Face Off's Top 20 Countdown,</i>
<i>Judges' Favorites</i> returns.

411
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,339
We're back, counting down our
judges' top 20 favorite makeups

412
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,375
in the history of <i>Face Off.</i>

413
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,145
Whether it's distant planets,
desert plains,

414
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,814
or eerie wastelands, <i>Face Off's</i>
77 spotlight challenges

415
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,284
have taken us to every kind
of destination.

416
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,387
The number 12 spot is a makeup
from a season two challenge

417
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,356
that took the competition to one
of the most difficult places

418
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,993
a makeup artist can go--
underwater.

419
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:51,697
Tara and Matt's fish creature
was really spectacular.

420
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,265
So beautiful.

421
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,365
I really love this.

422
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Your spotlight challenge was

423
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,536
to find a sea creature
to use as inspiration

424
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,671
for your unique makeups.

425
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,908
You were also asked
to make them waterproof.

426
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,610
It's very nerve-wracking.
Is this gonna float?

427
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,779
Is the paint gonna
bleed into the water?

428
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,013
I don't know what happened.

429
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,115
There's so many chunks missing
from the edges.

430
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,684
I'm really stressing that

431
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,519
we're not gonna be able
to get these edges down.

432
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,053
How are we gonna hide these?

433
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:20,090
My brilliant plan is to cover
these massive edges with fabric.

434
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,091
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

435
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,259
- That looks so cool.
- Wow.

436
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,195
Everybody gasped when she got
in the water.

437
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,595
Oh, it looks really cool.

438
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,897
The colors are beautiful.

439
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,566
Massive range of iridescence
head to toe.

440
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,036
The little filigree work that's
in the sculpture,

441
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,304
absolutely thrilled me.

442
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,839
Well done.

443
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,841
I'm glad we decided to go with
the fabric and hide the edges

444
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,775
because it looks
like colorful scales.

445
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,911
Well, this was a really clever
way to hide all their edges.

446
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:44,581
They're thinkin' on their feet
and they're turning challenges

447
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:48,151
around and making them
attributes.

448
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:50,320
Tara and Matt's fish creature,

449
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,056
aquatic, sensual beauty.

450
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,961
From under the sea to outer
space, it's the second makeup

451
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:01,797
in our top 20 from season
three's <i>Star Wars</i> challenge.

452
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,466
Let's head back
to Mos Eisley and meet

453
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:08,371
this unforgettable cantina alien
taking the number 11 spot.

454
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,706
This week, your spotlight
challenge was to create

455
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:14,077
an original alien that would fit
into a modern version

456
00:20:14,111 --> 00:20:17,079
of the classic <i>Star Wars</i>
cantina scene.

457
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:18,447
Let's see what
you've come up with.

458
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:23,552
Talk about coming out swinging.

459
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,021
Laura and Sarah's <i>Star Wars</i>
cantina alien

460
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:30,493
is the first episode,
and it's perfectly executed.

461
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:33,395
She comes from the Dagobah
System, which is very moist,

462
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,830
but she lives on Tatooine.

463
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:38,133
That's why she's got
the breathing apparatus.

464
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,402
And her costume helps retain
that moisture.

465
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:42,271
It's a whole suit get-up.

466
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,439
This is the type of design
that we're working towards

467
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:47,675
in production all the time,
with room to design it.

468
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,911
They pulled it off in two days.

469
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:51,746
One of the coolest things
was when she walked out,

470
00:20:51,781 --> 00:20:53,681
she had her hood up,
so we really couldn't see

471
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:54,749
what she looked like.

472
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:56,885
Would you mind removing
the cowl for us?

473
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:58,820
And when she pulled
that hood down,

474
00:20:58,854 --> 00:21:02,824
it was so regal and so gorgeous.

475
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,892
Really excellent job, ladies.

476
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,593
Laura and Sarah nailed it
with this one.

477
00:21:06,628 --> 00:21:09,063
I like the fact that you
mentioned the Dagobah System.

478
00:21:09,097 --> 00:21:11,765
She has a specific origin,

479
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,401
so you've been doing
your homework, which is great.

480
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:14,535
We're such geeks.

481
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:15,736
You know,
it's so important that

482
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,105
when you're going to do
a head-to-toe makeup

483
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,007
that it feels like
it's connected,

484
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:22,843
and the hands related perfectly
to the head,

485
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:26,146
both in its texturing and,
of course, its coloration.

486
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,215
This makeup is one of
the cleanest that we have seen

487
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,053
in all five seasons on the show.

488
00:21:33,087 --> 00:21:35,822
Up next, we travel to
the World Of Oz.

489
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:37,958
Coming in at number ten is
a winning collaboration

490
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:40,060
from a pair
of season two finalists,

491
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:42,762
one of whom became
that season's champion.

492
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,736
Rayce and Ian's Cowardly Lion,

493
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,371
it's a very contemporary way

494
00:21:52,405 --> 00:21:54,574
to approach
a very traditional character.

495
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:56,008
If you're a Cowardly Lion,

496
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:57,576
you're probably starving.

497
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,744
You'll have a smaller frame.
You'll be a little nicked up.

498
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:03,148
The way me and Ian are breaking
down our concept and design

499
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:06,018
is we're both going to do
the chest piece,

500
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:09,154
and he's gonna do the hair while
I do the overall paint job.

501
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:14,593
It was weird, and cool,
and exceptionally done.

502
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:17,428
- I do love the paws.
- What makes it work, beyond

503
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:21,566
all the obvious makeup work that
they did, was the hair work.

504
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,468
Its silhouette was so strong,

505
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:26,204
and that was a huge head
of hair.

506
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:30,774
That's not easy to work with
unless you're Fabio.

507
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,578
I really love the idea
of it being gray.

508
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:37,781
So expect it to be
this beige-y flesh tone.

509
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,617
- Very well done.
- Thank you very much.

510
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,352
They didn't allow their paint

511
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:43,054
to get in the way of
the sculpture,

512
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:44,555
so the shading
and counter-shading

513
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:46,824
that they're using and the
highlighting to make those ribs

514
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:49,760
feel really nice and sunken in,
it was all gorgeous.

515
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:53,363
It was such a unique character
and such a bizarre take.

516
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:55,265
That makeup really
has staying power.

517
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:59,169
Rayce and Ian's Cowardly Lion,
courage personified.

518
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,306
It's time to peel off
the clothes

519
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,941
as we take a look at the best

520
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:07,310
body painting ever featured
on <i>Face Off.</i>

521
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:10,247
This season one makeup
not only won the challenge,

522
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:13,650
but it joins our top 20
at number nine.

523
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:17,354
Welcome to your next
spotlight challenge.

524
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:20,256
Everybody?
Drop 'em.

525
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,324
Oh, my God!

526
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,561
It is birthday suits as far as
the eye can see.

527
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:26,596
Okay.

528
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:31,868
Anthony killed this challenge.

529
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:34,571
I mean, the guy's never done
a body painting before

530
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:37,173
in his life, and then
he rolls this thing out?

531
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,907
We're just shocked.

532
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:41,710
To come on the show
and discover an attribute

533
00:23:41,744 --> 00:23:45,747
that he may not have ever known
that he had as an artist?

534
00:23:45,782 --> 00:23:47,183
I think that's so awesome.

535
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,018
The idea is that she's pickin'
her bark apart.

536
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:54,122
Anthony's burnt wood makeup,
holy smoke.

537
00:23:54,156 --> 00:23:56,658
I don't even think he knew
he could do that.

538
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:59,561
- This was awesome.
- Thank you.

539
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:01,964
I loved the way that
he did that very clever thing

540
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:04,900
where it looked like she
was holding part of her stomach.

541
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:07,135
If you hadn't have had
those open spaces,

542
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:09,170
I think it would have been
very difficult

543
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:11,606
to pick out where
your person was.

544
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,342
It's like she ripped a piece of
her body off and is screaming.

545
00:24:14,376 --> 00:24:16,411
I just really love it.

546
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:19,614
To see that huge piece of art
up there was just--

547
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,048
oh, it was breathtaking.

548
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,651
That was one of the most
happiest moments of my life.

549
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:25,920
I'm ready to cry.
I-- It was-- Honestly?

550
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:29,189
That right there was better
than winning any Academy Award.

551
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:32,693
The detail and the precision
in mimicking his paint

552
00:24:32,728 --> 00:24:36,363
with the environment
was uncanny.

553
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:39,366
Anthony's burnt wood
was both invisible

554
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,302
and self-demonstrative.

555
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:43,670
For a<i>Face Off</i>competitor,

556
00:24:43,704 --> 00:24:47,407
the final presentation can make
or break your chances.

557
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:49,676
Our season one body paint
challenge not only gave us

558
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,778
one of the judges' favorites,

559
00:24:51,812 --> 00:24:54,414
it also offered one of
the most amusing moments

560
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,216
in <i>Face Off</i> history.

561
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,952
This is the judges' pick for
the longest makeup description

562
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:01,320
in the history of <i>Face Off.</i>

563
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:02,956
The most complicated

564
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,258
and convoluted description of
a makeup

565
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:06,693
goes to Sergio.

566
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:09,029
I looked at all
the backgrounds and I saw this,

567
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:13,599
uh, big tornado comin' up from
a very desolate area...

568
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:14,868
It kind of speaks about real
life because we have

569
00:25:14,902 --> 00:25:16,001
a lot of events that happen

570
00:25:16,036 --> 00:25:17,570
that we--
We're not aware of here...

571
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:20,139
When you're overrun and you have
all this stuff, you know,

572
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:21,974
I mean, it's something that he's
not gonna be able to escape,

573
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:23,609
you know-- but there's droughts
and stuff like that

574
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:24,910
in other places of the world,

575
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:27,112
and so I got an image
real quick of...

576
00:25:27,147 --> 00:25:29,848
But he still has that,
like, look of hope,

577
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:31,617
and I wanted my image
to really be able

578
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:35,220
to tell people a story
and have them ask questions...

579
00:25:35,254 --> 00:25:37,222
Almost like a fetal position,
because...

580
00:25:37,256 --> 00:25:39,058
I gotta laugh.

581
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:42,728
Sergio gave us the longest
description of a makeup job

582
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:44,663
in the history of <i>Face Off.</i>

583
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:46,899
And that's kind of what
I was going for.

584
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,167
Uh-huh.

585
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:52,504
Boy, that's a long story for
a very short makeup.

586
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:56,241
And it was an orange body
painting and white stripes.

587
00:25:56,275 --> 00:25:58,743
Hello?
Too long.

588
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:00,978
I thought about maybe
darkening his skin even more.

589
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:04,182
Sergio's description of
his naked ambition makeup,

590
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:07,952
uh, I don't know.
Fell asleep, don't recall.

591
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:11,522
<i>Face off's</i>season two
Tim Burton challenge

592
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:14,992
inspired three looks among
our judges' countdown,

593
00:26:15,027 --> 00:26:17,695
and two are still to come.

594
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,264
Which ones are they
and where did they rank?

595
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:21,699
It's coming up on

596
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:24,167
<i>Face Off Top 20 Countdown,</i>
<i>Judges' Favorites.</i>

597
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,195
Welcome back.

598
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,097
We're counting down
our judges' top 20

599
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:35,633
<i>Face Off</i> makeups of all time.

600
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,402
Let us know if you agree with
our judges' choices

601
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:40,538
on Twitter using #FaceOff.

602
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:42,706
Coming in at number eight
is this tasty treat

603
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:45,843
from the season two
Tim Burton challenge.

604
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:49,680
Its clever design and evocative
image had all the judges raving.

605
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:54,818
Matt's ice cream man from
the Tim Burton challenge,

606
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:57,922
oh, so creepy.

607
00:26:57,956 --> 00:27:01,624
It was kind of like you take
Burton's dark side, and you add

608
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:04,327
nothing but dark chocolate
and make it darker and darker,

609
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:07,464
'cause he went so south on this.

610
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:09,299
I love the ice cream man.

611
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:12,436
He's so colorful,
so delicious looking,

612
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,271
and he's just a feast
for the eyes.

613
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,706
It has so much going on,
there's so much story,

614
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,708
that you're almost afraid
to ask.

615
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:20,242
He's an ice cream inventor.

616
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:23,580
His lab exploded,
fusing his anatomy and DNA

617
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:25,582
with his own creation, so now

618
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:27,584
he's this chocolaty,
ice cream-sprinkled,

619
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:29,518
waffle cone-headed clown.

620
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:32,555
Matt's attention to detail
was pretty inspiring.

621
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:36,024
Sprinkles around its mouth,
a little cherry on its nose.

622
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:38,461
Phew.
Spooky.

623
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:39,962
Oh, no, thanks.
I ate.

624
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:45,267
There's something so wrong
about this twisted vision

625
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:47,336
of the perennial classic
that it's right.

626
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,139
This is more of what I've been
looking for out of you.

627
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:53,575
The balance of what you did
integrating the actual

628
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,144
cones into the makeup
is very wise.

629
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:58,179
If Tim Burton was gonna make
a horror movie,

630
00:27:58,214 --> 00:27:59,247
this guy would be in it.

631
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:01,617
This thing still
has life today.

632
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:03,685
People are always
talking about it online.

633
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,488
This thing is really
a psychotic--

634
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:10,091
I don't want to have
ice cream again.

635
00:28:10,126 --> 00:28:12,559
Now we've got the stunning
makeup that earned its creator

636
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:14,761
the title of <i>Face Off</i> champion.

637
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:16,497
From season one,
this haunting creation

638
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:18,031
comes in at number seven.

639
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:21,535
Your final challenge is
to reinvent

640
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:24,904
two characters from
a classic fairy tale.

641
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:26,873
You will also
be choosing a theme

642
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:28,274
to go along with
your fairy tale.

643
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,146
I knew a little bit about
the Frog Prince fairy tale,

644
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,515
and I knew that there was
a lot of potential there.

645
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:38,018
Conor's Frog Prince,
when you look at it,

646
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,754
it really is feature-film
quality.

647
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:45,525
The design captures a moment
of metamorphosis so brilliantly.

648
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,029
It is the quintessence of
the pain of transformation.

649
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,997
And, on top of everything else,

650
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,167
he decides to go ahead
and integrate

651
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:58,337
a very rudimentary mechanical
element to give it some life.

652
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:00,206
Blow into that tube.

653
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,306
Oh, my God.

654
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,475
That bladder that
he stuck in there?

655
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,779
It's genius in its simplicity,
and it worked perfectly.

656
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:09,915
I took the foam run
and I cut out all this

657
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,785
and built latex and
a tube right into the mold.

658
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:13,852
Hid the tube up underneath
the lip.

659
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,087
Well done.

660
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,955
I didn't come here just for
the hell of it.

661
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,723
I came here to win.

662
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,991
Conor is a really good
technician.

663
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,759
He has a great design sense.

664
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:24,095
His applications are flawless.

665
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,165
Look at the top of the head.
That's a great paint job too.

666
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,901
Conor's Frog Prince,
and the fact that this is

667
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,237
a season one winner,
it's incredible.

668
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,771
It's why he was the winner.

669
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:37,809
The eye of the frog is one of
the best eyes that I've seen.

670
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:39,177
Conor, in this challenge,

671
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:42,046
achieved a "ribbeting"
amphibious delight.

672
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:46,050
From cursed frogs
to enchanted swans,

673
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,953
it's the crowning achievement
from season five champion,

674
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:53,156
Laura, and it holds the number
six spot on our all-time top 20.

675
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,263
Laura's season five
finale makeup

676
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,432
was the manifestation
of beauty and power.

677
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,899
So incredible.

678
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:07,070
Laura's Renaissance swan
and sorcerer is breathtaking.

679
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,705
Unbelievably gorgeous.

680
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,708
Renaissance, Baroque,
whatever you want to call it.

681
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,243
Pearls, swirls.

682
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:15,678
Oh, my God.
She had everything in it.

683
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:18,048
I absolutely love how her bodice

684
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,516
looks like it's morphing
into something, and then

685
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:23,553
the shoulder pieces, like,
the start of wings.

686
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:25,855
You've got some great
texturing happening.

687
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:29,892
There's a real beautiful,
classic silhouette that she has.

688
00:30:29,926 --> 00:30:34,163
To have a figure dancing
with that aesthetic

689
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:37,700
on their body was so beautiful.

690
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,902
When you're designing,
you cannot do it alone,

691
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:41,771
so Laura divides up the labor

692
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:43,939
but guides it,
so that when it's done

693
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:46,441
it all looks like it was done
by one person.

694
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:47,943
Clearly she's a good artist.

695
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:49,845
She has an incredible
design sense.

696
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,648
She's a really seasoned
technician.

697
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:55,584
She is a focused beam
of talent.

698
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:57,519
It's clear that
she's gonna do the same

699
00:30:57,553 --> 00:30:59,020
professionally and
in her career.

700
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:00,422
She's phenomenal.

701
00:31:00,456 --> 00:31:04,025
This is an awe-inspiring
conglomerate

702
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,428
of multiple different techniques

703
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:07,629
and multiple different
influences

704
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,831
that are blended
seamlessly together

705
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,133
to create truly amazing
characters.

706
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,404
Next up, Las Vegas was
the backdrop

707
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:20,141
for one <i>Face Off</i> competitor's
crowning achievement.

708
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:22,610
The number five spot on
our judges' countdown belongs

709
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:24,512
to these amazing makeups created

710
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:26,547
for the mind-blowing production,
<i>Le Reve.</i>

711
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:36,691
Anthony's sinister performers
from the<i>Le Reve</i>show

712
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:40,027
were probably
the most definitive characters.

713
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:42,062
I don't know how
they could have been beaten.

714
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:46,967
The thing with this challenge
is to keep it very minimal

715
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,102
and not have anything
restrictive on their bodies.

716
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:54,308
I decided to keep it to a cowl,
face, and a minor chest piece.

717
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:57,277
The<i>Le Reve</i>challenge was,
by far,

718
00:31:57,312 --> 00:32:01,481
the most physically difficult
challenge to work a makeup on.

719
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:05,752
These guys were falling
from 50, 60 feet above water,

720
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:08,855
so creating anything
that didn't fall off

721
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,491
was extremely challenging
to begin with,

722
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:13,626
but to be able to design
something that looks beautiful

723
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:17,530
as a makeup, performs
under extreme circumstances,

724
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:21,334
and happens to just fit in
to a rich environment

725
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:24,270
that he could not have access
to prior to the challenge?

726
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:25,604
Killer work.

727
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:28,207
So, we're basically doing
a prosthetic face piece,

728
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:29,976
and we're gonna be working
into the cowl.

729
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,111
And then for
our female character,

730
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:34,881
it's gonna be the same species
but a lot softer.

731
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:37,516
The characters look like
they belong together.

732
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,718
I love the coloring
on both of them.

733
00:32:39,753 --> 00:32:40,719
The paint job was

734
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:42,921
- absolutely gorgeous.
- Thank you.

735
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:45,524
Anthony's<i>Le Reve</i>characters
were perfection.

736
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:46,925
This is, by far,

737
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:49,261
- my absolute favorite profile.
- Of course it is, because

738
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:50,529
it's so naturally looking.

739
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:51,630
I can believe this thing

740
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:53,031
- exists somewhere.
- Yes.

741
00:32:53,065 --> 00:32:56,167
The execution of the makeup from
a design standpoint,

742
00:32:56,202 --> 00:33:00,838
application, paint, costume,
all of it, is the reason he won

743
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:04,009
that particular challenge, and
the entire season of <i>Face Off.</i>

744
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:09,179
Have your favorite competitors
made the list?

745
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:10,915
We're working our way
to number one.

746
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,517
It's coming up,

747
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:16,571
when <i>Face Off Top 20 Countdown,</i>
<i>Judges' Favorites</i> returns.

748
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,721
Welcome back to the <i>Top 20</i>
<i>Countdown, Judges' Favorites,</i>

749
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:23,257
where we reveal the best
special effects makeup

750
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,027
in the history of <i>Face Off.</i>

751
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:28,362
Our number four makeup comes
from a season one challenge

752
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:30,998
where the artists were shocked
to learn their zombie creations

753
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:34,235
would be put to the test in
an expected dance routine,

754
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:35,469
and one of those zombies

755
00:33:35,503 --> 00:33:38,038
has been haunting
our judges ever since.

756
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:46,513
Conor's zombie.

757
00:33:46,548 --> 00:33:48,081
Crap, was that bitchin'.

758
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:50,551
Particularly since
so many zombies have been done,

759
00:33:50,585 --> 00:33:51,885
we know what they're supposed
to look like.

760
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,288
This one is zombie perfection.

761
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,589
Wow.

762
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:58,358
First of all,
it's a really cool opportunity

763
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:00,827
to do something that every
makeup artist wants to do,

764
00:34:00,862 --> 00:34:02,695
create this really
awesome zombie

765
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,831
in a dance video situation.

766
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,100
It was the quintessential
zombie.

767
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:10,470
She was skinny.
She was dry.

768
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:13,473
She was everything
a zombie should be.

769
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:16,275
The proportions
are beautifully handled.

770
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:20,145
You want to create
a sucked-in skeletal frame,

771
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,214
but to build that framework over

772
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:24,617
and then put skin over that
that looks sunken in,

773
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:26,318
it can easily get away from you.

774
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:27,486
This does not.

775
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,422
He works those notes
to perfection.

776
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:32,124
I want to do, like,
kind of a classic

777
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:35,727
'80s style zombie who's
now just a dried out husk.

778
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:37,029
Conor's another one of
our artists who has

779
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:38,497
a great design sense.

780
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:40,665
A really great applicator.

781
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,901
This is his third in our top 20.

782
00:34:42,935 --> 00:34:44,168
You name it, he can do it.

783
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:47,572
You got every detail
absolutely perfect,

784
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:50,541
right down to her arms,
her fingernails.

785
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:53,076
You even aged her hair
to the right color.

786
00:34:53,111 --> 00:34:55,513
- It's a stunning makeup.
- Thank you.

787
00:34:55,547 --> 00:34:57,515
It never becomes silly.

788
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:59,417
It never parodies itself.

789
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:01,619
It somehow manages to pull off

790
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:04,588
a dancing zombie
and still be super cool.

791
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,158
Conor's zombie
is roadkill beauty.

792
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:10,360
Everybody loves a zombie.

793
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:14,965
From zombie dancers
to cursed musicians.

794
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,866
Earning the number three spot
on our top 20,

795
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:18,101
here is the winning look

796
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:20,370
from <i>Face Off's</i>
Tim Burton challenge.

797
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,472
This week, your spotlight
challenge was to take

798
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:25,608
an ordinary profession
and create a character

799
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:28,144
worthy of being featured
in a Tim Burton film.

800
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:34,116
With Rayce's cellist,
you see him really

801
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:36,285
working at his highest capacity.

802
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,421
He writes these stories inside

803
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:40,222
of his head while
he's sculpting.

804
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:41,690
It's a unique thing.

805
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:45,027
I wanted to see if I could
bring in another character,

806
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,895
almost like the cello
was morphed into

807
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,832
a human and it's her love.

808
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:53,569
The idea that her playing it
was keeping alive

809
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:56,037
the spirit within the cello,

810
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,973
and the melancholy on her face,

811
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:00,408
which is so appropriate
for that type of instrument.

812
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:05,581
This is an unparalleled design
executed without fear.

813
00:36:05,615 --> 00:36:07,916
Actually, I went through
a few different designs.

814
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:10,118
It's just a face prosthetic.

815
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:12,020
Sometimes less is more.
I mean, you know,

816
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:13,554
you don't necessarily
have to cover their,

817
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,058
you know, face with prosthetics
to get a Tim Burton character.

818
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,361
That design was really unique,

819
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:21,529
and I imagine it could be in
a Burton film.

820
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:23,198
Oh, beautifully executed.

821
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:25,633
Your airbrush work
is really great.

822
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,035
You had airbrushed her clothing
as well, which was

823
00:36:27,069 --> 00:36:29,670
a good idea, because it
homogenized the whole look.

824
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:31,038
It's just beautiful.

825
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:32,940
Thank you so much.

826
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:35,776
Rayce's cellist
really did capture

827
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:38,679
other elements of
the Tim Burton style.

828
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:42,016
The stripes, the curved,
concentric lines,

829
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,986
but it's also the fact that
he included the relationship.

830
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:50,190
That was a really smart move,
which is why he won.

831
00:36:50,225 --> 00:36:52,893
Our top 20 countdown goes
to the underworld

832
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:56,296
as we check out a chilling
creation from season four.

833
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:59,766
Here's the second best makeup
in the history of <i>Face Off.</i>

834
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:05,272
Anthony and Alam's ice demon,
so pretty.

835
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,107
Anthony and Alam.

836
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,742
Ice demon.
What?

837
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:13,513
How are they managing something
so perfect for the challenge?

838
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:16,383
Create a demon character
from somewhere around the world

839
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,017
and bring it to life.

840
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:20,653
Then we threw you a twist.

841
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:21,921
Hell had frozen over.

842
00:37:21,956 --> 00:37:23,823
So, we got "Deumus,"
a Hindu goddess.

843
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:25,825
We both really want
to make this demon

844
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,929
beautiful to take it away from
a grotesque nature.

845
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:31,030
- It's very beautiful.
- Yeah.

846
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:32,031
It's pretty.

847
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:33,133
- I like the turquoise.
- Yeah.

848
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,700
I mean, it was so great
to see them

849
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:38,571
doing a beauty makeup on top of
a creature makeup,

850
00:37:38,605 --> 00:37:41,907
and just pulling it all together
from head to toe.

851
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:43,442
The feet on this thing
were beautiful.

852
00:37:43,477 --> 00:37:46,245
These are some of
the best details

853
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,580
that we've seen in any makeup.

854
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:49,582
What's remarkable
about this makeup

855
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:51,950
is the flow of the line from

856
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:53,786
horn down through
the zygomatic arch.

857
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,754
It's a perfect example of how

858
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:58,490
to move your eye throughout
the sculpture.

859
00:37:58,524 --> 00:38:01,359
Alam does like beauty
and Anthony

860
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:03,862
does like the creature-y side
of things,

861
00:38:03,897 --> 00:38:07,865
so that hybrid of their comfort
zone, of their wheelhouse,

862
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,269
really lent itself
to a perfect vision.

863
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:13,438
There's a very strong
synthesis between

864
00:38:13,472 --> 00:38:16,174
your demon's attributes
and the region that it was from.

865
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,943
We could immediately tell a lot
about it just looking at it.

866
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:20,812
Everything that
you guys did worked

867
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:23,447
so extremely well together.
Well done.

868
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,949
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

869
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,050
Five awesomes.

870
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:29,320
This one totally blew me away.

871
00:38:29,354 --> 00:38:33,090
We've seen 19 of the best
creations ever on<i>Face Off.</i>

872
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:36,593
When we come back, we reveal
the judges' top pick.

873
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:38,963
The number one makeup is next.

874
00:38:44,312 --> 00:38:46,646
Over five seasons
of intense competition,

875
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:48,281
<i>Face Off</i> artists have created

876
00:38:48,316 --> 00:38:51,418
almost 700 special effects
makeups.

877
00:38:51,452 --> 00:38:55,122
So far, our judges have revealed
19 of their top 20 picks.

878
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:58,225
Now we are moments away from
the number one makeup

879
00:38:58,259 --> 00:39:00,893
in the history of <i>Face Off,</i>

880
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:04,631
but first,
let's see the largest.

881
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:07,166
The largest makeup goes

882
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:10,169
to Eric F and Kris
for their two-headed giant.

883
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,273
What the fuck is that?

884
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:15,942
I don't know, but it was funny.

885
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:18,211
It was so big, and then
they had this little guy,

886
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:20,213
who was actually
the real life-sized guy.

887
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:23,015
This poor little guy
held there,

888
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,383
like a little baby

889
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,952
like an adult baby.
It was weird.

890
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:29,020
They probably rang up the
biggest bill in material costs

891
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:30,723
on the history of the show.

892
00:39:30,757 --> 00:39:34,326
This thing is like trying
to plaster a hot tub.

893
00:39:34,361 --> 00:39:36,194
I mean, it is massive.

894
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:38,230
Kris and I want to execute

895
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:40,532
the biggest character
as possible.

896
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:42,268
It's gonna be ten-foot tall!

897
00:39:42,302 --> 00:39:44,536
It's filling up half the stage,

898
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:48,339
and the looks on
the judges' faces is amazing.

899
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:56,882
This thing is so huge,
so impressive, but funny.

900
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,316
- They switched it back.
- This is so great.

901
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,919
Look, he's stabbin' his hand.

902
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:05,089
You guys should definitely
be impressed with yourselves.

903
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,558
I think it's the biggest makeup
we've ever seen on the show.

904
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:08,826
Yes.

905
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,461
That was one of our goals.

906
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,829
So...

907
00:40:13,632 --> 00:40:16,534
The top creation of all time
comes from a season five team,

908
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:18,302
and it's the most camera-ready
creature

909
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:20,637
to spring out of your garden.

910
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:22,606
Here it is,
the number one makeup

911
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,541
in the history of <i>Face Off.</i>

912
00:40:29,848 --> 00:40:32,283
Miranda and Tate's
Peter Pumpkin Eater.

913
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:34,451
Wow.

914
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:38,355
This is my favorite makeup

915
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:41,958
I have ever seen
on the show, period.

916
00:40:41,992 --> 00:40:43,727
There are a ton of awesome

917
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,696
sculptural decisions
in the head.

918
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,532
It is so good that Ve, myself,
and Glenn

919
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:50,767
all agreed that this
is camera-ready.

920
00:40:50,802 --> 00:40:54,037
Every little detail on this
reads whimsy and fantastical,

921
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,939
and I think you did a great job.

922
00:40:55,973 --> 00:41:00,310
Terrific costume,
impeccable fabrication.

923
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:04,848
Miranda did a spectacular job
on the sculpting.

924
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:08,884
I'm sure Tate helped her with
all that fabrication and cowl.

925
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:10,419
What do you think about this

926
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:11,920
coming out of her dress
from behind?

927
00:41:11,955 --> 00:41:14,189
Tate and I are just really
bouncing back and forth ideas

928
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,424
past each other with everything.

929
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:17,706
Like that, but pull
the whole thing up higher.

930
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:18,342
Oh, okay.

931
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:19,829
Should we extend, like,
a long line in that?

932
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:23,899
So, I start adding little bits
of clay right here,

933
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:25,334
and that is already helping,

934
00:41:25,368 --> 00:41:27,202
making her look more like
she's smiling

935
00:41:27,237 --> 00:41:28,470
rather than gaping.

936
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:30,839
We tell them not
to bake in expressions, right?

937
00:41:30,874 --> 00:41:32,407
They did exactly that,

938
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:35,277
but it's such a cool expression
that it doesn't matter.

939
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:37,412
The paint job, so authentic.

940
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:40,582
It just felt like this fetid,
rotted pumpkin

941
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,083
that's laying out in the field,

942
00:41:42,117 --> 00:41:43,918
and the combination of that
with the wardrobe

943
00:41:43,952 --> 00:41:46,754
and the vines coming
all the way down on the hands,

944
00:41:46,788 --> 00:41:48,589
it's this huge story

945
00:41:48,623 --> 00:41:51,592
that demands not only
to be in a film

946
00:41:51,626 --> 00:41:54,027
but to be the star
of its own film.

947
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:56,430
The reason this is my top

948
00:41:56,464 --> 00:41:58,965
is because there's
nuanced layers.

949
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,402
The use of pumpkins seeds,

950
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,437
the gloss, but they used it
in reserve,

951
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:07,507
which gave it
a realistic sensibility.

952
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,409
I think you knocked it out
of the park.

953
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,344
This is my greatest moment
on<i>Face Off.</i>

954
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:14,447
I've never felt so much pride.

955
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,982
It is what we wanted to make.

956
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:18,418
It was such a team effort,
and I feel so honored.

957
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,986
We absolutely loved
the sculpture, the paint,

958
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:22,755
and the overall harmony
of the piece.

959
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,757
Yeah, girl!

960
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,292
Oh, wow.
This is an obvious rating.

961
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:29,261
This probably has at least
100 bitchin's in it.

962
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,963
Miranda and Tate's
Peter Pumpkin Eater

963
00:42:30,997 --> 00:42:32,665
is off the squash hook.

964
00:42:37,503 --> 00:42:40,239
Looking back at these top 20
makeups, I just cannot wait

965
00:42:40,273 --> 00:42:42,607
to see what happens next
on <i>Face Off.</i>

966
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:44,910
There you go.
The top 20 makeups

967
00:42:44,945 --> 00:42:47,746
in the history of <i>Face Off</i>
according to our expert judges.

968
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,015
But the movie magic
doesn't stop there.

969
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,716
The jaw-dropping
creations continue

970
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:54,719
on our next blockbuster season
of <i>Face Off.</i>

971
00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:56,460
We'll see you then.
