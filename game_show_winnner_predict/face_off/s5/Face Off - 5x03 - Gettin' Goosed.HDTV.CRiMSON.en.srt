Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:08,389
Alana's bride of Frankenstein
brought her to victory.

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,257
What?
That's awesome, dude.

4
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,527
Sam's sculpt fell short,
and she was sent home.

5
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:16,030
Now 14 artists remain.

6
00:00:16,064 --> 00:00:18,632
And tonight,
they'll put a new spin

7
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,167
on some classic tales.

8
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:22,136
The stakes are higher than ever
this week.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,521
- Oh, hell.
- Oh, this is not good.

10
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:28,842
But with an unexpected twist,
the pressure is doubled.

11
00:00:28,877 --> 00:00:30,177
Time, everyone!

12
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:31,545
Awesome stuff, guys.

13
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,782
It doesn't seem to satisfy
the equation there.

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,484
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

15
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,086
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,256
to one of their 85
international locations,

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,659
the all-new 2013 Fiat 500,

18
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:48,462
and $100,000.

19
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:52,132
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

20
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,268
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

22
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:39,513
I'm really sorry you had to go
through that last night.

23
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:40,948
I know.

24
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,249
You're still here.

25
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:43,484
And you could, you know,
learn from that.

26
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:45,119
Ve did mention that

27
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:48,088
I had to learn how to splatter

28
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:51,158
and do other kinds of things
with the airbrush

29
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:53,160
because what I did
was not the kind of paint job

30
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:55,329
and the realism
that they are expecting.

31
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:56,730
Yeah.

32
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:59,366
Being on the bottom was
emotionally difficult for me.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,984
But I'm going to take
those criticisms

34
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:04,037
and use them productively.

35
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,583
We walk into the lab today,

36
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:18,519
and Glenn is standing
with McKenzie.

37
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:20,420
So I'm excited to find out
what the challenge is

38
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:23,490
and for a chance
to impress Glenn.

39
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:24,525
Hey, guys.

40
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:29,596
This week's foundation challenge
is inspired

41
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:33,083
by a highly acclaimed
horror film.

42
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:34,218
<i>Insidious.</i>

43
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:35,669
Yeah!

44
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:37,504
- Awesome.
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,239
I'm a huge<i>Insidious</i>fan.

46
00:02:39,274 --> 00:02:41,141
I might have a little bit
of an edge on this one.

47
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,426
The story centers
on a young boy

48
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,294
who has the gift
of astral projection,

49
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:46,146
which takes him
into a spiritual realm

50
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,614
inhabited by demons.

51
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,917
The terrifying sequel,
<i>Insidious Chapter 2,</i>

52
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,252
follows the haunted
Lambert family

53
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:54,388
as they seek to uncover
the mysterious secret

54
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,690
that has left them
dangerously connected

55
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:57,691
to the spirit world.

56
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,131
Now that my heart's racing--

57
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:06,834
Okay, your foundation
challenge is to create

58
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:09,236
your own personal demon

59
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,172
inspired by the world
of <i>Insidious Chapter 2.</i>

60
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,309
Before we get started,

61
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:17,861
I have a special message
for you

62
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:20,013
from the director
of the <i>Insidious</i> films,

63
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:21,014
James Wan.

64
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,416
Hi, everyone.

65
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,568
Today's winner will receive
a copy of <i>Insidious,</i>

66
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:26,436
out now on home video.

67
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:29,322
And you'll also win a flight
out to Los Angeles

68
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,625
with a friend to attend

69
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:35,929
the red carpet premiere
of <i>Insidious Chapter 2.</i>

70
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:37,397
Wow.

71
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,967
There's one detail
that McKenzie didn't tell you.

72
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,369
In the climactic ending
of the original film,

73
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:45,656
the boy's father is shown to be
possessed by a female demon.

74
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:48,058
So I want you to turn
your male models

75
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,276
into female demons.

76
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:53,280
Demon drag challenge,
all right.

77
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,817
Okay, you have two hours
to complete your looks.

78
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:59,586
Your time starts now.

79
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,778
This couldn't have been
a better challenge for me.

80
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:10,414
I walk around battling
my own demons every day.

81
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:13,700
The challenge is to take
our male models

82
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:17,020
and turn them into female demons
based on <i>Insidious 2.</i>

83
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:20,240
And my concept is that
this demon possesses me.

84
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:23,176
And it's constantly inputting
this temptation

85
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:25,646
of mortal sin.

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,730
Ready?

87
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,015
A woman has a rounder face,

88
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:29,850
while a man has more angles.

89
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:32,753
So I'm going to have to start
adding roundness

90
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:35,355
to his face,
and the best way to do that

91
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,658
is to make him
into an old woman.

92
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:40,661
I want this demon
to become something

93
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,763
that scared me
when I was a child.

94
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:44,381
I think horns would be
appropriate,

95
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:47,851
so I add horns
along the jawbone.

96
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:49,903
I want to bring
all of my fears into this

97
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:51,972
<i>Insidious Chapter 2</i>
inspired demon.

98
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,174
So she's an old version
of myself

99
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,776
who continues to mock me.

100
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:58,562
_

101
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:02,466
I have this weird,
reoccurring nightmare

102
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,817
that my teeth are loose.

103
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,419
All right,
so that's my personal demon,

104
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:06,887
teeth falling out.

105
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,255
I choose not to use
a prosthetic.

106
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:11,289
I'd rather spend my time
on detail in the paint job.

107
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,511
Something that's always
creeped me out

108
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:17,664
is a creature without eyes,
so I removed my demon's.

109
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,083
And so I take one of
the female heads

110
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,235
and vacuform it,
then just apply this mask,

111
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,255
which will give the male model
a female form.

112
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,512
One of my nightmares involves
this constantly fading character

113
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:33,847
that goes from black to white.

114
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:36,883
So I'm gonna try to do that.

115
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:48,528
Time's up.
Everybody, brushes down.

116
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:50,497
- Hey, Alana.
- Hi, you guys.

117
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:51,765
Tell us about what
you did today.

118
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,601
I have a lot of weird fears
and insecurities.

119
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:57,254
And this is a demon that's
just been hanging on my back.

120
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:00,707
I think that it's cartoony,
and it doesn't say "demon".

121
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,342
You know, you've got two hours.

122
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:04,344
Instead of going
heavily prosthetic,

123
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,297
the two-tone graphic nature
of this thing, I think,

124
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:08,515
is a spot-on decision.

125
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:09,850
Well done.

126
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,668
Extremely complete image.

127
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:12,786
Everything goes together.

128
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,654
The wardrobe works
with the colors.

129
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:15,722
Very cool.
Well done.

130
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:17,657
I was toying around
with the idea

131
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:19,726
of making horns extrude
from the jaw line.

132
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,228
I do get where you were going
with the chin,

133
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,030
but I think you missed
the mark.

134
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:25,065
I think you succeeded in taking
a very masculine man

135
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,968
and perhaps making him
even more brutish.

136
00:06:28,002 --> 00:06:30,003
An idea like this,
the plastic mask

137
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:33,073
with under paint,
what a brilliant way

138
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:36,043
to get that feminine aspect
out of your way.

139
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,377
Well done, Roy.

140
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:38,829
Thank you.

141
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,447
I'm looking around at some
of the other makeups,

142
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:41,782
and lot of them are
really impressive.

143
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,234
There's solid competition here.

144
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:46,153
I know that the challenges are
gonna get harder.

145
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:49,189
So I got to bring my A game
every single challenge

146
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:51,658
because if I don't do my best,
I'm going home.

147
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:53,777
So, Glenn,
how did they do today?

148
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:55,595
I think a few people
found exactly

149
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,830
what we were looking for.

150
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:57,881
Who were your favorites?

151
00:06:57,915 --> 00:06:59,633
Rick.

152
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,769
Really strong graphic nature
to what you did.

153
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,404
And I love the fact
that you really went

154
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,539
in your own direction with it.

155
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:07,074
Thank you.

156
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:10,177
And, Roy, using
the vacuform shell

157
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:13,313
to obliterate the male
and create that female look,

158
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,115
very, very creepy.
Well done.

159
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,500
Thank you.

160
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:18,552
All right, Glenn,
so who is the winner

161
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:21,521
of today's <i>Insidious Chapter 2</i>
challenge?

162
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:23,406
The winner of today's
challenge is...

163
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,727
Roy.

164
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:31,865
Roy, congratulations.

165
00:07:31,899 --> 00:07:33,467
You and a guest
will be attending

166
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:36,937
the red carpet premiere
<i>Insidious Chapter 2.</i>

167
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:38,538
I'm really excited.

168
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:39,906
And I know that my wife's
gonna be excited

169
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,159
to come back out here
and go to a red carpet event.

170
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,211
That's awesome.
Thank you.

171
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:45,278
All right, well,
great job, everybody.

172
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:46,413
I will see you tomorrow

173
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:49,416
for your next
spotlight challenge.

174
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,501
You can pick me up
that night, Roy.

175
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,553
I think his wife
might want to go.

176
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:05,198
We're walking in this park,
and we can see McKenzie

177
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,450
standing in front
of this huge carousel.

178
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:08,785
It's beautiful.

179
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,537
I love carousels.

180
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:13,440
Clearly, it's gonna be
pretty fun.

181
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:16,393
Welcome to the Griffith Park
merry-go-round.

182
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:19,045
Legend has it that Walt Disney
would bring his daughters here,

183
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,681
and it was during these rides
that he started to dream

184
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,550
the fantastical idea
of Disneyland.

185
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:24,751
Oh.

186
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:25,886
Well, this week's
spotlight challenge

187
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,954
is inspired
by other fantastic stories

188
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,856
that have been taking children

189
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,491
to whimsical places
for generations.

190
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:33,360
You will create an original,

191
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,829
whimsical character
from modern times

192
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:39,065
inspired by classic Mother Goose
Nursery Rhymes.

193
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,203
That's awesome.
I'm so excited.

194
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:45,505
I love Mother Goose.

195
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,073
Now you will be working
together in teams of two.

196
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:50,177
But this time...

197
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:52,812
you're gonna be choosing
your own teams.

198
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,514
So go ahead and select
a teammate.

199
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,384
I got RJ.

200
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,519
It's nice to be loved.
Thank you so much, sir.

201
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:00,787
I've always wanted to work
with RJ,

202
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:02,856
ever since I saw him
on season two.

203
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,174
I know his style,

204
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,825
and I know we can make something
really cool.

205
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:11,514
I chose Lyma 'cause I think
she's extremely talented.

206
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:13,483
So its gonna be amazing
to work with her.

207
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:15,168
So each of these props
represents

208
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,671
a different Mother Goose
Nursery Rhyme.

209
00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:19,839
Frank and Laura,
you get to pick first.

210
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:23,176
- The spider.
- Okay.

211
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,579
- Going with the spider.
- Ah.

212
00:09:25,613 --> 00:09:27,547
"Little Miss Muffet."

213
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,916
- Alana and Laney.
- Five Toes.

214
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,968
"This Little Piggy
Went To The Market."

215
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:33,253
Adolfo and Lyma.

216
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,738
You want the egg?

217
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:37,090
Yeah, I want the egg.

218
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:38,391
Humpty Dumpty.

219
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:40,827
RJ and Roy.

220
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,862
- "The Cat And The Fiddle."
- Rick and Eric.

221
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:45,699
Go with the coin,
whatever that is.

222
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,968
The Crooked Sixpence.

223
00:09:48,002 --> 00:09:51,738
- Scott and Eddie.
- "The Man In The Moon."

224
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:55,692
And last but not least,
Tate and Miranda.

225
00:09:55,743 --> 00:09:59,045
"Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater."

226
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,830
Well, now that you all have
your Nursery Rhymes,

227
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:03,249
there is one last thing
that I need to tell you

228
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,619
before you start working
on your designs.

229
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:09,172
The stakes are higher than ever
this week.

230
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:11,491
Oh, hell,
there is always something

231
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,693
with McKenzie and these twists.

232
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:15,528
Coming up...

233
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,797
It's scaring me.

234
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,399
- This is not good.
- We need to open this now.

235
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,634
Otherwise, we're fucked.

236
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:22,102
Oh, no.
The mold is not opening.

237
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:24,571
I think you did an amazing job
this week.

238
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:25,772
You missed the whimsical.

239
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:28,475
It just doesn't play well.

240
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,027
There's one last thing
that I have to tell you

241
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:36,771
before you start
working on your designs.

242
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,917
This week is
a double elimination,

243
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:45,220
and two of you
will be going home.

244
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:46,922
Already, on our third
challenge, a double elim?

245
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,056
That's, like, crazy.

246
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:49,658
Double eliminations are

247
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:52,461
basically like double pressure.

248
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:54,163
All right, I'll leave you here
to work on your designs.

249
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,831
When you're done,
you can head back to the lab

250
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,466
and get started
on your creations.

251
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,734
Good luck, guys.

252
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:04,173
Yee-haw.

253
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,591
The musical cat,
then where's the fiddle?

254
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,109
The cat<i>in</i>the fiddle.

255
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:08,977
So our concept is
to take the cat

256
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:11,346
and have him wearing a fiddle
that he can actually play.

257
00:11:11,381 --> 00:11:12,681
Maybe from the bottom
of the chin

258
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:15,317
have some whiskers going
down into the strings.

259
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,318
It could be.

260
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,237
The first thing I think of is

261
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:19,721
a pig in a meat dress.

262
00:11:19,756 --> 00:11:22,291
I'm not sticking to no little
piggy going to the market.

263
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,576
We shouldn't go scary.
It has to say whimsical.

264
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:25,994
We can't make
five separate pigs.

265
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,329
So we just decided
to pick one of them

266
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:28,330
from the poem.

267
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:29,731
This little piggy stays home.

268
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,000
The other little piggies are,
like, her minions.

269
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,535
If she doesn't get
what she wants,

270
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,142
she'll eat the other pigs
and wear them as accessories.

271
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:37,512
_

272
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:41,076
"There was a crooked man,

273
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,477
and he went a crooked mile."

274
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:43,645
Our crooked man,

275
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,047
he's kind of twisted
and mangled.

276
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,150
And that could definitely go off
in a very dark direction.

277
00:11:48,184 --> 00:11:49,785
But we're gonna take
a very whimsical approach.

278
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,254
I think it's
a really cool story.

279
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:53,989
"Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater

280
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:55,524
had a wife
and couldn't keep her.

281
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:56,575
He put her in a pumpkin shell,

282
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,227
and there he kept her
very well."

283
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,462
This is a woman who has been
locked inside a pumpkin.

284
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:02,631
So if she's ever able
to get out,

285
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:03,866
I would assume that
she would head

286
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,651
straight to Peter and off him.

287
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,302
It's gonna be a revenge story.

288
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,137
And we're gonna fabricate
this giant pumpkin.

289
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:10,155
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be pretty dope.

290
00:12:10,206 --> 00:12:11,406
We're really excited about it.

291
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,407
All right, guys,

292
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,359
let's get going
back to the lab.

293
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,577
I'm excited for this challenge,

294
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,614
and I'm ready to do this pig.

295
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,824
We get into the lab,
and we have seven hours today.

296
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:29,858
You start sculpting,

297
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:30,959
and I can start building
the pumpkin.

298
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:32,094
Okay.

299
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,896
I start sculpting,

300
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,998
and the fact that somebody
as talented as Tate

301
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:38,150
trusts me to block out
these sculptures

302
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,202
means a lot to me.

303
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,109
Adolfo and I want to make
Humpty Dumpty

304
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:49,077
into a female character

305
00:12:49,112 --> 00:12:51,046
and give it a Lady Gaga feel.

306
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,916
Lyma's sculpting the face,
and I'm sculpting the cowl.

307
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,384
They need to really,
really match,

308
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,651
because it's double elimination,

309
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,870
and we've both been
in the bottom.

310
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:01,373
I need to be safe.

311
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:04,293
Our concept is to create
the woman in the Moon

312
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,694
who lives on the Moon

313
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:08,397
and collects pieces
from Apollo missions.

314
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,132
We really want to give it
a modern take.

315
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,936
So we decide to make
an asymmetrical character.

316
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,921
I just really want to impress
the judges this week.

317
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,889
Yeah.

318
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,842
So our concept is
from the spider's perspective.

319
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:24,046
Miss Muffet used to have
a prince charming,

320
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,414
but then an evil witch decides

321
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,115
that she's going to curse
the prince

322
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,550
to look like a monster.

323
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:31,887
Laura is taking lead
on the head.

324
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,055
And then I start making
the mandibles

325
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,091
to go in different places
on the spider.

326
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:49,237
Hey, everybody.
Here for walkthrough.

327
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:50,238
Hi.

328
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:52,574
- Hello.
- We're back.

329
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:54,209
Let's see what you have.

330
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:55,477
Explain to us what you're doing
here with--

331
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,745
Tell us about your face first.

332
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:59,348
The face was something
that Rick actually drew out.

333
00:13:59,382 --> 00:14:01,650
With the paint,
start with a good flesh tone,

334
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:03,735
and then highlight
down your bone

335
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:05,053
to make him pop out more.

336
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,288
Oh, okay.

337
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,789
How are you incorporating
the whimsical?

338
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:10,142
Our witch cursed the guy.
That's whimsical.

339
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:12,361
As far as whimsical goes,

340
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,895
a lot of it's gonna depend
on your painting.

341
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,999
Start lighter and go back
into your darker part

342
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:18,467
of your head and everything.

343
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,202
What's going on over here?

344
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,319
We're gonna give her boobs.

345
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:22,738
What you've done here
is human form,

346
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:24,072
as opposed to pig.

347
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:26,274
So you think we should bring
them to more of a point?

348
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,809
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

349
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:29,144
I love Mr. Westmore.

350
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,446
I'm so thankful every time
he steps into that shop,

351
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,849
because it's always
the most incredible advice

352
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,450
anyone could ever ask for.

353
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:38,754
It's like the God of makeup
handing you the book of rules.

354
00:14:38,788 --> 00:14:39,988
- That's your sketch?
- Go right ahead.

355
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:41,723
Yeah, let's see the sketch.

356
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:44,126
What part of this reads
whimsical?

357
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,394
I mean, 'cause right now
it looks--

358
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:46,378
I gotta be honest.
It looks scary.

359
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:48,096
Yeah, you've done this

360
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,799
almost, like, skeleton,
horror-type of a mouth.

361
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,200
If you just fill her out more,

362
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:54,036
your character would be
more whimsical.

363
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,987
Cool.
Thank you, guys.

364
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,456
All right, everybody,
we're heading out,

365
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,457
- but it's looking great.
- Thank you.

366
00:14:58,508 --> 00:14:59,474
- Thank you, guys.
- Bye-bye.

367
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:00,475
Bye, guys.

368
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,611
So this is not good.

369
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:04,846
Should we extend, like,
a long line back?

370
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,181
Mr. Westmore
gives us the advice

371
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:07,849
that maybe if we rounded
the face a little bit more,

372
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,351
it would be more whimsical.

373
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:13,221
So I start adding little bits
of clay right here.

374
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:14,823
And that is already helping,

375
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,541
making her look more
like she's smiling,

376
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:19,594
rather than gaping.

377
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:26,739
_

378
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,539
Hey, everybody, that's time.

379
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:32,908
Whoo!

380
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,242
At the end of the day,

381
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:35,744
I'm starting to feel better
about the sculpt.

382
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:37,462
I've taken
Mr. Westmore's advice

383
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,214
and made some changes
to the face.

384
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:42,551
I'm hoping that
this all comes together.

385
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:51,359
It's day two of our
Mother Goose challenge.

386
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:52,727
We have 9 1/2 hours.

387
00:15:52,762 --> 00:15:54,329
I'm gonna go take a victory lap,

388
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:55,664
because we already won
this challenge.

389
00:15:55,698 --> 00:15:56,965
Go, go, go, go.

390
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,767
I need to kick ass
in this mold room today.

391
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:01,603
I need to get our hoof molded,
our face molded.

392
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,205
I need to get our ears molded,

393
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:06,975
as well as the creature's
gigantic belly and teats.

394
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,910
So there's a lot of stuff
to do today.

395
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:10,912
I have to mold Laura's cowl,
the back,

396
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:12,264
and then the chest.

397
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:13,882
I want to make sure
that all that's done quickly

398
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,617
so they'll be ready
for foam latex.

399
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:27,362
I want to fabricate a fiddle
out of L200 foam.

400
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:28,713
And the cool thing
about this foam

401
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:32,033
is that you can use a heat gun,
and, as it cools off,

402
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:36,588
it assumes the shape
of whatever way you've held it.

403
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:47,081
There we go.

404
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,316
So, mold is ready,

405
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,802
mold is clean,
and I have this great idea.

406
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,971
How about we run the molds
through poly foam,

407
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,390
and then we also run it
in foam latex?

408
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:57,392
So that way we can have
both options and see

409
00:16:57,426 --> 00:17:00,428
which one is gonna work better
than the other one.

410
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:07,569
We can maybe make, like,
a little fingernail flat rock

411
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:09,154
or something like that.

412
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:10,155
Let's do that.

413
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,706
Instead of sculpting
and molding

414
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:14,709
arm and leg pieces
for our moon character,

415
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:16,878
I decided to use latex
and foam.

416
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,014
So I take some spandex material

417
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:23,752
and cut up little chunks
of foam to replicate Moon rocks.

418
00:17:23,786 --> 00:17:25,954
You pull, and I push.

419
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,627
It's time to open the mold.

420
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:28,828
_

421
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,502
We can't get the poly foam out.

422
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:33,107
_

423
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,568
_

424
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,389
_

425
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,538
_

426
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:39,573
_

427
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:42,971
I cannot believe Lyma
just left.

428
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:45,290
There's no way to open
this mold by myself.

429
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,809
If I don't have this mold ready,
we're not gonna have a head.

430
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:55,500
_

431
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:57,998
So it's day two in the lab,

432
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:02,252
and my partner just left me
to open this mold by myself.

433
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,821
I don't have time to start
from scratch.

434
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:06,840
On application day,
there's just no time at all.

435
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:09,477
_

436
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:10,700
_

437
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:11,501
_

438
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:12,513
So Laura comes.

439
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:14,291
And thank God she's here
with me.

440
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,044
_

441
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,620
_

442
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:19,537
_

443
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,375
_

444
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,179
_

445
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,896
I feel so relieved right now.

446
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,274
_

447
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,796
Where's Lyma?

448
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:30,931
We have to clean this guy.

449
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:32,516
All right, you can do it?

450
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,600
Yeah.

451
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:35,135
Yeah, but this
is not going to work.

452
00:18:35,186 --> 00:18:36,386
No, no, no,
I don't care about that one.

453
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,387
I'm not really concerned

454
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:38,689
about the poly foam piece.

455
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:40,073
I'm just concerned
about cleaning the mold

456
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:43,110
so I can be ready to run it
in foam latex.

457
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:45,100
_

458
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,763
It's one hour.

459
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:56,540
I've decided to make
my character a bacon bra

460
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:57,875
to match her bacon bow.

461
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,911
So I'm "bacon" care of business
in the red room.

462
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:02,813
_

463
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:03,756
_

464
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,782
Mm-hmm, just tinted.

465
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:07,818
15 minutes!

466
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:18,660
_

467
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,230
We're ready to run this
in foam latex.

468
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,398
There you go.

469
00:19:21,432 --> 00:19:22,933
And I am just hoping
that this piece

470
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:26,203
is gonna come out amazing.

471
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,272
That's time, everyone!

472
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:29,539
Whoo!

473
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:31,808
I'm hoping application day

474
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:33,126
is gonna run smooth,

475
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:36,196
and I am just really excited
that this day is done.

476
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:46,940
Go, go, go!

477
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:49,993
Good luck, everyone.

478
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,695
- Do you see our cowl?
- It looks really good.

479
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:53,096
Yay!

480
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:55,265
Cool.
Well, I'll start cutting.

481
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,600
So it's application day.

482
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:57,701
We have four hours in the lab.

483
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:59,503
And we have a back.
We have a chest.

484
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:00,837
We have a face.
We have a cowl.

485
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:03,240
We have four legs.
We have two wrists.

486
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:06,410
This is gonna go crazy.

487
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:07,678
Okay.

488
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:08,879
The cowl looks pretty good.

489
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:10,614
However, there's a lot
of work ahead.

490
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:12,199
- It doesn't look that bad.
- No.

491
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,334
We're gonna to start
to fabricate all the arm pieces

492
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,320
and everything that needs
to be glued on.

493
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,591
Yay!
Our models arrive.

494
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,810
And the first thing
that we have to do

495
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,862
is make sure that the bodysuit
fits properly.

496
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:26,897
It's not too uncomfortable?

497
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:29,533
Eddie made several other
extra pieces

498
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,168
that all tie together.

499
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,586
So he's working on the rest
of the body

500
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:34,388
while I'm gluing on the head
and the face.

501
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:37,574
You, ma'am,
are an absolute wonder.

502
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,526
This little piggy
looks fabulous!

503
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:42,779
- That all right?
- Sweet!

504
00:20:42,813 --> 00:20:43,947
All right, stand up.

505
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:47,551
Let me put this on you
and see how this fits.

506
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:48,869
Cool, it fits you.

507
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:49,903
- Yeah.
- I'm excited.

508
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:51,021
Who would've thought?

509
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,022
I am really pleased
with the way

510
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,323
this build has turned out.

511
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:55,442
I think Roy and I
are on the right track,

512
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,144
and I'm really excited
to show this to the judges

513
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:58,261
and see what they think.

514
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,520
This is gonna be glued here,
so whenever you're done,

515
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:09,560
you just pull that arm out,

516
00:21:09,595 --> 00:21:11,154
and you'll have your arm free
the whole day.

517
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:12,190
Awesome.

518
00:21:12,225 --> 00:21:12,743
The makeup Eric and I
are working on

519
00:21:12,777 --> 00:21:15,362
is different than the rest
of the group.

520
00:21:15,413 --> 00:21:17,981
I think both Eric and I
are a little bit concerned

521
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,702
that we might not exactly hit
the whimsical

522
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:22,819
on this challenge.

523
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:24,538
And we'll work on the style.

524
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,823
But it shouldn't be monsterly.

525
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:29,860
- Yeah.
- That's really about it.

526
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:34,589
Close your eyes.

527
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,634
As I'm making
the giant pumpkin,

528
00:21:37,668 --> 00:21:40,337
I'm starting to notice
that it's looking boxy.

529
00:21:40,371 --> 00:21:42,539
The last thing I want to do
is detract from this makeup.

530
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:43,690
_

531
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:45,392
I decide it's not worth it.

532
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:47,644
I'm just gonna drop it and start
helping paint the head.

533
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:48,929
Give me what color you want,

534
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:51,982
and I'll go ahead
and start basing it out.

535
00:21:56,954 --> 00:22:00,057
Most of my day
is finishing up these legs.

536
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:01,791
And they're just so big.

537
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:03,810
I'm a little bit worried.
That's for sure.

538
00:22:03,845 --> 00:22:06,413
The whimsical thing
is gonna end up being a problem.

539
00:22:06,447 --> 00:22:09,833
We'll see what the judges
have to say.

540
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,669
I didn't know if you wanted
to do that

541
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:13,670
that color or not.

542
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:14,838
Yeah, I'm gonna do it now.

543
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:16,406
We put some pink in the ears.

544
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:19,009
It's a very cartoonish
challenge.

545
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:21,078
We wanted to really accentuate
the cartoon feel of it.

546
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:23,713
I mean, he's wearing
a giant violin.

547
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:24,914
This is not gonna be

548
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:27,584
a realistic cat.

549
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,041
God, you're so cute.

550
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:36,393
I can't even handle it.

551
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:37,711
What do you think about this

552
00:22:37,745 --> 00:22:39,212
coming out of her dress
from behind?

553
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:41,731
Tate and I are just really
bouncing back and forth ideas

554
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:42,999
past each other
with everything.

555
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:44,367
I like that, but pull
the whole thing up higher.

556
00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:45,602
Oh, okay.

557
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:49,389
And I think it's looking
really great.

558
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,242
If you start moving around,
you'll be a scrambled egg.

559
00:22:52,276 --> 00:22:56,880
That's awesome.

560
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:58,982
15 minutes, guys!

561
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:02,018
Coming with legs.

562
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:09,659
Oh, yeah.

563
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,230
You're amazing.

564
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:14,397
All right, everybody,
that's time.

565
00:23:14,431 --> 00:23:16,900
Let's go.

566
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:19,202
- Whoo!
- Oh, man.

567
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:21,338
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

568
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:22,973
We've gotten great feedback
from everybody

569
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,275
about how our sculpture looks
like a crooked guy.

570
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,544
But is it fun?

571
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:28,812
No.

572
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm not sure that
what we've accomplished

573
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,048
is what the judges
are looking for

574
00:23:32,082 --> 00:23:33,750
for this challenge.

575
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:37,353
But it's up to the judges
at this point.

576
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:39,990
Coming up...

577
00:23:40,024 --> 00:23:40,991
I'll try to make it work.

578
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,692
Did hell freeze over?

579
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:45,595
There's some totally
arbitrary surfacing.

580
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,665
- Awesome stuff, guys.
- It doesn't read whimsical.

581
00:23:58,418 --> 00:23:59,852
We get to last looks.

582
00:23:59,887 --> 00:24:01,187
We have one hour left.

583
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,139
We still have a lot
of painting to do.

584
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,691
We also need to apply
a whole bunch of little pieces.

585
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:08,427
I'll try to make it work.

586
00:24:11,998 --> 00:24:13,466
I do the beauty makeup
around the eyes

587
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,867
and around the mouth.

588
00:24:14,902 --> 00:24:16,802
And Alana's spackling some colors.

589
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:20,306
We're looking so good.

590
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,441
15 minutes, everybody.
15 minutes.

591
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:23,993
Time is ticking,
and Rick is trying

592
00:24:24,044 --> 00:24:26,178
to wrangle together
the wardrobe.

593
00:24:26,213 --> 00:24:27,546
We have this coat
on our character,

594
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:29,015
but we don't want it to cover up
all the work we did.

595
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:32,051
That is a very
awkward-fitting coat.

596
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,656
_

597
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:38,124
Did hell freeze over?

598
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:41,160
Because we're finished
before they call time.

599
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:46,399
That's time!
Time's up, everybody.

600
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:48,951
We did it.

601
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,303
I think there's a lot
of really great makeups

602
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:51,504
in the room,

603
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:52,772
but it's really stressful
for everybody

604
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:54,357
because there's two people
going home.

605
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:56,742
And none of us ever know
what the judges are gonna like

606
00:24:56,777 --> 00:24:59,011
or not like.

607
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:11,590
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

608
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:14,660
Tonight two of you
will be eliminated.

609
00:25:14,695 --> 00:25:16,512
But first, let's say hello
to our judges.

610
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:19,382
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

611
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:21,200
Hi, everyone.

612
00:25:21,234 --> 00:25:24,086
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

613
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:25,087
Good evening.

614
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:26,272
- Hey, Ve.
- Hi, Ve.

615
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:28,607
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

616
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:29,608
Hello.

617
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:30,977
Hey, Neville.

618
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:32,244
This week,
your spotlight challenge

619
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,380
was to create an original,
whimsical character

620
00:25:34,414 --> 00:25:36,916
inspired by a Mother Goose
Nursery Rhyme.

621
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,918
So let's take a look.

622
00:26:01,074 --> 00:26:03,809
She looks like a supermodel
in a runway show,

623
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:05,344
just with an egg on her head.

624
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,664
She is rocking out
the snobby swine.

625
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:28,818
And it looks awesome.

626
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:46,168
The only time in<i>Face Off</i>history

627
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:47,319
where an actor could get away

628
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:48,754
with playing with himself
on stage.

629
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:51,006
He's literally playing
the strings with his tail bow.

630
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:54,193
Turned out exactly the way
we drew him.

631
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,911
Eric and I are happy
with our makeup.

632
00:27:11,945 --> 00:27:15,714
Whimsical or not,
we're proud of what we've done.

633
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:34,800
I'm loving my spider.

634
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:37,236
He's evoking a sense
of longing.

635
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,906
I think he's adorable.

636
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,378
This is my greatest moment
on<i>Face Off.</i>

637
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:04,180
I've never felt so much pride.

638
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:07,800
It is what we wanted to make.

639
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:25,868
It looks cool.

640
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,120
Everything from the tiny,
little craters on her face

641
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:30,189
and the metallics
on her costume.

642
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:33,225
We're really pleased.

643
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:38,731
Judges, why don't you take
a closer look?

644
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,839
It's a pretty well-balanced
paint job.

645
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,190
There's a good beauty makeup
on top of it.

646
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:49,708
- Where is the edge?
- A pretty good blend, though.

647
00:28:49,743 --> 00:28:51,310
I don't know.

648
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,879
The judges come close,
and they start picking at it

649
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:55,481
and checking the eggshells
and all that,

650
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:58,450
and I'm just praying
that those things stay on.

651
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:04,990
That cracks me up.
It's so cool.

652
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:06,325
Hold me.

653
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,326
Around the eyes is really good.

654
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,310
- It is.
- Yeah.

655
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:10,095
It looks really good.

656
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:11,096
Do you have any singles?

657
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:14,133
Do you have any singles.

658
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,153
There's some
beautiful forms happening

659
00:29:18,205 --> 00:29:20,339
with the ears flowing
out of the head.

660
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:22,024
This is sort of like a cartoon.

661
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:25,511
Yeah.

662
00:29:25,545 --> 00:29:28,297
Can you just turn?
I'm looking at this arm.

663
00:29:28,348 --> 00:29:30,099
And there's totally
arbitrary surfacing

664
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,917
that I just don't understand.

665
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:33,502
The shapes of the bones
are not even wrong

666
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:34,837
in a cartoony way.

667
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:36,255
- Yeah.
- They're just completely wrong.

668
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:39,441
Our character is definitely
the least whimsical.

669
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:42,278
But there's a small chance
they'll love it.

670
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:45,097
I just want to survive.

671
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:47,366
We want to know what you think

672
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,068
of tonight's transformations.

673
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:52,121
So tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

674
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,754
- The scapula comes down.
- That bothers me as well.

675
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:58,038
The shapes of the bones,

676
00:29:58,056 --> 00:29:59,707
they're not even wrong
in a cartoony way.

677
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:01,909
- Yeah.
- They're just completely wrong.

678
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:03,694
I'm very, very nervous.

679
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:05,346
This is a double elimination
this week and

680
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,981
that's what got me eliminated
on season four,

681
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,017
and I don't want to go home.

682
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:12,791
_

683
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,839
_

684
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:16,523
He's got to like
that sculpture.

685
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:17,890
_

686
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:20,010
_

687
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:21,740
_

688
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:24,398
I think they're smiling.

689
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,036
Nice paint job, guys.

690
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,655
There are a ton of awesome
sculptural decisions

691
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,573
in that head.

692
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:33,988
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus, yeah.

693
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:35,877
_

694
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,745
And let's see the other side.

695
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:40,781
The stuff with the pumpkin
seeds hanging off of it's great.

696
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:44,535
Hey.

697
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,036
She's the girl in the Moon.

698
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:49,023
Let's have you open your mouth.

699
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,324
Oh, this is great.

700
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:52,226
Look, she can actually move
her face really well.

701
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,795
My only complaint is that it
doesn't quite look

702
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,297
like the Moon's surface.

703
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:59,283
I agree.

704
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:05,306
Okay, the judges have scored
your creations.

705
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,109
Roy, RJ...

706
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:11,412
Eddie, and Scott...

707
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:13,681
Congratulations, you are safe

708
00:31:13,715 --> 00:31:16,750
and can head
back to the makeup room.

709
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:20,004
God, that makes me so nervous.

710
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,605
And the rest of you
were the best

711
00:31:21,656 --> 00:31:23,424
and the worst of the week.

712
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,109
The judges will now speak
with each of you

713
00:31:25,143 --> 00:31:26,727
to lean more about your work.

714
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:29,563
Alana and Laney,
you're up first.

715
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:34,802
Start telling me
about this work.

716
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:37,421
Our poem was The Five Pigs.

717
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:40,090
Alana did the face,
and I did the chest.

718
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:42,009
Alana made the bow
out of silicone.

719
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:45,212
- Silicone.
- And the rest is foam latex.

720
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:47,214
The whimsy is very apparent,

721
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:49,550
and it's a picture
of porcine perfection.

722
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:51,402
- Thank you.
- The chest and face

723
00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:52,569
managed to look like
they were done

724
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,355
by the same person.

725
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:56,357
Awesome stuff, guys.

726
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:58,025
She's very sweet, I got to say.

727
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:00,160
It's very clever
with her belly.

728
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:02,296
And we even addressed the fact
that she has hooves.

729
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,031
Great choice of wardrobe.

730
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:06,750
And her chest gives a whole new
meaning to pulled pork.

731
00:32:06,785 --> 00:32:08,419
Oh, yes.

732
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:11,238
This little piggy sizzles.

733
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:14,808
But I think the white wig
confused me a touch.

734
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:16,610
It felt a little poodle-like.

735
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,245
But you did a good job
maintaining

736
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,479
her swine-like anatomy.

737
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:20,481
She is a beaut.

738
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:21,598
Thank you so much, guys.

739
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,999
- Thank you.
- You can step down.

740
00:32:29,124 --> 00:32:32,125
Frank and Laura, you're next.

741
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,866
So tell us about your creation.

742
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,768
We had "Little Miss Muffet."

743
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:42,920
We decided to give the spider
his story

744
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:45,005
from his point of view.

745
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,290
I would have liked
to have seen something

746
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,708
that brought Miss Muffet
into this

747
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:50,928
and not just a spider
by itself.

748
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:53,063
The fact that your whimsy
has to do

749
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:54,081
with your spider coloration

750
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,399
I think was a poor choice.

751
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,351
It doesn't read whimsical.

752
00:32:57,385 --> 00:32:59,319
It reads "A man and a spider
put together."

753
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:03,257
I just don't think
it suits the challenge.

754
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,159
I think you got lost
on trying to blow us away

755
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,093
with a really big makeup
this week

756
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:10,614
and missed the fantastical
and the whimsical.

757
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:12,032
Also, the paint needs
so much more detail,

758
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:14,201
so much more time.

759
00:33:14,235 --> 00:33:16,737
It just doesn't play well.

760
00:33:16,771 --> 00:33:18,539
Thank you.
If you'd please step back.

761
00:33:18,573 --> 00:33:21,575
Thanks, buddy.

762
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:26,880
Lyma and Adolfo.

763
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:34,421
Tell us what the concept is
behind the story.

764
00:33:34,456 --> 00:33:35,439
She's kind of, like,

765
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,374
a reincarnation
of Humpty Dumpty.

766
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,109
A Lady Gaga reincarnation.

767
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,829
Like a female and stronger
version of Humpty.

768
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:42,880
Who did what?

769
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:44,965
I sculpted the cowl,
the chest piece,

770
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:46,467
and I did the arm pieces,

771
00:33:46,501 --> 00:33:48,368
and I painted the base
of the body.

772
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:52,205
And Lyma sculpted the face,
did all the plastic part of it,

773
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:55,108
and she did
all the airbrush work.

774
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:58,145
This is a beautiful rendition
of Humpty Dumpty.

775
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:02,499
I like that you got
beauty makeup

776
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,568
into the makeup as well.

777
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:06,403
I'm really pleased
with what you've done.

778
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:07,905
Thank you very much.

779
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:10,424
I'm very pleased with this.
It's very stylized.

780
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,925
I will say, Lyma,

781
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,810
do not just keep holding
stencils up

782
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:16,263
and giving me the same pattern
all over the body.

783
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:17,597
Other than that,

784
00:34:17,615 --> 00:34:19,933
I feel like we could see this
in a film right now.

785
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:21,034
Well done.

786
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:23,170
Thank you so much.

787
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:26,190
If you'd please step back.

788
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,212
Rick and Eric,
please come forward.

789
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,036
All right, guys,

790
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,188
go ahead and tell me
about your design ideas.

791
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:43,190
Well, we drew
the crooked sixpence.

792
00:34:43,224 --> 00:34:45,826
It describes the crooked man
who walked a crooked mile.

793
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,694
He was a handsome man,

794
00:34:47,729 --> 00:34:51,048
and as he started to deform,
he became rejected by society.

795
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,983
Rick sculpted
the back and chest.

796
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:56,053
He also blocked out this arm
and this arm piece.

797
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:59,223
I sculpted the face entirely.

798
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:02,492
My big problem with it
is the idea.

799
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:07,948
It's neither completely real
or completely fantastical.

800
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,383
- Right.
- Also, the fact that his arm

801
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:12,302
is sort of just jammed
on the back of him,

802
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:13,453
very abrupt.

803
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:14,738
It doesn't look like his arm
to me.

804
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:16,690
It looks like an extra arm.

805
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:19,059
That's bad.

806
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:20,226
You know, when I looked
at this guy,

807
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:21,411
I didn't see a crooked man.

808
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:22,663
I saw a twisted man.

809
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:26,366
If you would've done him
really angular crooked,

810
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:28,135
then that would've been
whimsical.

811
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,754
I just think you guys missed
the mark on this totally.

812
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:32,289
Right.

813
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,941
Thank you.
You can step down.

814
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:35,702
Thanks, boy.

815
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:40,864
Tate and Miranda,
please step forward.

816
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,721
Okay, tell us
about your Nursery Rhyme

817
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:50,123
and who was responsible
for which parts

818
00:35:50,158 --> 00:35:51,141
of your character, please.

819
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:53,293
We had "Peter, Peter,
the pumpkin eater".

820
00:35:53,328 --> 00:35:56,063
Tate sketched out the design
of the face first,

821
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:57,764
and I blocked out the cowl
and the face

822
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:58,832
and did a lot of the sculpting.

823
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,835
Tate did the hands
and the body,

824
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,171
and I did the head.

825
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,139
I think you knocked it
out of the park.

826
00:36:06,174 --> 00:36:09,643
This is really
a fantastic character.

827
00:36:09,677 --> 00:36:10,677
Yay.

828
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:12,446
I mean, every little detail
on this

829
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,014
reads whimsy and fantastical.

830
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,650
And I think you did
a great job.

831
00:36:16,684 --> 00:36:19,453
The decision-making
in the sculpture on the face,

832
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:23,223
where the smile happens
through wrinkle texture,

833
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:25,725
and it's not carved out,
it looks organic.

834
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:26,927
It looks like a pumpkin.

835
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,962
It's really impressive, guys.
Well done.

836
00:36:28,997 --> 00:36:31,164
Thank you so much.

837
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,201
If you'd please step back.

838
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:37,604
Thank you, guys.

839
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,339
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

840
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:42,376
while the judges make
their decisions.

841
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:46,513
All right, judges,
so why don't we start

842
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:48,215
with some of your
favorite looks tonight?

843
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,550
How about Alana and Laney's
character?

844
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,586
This definitely was high
on the whimsy mark for me.

845
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,587
Mm-hmm.

846
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:55,889
If it was just a pig makeup,

847
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,891
it wouldn't have been
whimsical.

848
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,259
It's the wig and the bow

849
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:00,744
and Alana's sense of humor
coming through.

850
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:02,529
And from a makeup standpoint,

851
00:37:02,563 --> 00:37:05,399
it was some of the best work
that I've seen Alana do.

852
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:08,635
Let's talk about Adolfo
and Lyma's character.

853
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,370
I loved that makeup.

854
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:12,339
I loved the whole head treatment
with the cracked egg...

855
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:14,007
- Yeah.
- ...and all the different layers.

856
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:15,909
I liked that they added
the couture element,

857
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,277
that they made it
a little runway.

858
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:18,278
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

859
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:19,279
That was kind of cool.

860
00:37:19,313 --> 00:37:20,313
Let's move on

861
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:22,382
to Tate
and Miranda's character.

862
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,985
The decisions in the sculpting
and the paint job

863
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,553
are so intelligent.

864
00:37:26,587 --> 00:37:28,254
Miranda's sculpting's
beautiful.

865
00:37:28,272 --> 00:37:29,623
Beautifully painted.

866
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:31,958
A head-to-toe
complete makeup.

867
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:33,960
The textures,
everything was weathered

868
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:35,228
to the same level.

869
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:36,313
Which is extremely impressive.

870
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:37,681
All right, so why don't we talk

871
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:39,999
about the makeups
that you didn't like as much?

872
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:42,185
Let's start
with Frank and Laura.

873
00:37:42,236 --> 00:37:45,539
I felt that the fact
that it was just a "spider man"

874
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,507
wasn't very inventive.

875
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:49,309
And I think they're definitely

876
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:50,777
much more creative than that.

877
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:51,911
Why didn't they do something

878
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,613
where part of it was
Miss Muffet

879
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:54,865
and part of it was the spider

880
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,284
and make it real whimsical
and fairytale-like?

881
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,419
Okay, let's move on
to Rick and Eric.

882
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:01,121
It wasn't whimsical.

883
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:02,389
It was freaky and scary.

884
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,825
The fact that the arm was just
jammed on the back,

885
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,059
it killed me.

886
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:07,844
And when you get
up into the face area,

887
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:10,130
you're struggling with paint
and sculpture.

888
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,948
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

889
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,333
- Yeah.
- Yes, we have.

890
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:14,835
Let's bring them back out.

891
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,411
So, Glenn, tell us
about the top teams.

892
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:26,580
Alana and Laney,

893
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:30,167
your pig was a very impressive
character, head to toe.

894
00:38:30,218 --> 00:38:32,335
We really appreciate
the amount of thought and work

895
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:34,171
that went into this makeup.

896
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:36,957
Tate and Miranda,
this was a killer design

897
00:38:36,991 --> 00:38:39,176
and a beautifully executed
makeup.

898
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,928
We absolutely loved
the sculpture, the paint,

899
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:43,964
and the overall harmony
of the piece.

900
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:45,532
Lyma and Adolfo,

901
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:48,902
tonight was a huge step forward
for both of you,

902
00:38:48,936 --> 00:38:51,772
and we can easily imagine
your egg creation

903
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:53,056
in a feature film.

904
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:54,975
Okay, which team came out
on top?

905
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:56,076
The top team tonight is...

906
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,674
Okay, which team came out
on top?

907
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,343
The top team tonight is...

908
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,082
Tate and Miranda.

909
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:15,018
Yeah, girl.

910
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,236
Your pumpkin was one
of the best makeups

911
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:17,788
we've ever seen on the show,

912
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,072
truly a great collaboration.

913
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,424
- Well done.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

914
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,160
Tate and Miranda, great job.

915
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,328
But as you know,
we can only have one winner.

916
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,480
Glenn?

917
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,901
Our winner tonight is...

918
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:31,902
Miranda.

919
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:35,355
- Yeah.
- Get it, girl.

920
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:36,690
It's a great makeup,

921
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,608
and though Tate's design
was very strong,

922
00:39:38,643 --> 00:39:42,345
we absolutely loved the sculpt
and paint you applied.

923
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,780
So great job.
Well done.

924
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,882
- Thank you.
- Thank you guys so much.

925
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,617
It was such a team effort.

926
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,921
But it feels great to win,
and I feel so honored.

927
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,622
Tate and Miranda,
congratulations.

928
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,892
You, Alana, Laney,
Adolfo, Lyma,

929
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,861
you're all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

930
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,170
Unfortunately, that means
the rest of you

931
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:08,772
are on the bottom this week,

932
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,908
and two of you
will be going home.

933
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,910
Please step forward.

934
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,053
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

935
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,354
Rick and Eric,

936
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,957
your character was
anatomically incorrect

937
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,725
and did not fulfill
the whimsical aspect

938
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,126
of this challenge.

939
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,494
Frank and Laura,

940
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:34,397
your spider creature lacked
detail in its paint,

941
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,700
and your concept also failed
to satisfy the criteria

942
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,368
of this challenge.

943
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:41,938
So who is the first person
going home tonight?

944
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,407
The first person going home
tonight is...

945
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,296
Rick.

946
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,447
We thought
that you were missing

947
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,816
some basic anatomy
in your work tonight,

948
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,817
and we really questioned

949
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,987
the design choices
that you made.

950
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,005
Rick, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

951
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,441
It's really been great having
you here with us.

952
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,609
Thank you.

953
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,362
I saw some really cool stuff
from you.

954
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,364
Hold your head high,
and good luck in the future.

955
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,765
Thank you, sir.

956
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,867
Rick, if you'd please head
back to the makeup room

957
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,987
and pack up your kit.

958
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,655
I'm not ready to go home,

959
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,008
but there's no regrets.

960
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,710
Being a part of this competition
has been a dream come true.

961
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,629
It's really pushed me
as an artist.

962
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,214
And I'll take all those things
home with me

963
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,250
as well as the relationships
that I've formed.

964
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,656
Glenn, who is the second person

965
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,890
leaving us tonight?

966
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,660
The second person going home
tonight is...

967
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,732
Eric.

968
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,834
We felt that
your facial sculpture

969
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:47,904
simply did not embrace
the crooked nature

970
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,406
of our challenge tonight.

971
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,074
It just wasn't taken
far enough.

972
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:54,794
Thank you guys so much
for this opportunity.

973
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:58,448
Eric, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

974
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:02,402
That means, Frank, Laura,
you are safe this week.

975
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,586
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room.

976
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:10,560
Eric, this was
a really tough week.

977
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,362
There were so many great
makeups.

978
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,097
And you should be proud
of everything that you've done

979
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,198
here with us.

980
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,300
Thank you very much, Ve.

981
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,836
Eric, it's really been great
having you here with us.

982
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,338
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

983
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,539
and pack up your kit.

984
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,523
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

985
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:27,043
Good luck, Eric.

986
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:28,094
I'm going home now,

987
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,596
but there's a lot
to be proud of.

988
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,949
This has all very much been
a way to push myself.

989
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,752
- I'm going home, guys.
- No!

990
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:36,819
I'm glad I came back.

991
00:42:36,837 --> 00:42:38,488
I was very blessed to have been

992
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,889
a part of <i>Face Off.</i>

993
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,891
I have this extended family
of artists because of it.

994
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,159
- Bring it in, brother.
- Hey, buddy.

995
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,744
We're going together, man.

996
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,163
I'm very proud of what I've been
able to accomplish.

997
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:50,000
I can only benefit
from having been here.

998
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,335
There is a whole career
out there for me.

999
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,871
And I know that I have a lot
to offer this industry.

1000
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,171
I'm definitely not giving up.
