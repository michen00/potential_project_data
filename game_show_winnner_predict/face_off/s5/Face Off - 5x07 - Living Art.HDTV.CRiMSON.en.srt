1
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:03,744
Previously, on Face Off...

2
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:08,501
Tate's spooky skeleton
brought him to victory...

3
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:09,703
Yeah.

4
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:12,339
And Lyma was sent home.

5
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:14,274
Now, nine artists remain,

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,244
and tonight, they'll
greet a bombshell guest...

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:19,012
Elvira.

8
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:20,647
Get the fuck out.

9
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:21,648
And face a challenge

10
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:22,916
of artistic sophistication...

11
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,017
There's these beautiful
paintings.

12
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:25,385
I'm really excited.

13
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,855
And for some,
it spells disaster.

14
00:00:27,889 --> 00:00:30,357
Mr. Westmore,
where are you?

15
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:31,658
Oh, shit.

16
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:34,294
- Medic!
- There is blood everywhere.

17
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:38,498
- So damn good.
- For me, it doesn't work.

18
00:00:38,532 --> 00:00:40,800
I think the entire thing
was a mistake.

19
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,603
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

20
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:45,239
from Kryolan
Professional Makeup

21
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:48,375
to one of their 85
international locations,

22
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,778
a 2013 Fiat 500,

23
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:55,148
and $100,000 dollars.

24
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:58,252
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

25
00:00:58,286 --> 00:01:00,921
Only one will win Face Off.

26
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,057

27
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,099
Ay, yi-yi-yi.

28
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,468
At this point, we've been
through six challenges.

29
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,970
I'm 52 years old,
and, boy, right now,

30
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:54,207
my body feels every day
of those years.

31
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:57,544
Bottom three times in a row,
so I'm going to try and go big.

32
00:01:57,578 --> 00:01:58,545
Go big or go home?

33
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,413
Yeah.

34
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,654
I'm walking into the lab,

35
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,155
and there's candelabras
everywhere,

36
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,624
and all of the models are here,

37
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:13,826
so I'm wondering what
this challenge is going to be.

38
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,129
From Batman to Sherlock Holmes,

39
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:17,997
makeup artists
are often asked to reinvent

40
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,400
an iconic character
for new audiences,

41
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,535
so in this challenge,
you'll reinvent

42
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,373
one of the most unforgettable
characters of all time.

43
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:29,142
She'll be appearing soon
on SyFy's new series, Fangasm,

44
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:32,145
but you know her
as the Hostess of Horror

45
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:33,813
and Mistress of the Dark,

46
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:35,382
Elvira.

47
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,885
Oh, my God.

48
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,853
Get the fuck out.

49
00:02:40,888 --> 00:02:43,723
- I have chills.
- Oh, I love her.

50
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:47,193
Elvira is an icon
of sex, beauty,

51
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:49,061
and all the things I love most.

52
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:51,498
Thank you so much
for being here.

53
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:54,367
It's a thrill to be here.
It's one of my favorite shows.

54
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:57,103
Well, your look is so iconic.

55
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:00,407
What is it that makes it
so classic and memorable?

56
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,642
Well, there's, you know,
a couple of big things.

57
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:06,746
That would probably be
my eyes, which, you know,

58
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:08,415
have a lot of color going on,

59
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,084
and of course,
my vivacious personality.

60
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:14,921
All right,
so your foundation challenge

61
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:18,057
is to create your own
Mistress of the Dark

62
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:20,694
worthy of Elvira's legacy.

63
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:22,161
So awesome.

64
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:24,230
So, as the judge
of today's challenge,

65
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:25,598
what are you going to be
looking for from these guys?

66
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:28,768
I am going to be looking
for a hip, young, cool,

67
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,870
edgy take on my look.

68
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:32,639
All right, now each of you

69
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:34,106
will get some assistance

70
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:37,109
from a professional hair stylist
to complete your looks...

71
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,545
- Ooh, wow.
- Oh, wow.

72
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,413
I don't do hair,
so it's going to be really cool

73
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,248
to have somebody there
that we can tell what we want

74
00:03:42,282 --> 00:03:43,916
and have them create it for us.

75
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:45,385
And we have two big prizes
at stake today.

76
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,687
The winner will
take home immunity,

77
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:50,657
and you will also get
an incredible Kryolan Makeup kit

78
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:52,325
full of supplies.

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,728
- Ooh, that's cool.
- Oh, wow.

80
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:57,897
I could definitely use that
prize, and I'm dying for it.

81
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:00,233
Kryolan has also
generously stocked the lab

82
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,868
with everything that you
could possibly need

83
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:03,269
to accomplish this challenge.

84
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:05,505
You'll have two hours
to complete your looks.

85
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:09,476
Good luck, guys,
because your time starts...

86
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,910
- now.
- Eek!

87
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,384
Maybe kind of bring this up
and twist it?

88
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,819
My hair stylist knows
more beauty makeup than I do,

89
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:21,654
so I'm taking advice from her.

90
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:22,922
I like what you're doing
with the hair right now, though.

91
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:24,120
Good, good, good.

92
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:27,293
For my modern Elvira,

93
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:29,996
I grabbed some awesome
Kryolan eyelashes.

94
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,464
I think they'll be
a fun addition.

95
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,602
I remember watching Elvira
with my dad when I was younger,

96
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:38,070
so my concept's the creature
from the Black Lagoon.

97
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,106
I got a lot of area to cover,
so to be able to do it

98
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,008
in two hours,
it's going to be really hard.

99
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:48,114
Elvira's known for her comedy,

100
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:50,850
so I'm thinking
bride of Frankenstein

101
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,585
meets sexy nurse.

102
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:56,456
So my concept
is to create Elvira's

103
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,757
long-lost cousin, Elmira.

104
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,091
Look there for me.

105
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,327
The idea's to do bat wings
into the makeup

106
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,897
and cut a wig that has
the bat wing scallops into it,

107
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,900
and fabricate a little
bat epaulet for the shoulder.

108
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:09,135
Ten minutes, guys!

109
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:19,045
Time is up!
Put your brushes down!

110
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,914
- Hi, Miranda.
- Hi.

111
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,348
So explain to us
what you did today.

112
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,250
I saw this dress,
and I thought it was stunning,

113
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:27,019
and I wanted to make the makeup
glamorous as well.

114
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:29,556
I love the shading.
I wish I could do it that way.

115
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,024
It sort of looks like Elvira
meets Metropolis.

116
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,059
Thank you so much.

117
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:34,527
This is Nurse Cutter.

118
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,162
She hosts the late-night
horror double feature

119
00:05:36,196 --> 00:05:37,464
at the local insane asylum.

120
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:39,466
I love this, like, like,
Nurse Elvira,

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,433
creepy and scary.

122
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:42,902
The thing around the neck
is amazing.

123
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:45,738
I didn't want any
real healthy color in her face.

124
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,741
I love, love the outfit
and the skin color.

125
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:51,578
I'm not quite getting as much
of the whole gothic look.

126
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:55,849
You're going edgier
and more modern, so I get it.

127
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:57,383
I looked up your family tree

128
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,952
and found your
long-lost cousin, Elmira.

129
00:05:58,986 --> 00:06:00,319
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:02,655
And Elmira really loves bats,

131
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,123
and so she has
this whole bat motif going on.

132
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:05,525
Yeah.
I really like...

133
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,326
You can see
the bat motif there.

134
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:08,862
I love the bottom lashes.

135
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,229
I should flip mine upside down.

136
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:12,131
I'm getting makeup tips here.

137
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:14,467
Anyway, awesome job.
Very cool take.

138
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:17,003
It's so cool to look
around the room and see

139
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:20,406
where everybody's creativity has
taken them on this challenge.

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,541
I love it.

141
00:06:21,575 --> 00:06:24,110
So who created your favorites?

142
00:06:24,144 --> 00:06:27,346
I think they all did
fantastic, but with Roy,

143
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,616
there was the spooky,
there was the sexy,

144
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,850
and there was the humor.

145
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,820
And, Tate, the nurse
was very scary,

146
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:36,322
also had an element of humor.

147
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:37,924
A great mix
that captured Elvira.

148
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,158
All right, then.

149
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,895
Who is the winner
of today's challenge?

150
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:46,365
The winner
of today's challenge is...

151
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,834
Roy.

152
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,702
Oh, my God.

153
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:51,004
I can't believe it.

154
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,907
Roy won because
that combination of sexy,

155
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:55,241
spooky, and funny.

156
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:58,044
I love it.
Roy, congratulations.

157
00:06:58,078 --> 00:06:59,612
Thank you so much.

158
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,380
As the winner of today's
foundation challenge,

159
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:02,982
you not only have immunity,

160
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,852
but you also won a beautiful
Kryolan Makeup case

161
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,386
full of supplies.

162
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:09,088
Having this kit
is going to be really cool

163
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:10,389
if I can keep my wife
out of it.

164
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:12,358
She likes makeup
just as much as I do.

165
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,260
All right, you guys,
I will see you tomorrow

166
00:07:14,294 --> 00:07:16,362
for your next
spotlight challenge.

167
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:19,165
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Elvira.

168
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:36,649
- Ooh.
- Oh, I like this challenge.

169
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,350
It's really neat.

170
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,286
So we walk into this room
that looks like a gallery space,

171
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,420
and I see McKenzie and Neville,

172
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,889
and there's
these beautiful paintings,

173
00:07:42,923 --> 00:07:44,156
and I'm really excited

174
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:46,626
'cause I'm
a huge art history buff.

175
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,597
Welcome to the world-famous
Pacific Design Center,

176
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:53,499
home to some of the biggest
names in contemporary art.

177
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,334
Professionals working
in film and television

178
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:57,303
are often called upon
to take a certain style

179
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,171
or period in history and use it

180
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,107
as a catalyst to create
something original.

181
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,375
So on these walls
are paintings that represent

182
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,111
iconic art movements.

183
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:09,048
Cubism, surrealism, pop art,

184
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,951
expressionism,
and constructivism.

185
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:14,921
Your spotlight challenge
is to select one of these

186
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:17,023
iconic art movements
and create a character

187
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,524
that could live within it.

188
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:20,026
That's rad.

189
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,761
I've daydreamed
about this challenge,

190
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:23,462
so I'm super-excited.

191
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,131
All right, so Neville
might be best known

192
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,233
as a creature designer
on some of Hollywood's

193
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:30,536
biggest films, but his art
has also been featured

194
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,006
in exhibits and galleries
all over the world.

195
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,908
So, Neville, what's most
important to consider

196
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:38,410
when working
with a certain style of art?

197
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,479
Well, you have to be faithful
and well-versed in it,

198
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,414
so you know how to bend
the rules and manipulate it

199
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:45,018
into your own,
and it needs to feel like

200
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:47,353
an attractive
piece of living art.

201
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:48,888
Okay, guys, take a look around.

202
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,990
When you find an art movement
that you like,

203
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,526
grab its card and start
working on your design.

204
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,527
Good luck, guys.

205
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,895
- Bye.
- Thank you.

206
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:57,793
I know what I want.

207
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,533
I'm moving around this gallery,

208
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,935
and the one that
I'm completely unfamiliar with

209
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,071
is constructivism.

210
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:06,272
I used to work construction,

211
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:08,841
so maybe this
is somehow correlated.

212
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:17,116
Immediately,
I have to get that pop art.

213
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:20,153
I want her to be a living piece
of social media.

214
00:09:20,187 --> 00:09:23,122
I want to do a sculpt
and then vacu-form that,

215
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,558
so when she comes out,
she takes her face off,

216
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,560
and she'll have a completely
different paint job

217
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,195
underneath of it.

218
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,032
I picked cubism.

219
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,634
So far, I've got a man
in a top hat.

220
00:09:35,669 --> 00:09:37,536
He's a period piece,

221
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:41,507
but the modern, brightly
colored, cubism version.

222
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,611
I went straight
for expressionism.

223
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:47,646
I've always been a fan
of Van Gogh.

224
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,816
Starry Night is one
of the most famous paintings,

225
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,317
so I'm taking inspiration
from that.

226
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:53,352
My concept
is "Stressful Night,"

227
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:56,089
and I want to merge
flesh tones into reds

228
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:58,557
as symbolism for stress.

229
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,761
I chose surrealism.

230
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:03,896
I want to take symbolic pieces

231
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,398
and do this fortress crumbling,

232
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,434
and then I have this bulb
underneath

233
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,269
that releases the actress.

234
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,172
All right, let's go.

235
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:14,607
We're going back to the lab,

236
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,909
and I think I've made
a bad choice

237
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,010
thinking that constructivism

238
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:19,879
has anything to do
with construction,

239
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:21,948
and I don't get it.

240
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:30,189
So we get to the lab.
We've got six hours today.

241
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:33,192
First thing we have to do
is pick our models.

242
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:35,128
I know a little bit
about surrealism,

243
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:38,030
and I'm thinking about
creating a tribute to my dad.

244
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,766
My dad was an alcoholic,

245
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,201
and he died
of consequences of that,

246
00:10:42,236 --> 00:10:45,104
and I'm putting
some of my stresses

247
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,839
into my character here,

248
00:10:46,874 --> 00:10:49,208
so it could be
a little bizarre.

249
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:51,510
Tate.

250
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:54,313
- What's up?
- Does that look cubism-ish?

251
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:57,583
I'm thinking that I'm going
to do this female musician

252
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:59,852
who's forlorn because
she lives through her music,

253
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:01,854
and once she stops, she dies.

254
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:03,956
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

255
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,126
Constructivism emphasizes
the use of materials,

256
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:09,361
so my concept is a statue

257
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:11,330
that's got an iron beam
pointing downwards,

258
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,666
which symbolizes
the fall of iron

259
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,134
and the rise of plastics.

260
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:19,172
I'm having such a hard time
with this.

261
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:20,606
Just like...

262
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,276
I chose something
I didn't know anything about.

263
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,711
Alana's getting lost
in second-guessing herself,

264
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:27,546
and there's just really
no time for that.

265
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,182
Back to the drawing board.

266
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:30,983
I've spent three hours
of this challenge

267
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:33,119
trying to understand
what the challenge is.

268
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:34,687
I'm running out of time.

269
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:36,689
I've got to get
this concept on the way,

270
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:38,557
or else I'm going to go home.

271
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:42,728
Mr. Westmore,
where are you?

272
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:44,263
Coming up...

273
00:11:44,298 --> 00:11:45,631
I'm not going to tell you
how to do it, that's not--

274
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,099
No, I'm not asking you
to tell me how to do it.

275
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:48,835
I'm scared.
I don't want to go yet.

276
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,436
So damn good.

277
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,972
I don't see how you could be
so incredibly wrong.

278
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,402
Oh, my God.

279
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:00,669
Our challenge
is to create a character

280
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,372
that represents
a specific art movement.

281
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:07,876
My movement is constructivism,
but I'm a little confused.

282
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,412
I don't have
another minute to waste,

283
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:11,747
and I'm finally just like, "God,
send me Mr. Westmore, please,

284
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,182
'cause I am so lost."

285
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,351
Fuck.

286
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:21,790
This giant castle piece
is going to be really heavy,

287
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,527
so I'm going to hollow it out
to make it as light as possible.

288
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,529
That face is so cool.
Nice.

289
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,102
- Hey, everybody!
- Hey!

290
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,570
- How are you?
- Hi!

291
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:35,971
Here to do a walkthrough.

292
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,806
- Hey, Scott.
- Hello.

293
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,375
- So what did you pick?
- Surrealism.

294
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:42,478
So this is a volcano,
based off of my dad.

295
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,513
The volcano represents
his volcanic temper,

296
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:45,948
especially when he drank.

297
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:47,816
He's going to be
carrying a birdcage

298
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,285
with a giant ear in it,

299
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:52,288
because he had trouble hearing,

300
00:12:52,322 --> 00:12:53,789
and he's also going
to have a crutch,

301
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,224
which is going to be
a cigarette.

302
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,193
I mean, you've got all
of the elements there.

303
00:12:57,227 --> 00:13:00,662
I'm just concerned that you
don't get it too busy.

304
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,931
- Yeah.
- Maybe simplify a few things.

305
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,700
Expressionism is what I have.

306
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,569
That's where
the artists of the time

307
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,904
would use odd shapes to show
what they were feeling,

308
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:10,973
so I'm gonna take my model
and have the world

309
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:12,241
wrapped around her

310
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:13,842
to the point where
her head wants to explode.

311
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,010
Mm-hmm.

312
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,612
This needs to really be shaded

313
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:21,417
to be able to airbrush
these explosion type of marks

314
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:22,418
that are going to occur.

315
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:23,586
Thank you very much.

316
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,753
You're a godsend,
I swear to you.

317
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:25,787
Okay.

318
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,256
I stupidly picked
constructivism

319
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,425
because I thought it
was architecturally driven,

320
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,293
which is something
I have a heavy background in.

321
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,329
You know, what you're doing
here, the squared-off shapes

322
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,963
and things like that,
it's good.

323
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:36,198
Just take away
the human features.

324
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,500
Okay.

325
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,201
You don't want two eyes,
a nose, and a chin.

326
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,803
I think I'm going to eliminate
the facial features

327
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,806
almost completely,
and make this into

328
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,809
more of a bended metal
shape of a person.

329
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:49,178
I chose expressionism.

330
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,247
My base inspiration
is Van Gogh,

331
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,981
and I'm doing a gradation
of lush colors

332
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,317
on the front of the face
to reds.

333
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:56,718
The thing is,
with Starry Night,

334
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,489
that deep blue is such
a predominant color.

335
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:03,925
By going into reds,
it's not going to convey

336
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,628
your concept of Starry Night.

337
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,996
All right, guys, we're
heading out, but good luck.

338
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:08,997
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

339
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:10,533
- Bye.
- Bye.

340
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,707
As usual, I'm one
of the first people

341
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:20,276
getting my sculptures done.

342
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,244
I'm feeling pretty good
about where I stand.

343
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,512
I have a lot of stuff to build,

344
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:25,814
but it all seems
to be coming together well.

345
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,318
Really, really nice.

346
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:31,053
I feel like cubism was created

347
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,855
because people wanted
to transcend 2-D art.

348
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,325
Cubism is three-dimensional
squares.

349
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,026
You can't think of this
as a makeup.

350
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:39,928
You have to think of this
as a work of art.

351
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,363
It's looking great, man.

352
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:55,578
All right guys, it's time!

353
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:56,912
Ha ha.

354
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,681
At the end of the day,

355
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:01,317
I really am feeling a lot
more passionate about my piece.

356
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,819
I think I have
some really good ideas,

357
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:06,455
and I have quite a bit of work
to do tomorrow,

358
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,291
but I got this.

359
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,301
This is day two
of our living art challenge.

360
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,636
We have 9 1/2 hours in the lab.

361
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,070
Look at that, Eddie.

362
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,905
I don't even have to clean out
the fucking mold.

363
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,941
That is perfect.

364
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,317
Today, I head straight
into the cowl.

365
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,720
I take vacu-form plastic

366
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:39,388
and I start melting it
over a head.

367
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:41,923
I then take foamcore.

368
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,227
Foamcore
is very stiff cardboard,

369
00:15:45,262 --> 00:15:49,131
so I end up building
this gigantic... thing.

370
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,500
I'm very excited to see
how it'll look.

371
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,440
Bye, Tate.
See you in a couple weeks.

372
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:02,278
Screw you, Roy.

373
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:04,780
I get my castle finished.
It looks really good.

374
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:07,516
So I'm going to get it
blocked up for molding.

375
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,151
I make a gigantic mold.

376
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:11,754
I mean, we're easily
talking close to 300 pounds

377
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:13,822
of clay inside it.

378
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,526
It's a huge piece,
so I've got to hurry up.

379
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,330
Do you think I should
use that or the wig?

380
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:22,564
I'm not going to tell you
how to do it, that's not--

381
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,266
No, I'm not asking you
to tell me how to do it.

382
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,435
I'm just asking if you
think this hair looks odd.

383
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,504
I don't think
I want to keep this hair,

384
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,272
because I feel like
it really looks too much

385
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:33,342
like a robot,
and not this female musician.

386
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:34,543
They both will be fine.

387
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,778
I'm sure that they're both
going to be awesome.

388
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,079
Okay.

389
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:39,315
I'm a little bit behind,

390
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,116
and that's not a place
I want to be

391
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,819
when I have so much to do.

392
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:46,522
Today, I'm working
on the bodysuit,

393
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:49,491
creating all the bulges
where the world is squeezing in.

394
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:51,860
So what I want to do
is create a fat suit.

395
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:53,895
And then I start
wrapping the L200,

396
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,931
so I know where pieces
need to lay,

397
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,300
and then I actually take another
bodysuit and put over that.

398
00:16:58,335 --> 00:16:59,968
So that way, then,
I have, like, this flesh suit

399
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:03,939
that I can paint
and match her flesh color.

400
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,011
My mold is ready to crack open,

401
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:12,514
so I go to tip it over.

402
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,685
Agh. Whew.

403
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,686
Oh, shit.

404
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:20,422
It completely smashes my hand.

405
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,858
Shit.

406
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:25,160
My finger looks like
a bloody hot dog bun.

407
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:27,028
I'm going to need
a few stitches.

408
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:28,964
There's blood
absolutely everywhere.

409
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:32,401
- Shit, Tate!
- Yeah.

410
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,337
Oh, my God.
Medic!

411
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:37,639
Oh, fuck.
My finger's not working.

412
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:40,208
It's completely numb and dead,
and I can't tough it out.

413
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,811
Oh, my God, are you okay?

414
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,947
This is a terrible point
for it to happen,

415
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,416
because I went huge.

416
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,050
I'm really, really worried.

417
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:50,318
I don't even know
if he's going to clear me

418
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:53,489
to come back
to the competition.

419
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,257
So the medic looks
at my finger and said,

420
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,821
"We've got to get this kid
to the doctor right now."

421
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,990
We need to take him to
Emergency Care right now.

422
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,162
And then he wraps me up,
and they send a van,

423
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:08,465
and they're like,
"You're out of here."

424
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,333
I don't know how long
I'm going to be there,

425
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:12,903
but this is not something
that I can just ignore.

426
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,941
I got some time to spare here,
so let's see what we can do.

427
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:19,476
Yeah, yeah, I think
it was right here.

428
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:20,711
I'm in a good spot
with my makeup,

429
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,546
and I don't want Tate
to have to suffer

430
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,347
because he had an accident.

431
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:26,717
If we can find
another pry point here.

432
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:27,851
Roy and I
just jump into action...

433
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:29,820
There we go.
Okay.

434
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:32,109
And we open the mold.

435
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:36,126
And then anyone
who can help comes over

436
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,828
to start cleaning out clay
as well.

437
00:18:37,862 --> 00:18:41,565
It's very refreshing to know
that people do care.

438
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:56,747
When I go to open up
my cowl mold,

439
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,315
I realize it's so heavy.

440
00:18:58,349 --> 00:18:59,817
Will you help me lean it over?

441
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:01,351
I don't want to pull a Tate.

442
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:03,587
I don't have
a lot of muscles at all.

443
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:05,522
Cool. Yay!

444
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,023
Every time I have a big mold,

445
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:09,493
I have to have one of the guys
help me, which sucks,

446
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,161
but I just don't
have the muscle power.

447
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:13,029
That would have probably
taken me 12 hours.

448
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,598
Yeah.

449
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:19,336
I'm going to make
a giant cigarette

450
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,038
that my character's going to use
as a crutch or a cane.

451
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,807
So I find this big tube of foam

452
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:25,476
that's about
the right thickness,

453
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,778
and now I'm going to paint it
to look like a cigarette.

454
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:29,847
I'm feeling pretty confident

455
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:33,316
that it meets
the definition of surreal.

456
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:36,453
Whoo-hoo!

457
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:38,254
- Hey!
- What's up?

458
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:39,690
Yay!

459
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:41,992
I saved my finger.
13 stitches, though.

460
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:43,059
Come here!
Come here, come here.

461
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:44,094
Let me show you
where you're at.

462
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:45,095
I'm worried.

463
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,830
I've only got 2 1/2 hours left.

464
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,398
- Here's your molds.
- Okay.

465
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:50,133
You've got three layers
of latex in them, drying.

466
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,368
My mold is cleaned out.

467
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:53,036
They've already got
the first layer of latex in.

468
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,905
Pour your foam in 'em,
and you're good to go.

469
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,439
Thank you so much, man.

470
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:57,808
- Not a problem.
- You're great.

471
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:00,010
I'm eternally grateful
for everyone's help...

472
00:20:00,044 --> 00:20:01,678
Thank you for your help,
brother.

473
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:04,014
So I give everybody
all my love,

474
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:05,482
and then
it's right back to work.

475
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:07,784
- 2 hours, 18 minutes.
- Thank you, bud.

476
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:13,724
I finally get my cowl done,

477
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:16,393
so I start blocking out colors.

478
00:20:16,427 --> 00:20:19,162
Tomorrow, I'm going to have
to paint this entire suit,

479
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:21,899
so I need to get
as much done today

480
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,634
so I have time tomorrow
to do everything else.

481
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:25,468
That's absolutely stunning,
Laura.

482
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:29,139
I'm having a love-hate
relationship right now with it.

483
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:32,475
It's the end of day two,

484
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,546
and I'm only able to get
my surrealist pieces poured.

485
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,147
When I get in tomorrow,

486
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:38,882
if there's anything
wrong with it,

487
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:41,284
I don't have time
to make new ones.

488
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:45,155
That's time!

489
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,458
I'm trying to keep
my composure,

490
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:50,928
but I'm fairly confident

491
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:53,931
tomorrow is going to be
a train wreck.

492
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,377
It's application day,

493
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:10,313
so today I have to pull
my castle out of the mold,

494
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:11,915
I have to pull the poppy seed
out of the mold.

495
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,149
I have to hollow them out,

496
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:16,186
I have to build
a backpack harness...

497
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,590
and then I have
to put it all on my model,

498
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:23,093
and I have to paint all of it
without the use of my left hand.

499
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,995
This is the most work
I've ever tried to squeeze

500
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:26,196
into four hours.

501
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:30,333
Wow.
My cowl is thrashed.

502
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:32,970
This cool architectural design
that I've done in the neck

503
00:21:33,004 --> 00:21:34,204
is completely shredded out,

504
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:35,739
and it was one
of my favorite features.

505
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,008
I can fix this.
I can fix anything.

506
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,644
That's what I do.
I fix things.

507
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:44,848
Models!

508
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:46,984
You'll be covered in squares
and things like that.

509
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:48,184
That's amazing.

510
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:51,254
Head to toe, my model
is going to be in paint.

511
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:53,423
I will be painting everything,

512
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:56,693
because in a cubism painting,
there are brush strokes.

513
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:58,261
You can't airbrush
the entire thing.

514
00:21:58,295 --> 00:22:01,564
So this is literally
a walking piece of art.

515
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,833
We'll see if I can get it done.

516
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:04,886
God, I need more paint.

517
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:08,105
The art movement
that I have is constructivism,

518
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:10,641
which is materials
and futurism.

519
00:22:10,675 --> 00:22:11,742
There's this beam you'll hold
in one hand.

520
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:13,877
- Dude!
- It's a big tree,

521
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,378
and it's got a face in it
and the whole thing,

522
00:22:15,412 --> 00:22:17,480
so that's kind of where
I'm kind of going with this.

523
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:18,682
My pieces look good.

524
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:20,984
I mix up the base color
of my volcano,

525
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:22,418
and I paint that on
very quickly.

526
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:24,755
And then I spend a little bit
of time painting in

527
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:26,723
the fluorescent colors
for the lava,

528
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:30,194
and everything's looking
like it's on the right track.

529
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:37,701
So this needs to sit
right about there.

530
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,636
- How does it feel?
- Good.

531
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:42,605
I have a lot to do
for my pop art character,

532
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,008
but my foam pieces are perfect,

533
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:48,378
and my model is looking
super-cute.

534
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:50,113
I find
these big circle stencils,

535
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,948
and they're going to be perfect
for me to do

536
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,817
at least four dots at a time.

537
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:55,686
I feel like I could
get the paint job done

538
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,554
rather quickly.

539
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,824
I kind of psyched myself out
of some things

540
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,258
that I should have done.

541
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:05,461
I'm pretty nervous because
I only have a face piece,

542
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:07,664
and I'm thinking I could
really be in trouble this time.

543
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:09,966
I still want
to fabricate this guitar,

544
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,069
and I've never fabricated
anything before,

545
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:15,105
so I know that's going
to take me some time.

546
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:18,041
13:42!

547
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:25,615
I refill all the pieces
that are missing from my foam,

548
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,884
but I don't have
anything painted.

549
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,686
I don't think I could
feel any worse.

550
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:32,422
I'm so stressed out right now.

551
00:23:32,456 --> 00:23:33,656
All right, that's it!
Time's up!

552
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,158
Let's go!

553
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:36,359
I have never left myself

554
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,494
with this much work to do
going into last looks.

555
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,831
I'm terrified.

556
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,101
Coming up...

557
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:46,136
This is the end for me.

558
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,071
I'm scared.
I don't want to go yet.

559
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:49,706
You've got
some massive problems.

560
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:52,642
- Took my breath away.
- So damn good.

561
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:01,666
It's time for last looks.
I am so stressed out.

562
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,203
I have to paint this model's
whole body, her whole cowl.

563
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,871
I have never left myself
with this much work.

564
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,108
- You can use my airbrush.
- Thank you so much.

565
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:12,377
I don't like the way
the hair looks.

566
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,111
I don't have time
to style it at all.

567
00:24:14,146 --> 00:24:15,813
I just have to throw it on.

568
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:18,216
I just don't like this makeup.

569
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:21,186
I'm hand-painting
everything

570
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,087
because this style
was a lot of brush strokes,

571
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,056
but it's difficult
in such a short amount of time.

572
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,924
Ten minutes, everyone!

573
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,092
How the fuck
am I going to paint

574
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:29,860
that huge thing in ten minutes?

575
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:31,461
_

576
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:45,410
That's it!
Time's up!

577
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,744
Brushes down!

578
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,847
I don't think
I could feel any worse.

579
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:53,084
This is it-- I'm about
to be eliminated again.

580
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,396
Welcome to the Face Off
reveal stage.

581
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:07,498
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

582
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:10,668
Say hello
to our talented judges...

583
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:13,671
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

584
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:14,706
Good evening, guys.

585
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,173
Hey, Glenn.

586
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,576
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

587
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:20,177
- Evening.
- Hey, girl.

588
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:22,747
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

589
00:25:22,781 --> 00:25:23,981
- Hello.
- Hey, Neville.

590
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:25,416
All right, guys, so this week,

591
00:25:25,451 --> 00:25:28,519
your spotlight challenge was
to choose an iconic art movement

592
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:31,322
and create a character
that could live within it.

593
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:33,858
So let's take a look
at your living works of art

594
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:36,294
while the audience at home
tweets about their favorites,

595
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,429
using #FaceOff.

596
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,155
The paint job,
I'm really not feeling it.

597
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,856
These edges
are just God-awful.

598
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,358
This is the end.

599
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:10,161
I need to just be happy
to have been here this far.

600
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:32,049
I'm very happy
with the forms I've created,

601
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:36,454
but I'm unhappy
that my paint job is flat.

602
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,774
I'm really proud.

603
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:58,909
She looks like she jumped
out of a comic book

604
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,378
and landed on our stage.

605
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,033
I don't like this makeup.

606
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:24,569
It's totally out
of my comfort zone,

607
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:28,305
and I know I'm going to be
one of the bottom looks.

608
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:50,227
I like the asymmetry
of the sculpture

609
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,597
with the symmetry of the color.

610
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:56,166
The piece screams "Cubism."

611
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:19,724
I'm really proud of my design.

612
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:22,660
I think it looks
like a surrealist painting.

613
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:25,329
I feel confident about it.

614
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:47,952
I'm really happy
with this piece.

615
00:28:47,986 --> 00:28:52,189
I think I could easily
be top looks, or even win it.

616
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:14,612
It looks exactly the way
I envisioned it.

617
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,113
The colors really pop,

618
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:17,615
the big i-beam
with the forced perspective

619
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:19,350
achieved what I wanted it to,

620
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,719
so I think it all
came together great.

621
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:42,573
There's so much going on
with my character,

622
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:45,743
I hope they don't feel
that I ignored the challenge.

623
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:46,944
Overall, technically,

624
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:50,080
I think I pulled off
some pretty cool stuff.

625
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:56,821
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look

626
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:58,789
at tonight's living art?

627
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:09,534
I get that her left side
is more of the human,

628
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:13,404
and her right side
is more of the constructivism.

629
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:15,208
Thank you.

630
00:30:18,343 --> 00:30:20,310
I'm surprised there's
so many colors in it up close,

631
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,580
'cause from far away,
it doesn't look like it

632
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:24,448
has that many colors in it.

633
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,884
This feels so compact
and smashed together.

634
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:32,423
It definitely
does feel pop art.

635
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:36,027
I think, for me,
it's a question of execution.

636
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:41,832
- Dolly Parton meets cubism.
- Hmm.

637
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:45,102
It bums me out that she didn't
do anything to her arms.

638
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:49,273
Oh, my God, don't look
at that God-awful guitar.

639
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:51,308
Don't look at those
unpainted arms.

640
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:54,311
I'm scared.
I don't want to go yet.

641
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:58,315
Who made your favorite
living work of art tonight?

642
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:01,351
Tell us on Twitter,
using #FaceOff.

643
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:05,907
She didn't do anything
to her arms.

644
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:06,994
Yeah.

645
00:31:07,105 --> 00:31:09,792
I feel disappointed myself
about this makeup.

646
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,844
I'm quite sure
that I'm on the bottom.

647
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:13,012
It's really interesting,
though.

648
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:15,214
Yeah.
I really like it.

649
00:31:16,316 --> 00:31:18,250
What is his head
supposed to be?

650
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:20,786
A certain type
of whiskey bottle?

651
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:22,188
It seems like he's got
all these cool ideas,

652
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:24,690
but I do not like that makeup.

653
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:25,713
Yeah.

654
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,228
Another amazing paint job.

655
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,264
- It really is.
- That's a lot of colors.

656
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,835
I really like this idea

657
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:37,937
of squeezing it so tightly
that we see bulges.

658
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:39,004
That's kind of cool.

659
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,906
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

660
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:45,978
I like this thing.
I like the forced perspective.

661
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:48,480
Yeah, it's fantastic.

662
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,184
As much as I dig
what's going on,

663
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:55,787
I'm not quite sure if this
design fits surrealism.

664
00:31:55,822 --> 00:31:58,324
I agree.

665
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:04,096
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

666
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,998
so let's find out
what they thought.

667
00:32:06,032 --> 00:32:08,133
Frank...

668
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:09,768
Roy...

669
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:13,172
Alana...

670
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,241
Congratulations,
you are all safe

671
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:17,809
and can head back
to the makeup room.

672
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,915
Oh, my God.

673
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:29,288
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

674
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,490
The judges would now like
to speak with each of you

675
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:32,724
to learn more about your work.

676
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,460
Let's talk to Miranda.

677
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,371
Tell us about your concept
and the art movement you used

678
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:47,106
to create this character.

679
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,673
The art movement was cubism,

680
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:51,843
and I wanted to make
a sorrowful musician

681
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:53,312
who lives through her music,

682
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,282
but if she stops playing,
she dies.

683
00:32:56,316 --> 00:32:58,050
To be honest,
I'm quite disappointed

684
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,519
in myself this challenge.

685
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,421
I don't see how you
could be so incredibly wrong

686
00:33:02,455 --> 00:33:05,090
about how successful you were
with your makeup.

687
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:08,327
Really?
Oh, my God!

688
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,196
Anyone familiar
with the cubism movement

689
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:12,998
would look at it immediately
and say,

690
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,167
"I know exactly
what they were going for."

691
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,501
It's a very successful makeup.

692
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,671
Her face is unbelievable.

693
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:22,274
My one comment is that you
should have addressed her arms.

694
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:24,176
That's the only thing
that's missing.

695
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,178
It totally took my breath away.

696
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,780
- Thank you so much.
- Nice job, honey.

697
00:33:28,815 --> 00:33:30,515
So damn good.

698
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,551
The surfacing is fantastic,
the painting is beautiful.

699
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:34,186
I just love this piece.

700
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,821
Thank you, Neville.

701
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,156
Miranda, please step back.

702
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,762
Tate.

703
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:48,334
Hey, guys.

704
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:50,535
Okay, Tate, give it to me.

705
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,872
We all know art is subjective,
especially surrealism.

706
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,941
For this character,
I put the castle on top,

707
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:59,411
and put a spriteful fairy
to live inside it.

708
00:33:59,446 --> 00:34:02,614
The mold for this tipped over
on my hand.

709
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:04,316
I had to get 13 stitches
yesterday,

710
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:06,018
and I missed three hours
in the shop,

711
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:08,487
so I wasn't able to detail it
as much as I wanted to.

712
00:34:08,521 --> 00:34:11,790
Well, I got to tell you,
I'm just not certain

713
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:15,361
that it really fits
into the surrealism category.

714
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:18,130
The whole bottom,
it falls apart for me.

715
00:34:18,164 --> 00:34:19,331
Okay.

716
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:22,301
I feel that it's not
makeup-y enough.

717
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:23,502
Mm-hmm.

718
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:24,669
You've got paint on her face,

719
00:34:24,704 --> 00:34:26,872
and you've got contacts
and eyelashes,

720
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,307
and beyond that,
it's a costume.

721
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,808
It's a really cool costume.

722
00:34:29,842 --> 00:34:31,410
Understood.

723
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,412
Tate, please step back.

724
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,447
Thanks, guys.

725
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:38,450
Eddie.

726
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,725
Tell us about the movement
you chose for this makeup.

727
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,027
I selected expressionism.

728
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:49,294
I've always been inspired

729
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:50,795
by Vincent van Gogh's
Starry Night.

730
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,964
The title of this piece
is Stressful Night,

731
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:55,667
'cause I really wanted to
portray the emotion of stress.

732
00:34:55,701 --> 00:35:01,040
At a distance, it could be
interpreted as a burn makeup.

733
00:35:01,074 --> 00:35:04,643
It feels a touch monstery.

734
00:35:04,677 --> 00:35:06,145
You've got
some massive problems.

735
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,514
The fact that the eyes
are so wholly untreated,

736
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:10,215
and they're just poking out.

737
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,351
It feels like something
that's trying to be art

738
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:15,187
that's just jammed
on somebody's head.

739
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:18,723
There's just too much red.
There's no delineation in color.

740
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:21,326
It's too monochromatic.

741
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:23,762
Eddie, please step back.

742
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,978
Laura, please step up.

743
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:37,076
Tell us about your concept
and the movement.

744
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,178
I decided to go with cubism.

745
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:41,213
I wanted to both
incorporate my style

746
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,748
with the style
of the time period.

747
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:47,352
I think it's an absolutely
stunning job.

748
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:51,190
It looks like a living,
walking painting.

749
00:35:51,224 --> 00:35:53,058
This is an immaculate makeup.

750
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:55,461
The asymmetry of it,
all your construction...

751
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:58,697
It's mind-boggling.
It's absolutely exquisite.

752
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,232
Thank you so much.

753
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:02,701
Everything they said,
times ten.

754
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:04,703
- I just love it.
- Thank you.

755
00:36:04,737 --> 00:36:06,238
Laura, please step back.

756
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,374
Thanks, Matt.

757
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:15,080
Scott, please come forward.

758
00:36:18,418 --> 00:36:21,620
Hi, Scott.
Which movement did you select?

759
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:23,555
I selected surrealism.

760
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,825
I chose to make this
about my father,

761
00:36:26,859 --> 00:36:28,360
who passed away many years ago.

762
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,796
My father was a loving man,
but he had a lot of demons.

763
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:34,799
He had a volcanic temper,
hence the volcano.

764
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,901
This is a very personal piece
to you.

765
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:39,371
Unfortunately,
the makeup on his face

766
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,607
takes me out of the moment.

767
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:45,110
That volcanic look is one of
the hardest things to do well,

768
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:46,911
so for me, it doesn't work.

769
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:48,614
I was a bit lost.

770
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:50,415
The volcano doesn't look
like a volcano.

771
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,816
It reads more tree stump,

772
00:36:51,851 --> 00:36:54,253
and so that being tied
directly to his temper,

773
00:36:54,287 --> 00:36:56,688
metaphorically, didn't happen
for me as a viewer.

774
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:58,056
Okay.

775
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,458
Scott, you can step back.

776
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:05,464
Laney, please step up.

777
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:12,638
Tell us about the concept
behind this makeup.

778
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:15,574
I had pop art,
and my concept was

779
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,809
today's media effect on women

780
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:20,245
in the form
of "Comic Relief."

781
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,516
I think that you nailed
the style and the movement.

782
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:26,751
You took it a step further

783
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,988
and turned it into a character
that is interesting.

784
00:37:30,022 --> 00:37:31,790
I love the idea of this.

785
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:34,125
I get the whole thing,
that it's very pop arty.

786
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,327
I do love the red.

787
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:37,095
It just seems like you
stuck too much of it

788
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,130
right up here
on her head for me.

789
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,600
Other than that,
oh, my God, it's fabulous.

790
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:44,703
Laney, please step back.

791
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:46,971
- Mwah!
- Mwah!

792
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:54,079
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

793
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,880
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

794
00:37:55,915 --> 00:37:58,383
while they deliberate.

795
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:03,088
All right, judges,
let's talk about the looks

796
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:04,789
you liked the most
this evening.

797
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,957
Why don't we start
with Miranda?

798
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:07,693
Oh, I like Miranda's.

799
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,294
She made ugly beautiful.

800
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,129
The sculpting was so cool,

801
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,931
and the colors were so subtle.

802
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,266
She did a great job.

803
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,900
All right,
let's move on to Laura.

804
00:38:15,935 --> 00:38:19,838
Oh, my God, she knocked it
out of the park again.

805
00:38:19,872 --> 00:38:22,173
Planar surfacing is such
a laborious thing to do.

806
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,542
Yeah.

807
00:38:23,576 --> 00:38:26,911
That, to me, was the most
mind-blowing part of this.

808
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,780
All right,
let's move on to Laney.

809
00:38:28,814 --> 00:38:30,949
In terms of presenting

810
00:38:30,983 --> 00:38:32,951
your movement in a concise way,

811
00:38:32,985 --> 00:38:35,186
Laney may have beaten everyone.

812
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:36,288
Yeah, I agree.

813
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:37,922
All right,
let's talk about the looks

814
00:38:37,957 --> 00:38:39,558
you liked the least this week.

815
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:40,726
Why don't we start with Tate?

816
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,394
I think the entire thing
was a mistake,

817
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:44,363
just because it doesn't add up.

818
00:38:44,397 --> 00:38:46,798
It doesn't stack up
at all to surrealism.

819
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:49,468
Yeah, it was obvious
when you looked at it

820
00:38:49,502 --> 00:38:50,902
that it was more of a costume.

821
00:38:50,936 --> 00:38:52,738
Okay.
Let's move on to Eddie.

822
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:54,005
He had the right idea,

823
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:56,174
but it needed that other color,

824
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,976
beyond just his apron.

825
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,379
If he would have used some
black scrim over the eyes

826
00:39:00,413 --> 00:39:03,515
and painted graphic,
open eyeballs on the scrim,

827
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,718
it would have changed
the entire tone of the face.

828
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:08,820
All right,
let's move on to Scott.

829
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:12,391
Scott needs to work on
simplicity and attractiveness,

830
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:15,026
because that piece
is just so unattractive.

831
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,362
Everything was too hard,
and too structured.

832
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,231
To me, surrealism
has a softness to it.

833
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:22,033
He just didn't do it
the right way.

834
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:24,068
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

835
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:26,738
- We have.
- Let's bring them back out.

836
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:37,516
Glenn, tell us about
the top looks.

837
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:41,486
Miranda, your character
was soft and beautiful,

838
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:44,289
and your sculpture
readily conveyed the sorrow

839
00:39:44,324 --> 00:39:45,757
that you were going for.

840
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:48,927
Laney, you had
a really cool character,

841
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:50,962
and there was no question
in our mind

842
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:52,331
when she walked out
that she was from

843
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:53,832
the pop art movement.

844
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:57,902
Laura, we loved all
of the great design decisions

845
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,304
in your makeup, and once again,

846
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:02,240
you've delivered
an immaculate paint job.

847
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,309
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

848
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:07,379
The winner of
this challenge is...

849
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:15,156
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

850
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,191
The winner
of this challenge is...

851
00:40:19,495 --> 00:40:22,397
Laura.

852
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:27,502
You perfectly met this challenge
and integrated your movement.

853
00:40:27,537 --> 00:40:31,640
It truly was living art,
perhaps your best work yet.

854
00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:33,041
Thank you, guys.

855
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:34,910
I really, really, really,
really appreciate it.

856
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,912
And I'm just so happy

857
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:39,981
that they appreciate not just
my makeup, but my artwork.

858
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:41,917
Laura, congratulations.

859
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:43,718
You, Miranda, and Laney

860
00:40:43,753 --> 00:40:46,721
can head back
to the makeup room.

861
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,694
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

862
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:54,195
are on the bottom this week,

863
00:40:54,229 --> 00:40:57,732
and one of you
will be eliminated.

864
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:00,435
Please step forward.

865
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:09,143
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

866
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:12,013
Tate, we like the piece
that you created

867
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:14,549
on a general level,
but the bottom line is

868
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:17,418
it just didn't
read "surreal" to us.

869
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:21,289
Eddie, while your makeup
did evoke your movement,

870
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:24,125
we took issue with some
of the shapes of your sculpture

871
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,095
and the fact
that it had a mask feel.

872
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:29,764
And Scott, we liked your story,

873
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:32,467
but there were several problems
with the execution

874
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:35,537
that hindered the way
that it was being conveyed.

875
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,006
So who is going home tonight?

876
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,608
The person going home
tonight is...

877
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:48,683
Scott.

878
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:50,785
It seems like you
really struggled this week

879
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,453
to pull all of your ideas
together.

880
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:55,490
It just didn't work
on an overall level for us.

881
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:58,627
Scott, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

882
00:41:58,661 --> 00:42:01,663
Eddie, Tate,
you are safe this week

883
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:05,033
and can head back
to the makeup room.

884
00:42:07,436 --> 00:42:10,304
Scott, I am not worried
about you at all.

885
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:13,008
I have seen
amazing creations from you,

886
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:16,344
so I am looking forward
to seeing more of those.

887
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:18,179
- I've had a blast.
- Cool.

888
00:42:18,213 --> 00:42:19,915
Scott, it's been great
having you here with us.

889
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:21,883
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

890
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:23,217
and pack up your kit.

891
00:42:23,252 --> 00:42:25,253
Bye-bye.

892
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:30,124
I wish that I had pushed myself

893
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,094
outside my boundaries
a little more.

894
00:42:33,128 --> 00:42:34,863
- Scott?
- Yeah, it's okay, guys.

895
00:42:34,897 --> 00:42:36,932
I'm seriously fine.

896
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:40,635
Maybe I'm stuck in my
particular way of doing things,

897
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,904
so breaking outside of that
is difficult.

898
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:46,107
This is a young person's game,
and that includes Roy.

899
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:48,543
I don't have any concerns
about my future.

900
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:52,146
I made a lot of new,
awesome friends.

901
00:42:52,181 --> 00:42:53,982
Hopefully, I'll be back
for the finale

902
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:55,483
and maybe can show
that I've still

903
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,265
got a few tricks up my sleeve.
