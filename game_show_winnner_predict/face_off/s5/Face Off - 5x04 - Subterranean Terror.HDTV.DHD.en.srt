00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,603
<i>Previously on Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:09,233
Miranda's pumpkin brought
her her second win.

3
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,271
It's one of the best make-ups
we've ever seen on the show.

4
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:13,925
Thank you guys so much.

5
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:17,433
And in a shocking double elimination
Rick and Eric were sent home.

6
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:21,085
Now 12 artists remain.

7
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,466
And tonight, they'll go to
unexpected depths

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,564
in their first individual challenge.

9
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:27,661
- Feels kinda creepy.
- Spider webs everywhere.

10
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:29,182
I'm completely flipping out.

11
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:31,755
And some will crack
under the pressure.

12
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:32,976
Ah, fuck!

13
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,295
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

14
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:36,758
Maybe I need to just
scrap this whole thing.

15
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:37,817
Awesome!

16
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:40,652
It was a great design,
a mature and professional paint job.

17
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,758
I didn't get why
it looked like that.

18
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:43,908
Bad, RJ.

19
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:46,491
It's a really good piece,
but what it's killing it is the paint.

20
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:49,583
In the end, one
will win a VIP trip

21
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:54,291
from Kryolan Professional Make-Up
to one of their 85 international locations,

22
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:56,941
a 2013 Fiat 500

23
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,571
and $100,000.

24
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,174
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

25
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,504
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

27
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:52,823
Good morning.

28
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:53,991
Congrats.
That was impressive.

29
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:55,726
Thank you, guys.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,729
Maybe not everybody takes it
as hard as I did,

31
00:01:58,763 --> 00:02:01,098
but being in the bottom
last week

32
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:05,302
was absolute emotional torture.

33
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,972
I know I have it in me somewhere
to do this.

34
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:10,307
I'm just going to have to dig
a little deeper.

35
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:19,125
_

36
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:23,821
- This is dangerous.
- Building's pretty cool.

37
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,256
What is it?
Electricity?

38
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,423
We see this building.

39
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,792
This looks like
it ought to be cool.

40
00:02:33,798 --> 00:02:37,034
Welcome to the Glendale
utility substation.

41
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:40,971
This massive structure was once
a bustling power station.

42
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:43,173
- That's awesome.
- I brought you here today

43
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,509
not for what you see
around you...

44
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,378
but what's actually
beneath your feet.

45
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:49,680
It's a network of
abandoned tunnels.

46
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:52,399
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:54,568
Hollywood has made a long
tradition out of exploring

48
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,354
humanoid cultures that live
beneath our own,

49
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,090
going all the way back to HG
Wells's <i>The Time Machine,</i>

50
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:02,760
<i>C.H.U.D.,</i> and <i>The Descent.</i>

51
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:06,330
So for your first individual
spotlight challenge,

52
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:07,481
you will each create

53
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:09,333
a subterranean creature
of your own.

54
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,768
Oh, no!

55
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:12,403
That's really cool.

56
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,138
Now you see the stairs
over there?

57
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,740
They lead to the tunnels
that I mentioned before.

58
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,776
Down there, you will find
six unique areas,

59
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,112
each containing evidence of
a mysterious creature.

60
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:25,482
Now, it's up to you to
interpret what you find there

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,001
and create the beast

62
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:29,920
that might have once inhabited
these underground lairs.

63
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,921
_

64
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:33,657
Before I send you down
to the tunnels,

65
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:36,259
I'd like to introduce you
to a very special guest.

66
00:03:36,277 --> 00:03:38,095
He's a concept artist
and master sculptor

67
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:40,464
whose creative vision
has helped shape movies

68
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:41,832
like <i>Avatar,</i>

69
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:44,101
<i>The Chronicles Of Narnia</i>
<i>Prince Caspian,</i>

70
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:45,502
<i>Alien Resurrection,</i>

71
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:47,071
and <i>Hellboy.</i>

72
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,939
Please give a warm welcome

73
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:50,524
to Jordu Schell.

74
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:54,912
I'm completely flipping out
because Jordu's my hero.

75
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:56,847
Jordu, thank you so much
for being here.

76
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:58,148
It's nice to be here.

77
00:03:58,183 --> 00:03:59,984
So, Jordu, we are dealing with
subterranean creatures.

78
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:03,754
How can the underground habitat
influence those designs?

79
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,139
They're probably
going to be very pale.

80
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:06,256
They don't see
a lot of sunlight.

81
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,759
They may be eyeless,
like moles,

82
00:04:08,777 --> 00:04:10,394
so use your considerable
imaginations,

83
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:12,129
which I know you all have,

84
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,547
of things
that dwell underground.

85
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:14,932
All right,
so you will be joining us

86
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:16,300
on the elimination stage.

87
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,768
What are you going to be looking
for from these guys?

88
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:20,571
I think that believability
in your characters

89
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:22,256
is the most important aspect

90
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,507
when you're trying to convince
the audience

91
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,908
that what they're seeing
is real,

92
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:26,543
and if it doesn't look that way,

93
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,779
it's not going to work.

94
00:04:28,813 --> 00:04:32,582
Okay, guys, it's time for you
to descend into the darkness.

95
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,784
Oh, my God!

96
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,152
Good luck down there.

97
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:42,576
It feels kind of creepy,

98
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,894
and it's completely
in the dark.

99
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:45,662
Everybody's trying to
figure out where to go.

100
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:48,999
- Spider webs everywhere!
- This is so cool.

101
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:53,070
I walk a little deeper
in this amazing room

102
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:57,191
that is surrounded by kelp
and moss and cargo crates.

103
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:59,309
It was super-inspiring.
I'm so into this, Tate.

104
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:01,378
Yeah, right?
There's something freaky

105
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,714
- about this room.
- Yeah, I like it.

106
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:06,283
I want to try to push myself
on this,

107
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,684
'cause it's the first
individual challenge.

108
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:11,722
My concept is
this mermaid-esque creature

109
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:14,124
that purposefully goes into
the nets of fishermen

110
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,727
to capture the men,
use them to her liking,

111
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:18,028
so I'm thinking creepy-sexy.

112
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,333
I start sketching,

113
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:26,403
and I definitely want to do
something sea-life-meets-human,

114
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:29,873
inspired by crustacean or,
like, shrimp, lobster...

115
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,408
Our people could mate.

116
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,277
Oh, yeah.

117
00:05:43,188 --> 00:05:46,089
I chose the room that has
what looks like tentacle marks

118
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,258
all over it.
My concept is

119
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:51,495
to have a creature
that's part worm, part octopus.

120
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:54,164
My idea is to have my actor
on his hands and knees.

121
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:56,166
I'm going to try to make like
the tentacles are moving,

122
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,501
which is difficult to do,

123
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,337
so I'll make it as believable
as I possibly can.

124
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:07,811
This is going to be a fun one.

125
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,196
There's
a lot of goodies in here.

126
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,515
I just see this as, like,
activated by the blacklight.

127
00:06:11,549 --> 00:06:14,601
So I saw the bones and the
blood and the toxic material.

128
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:16,353
It looked really
interesting to me.

129
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:19,123
I come up with the idea of
adding mandibles to my character

130
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:21,758
because it would use
its mandibles to guide itself

131
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:23,494
through these
underground catacombs.

132
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,605
This is the room
with chains on the wall

133
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,873
and an electrical panel.

134
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,108
It's a creature that was
probably kept captive.

135
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:39,943
It's our first
individual challenge.

136
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:40,944
Yes!

137
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,346
For the first time,

138
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,997
I have a chance to show
what my skills are,

139
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:45,549
so I start drawing out shapes.

140
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,418
Through evolution,
its eyes have gone away.

141
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:51,288
Teeth come out of its mouth
and just flow down its body.

142
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:52,990
He broke his chains.
I mean, honestly, this thing--

143
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:55,058
Well, I guess the electricity
just make him stronger.

144
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:57,261
- Yeah, maybe.
- Rip the chains off him,

145
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,263
and he escape.

146
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:04,368
First thing I see
is a door that is broken down,

147
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,069
and then I think
if this got closed off

148
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:08,505
and people got trapped
down here, what would they eat?

149
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,940
- I love this room.
- Yeah, me, too.

150
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:13,810
Maybe humans ate cockroaches
or cockroaches ate the humans.

151
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:16,046
So I want to do
a female character

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,615
with different little wounds
all over her body

153
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,785
where the cockroaches will be
living and biting on her.

154
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,887
- I'm really excited to see yours.
- I know.

155
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,295
Really,
we just have two clues--

156
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,096
- claws and some feet.
- Yeah.

157
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,265
The area I'm in kind of looks
like a subway station,

158
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
and that gets me thinking
about rats.

159
00:07:36,935 --> 00:07:39,603
So I decide that I'm going to do
a naked mole-rat,

160
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:44,374
and its society is warring with
another subterranean society,

161
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:48,245
and the captive chained to
the wall was a prisoner of war.

162
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,981
Definitely a work in progress
at this point.

163
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:53,350
- Come on, mama.
- Watch your head.

164
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,960
Back in the lab,
we've got 5 1/2 hours to work,

165
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:05,729
so we choose our models
and start working immediately.

166
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:11,335
The first thing I do,
I just start sculpting this cowl

167
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,303
and just let the clay
speak to me.

168
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:17,007
My room, it has, like, broken
chains and electric panels.

169
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:20,410
So my concept is this prisoner
that was sentenced to death,

170
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:22,579
so they electrocuted him,
but nobody knew

171
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:24,281
he was going to be immune
to electricity,

172
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,016
so it made him stronger.

173
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,988
Perfect.
I want to start working

174
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:33,924
on the back of my sculpture,

175
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,393
so I used reference
of Alana's back.

176
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:38,378
God, you have gorgeous bones.

177
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:40,597
I'm giving her
a very big hunchback,

178
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,132
big shoulder blades
popping out.

179
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,734
I really like that shape.

180
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:46,136
I love how it's turning out.

181
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,276
My clue is a dusty footprint

182
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,945
and three scratches
down the wall.

183
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,649
So I decide I want to take

184
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:01,184
different aspects
of different creatures.

185
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:05,122
So I go with the ears of a bat
and the nose of a mole

186
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,291
and combine them
with an armadillo

187
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:08,659
because it's something
that would be

188
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,210
digging through the ground.

189
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,495
Because I combined
so many things,

190
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:13,096
I want to find something
that inspires me.

191
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:15,315
Let me know if you see
a mole anywhere.

192
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:16,566
I saw a mole in here.

193
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,318
- You saw one?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:20,187
This mole-rat
that I have in my mind

195
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:23,240
could have been mutated
from the chemicals

196
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:25,709
leaking down into the soil,

197
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:28,345
and the fact that there's hair
all around in my room,

198
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,347
maybe he's losing his hair.

199
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:32,933
This is my first individual
challenge ever on <i>Face Off,</i>

200
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:34,885
and I'm excited to finally
get to really just show

201
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,970
what I can do.
You're doing a mole also?

202
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:39,389
- Yeah.
- You are?

203
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:42,426
There aren't many creatures
that live underground, though.

204
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,330
RJ and Laura both have ideas
to do mole characters as well.

205
00:09:46,364 --> 00:09:47,664
Awesome.

206
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:49,532
Now that I know everybody's
doing a naked mole-rat,

207
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,451
I don't really know what to do.

208
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:53,387
They both made it all the way
to the finals,

209
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:56,173
so now I feel like we're kind of
in direct competition.

210
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:57,507
That's not really a place
that I want to be.

211
00:09:57,542 --> 00:10:00,543
We'll all just have to be
really creative

212
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:02,512
with our overall design.

213
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,758
_

214
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,525
_

215
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:10,387
Maybe I need to just scrap
this whole thing and start over.

216
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,392
- Coming up...
- I have to risk it.

217
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:17,561
Ah, fuck!
Think, think, think!

218
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:20,030
This is definitely
an "Oh, crap" moment.

219
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:21,698
This has never happened before.

220
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,201
I love this make-up.

221
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,336
It's just too messy for me
this week.

222
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,699
I want to take a survey

223
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,734
of how many people
are doing freaking moles.

224
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:38,622
RJ and Laura both have ideas to
do mole characters as well,

225
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:40,073
which makes me
a little bit nervous,

226
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,608
but I have a pretty clear design

227
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:44,110
that I've had since the second
that I stepped into my room,

228
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,246
and I don't want to
change that.

229
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,415
Hopefully,
my mole-rat is the best.

230
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:51,151
Frank, are you doing
a naked mole-rat?

231
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,086
- No.
- Okay, thank God!

232
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,825
Roy's building
a full-size octopus.

233
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,493
You gonna take down
the <i>Nautilus</i> with that?

234
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,912
I can take down you.

235
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,670
That is fucking awesome.

236
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,475
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, everybody!

237
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,444
- Hi!
- Hey, how's it going, guys?

238
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,746
- We're here for a walk-through.
- My favorite part of the day.

239
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,550
I went to this scene where
there was toxic fluid

240
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,619
and structures
that had been bitten.

241
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,988
I want it to be a scientist
that had an accident,

242
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,990
and then mutated into
this creature.

243
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:32,392
I want teeth in his real mouth

244
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:35,295
and then have another layer
of teeth on top of it.

245
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:36,796
I would do away with
the lower lip

246
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,200
so he has no lips,
as opposed to, you know...

247
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,068
- Okay.
- ...seeing too much human there.

248
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:43,837
I found a room
that had tentacle marks

249
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,072
all over the walls,
so I'm thinking

250
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,476
an octopus-human hybrid
in mid-transition.

251
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,444
I'd add a little more beef
to the neck here.

252
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,146
- Okay.
- It's a common mistake

253
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:54,581
- a lot of people make...
- Yeah.

254
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:56,482
Is not making the sculptures
thick enough,

255
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,585
and then there's nothing there
to really run.

256
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,253
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey, guys.

257
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,688
During the last challenge,

258
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,457
Michael Westmore's advice
really saved Scott and me,

259
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,127
so anytime Mr. Westmore
comes by and says something,

260
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:08,672
we're definitely going
to figure out a way

261
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:09,696
to interpret that
into our make-up.

262
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,197
The rats, when you see them,
you know,

263
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,700
that head and the whole body
all connect all the way through.

264
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,435
So go more with
what we've got here

265
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,903
with the rat folds coming
all the way up to the cranium?

266
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,338
Yeah.

267
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:20,140
I'm just nervous,
especially after

268
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,841
the last spotlight challenge.

269
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:23,943
I just don't want to be
a bottom look again.

270
00:12:23,978 --> 00:12:26,613
- Roy! What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

271
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:28,882
Sort of an evolved octopus,

272
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,051
so, like, the arms will fit in
here, and the legs in there,

273
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,769
and these here will actually
move along with it

274
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,220
so it looks like
the tentacles are moving.

275
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,356
You know what helps
with a mold this big?

276
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,059
You get a couple of 2x4 boards
and literally getting down,

277
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,927
trying to get them
on the level thing,

278
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,312
because when you
turn this thing over,

279
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:44,097
the mold isn't going to rock,
you can work on it,

280
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,232
- and it'll be really easy.
- Okay, cool.

281
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,767
- I can't wait to see this.
- Yeah.

282
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:48,935
- Good luck, Roy.
- Good luck, Roy.

283
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,103
Thank you.

284
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,304
All right, guys,
we're heading out.

285
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,239
- Good luck.
- Thank you!

286
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,974
- See you later.
- Thanks, guys! - Bye-bye.

287
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:56,276
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

288
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,514
Are you going to mold
that thing?

289
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,750
No, I'm going to
let the model wear clay.

290
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,821
I've still got an hour before
the end of the day,

291
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,956
so I'm definitely going to get
this thing molded today.

292
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,292
Oh, my gosh,
that's going to be so big.

293
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,527
That's what she said.

294
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,912
It's starting to set up,

295
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,196
so I know that I can come in
first thing in the morning

296
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,015
and clean it out.

297
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:22,802
There's exactly one hour left!

298
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,758
My mold looks good,

299
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,778
but it doesn't seem like
the plaster is completely set.

300
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,178
I have to risk it.
I need to finish the mold today,

301
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:38,952
'cause I'm working on my own,
so time is really important right now.

302
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,454
Fuck!

303
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,157
As I am opening it, it cracks.

304
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,159
Fuck!

305
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:49,395
Think, think, think, think...

306
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:52,599
I start pouring plaster on top
of the mold,

307
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,267
but time's running out.

308
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,203
That is time!
Let's go!

309
00:13:57,238 --> 00:13:58,805
<i>¡Vámonos!</i>

310
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,540
Damn!
The only thing I can do

311
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,675
is hope that tomorrow,
when I come back,

312
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,945
this is going to be okay
when I take it apart.

313
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,314
I have never felt this nervous.

314
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,091
Whoo!

315
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:22,428
It's the second day of our
subterranean creature challenge,

316
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,096
and we have 9 1/2 hours left
in the lab.

317
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:31,204
The first thing I do
is check the crack.

318
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,675
It's still there,
but it seems fine.

319
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,711
It's not going to be a seam
on my prosthetic,

320
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:41,865
so adding that extra layer of
plaster really helped.

321
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:48,754
Eddie, Tate, Frank,

322
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,656
can I get you guys to help me
for a second?

323
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,658
If we can take this
and sort of just roll it over,

324
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,010
that would be fantastic.

325
00:14:54,044 --> 00:14:55,361
There's easily 400
pounds of mud

326
00:14:55,396 --> 00:14:57,914
surrounded by 100 pounds of
concrete on this table,

327
00:14:57,948 --> 00:14:59,899
and I got to get this mold
off the table

328
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,034
so I can get it cleaned out.

329
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,404
- Oh, you got your end?
- I got it.

330
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,039
Aw!

331
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,473
Holy shit!

332
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,810
Okay, good.
Just take it on the floor.

333
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:14,197
At least we can go canoeing
after all this is over, right?

334
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,515
Yeah.

335
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,317
The next thing is to take it
out and wash it out

336
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,401
and start throwing latex
into it.

337
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,919
What the hell was I thinking?

338
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,261
Those are going to be
venom sacs and, like,

339
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,864
that's what the shell is for,
to protect those sacs.

340
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,131
I'm taking a lot of inspiration

341
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,033
from a bunch of different
subterranean creatures.

342
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,536
I'm hoping that the judges can
see that it's an amalgam,

343
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,770
not a big mess.

344
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,375
I'm sculpting out
five different sizes

345
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,910
of little tentacles,

346
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,546
and I'm going to deposit inside
the pros-aide transfer.

347
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,350
Pros-aide is a liquid glue.

348
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,452
It's almost like gelatin
or silicon

349
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:56,606
but it's already sticky
and can be applied very easily.

350
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,999
This mold's taking me longer
than my sculpture did.

351
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,834
This is a difficult mold to make

352
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:10,136
because there is so much bend
and movement to it.

353
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,504
I need to divide it
down the middle

354
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:13,139
and follow this bend.

355
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,908
Plus, the tips of this fin
are paper-thin,

356
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:18,511
so I really need to be careful
not to bend my sculpture.

357
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,419
Once I get it cleaned out,

358
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:28,004
it's time to start applying
the poly foam,

359
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,423
so I mix big batches of it
and pour it into my mold.

360
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,729
That's stiff foam, though.

361
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:38,932
And then I realize,

362
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:42,335
well, this is stiffer
than what it should be.

363
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:44,103
Yeah, this one was a lot harder

364
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:45,805
than what I thought
it was going to be.

365
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,974
I thought it was a softer foam,
but it's a rigid foam.

366
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,209
There's two types of A/B foam.

367
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,011
Soft foam is like squishing
a loaf of bread.

368
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,113
Rigid foam is like squeezing
a brick.

369
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,351
This is definitely
an "Oh, crap" moment.

370
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,603
There's no way
to get this thing out.

371
00:17:00,654 --> 00:17:02,188
I start pulling on it.

372
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,090
There's no way.

373
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:07,794
I built this entire concept
around these tentacles.

374
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:09,078
Shit.

375
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,797
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

376
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:15,034
My entire piece
was swinging on this,

377
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,337
so I might as well go home
and pack now.

378
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,228
So it's day two of
our subterranean challenge,

379
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,464
and I can't get
this rigid foam out.

380
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:29,366
I start pulling on it.
Nothing.

381
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:32,369
Then I grab a couple of chisels
and a mallet

382
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:33,637
and start trying to
chip it away

383
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:37,541
so I can at least get
another run at the mold...

384
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,176
but I realize it's going
to take me three hours

385
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,912
to clean this out, and with
four hours left in the day,

386
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,080
I don't have the time.

387
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:44,849
There's no way
I can use this mold.

388
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:47,251
I decide to scrap
the entire piece.

389
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:48,552
It's 90% of the creature.

390
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,053
I mean, that's what
the bulk of it was

391
00:17:50,071 --> 00:17:52,156
was the tentacles,
and now they're gone.

392
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,358
- How'd it come out?
- It didn't.

393
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:55,426
Oh, it didn't?

394
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,162
- Oh, fucking shit!
- Okay.

395
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:00,664
I at least have a face piece
that I had already sculpted out,

396
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:03,734
so I'm not without anything...

397
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:05,703
but it ain't much better
than having nothing.

398
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:18,516
Miranda's going to
stick with mole,

399
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,319
so I'm going to go
more rat with mine.

400
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:24,855
For the tail I use a pool noodle

401
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,690
and shave it down,

402
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,076
and then I spray glue
all over it

403
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,715
so it maintains its rat-like,
disgusting shape.

404
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,539
So my new concept
is the evolution of a squid.

405
00:18:41,573 --> 00:18:44,642
I can build an octopus
and also make a squid head.

406
00:18:44,676 --> 00:18:46,911
I could fabricate that
pretty quick.

407
00:18:46,945 --> 00:18:48,946
Right now, I'm just throwing
things on a mannequin

408
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,714
to see what works
and what doesn't.

409
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:52,115
Just so long as
I have something.

410
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,118
I don't want to just have
a head on a robe.

411
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:57,929
Hey, guys, one hour!

412
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:04,995
People are about done
for the day.

413
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,197
I have all my molds
and everything ready to go,

414
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:09,934
so I feel like I'm going to be
in pretty good shape

415
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,068
for tomorrow.

416
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,970
This has never happened before.

417
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:17,007
Everybody's feeling pretty good
and rockin',

418
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,409
except for Roy.

419
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,515
Hey, guys, it's time!

420
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,152
By the end of the day,

421
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:30,020
I have some semblance of
a chest piece

422
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:31,872
and a couple of tentacle arms.

423
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,374
I've also got
the base coat on it.

424
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,125
I just hope
they don't send me home.

425
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,994
Good day.

426
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,729
I'm starting out
with a piece of crap

427
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:40,297
and putting more crap on,

428
00:19:40,332 --> 00:19:42,333
so this is going to be, like,
a really big crap sandwich.

429
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,876
Good luck, everybody!

430
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,311
So, application day.

431
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,847
We got four hours in the lab

432
00:19:56,882 --> 00:20:00,151
and then an hour of last looks,
and my priority is paint.

433
00:20:00,185 --> 00:20:01,352
Hey, Alana, you want to see
what a seam looks like?

434
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,337
Yeah, I already know.

435
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,857
I'm going to go in here

436
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,159
and work on this piece
in here real quick

437
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:09,276
and see if this is
going to work.

438
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:10,811
I'm frantic.

439
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:12,196
I want to get the cowl
finished first,

440
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,064
so I've sculpted out
a quick squid tail.

441
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:17,568
I cut a piece of L200 and put it
on the vacuform machine,

442
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:18,702
and it actually works.

443
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:20,004
I can't believe it.

444
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:22,573
Maybe my luck's changing
a little bit.

445
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,191
Oh, that's a bad tear.

446
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:26,009
Oh, was it not supposed to
be open?

447
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:27,194
No.

448
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:28,646
There's a problem with my cowl.

449
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,948
There's a big tear that goes
all the way through.

450
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:33,451
I have about a 1/2 gap,

451
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:35,686
so I'm going to have to patch
that somehow.

452
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,622
So I've got
a premade prosthetic piece

453
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,175
that fits pretty well
over that tear,

454
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:43,928
and it looks like
a badly stitched wound.

455
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:45,980
I just want to spend
as much time as I can

456
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:48,199
painting you today.

457
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,338
Hmm?

458
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:55,673
Nice!

459
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:56,774
Alana, doesn't she look like

460
00:20:56,808 --> 00:20:58,726
she could be Gollum's
girlfriend?

461
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,278
- Yes.
- So I have all my pieces down,

462
00:21:01,313 --> 00:21:02,496
and I'm feeling pretty good.

463
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:04,331
But I still have to get
cockroaches

464
00:21:04,382 --> 00:21:05,883
in my creature's wounds.

465
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:08,085
If you could lean back
just a little bit-- there we go.

466
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,760
Since my character's supposed
to be electrocuted,

467
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:19,029
I want to give him
this burnt look,

468
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,166
so I'm trying to come up with
this warm flesh tone.

469
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,635
But as soon as I start
painting him,

470
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:27,271
it's-- I--
it's orange.

471
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:30,241
You know what you should do
after you put those veins on?

472
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,409
Go back over with your face
color and stipple it

473
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:34,545
so it makes it look like
it's under the skin.

474
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:41,785
Where am I?

475
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,925
Okay, now comes the fun part.

476
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,494
When you're painting,
you need to have areas

477
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:51,629
for your eyes to settle,

478
00:21:51,663 --> 00:21:54,965
areas for your eyes
to be drawn to...

479
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,034
So I'm trying to add little
details here and there

480
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:59,103
but still keep an overall
cohesive paint job.

481
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:00,971
That paint job's
looking good, man.

482
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:02,206
Thanks, Tate.

483
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,192
Please, get up a little bit?

484
00:22:05,243 --> 00:22:08,279
I really want this creature to
look like a naked mole-rat,

485
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:10,748
but that has a lot of pinks,

486
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:12,950
and I've never really done that
kind of a paint job before.

487
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:15,436
Now just hold still.

488
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:18,255
I need to pull it all together
and then, hopefully,

489
00:22:18,273 --> 00:22:21,875
it won't end up looking like
this big, pink thing.

490
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,428
30 minutes, everybody!

491
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,968
I don't think I've ever worked
this hard, this fast.

492
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:34,088
From the chin up,
it's almost passable.

493
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:36,640
Anything from the chin down,
train wreck.

494
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:38,442
I'm hoping that, if I can put
a decent paint job on it,

495
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:39,476
that'll save it.

496
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:52,189
Time, everybody!

497
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:54,158
That's time!
Let's go!

498
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:56,026
That's it, guys.

499
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,664
I'm not feeling really happy
about this pumpkin head,

500
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:04,051
but I still have one hour
to come up with a plan.

501
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:06,887
I'm feeling pretty nervous
right now.

502
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:08,272
Coming up...

503
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:11,008
You've made a ton of
intelligent design choices

504
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,777
- this week.
- This is one of my favorites.

505
00:23:13,812 --> 00:23:16,614
I think you damaged the whole
thing with your paint job.

506
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:23,791
Good luck, everyone!

507
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:28,362
Where is that rat?

508
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:29,513
Hey, where's my rat?

509
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:30,681
I still have
a lot of work to do,

510
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,584
and one hour
is not a lot of time.

511
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:38,422
I start embedding all
the cockroaches in her wounds.

512
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,340
Now she doesn't look like
a mask anymore.

513
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:41,759
She looks like a creature.

514
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:50,200
I've been trying the best
I can to salvage this make-up.

515
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:51,385
Actually, let's put
your wardrobe around here.

516
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:52,836
I'll just step around you.

517
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,405
There's duct tape and pins
holding this thing together.

518
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,141
It's a mess.

519
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:05,883
- Time's up!
- We got it all done!

520
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:07,417
I know I'm on the bottom.

521
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:09,937
It's just how far
on the bottom am I?

522
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:23,400
Welcome to the<i>Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

523
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:26,470
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

524
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:30,841
First, let's say hello
to our talented judges--

525
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,043
owner of Optic Nerve Make-Up
Effects Studio Glenn Hetrick.

526
00:24:33,077 --> 00:24:35,078
- Good evening.
- Hi, Glenn.

527
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:37,214
Three-time Oscar-winning
make-up artist Ve Neill.

528
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,583
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Ve.

529
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:42,252
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

530
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:44,054
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Neville.

531
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:46,256
And please say hello again
to Jordu Schell.

532
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,661
Well, I'm very delighted
to be here,

533
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:52,513
and I'm excited to see
what I'm going to see.

534
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:53,663
Gonna be exciting.

535
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:54,998
All right, guys, so this week,

536
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:58,435
I gave you your first individual
spotlight challenge,

537
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:00,871
to use the clues
you found underground

538
00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:03,640
to create your very own
subterranean creature.

539
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:05,475
Now, while we check out
your work,

540
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:07,477
the audience at home
will be tweeting

541
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:09,079
about which ones
are their favorites,

542
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,481
using #FaceOff.

543
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:13,584
Let's see how your creations
turned out.

544
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:34,338
From a profile,

545
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:36,974
I'm really happy with
how the face turned out,

546
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:40,744
but I'm unsure as to how
this make-up looks straight on.

547
00:25:57,795 --> 00:26:00,314
I hope the judges see
my creature from the silhouette

548
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:02,332
because I think that's where
the piece is the strongest.

549
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:20,317
I'm happy with my edges,
even with my bad tear.

550
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:23,253
It's just going to depend now on
when the judges see it up close

551
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:24,755
they like it or not.

552
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:46,259
Proportion-wise, he actually
doesn't look that bad.

553
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:50,013
He has a really cool silhouette,
but he's orange.

554
00:27:05,596 --> 00:27:07,798
Looks pretty bad-ass.

555
00:27:07,832 --> 00:27:09,132
He's got a great silhouette.

556
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,600
I think I nailed the skin tone.

557
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:12,436
I did about as good as I can.

558
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,587
He looks awesome.

559
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:31,821
Everything came together.

560
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,206
Even though I'm excited about
my make-up,

561
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:34,458
they could all hate it,

562
00:27:34,492 --> 00:27:36,476
and I just hope that
that's not the case.

563
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:55,395
After the last critique I got,

564
00:27:55,446 --> 00:27:57,481
I have no idea what the judges
are looking for,

565
00:27:57,515 --> 00:27:59,282
so I could be top or bottom
at this point.

566
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:00,867
Who knows?

567
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,036
When my background comes up

568
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,855
and those green saturates
hit my creature,

569
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:23,607
I'm 100% happy.

570
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,060
He looks like I took a Ferengi
and mated it with an artichoke.

571
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:47,030
I didn't see that at all
until the lights hit him.

572
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:49,332
Bad RJ! Bad!

573
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:08,852
I think I did a good job,

574
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:12,272
and I am proud of what
I've done by myself

575
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:13,423
in this challenge.

576
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:30,340
My creature's
not sculpturally amazing,

577
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:34,377
but I feel like my overall
concept is completely original.

578
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,147
This is definitely
the worst piece I've ever done,

579
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:57,767
and there ain't a doubt
in my mind I'm in bottom looks.

580
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,274
Judges, why don't you
take a closer look?

581
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:14,151
Really furrow your brow.

582
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:16,153
I want to see
how the top of it looks.

583
00:30:16,187 --> 00:30:18,171
- Yeah, it's not bad.
- You know what's neat?

584
00:30:18,222 --> 00:30:20,641
The fact that this flexes
and this doesn't.

585
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:26,029
- Weird.
- I think he kind of

586
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:28,332
wiped out a lot of his sculpting
by the poor paint job.

587
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:30,467
It feels a little fruity
pebble coloration.

588
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:31,585
Okay.

589
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:37,407
Oh, boy, the painting
is so bad.

590
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:39,076
It looks like a Halloween mask.

591
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,545
I know that my creature's
very, very orange,

592
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:44,214
so do they like it?
Do they hate it?

593
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:47,017
The paint work is just doing
this thing a disservice.

594
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:49,069
I'm stressing out.
I can't even look.

595
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,038
I don't want to go home.

596
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,859
Who made your favorite
subterranean creature?

597
00:30:55,893 --> 00:30:59,262
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

598
00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:04,645
I am completely nervous.
I don't know what to think.

599
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,213
You never know what they're
looking for.

600
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:08,132
I don't understand
what these are

601
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,467
and why are they painted
so haphazardly?

602
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:16,056
- Let's see it move.
- Moves really well.

603
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,424
That is really bitchin'.

604
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:21,595
Wow!

605
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,130
I love this whole thing
coming up.

606
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:25,299
Yeah, it's a beautiful
design element.

607
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,434
This is really,
really gorgeous.

608
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,103
I'm afraid to get bit.

609
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,237
Ow!

610
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,776
- That paint is killing me.
- Yeah.

611
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,512
It's kind of a nice profile,
though.

612
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,526
_

613
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,219
- Good God almighty.
- What is that?

614
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,321
What happened here?

615
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:49,206
I don't even want to look.
I mean, if I could get away with

616
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,992
just walking offstage,
I would prefer that.

617
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:59,600
So the judges have scored
your creations.

618
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:01,035
Let's find out
what they thought.

619
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:03,904
Frank,

620
00:32:03,939 --> 00:32:05,639
Scott,

621
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,374
Roy,

622
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,343
Laura,

623
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,879
Adolfo,

624
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,948
Miranda,

625
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:17,017
you are the best and the worst
this week.

626
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:19,853
The rest of you are safe and can
head back to the make-up room.

627
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:21,021
Thank you, guys.

628
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,227
The judges would like to speak
with each of you

629
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:27,695
to learn more about your work.

630
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:30,064
Frank, you're up first.

631
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,004
Tell us about your concept

632
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:40,441
and what clues you took
from the subterranean room.

633
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:43,978
In the room, there was
some broken shackles.

634
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:45,446
I assumed
that he was a prisoner.

635
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,915
Then through evolution,
its eyes have gone away.

636
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,952
You've made a ton of
intelligent design choices

637
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:54,155
this week.

638
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:57,758
The fact that the eyes went away
through evolution is brilliant.

639
00:32:57,793 --> 00:32:59,527
- Beautifully done.
- Thank you.

640
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,445
I love the fingernails,
the claws.

641
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,897
I think you did a really nice
job this week, Frank.

642
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,234
The airbrush work that you did
looks so good.

643
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:09,453
It just feels like
he's an underground creature.

644
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:12,006
It could use a little more
color around the mouth,

645
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,108
- something to really draw your attention,
- Sure.

646
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:16,076
...but this is one of my favorites.

647
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:17,511
Thank you.

648
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,847
- Frank, you can head back.
- Thanks, pal.

649
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:21,970
Yeah!

650
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:23,917
Scott, you're next.

651
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,709
Tell us about your concept
and what clues you took

652
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,028
from your scene
to create your character.

653
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:37,081
In my particular room, there
were octopus tentacle marks

654
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:39,300
all over the walls,
and the first thing that hit me

655
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:43,637
was using half-hybrids
with humans and octopus.

656
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:46,473
I really didn't get
what all this was

657
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,993
and why it looked like that.

658
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,845
It's just too messy
for me this week.

659
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,613
- Okay.
- There's things about this

660
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,515
that are really cool
as a concept goes.

661
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,150
It's a good-looking piece,

662
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,686
but what's killing it is
really the paint.

663
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,256
I have a problem with
these bright spots on the head

664
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,994
that look like fruit cereal,
which just don't work.

665
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:08,329
Okay.

666
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:09,497
Scott, please step down.

667
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:15,903
Miranda?

668
00:34:22,244 --> 00:34:23,210
Tell us about the concept.

669
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,179
When I walked into my scene,

670
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,882
the first things that I noticed
were claw marks on the wall

671
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,450
and hair.

672
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,485
That made me think
mole creature.

673
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,387
The wrinkling,

674
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:36,056
particularly in the face...

675
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,325
is pretty spectacular.

676
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,394
It's so natural and organic,

677
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:43,163
and that's just a testament
to your skills as a sculptor.

678
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:45,065
Thank you so much, Neville.

679
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,483
I like the paint job.

680
00:34:46,535 --> 00:34:49,570
It's very subtle, and I think
you did an amazing job.

681
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:53,440
The neck and the head are
completely convincing to me.

682
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:55,709
Overall, you knocked me out
on this.

683
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:58,579
Thank you so much, Jordu.

684
00:34:58,613 --> 00:34:59,713
You can step back.

685
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:05,752
Adolfo.

686
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,409
Tell me about
what clues you found

687
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,161
in your underground chamber.

688
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,397
I found broken chains,
so I came up with this prisoner

689
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:18,332
that was supposed to be
electrocuted,

690
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,969
but he actually got deformed
and more powerful.

691
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:28,125
The sculpture just is not real.

692
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,011
It looks very masky to me.

693
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,447
Orange is one of those colors
that you would never see

694
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,633
in a space that doesn't have
any light in it,

695
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,886
and this has a pumpkin head,
it's so orange.

696
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,722
The sculpture
is extremely rudimentary.

697
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:44,091
It lacks the forms
that tell its story.

698
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,926
You sculpted a mask,

699
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,527
and you painted black
around the guy's head,

700
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,281
and that's not good enough.

701
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,099
Adolfo, you can head back.

702
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,806
Roy, please step up.

703
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,180
Tell us about your character.

704
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:08,582
The room that I had had
tentacle markings on the wall,

705
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,985
but this was not
my original concept.

706
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:13,554
I made the mistake of grabbing
rigid foam instead of soft foam,

707
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,856
so I obliterated
the whole thing.

708
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,692
The plan was for it to have,
like, octopus legs,

709
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:20,628
and the actor was going
to walk on all fours.

710
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:22,729
That sounds pretty cool.

711
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,132
This isn't.

712
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,167
I'm not happy with your work
this week, Roy.

713
00:36:27,202 --> 00:36:28,936
It's hard to polish a turd.
It really is.

714
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,538
You said it.

715
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,507
Yes, sir, I sure did.

716
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,143
But the fact is we have to
judge you for this.

717
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:37,678
There's a couple things
I do like.

718
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:43,384
There's some great lines
that flow from the nasal beak.

719
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:44,918
Roy, you can step back.

720
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,230
Thank you, buddy.

721
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,392
Laura, you're up next.

722
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,931
Can you tell us about
your concept?

723
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,734
My scene had scratches
on the wall.

724
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:04,705
It also had chains
and some footprints.

725
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:07,207
She's a prisoner, and they
chained her to the wall

726
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:09,827
in hopes of getting
some ransom.

727
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:13,497
She's very unique
and really cool looking.

728
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,549
My one comment is the fact that

729
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,935
she's supposed to be underground
for so long--

730
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,753
she looks a little pink to me.

731
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:22,039
But all in all, I think she's
a very cool character tonight.

732
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,424
Thank you.

733
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,658
I think
this thing is fantastic,

734
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:28,028
and I love the way that
the hands seem really big.

735
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:29,963
That's super-creepy.

736
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,031
Thank you.

737
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:33,267
I love this make-up.

738
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,235
The way that the face is down
here and the head is back here,

739
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,538
I think that's absolutely
brilliant.

740
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:38,839
Thank you.

741
00:37:38,873 --> 00:37:39,873
Laura, will you please
step down?

742
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,181
All right, guys, the judges have
heard what you have to say.

743
00:37:47,215 --> 00:37:48,482
If you'd please head back
to the make-up room

744
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,750
while they deliberate.

745
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:56,256
All right, guys,
so let's start with

746
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,059
the looks you like the most.
Why don't we start with Frank?

747
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:02,663
There's rational logic to
the decisions he made,

748
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,331
and also layers of paint

749
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,234
is something I've been asking
for forever.

750
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:10,270
We have something that
your eye goes right to,

751
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:12,572
and that is the focal point
of your design.

752
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,609
For me, that is design,
and Frank's had that.

753
00:38:15,643 --> 00:38:17,211
All right,
let's move on to Miranda.

754
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:19,813
She blows me away.

755
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,582
When you looked at it
from far away, it worked,

756
00:38:21,616 --> 00:38:23,083
when you looked at it up close,
it worked,

757
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,986
and the head was perfectly
proportioned

758
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,087
to the rest of the body.

759
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:28,722
All right,
let's move on to Laura.

760
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:31,225
A ton of brilliant decisions.

761
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:33,594
I thought how high
she made that forehead

762
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:35,796
and it made the face look
kind of smooshed,

763
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,098
but not too much--
didn't go too far out.

764
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:41,702
The way that she created
the claws was really effective.

765
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,437
Now let's talk about
some of the looks

766
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:45,773
you didn't like so much.
Why don't we start with Scott?

767
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:50,244
The design had no cohesion.
It had stuff just stuck on.

768
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:52,312
Yeah. It just was
not obvious what it was.

769
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,381
And the paint job
was not acceptable.

770
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,916
All right,
let's move on to Adolfo.

771
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,918
I loathe this make-up.

772
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,019
He sculpted a mask.

773
00:38:59,053 --> 00:39:01,321
But it was really
well-proportioned.

774
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:04,524
But the head ruins that,
because it is so mask-like,

775
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,560
and the paint job is so...

776
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,929
Orange?

777
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:10,497
It just didn't look right.

778
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:11,632
Let's talk about Roy.

779
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,433
Oh, boy.

780
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:15,469
I don't know why he tried
to do so much.

781
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:16,904
I would rather have seen
just a great head...

782
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,238
Me, too.

783
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,275
...instead of that godawful
construction on the arms.

784
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:23,844
Just focus on giving me
a brilliant make-up.

785
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:26,313
All right, judges, have you
made your decisions?

786
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:27,548
We have.

787
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:29,182
Let's bring them out.

788
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,291
All right, Glenn,
tell us about the top looks.

789
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:41,495
Frank, we thought your
sculpting was very strong.

790
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:44,631
Your paint job made it
a really outstanding piece.

791
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:47,801
Miranda,
you did a fantastic job,

792
00:39:47,836 --> 00:39:49,987
using reference
and your own imagination

793
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,140
to create a very
believable character.

794
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:56,343
Laura, this was one of
those creatures

795
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:59,112
where we knew a lot about her
right away.

796
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,114
She was, therefore,
quite convincing.

797
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,584
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge?

798
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,619
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

799
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,545
All right, Glenn, who is
the winner of this challenge?

800
00:40:14,563 --> 00:40:17,382
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

801
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:21,786
Miranda.

802
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,591
Thank you guys so much.

803
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,143
I can't believe it.

804
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:29,928
Your creature worked
on every level.

805
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:31,796
It was a great design
and incredible sculpting

806
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:33,632
and a truly professional
paint job.

807
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,033
Well done.

808
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:36,985
I've won three
out of four challenges.

809
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,270
I'm really proud of myself,

810
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:39,904
and I just hope
I can keep it up.

811
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,289
Congratulations.

812
00:40:41,324 --> 00:40:44,142
You, Frank, and Laura can head
back to the make-up room.

813
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,560
Thank you, guys.

814
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,551
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

815
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:54,903
are on the bottom this week,

816
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:57,656
and one of you
will be eliminated.

817
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,890
Please step forward.

818
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:09,067
Glenn, tell us about
the bottom looks.

819
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:12,771
Adolfo, it looked like your
character was wearing a mask,

820
00:41:12,805 --> 00:41:14,172
and the color
that you painted him

821
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:16,775
just did not read subterranean.

822
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:21,079
Roy, we realize that you had
a catastrophic failure

823
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,882
in the lab this week,
but we have to judge you

824
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,284
based on what you put
in front of us,

825
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,486
and this week,
it wasn't very good.

826
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:32,424
Scott, we felt that you really
could have pushed your design

827
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,726
and your sculpture much further,

828
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,262
but ultimately,
it was the poor paint job

829
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:38,997
that sunk you this week.

830
00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:40,765
So who's going home tonight?

831
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,834
The person going home
tonight is...

832
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:48,606
Adolfo.

833
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:51,409
There were a lot of choices here
that just didn't work,

834
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:55,413
and we ultimately couldn't get
past the mask factor.

835
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:56,915
It's been amazing.

836
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,284
I'm just blessed to be here.

837
00:41:59,318 --> 00:42:01,853
Adolfo, I'm so sorry,
but you've been eliminated.

838
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:06,224
Scott, Roy,
you're safe this week

839
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:07,892
and can head back
to the make-up room.

840
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,466
What's so important is that
you go forth from this

841
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,168
and continue to stay creative.

842
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,303
Thank you so much.

843
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:19,637
Good luck.

844
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:22,374
Adolfo, it's been great having
you here with us.

845
00:42:22,408 --> 00:42:24,109
If you'd please head back
to the make-up room

846
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:25,310
and pack up your kit.

847
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,495
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

848
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:30,198
I wish I was able to develop
the character

849
00:42:30,232 --> 00:42:31,616
a little bit better.

850
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,951
However, I worked really hard,

851
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:35,286
and I need to be proud of that.

852
00:42:35,321 --> 00:42:37,422
- Good-bye.
- No!

853
00:42:37,456 --> 00:42:38,706
Hey...

854
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:41,626
It is super-hard to get in
this competition,

855
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,061
but this is just the beginning
for me,

856
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:45,263
and I'm going to work as hard
as possible to make it.

857
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,085
I'm not going to stop
until I get to the level

858
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:52,420
that I really want to be.

859
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:54,873
I just can't wait
to go back to work

860
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:57,018
