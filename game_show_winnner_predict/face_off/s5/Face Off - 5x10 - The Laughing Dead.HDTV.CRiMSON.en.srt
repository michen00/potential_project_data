1
00:00:01,907 --> 00:00:04,173
Previously on Face Off...

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,306
Tate's slothful sinner
brought him to victory...

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,739
That means a lot.

4
00:00:10,773 --> 00:00:13,376
And veteran Frank
was sent home.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,780
Now, six artists remain,

6
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:19,318
and tonight, they'll be
creating comedic poltergeists.

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,318
Ah, that's fun.

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,419
Comedy is not easy.

9
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,054
This is a weird challenge.

10
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:26,823
But this challenge
is no laughing matter.

11
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:27,824
- Cancer?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:27,858 --> 00:00:28,824
Funny and scary

13
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:30,357
is a very difficult balance.

14
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,023
I might be going home
this week.

15
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:33,190
This is terrible.

16
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:34,958
I'm starting
to have a panic attack.

17
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:37,458
If I don't have a wig, my whole
character will be ruined.

18
00:00:37,493 --> 00:00:39,691
Ugh.

19
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,892
- It works.
- I'm very confused.

20
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,861
That's a problem,
when you can't tell me that.

21
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:46,897
In the end,
one will win a VIP trip

22
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:48,531
from Kryolan
Professional Makeup

23
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:51,729
to one of their
85 international locations,

24
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:55,098
a 2013 Fiat 500,

25
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:58,399
and $100,000.

26
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:01,403
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

27
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,638
Only one will win Face Off.

29
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:46,645
It's kind of nice and relaxing

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,480
after the night
I had last night.

31
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,315
That was awful.

32
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,517
How do you feel about that?

33
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,585
Well, I didn't want
to be there again, you know?

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,487
Then, all of a sudden, I was.

35
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,790
I don't know if I was just
not there mentally,

36
00:01:58,824 --> 00:02:01,760
but in the last challenge,
I was in bottom looks.

37
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:04,364
I think I had been so worried
about pleasing the judges

38
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:05,865
that I'm not being true
to myself.

39
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:07,099
I'm gonna go back
to what I like doing.

40
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:08,434
Same here.

41
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,335
Yup.
Right with you.

42
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,437
From here on out,
you're gonna see big.

43
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:13,872
You're gonna see fabrication.

44
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:17,008
This is gonna be
a whole new ballgame for me.

45
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,614
- Oh!
- Ohh.

46
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:26,517
So we walk into the lab,
and there's lightning.

47
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:27,651
There's smoke.

48
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:29,820
- Oh, creepy.
- Ohh.

49
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,054
This is scary.

50
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:32,822
And there's Patrick Tatopoulos.

51
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:34,090
Hey, guys.

52
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:35,258
- Hey, McKenzie.
- Hey.

53
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,360
I'm sure you all know
who this is.

54
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,995
Please welcome
today's guest judge,

55
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,464
our very own
Patrick Tatopoulos.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,034
Thank you.
I'm so happy to be back, guys.

57
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,636
It's really good
to see Patrick again.

58
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,304
He's just a fantastic designer.

59
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,039
I have the utmost respect
for Patrick's work.

60
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,040
All right, now...

61
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:53,976
today's challenge is based

62
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,045
on a dark and mysterious figure

63
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,948
whose face has never been seen.

64
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:00,116
The Grim Reaper.

65
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:03,452
Oh, no.

66
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:08,657
It's really cool.

67
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,959
This entire line of Grim Reapers
start walking in.

68
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:12,894
They're all cloaked.
You can't see their faces.

69
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:14,196
I'm really excited about this.

70
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,665
Oh, hell, yeah.

71
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:21,503
Your foundation challenge
is to create your own version

72
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:24,573
of the Grim Reaper,
so that we can finally see

73
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,708
what lies beneath that hood.

74
00:03:26,743 --> 00:03:27,709
- Ooh.
- Awesome.

75
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:29,211
Now, Patrick,

76
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:32,013
with a character as iconic
as the Grim Reaper,

77
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,815
how can the artists
create something original?

78
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,717
Just have to try
to stay very universal.

79
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:37,319
It's a character
that everybody knows.

80
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:39,854
You have to find a way to make
it relatable for everyone.

81
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,457
Now, the winner of today's
foundation challenge

82
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:46,160
will earn immunity and cannot
be eliminated this week.

83
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:49,130
All right, your models
have been randomly assigned,

84
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:51,467
and you have two hours
to complete your makeups.

85
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:55,772
Good luck,
because your time starts now.

86
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:57,807
Good luck.

87
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:01,378
Ever had a bald cap put on?

88
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:02,446
- Yeah.
- All right.

89
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,214
You have such nice hair.

90
00:04:04,248 --> 00:04:08,052
I really want to keep
my Grim Reaper very classic.

91
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:10,587
I want his face to be
crackly and gross,

92
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,689
and I want
to sprinkle blood on him,

93
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:15,659
like he's just taken somebody.

94
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,727
I'm gonna try
some stuff on you.

95
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,096
I find this snakeskin
prosthetic.

96
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:21,731
I've always been
creeped out by snakes,

97
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,734
so maybe I can play into
one of my own kind of fears.

98
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:30,440
I just want to try to do
a new take on a skull.

99
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,009
I've actually applied
seven prosthetics,

100
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:33,410
but they're not being used

101
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:34,978
the way that
they should be used.

102
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:35,979
This is a brow piece.

103
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,581
These are old-age folds,

104
00:04:37,616 --> 00:04:39,349
and he just comes up and points,
and he's like,

105
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:40,651
"You. You're dead.
Let's go."

106
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:45,623
I'm gonna make this
more Hades than a skeleton.

107
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:48,159
I want it to feel old and wise.

108
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:49,761
Big beard, big eyes,

109
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:53,898
so he has this penetrating
sort of stare.

110
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:56,568
I think most people are gonna
go with a skull type of look,

111
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:59,204
so I want to have sections
that are completely black.

112
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:00,839
I also want to cover his mouth.

113
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:02,240
You don't want to hear death
sneaking up on you,

114
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,909
so he can't speak.

115
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,844
You have five minutes left!

116
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,121
That's it, everybody!
Time's up!

117
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:18,122
Brushes down.

118
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:19,457
- Hello, Tate.
- Hi, Tate.

119
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:20,925
Tell us about your Grim Reaper.

120
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,662
Well, I just wanted to do
something dry and cracked.

121
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:25,063
Could you move a little bit?

122
00:05:25,098 --> 00:05:26,331
See, that's what's cool,

123
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,633
because it's unexpected
it's gonna move.

124
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:30,835
It's fantastic.
Very cool piece.

125
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:32,837
Mine was kind of inspired
by the look

126
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:34,806
that Rob Zombie
plays with on stage.

127
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:35,874
What you created for the skin

128
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,776
is really effective
and very strong.

129
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,512
I wish you did something else
with the-- the mouth.

130
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:43,015
- What you put-- you know--
- Yeah, I was out of time.

131
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,550
I like the idea,
is to bringing black in it

132
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,685
to the part of the face
that are gone.

133
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:47,986
It's cool.
It's great.

134
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,554
And the mouth,
that was very daring...

135
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,156
...and it came out great.

136
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,259
My Grim Reaper takes advantage
of people's fears.

137
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:55,627
I like what she's done
with the nose,

138
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:57,963
and the delicacy
of how tiny the scales are.

139
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:00,932
Very, very delicate,
and very real.

140
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:03,000
I figured the Grim Reaper
doesn't need a voice,

141
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,335
so just get rid of the mouth.

142
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:05,636
Oh, that's actually
really effective

143
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,271
because it looks like
a sculpted piece, seriously.

144
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,240
You blended them together
very well.

145
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:11,809
I decided to fuse
human anatomy with roots

146
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:13,044
and things
you'd see underground.

147
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,113
Right. The way you split
the nose in half,

148
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:17,081
it's like the roots are forcing
their way through the face.

149
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:18,216
Very original.

150
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,250
Thank you.

151
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,023
All right, Patrick,
which artists

152
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:26,457
created your favorite looks
today?

153
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:29,027
You guys really answered
the challenge very, very well.

154
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,429
Laura, I really was very,
very impressed

155
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,665
with the use
of light and shadows.

156
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,300
- It was very, very effective.
- Thank you.

157
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:38,637
And Tate, your texture
on the skin was super effective.

158
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:40,939
It felt dead,
yet could come alive,

159
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:42,307
and I thought
that was a very big asset.

160
00:06:42,342 --> 00:06:43,609
Great.
Thank you.

161
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:46,245
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

162
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,180
The winner
of this challenge is...

163
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,250
Laura.

164
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:53,319
Congratulations.

165
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:56,354
Laura, you did something
very special with your makeup.

166
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,289
You used generic appliances,

167
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:00,725
put them together
in such a great way.

168
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,994
They felt like they
were one piece of sculpture.

169
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:04,529
Thank you, guys.

170
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:06,031
Laura, as the winner
of this foundation challenge,

171
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:07,499
you have earned immunity

172
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,235
and cannot be eliminated
this week.

173
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:12,671
A shower of relief
goes over me.

174
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,941
Finally, to have immunity,
is just a treat.

175
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:17,776
All right, everybody,
I will see you guys tomorrow

176
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,578
for your next
spotlight challenge.

177
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:20,579
Bye.

178
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:21,747
Big day!

179
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:37,028
It's really cool to be walking
in the middle of Hollywood.

180
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:38,997
We see a big marquee
for the Laugh Factory,

181
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,500
and it says "Face Off"
all over the building.

182
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:44,136
So that's amazing.
This place is historic.

183
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
We walk in,
and there's McKenzie with Ve,

184
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,308
so I guess this is where
we're gonna get

185
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:52,643
our next spotlight challenge,

186
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:54,578
but I don't understand
what the Laugh Factory

187
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:56,380
has to do with makeup.

188
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,016
Welcome to the world-famous
Laugh Factory

189
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,584
on the Sunset Strip.

190
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:03,953
This renowned venue
opened in 1979

191
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:06,689
with a legendary performance
by Richard Pryor.

192
00:08:06,724 --> 00:08:08,491
Since then,
it has continued to host

193
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:09,960
the biggest names in comedy,

194
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:13,329
including Steve Martin,
Eddie Murphy, and Louis CK,

195
00:08:13,364 --> 00:08:14,631
just to name a few.

196
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:17,267
This club isn't only
known for laughs.

197
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,137
It's also one of Hollywood's
most haunted locations.

198
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:23,207
In fact, the office upstairs
used to belong

199
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:25,242
to the comedy legend
Groucho Marx,

200
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:26,577
and visitors say
that they can still

201
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:29,614
see him walking around
up there.

202
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,749
Now, while ghosts
are most commonly seen

203
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,018
in horror movies
and paranormal shows,

204
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:37,455
films like Beetlejuice
made them a source of comedy,

205
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:39,991
so with that in mind,
your spotlight challenge

206
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,926
is to create
an original ghost character

207
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:45,462
that is both scary and funny.

208
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:47,798
Ah, that's fun.

209
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:50,868
Comedy is not easy, and--
I don't know.

210
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:54,504
A scary, funny, graphical--
this is a weird challenge.

211
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,242
Lucky for you guys, we have
Ms. Ve with us here today.

212
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,978
Now, as you know, she won
an Oscar for the iconic makeup

213
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:03,847
she did on Michael Keaton
in Beetlejuice.

214
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:06,917
Ve, you expertly tread
that fine line

215
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:09,853
between being both funny
and scary.

216
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,888
How did you find
that perfect blend?

217
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,991
I made a real good contrast
with his eyes and his hair,

218
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,893
put some moss growing on him

219
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,428
like he crawled out
from underneath a rock,

220
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,264
and that took it
out of the ordinary

221
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:22,800
and gave it that comedic edge
that we were looking for.

222
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,501
The light-hearted
creepy guy.

223
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:25,669
So what are you gonna
be looking for

224
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,504
in their final makeups
on the reveal stage?

225
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,141
I'm gonna be looking for
something that's really creepy

226
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:32,910
and scary, but make him
bitchin' and fun, guys.

227
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,311
Go have a blast.

228
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:36,012
That's awesome.

229
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,414
Thank you, Ve.
All right, guys.

230
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:41,084
I want you to take advantage
of this atmosphere here

231
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:43,053
for some design inspiration.

232
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:44,688
When you're finished,
you can head back to the lab

233
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:46,156
and get started.

234
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,758
Good luck!
Bye.

235
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:55,432
I love the idea of Vaudeville,

236
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:58,401
so my concept is two little
people who used to perform

237
00:09:58,435 --> 00:10:00,136
as clowns in Vaudeville,
would go piggy-back

238
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,637
with a trench coat.

239
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:03,606
One night, one of 'em's drunk,
and they get killed

240
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,875
stepping into traffic
and gettin' hit by a street car.

241
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,043
So now they have
to spend eternity

242
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:09,880
stacked on top of each other.

243
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:12,683
I'm kind of thinking
to do an 18th century duchess

244
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:15,453
who constantly nags her husband

245
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:19,023
and spends all his money,
so he has her beheaded,

246
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:22,260
and then she comes back
to exact her revenge on him

247
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:23,861
so she can constantly
berate him

248
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:25,997
for the rest
of their afterlife.

249
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:30,835
My concept
is "Bone-Cap Bill."

250
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:33,272
He's a Wild West showman
whose show was raided

251
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:34,673
by a tribe of Apaches,

252
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,409
and he was shot up
with arrows and scalped.

253
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,712
He might be a host
of a children's television show

254
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:42,047
in the netherworld.

255
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:48,653
My concept is that
he's a nerdy scientist

256
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:50,288
who got blown up
in his experiment

257
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:51,856
and doesn't even know
he's dead.

258
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,759
He's very fumbling
and he's very physical comedy.

259
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:58,363
All right, guys.
Let's head back to the lab.

260
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,708
We get to the lab
and pick our models,

261
00:11:10,743 --> 00:11:12,477
and we have six hours today.

262
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,615
Today, it's really important
that I get the lower section,

263
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,252
the first body, done,
and the legs of the top body.

264
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:23,621
It's really hard to sculpt
something horizontally

265
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,056
that should be upright.

266
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,190
For this thing to work,

267
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:27,759
all the proportions
have to be right,

268
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:30,028
so I keep standing over it,
making sure that everything

269
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:32,096
is proportionally correct.

270
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,938
So is it a doctor
or is it a scientist?

271
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:43,640
Well, he's, like, a doctor
who's working on a cure.

272
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:44,642
A cure for what?

273
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:45,643
- Cancer.
- Cancer?

274
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:46,777
- Yeah.
- Okay.

275
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:48,546
Something
that's funny and scary

276
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,947
is a very difficult balance.

277
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:52,116
I'm just not excited
about my concept.

278
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,919
I'm still developing the story.

279
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:57,421
I'm just gonna try my best
to make this work

280
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:58,789
'cause I feel that,
this far in the competition,

281
00:11:58,824 --> 00:12:01,125
it's important to take risks.

282
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,067
My character
is "Electro-Cute."

283
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:11,402
She was electrocuted
during a music festival

284
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:14,439
on the Sunset Strip, and now
she roams the Sunset Strip

285
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:16,775
and tries to take over the stage
from all the bands playing.

286
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:19,177
I'm sculpting an amplifier,
and I want it to look

287
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:20,744
like it was fused
into her chest.

288
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:22,980
So I find little
plastic bottle caps

289
00:12:23,014 --> 00:12:25,349
to look like
the On and Off buttons.

290
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:28,451
I think it'll look pretty cool
when it's all pulled together.

291
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:35,459
So this character is going
to have a full chest piece,

292
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,862
a facial piece,
and two ear prosthetics.

293
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:41,098
There's so much involved
with just the chest sculpt

294
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:43,300
that I get straight to work
on that.

295
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:48,304
I'm blocking out the cowl
and the face,

296
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,641
and, about three hours in,
I start questioning my concept.

297
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:54,344
I feel like
this doctor character

298
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,280
doesn't really fulfill
the funny and scary

299
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:57,714
parameters of the challenge.

300
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:00,250
That is huge,
because it's arguably

301
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:03,588
the most important part
of a concept, but I'm worried

302
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:05,790
that I'm gonna have
to start over from scratch.

303
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:08,293
On the other hand,
if I move forward

304
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:09,594
with the concept I have now,

305
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:10,829
they're definitely
gonna send me home.

306
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't have a choice.
I have to make a change.

307
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,669
Coming up...

308
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,370
Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly like that.

309
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:20,638
This is terrible.

310
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:21,672
I'm starting
to have a panic attack.

311
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:22,907
Ugh!

312
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:24,742
It doesn't look funny.
It just looks weird.

313
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,010
It's quite genius.

314
00:13:26,044 --> 00:13:27,845
This doesn't satisfy
the challenge.

315
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,447
So it's day one
of our challenge,

316
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:39,783
and we have to create
a scary but funny ghost.

317
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:40,985
The character
I'm creating right now

318
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,286
doesn't really fulfill that,

319
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,323
so I realize that I have
to change my concept.

320
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,492
It's rough starting
a new design three hours in,

321
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,860
but I think this makeup

322
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:52,562
will be more successful
if I change it.

323
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:54,864
I come up with another concept,
and it's about

324
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:57,900
a '20s baseball player
who has a raging temper,

325
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,936
and he throws his baseball bat,

326
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,037
and it comes back,

327
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:02,772
hits him in the head,
and kills him.

328
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,341
I feel like this concept
is more comedic.

329
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:06,977
Although
I'm three hours behind,

330
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,913
I know this
was the right decision.

331
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,090
Hey, guys!
We're here for a walkthrough.

332
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,492
- Hey.
- Hey.

333
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,860
- Hey, Tate.
- Hey.

334
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,195
- Tell us about your concept.
- Wow.

335
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,763
He was a Wild West performer

336
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,499
that was attacked
by a tribe of Apaches,

337
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,534
and now he's a children's
television show

338
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,871
for the spirits of dead kids.

339
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,205
Oh, that's hysterical.

340
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,007
I was thinking about
making the character grayscale.

341
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,710
Do you think that I should
put in some yellows and greens?

342
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,211
- I do. I do.
- Yeah?

343
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:42,080
And even to the point
of maybe a little dust on him...

344
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,915
- Yeah, okay.
- ...because it's the Wild West.

345
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,549
He hasn't had a bath
for a long time.

346
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,050
I like that.

347
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,419
My girl's gonna be called
"Electro-Cute,"

348
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,854
and she was playing an outdoor
festival with her band...

349
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:52,655
- She's so cute.
- ...and she got electrocuted

350
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,957
when it started to rain.

351
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:56,826
I was thinking of having
white lightning bolt patterns

352
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,061
all over her body.

353
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:00,130
It's almost gonna read
like a large blood vein

354
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,632
as opposed to a lightning bolt.

355
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:02,699
It could be a blood vein,

356
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,801
maybe around the body
coming down.

357
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,870
- Just not too many.
- Yeah. Don't overdo it.

358
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:08,672
With the face,
I'm exaggerating the chin and--

359
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:09,706
Now, you know something?

360
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,108
To make it a little bit
more comedic,

361
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,344
you might add a little bit more
under the chin there.

362
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,279
- Really go for the gusto?
- Yeah.

363
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:18,582
So, my concept
is this cartoon-style ghost

364
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,518
with a baseball bat
wedged in his head.

365
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,186
What is the purpose
of the chin?

366
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,654
That was just
an aesthetic choice

367
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,189
to balance the top of the cowl.

368
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,391
I could see the judges saying,
"What is it? Tell me."

369
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:28,759
And you're gonna
have to come up with a story.

370
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,494
- They're Vaudeville performers.
- Okay.

371
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,162
They act during
the intermissions in Vaudeville.

372
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,864
- Okay.
- I'm just trying to get the--

373
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:35,265
the right expression
on the face.

374
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,134
This man looks like
he's screaming bloody murder.

375
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,836
I almost like
your sketch better,

376
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,104
- where he had a big stogie...
- Yeah.

377
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,073
...hanging out of his mouth
as opposed to...

378
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,509
All right, everybody.

379
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:46,743
We're heading out,
but it's looking good.

380
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:49,279
- Thanks, guys.
- Have a good one.

381
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,119
Mr. Westmore suggested
I close the mouth.

382
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:56,620
I got to find something
to make a cigar out of.

383
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:58,722
After I make a little quick
cigar and pop it in there,

384
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,124
I see that it's a lot funnier
with the mouth closed.

385
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,098
So I finished sculpting
the chest

386
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,500
and head straight
into the mold room.

387
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:13,871
And the goal is to get the chest
piece molded and ready for foam.

388
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:16,774
Now, hopefully, if I can
get the chest out by today,

389
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:19,309
I can pre-paint it tomorrow,
so that's the goal.

390
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,811
The chest is priority.

391
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,750
But there's gonna be
a baseball bat,

392
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:27,951
like, wedged in his head.

393
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,620
I can't use a real bat,
obviously,

394
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,155
because that would be
too heavy,

395
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:33,057
so I'm using a tube of foam

396
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,759
and carving the shape of a bat
with a belt sander.

397
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,028
I'm also sculpting a divot
in the cowl

398
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,263
where the bat
hits him in the head

399
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,764
to keep it in place.

400
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,433
I'll attach velcro patches
to both the bat and the cowl.

401
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:44,701
Whoa!
You made this?

402
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,335
Yeah. I mean,
it's kind of rough, but--

403
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,104
- That's so good.
- Thanks.

404
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:52,375
One of the things that
I am a little confused about

405
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,544
is how the hell
I'm gonna make this head

406
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,147
that I have
to have her carrying.

407
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,184
I see that all the wigs
have these styrofoam heads

408
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,919
that they're on top of,
and I'm like,

409
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,288
"Maybe I can
just use one of these

410
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,823
and get away with that."

411
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,958
I start stippling latex
all over it,

412
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:10,095
and then I start gluing these
pre-made prosthetics onto it,

413
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,930
and I find a nose
that's very similar to the nose

414
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,232
that I'm sculpting
on my female character.

415
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,601
I think that I can make this
work well enough

416
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:17,769
for what I need it to be.

417
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:18,937
I like the nose.

418
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,406
- It goes with your, uh--
- Her nose?

419
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,309
Goes with her nose, yeah.

420
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:31,251
At the end of day one,
I get my chest piece molded

421
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,553
in time to bake overnight
for foam.

422
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,255
That's time, everybody.

423
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,192
I'm all ready
to paint tomorrow,

424
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,327
and I'm feeling really good.

425
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:52,672
It's day two,
and we have 9 1/2 hours

426
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:53,907
in the lab today,

427
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:56,110
and the first thing I do
is check out my bodysuit.

428
00:17:56,144 --> 00:17:57,277
Hey.

429
00:17:57,312 --> 00:17:59,179
Oh, my God.

430
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:00,647
That is so amazing.

431
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:02,349
That's so fantastic.

432
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:03,750
Roy, put it on.
Please?

433
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:04,851
I got to get stuff made
right now.

434
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,253
All right.

435
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:07,587
Today, I really have
to finish sculpting the face,

436
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,023
and then I got
to sculpt the arms.

437
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,461
Day two in the lab.

438
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,730
I have to get started
on the broomstick pony.

439
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,632
The skull is a pretty
involved process.

440
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,734
I think maybe
I'll carve some rigid foam

441
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,035
to make the jaw piece,

442
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,471
and then hollow it out
to make the skull.

443
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,273
That's so cool.

444
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,508
I'm going to paint the skull
realistically.

445
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:29,876
I want the eyes to glow,

446
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,011
so I figure out how to get eyes
in there and mount them,

447
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,647
and then I make a rigging
where my model

448
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,550
can actually pull a trigger
and make the mouth move.

449
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:39,085
And I just got to make the bridle
and the saddle

450
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,887
and all that other stuff.

451
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,859
I'm about
an hour and a half in,

452
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:49,363
so I head over to the wet room
and get ready for molding.

453
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:52,032
I have plenty of time
to knock these two pieces out.

454
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,767
I feel like I'm back on track.

455
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,135
I'm feeling pretty good.

456
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:57,037
You got your sculpts done
pretty fast, Eddie.

457
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:59,539
Yeah, not too bad
for starting over.

458
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:09,549
For my character, I really
want to create my own wig

459
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,384
for her to make her hair
stick straight up

460
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,985
as if she was electrocuted,

461
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,053
but it's really hard

462
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,988
and taking a lot longer
than I thought.

463
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:20,692
I've tried multiple ways,

464
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,195
but it's so messy and sticky.

465
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,731
It's sticking to my hand,
and then it sticks to the table.

466
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,433
It sticks to my brush,
and it's just so frustrating.

467
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,902
Ugh!

468
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,271
I'm starting to have
a panic attack.

469
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:36,309
If I don't have a wig, my whole
character will be ruined.

470
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,783
So it's day two
of our funny ghost challenge,

471
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,819
and I can't get this wig
to come out the way

472
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,820
I want it to look.

473
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:48,988
Ugh!

474
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,589
I have to get my wig done.

475
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,525
If I don't have a wig,
my whole concept will be ruined

476
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,227
because the judges
won't be able to see

477
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:56,429
that she's been electrocuted.

478
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:59,298
This is so hard.

479
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,333
Laney's having
a really hard time.

480
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,236
I know all of us guys
promised to stop helping people,

481
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,605
but I can see that look
on her face

482
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,706
and I feel really bad.

483
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
Does it look bad?

484
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,274
Well, it doesn't look done.

485
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:11,442
I'm in a good place
with my stuff,

486
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,910
so I jump over and help her.

487
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,011
This is terrible.

488
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,812
- It's not doing what you want?
- No.

489
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:17,966
_

490
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,418
You're gonna have to put
some Gafquat here, Gafquat here.

491
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,921
Then you can, like,
roll up these tips into,

492
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,189
like, points and stuff.

493
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,790
I give her a couple ideas
with Gafquat.

494
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,093
It's a very heat-sensitive
hair adhesive,

495
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,160
so if you just hit it
with a hair dryer,

496
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,195
you can pull it right up.

497
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,863
Okay, that's smart.

498
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,968
So that stuff
worked pretty good?

499
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,570
- Yeah.
- Good.

500
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,272
It makes it look so much nicer.

501
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:44,242
I wish I'd used this
the entire time.

502
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,351
After the science experiment
explosion,

503
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:57,089
my mad scientist is scratched up
and really burnt,

504
00:20:57,123 --> 00:21:01,359
and I think it'll be funny
to have his ear

505
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,594
kind of falling off,

506
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,663
and I'm gonna make it
out of silicone.

507
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,499
This blue piece
is the silicone mold

508
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,801
that was made
from my model's life cast.

509
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,671
I'm pouring a platinum cure
silicone in,

510
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:15,541
and when it hardens,
I should be able to get an ear.

511
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:21,146
Oh, my God.

512
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:23,249
Oh, my--

513
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,585
I see Roy in the two-part
little person costume.

514
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,256
That thing is freakin' me out,
and Roy is smiling on top of it.

515
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,191
"Hee-hee-hee,"
like, giggling like a kid.

516
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:33,992
Eeeeh!

517
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,928
That's terrifying.

518
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:39,065
That's your greatest thing
you've ever created.

519
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,066
Wah!

520
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,568
Roy is pulling it off
again, man.

521
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:43,369
He's doing an amazing, complex,

522
00:21:43,404 --> 00:21:44,838
crazy thing,
and it looks great.

523
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:48,141
Bye, guys!

524
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:50,176
Seeing Roy
create two characters

525
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,146
is making me question how much
I'm doing this challenge.

526
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,114
His concept is very strong,

527
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:58,451
and it's gonna take a lot
for me to match that.

528
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,098
It's almost the end of the day,

529
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:13,832
and I'm really stressed out.

530
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,868
I spent so much time
working on the wig,

531
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:19,638
and now I'm really behind
with everything else.

532
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,872
Time's up!
Let's go home.

533
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,475
I'm really worried
about tomorrow.

534
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,876
There's so much to get done,

535
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,914
and I don't know if I'll
have time to finish everything.

536
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,662
It's the beginning
of application day,

537
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,997
and we only have four hours
in the lab.

538
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,766
When I get
to my prosthetic--

539
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,467
What the fuck is that?

540
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,270
The entire thing
has these big air pockets

541
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,439
between the foam latex
and the skin.

542
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,940
But if I try to glue it,

543
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,943
my whole detail layer
will be eliminated,

544
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:01,444
and that would be really bad,

545
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,146
because that's what I spent
all the time sculpting.

546
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,683
So I'm gonna have to spend
quite a bit of time

547
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,451
patching this.

548
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:10,354
Because it took me
a lot longer than I wanted

549
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,924
to finish my wig,
I got really behind.

550
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,425
So I immediately
just start getting

551
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,828
all my stuff ready
before the models get here.

552
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,171
- What's up? Yeah.
- What's up?

553
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,939
You're gonna be midgets today.

554
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,674
She's a rocker girl
that got electrocuted.

555
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,443
Just let me know
wherever it does not feel good.

556
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,445
My first priority
is making sure

557
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,681
that the details on the face
are solid.

558
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,616
Even though I have immunity,

559
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,952
I am really hoping
to impress the judges

560
00:23:41,986 --> 00:23:43,887
because I want
to win this challenge,

561
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,723
and I think
I might have a chance.

562
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,727
The judges are gonna be
looking for a funny ghost.

563
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:52,229
And you want to close it,
like, all the way.

564
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:55,132
And a lot of that's gonna depend
on my model's performance.

565
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,366
Walk this way.

566
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,367
And I keep telling her,
it's like,

567
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,735
"Try and make it sell."

568
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,003
No, a little--
little bit shorter--

569
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:01,105
little bit shorter steps, yeah.

570
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,140
Just that
little, bitty short step.

571
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,274
If she doesn't pull it off,

572
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,275
I'll probably be going home,

573
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,377
no matter how cool it looks.

574
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,179
That-- that's it.
That's the walk right there.

575
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,214
That's the walk.

576
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,518
I'm painting these elongated
forms around the eyes,

577
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:17,888
and when I take a step back
from my piece,

578
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:21,091
I notice that they seem
a little awkward,

579
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,861
but I'm just gonna do my best
to make what I sculpted work

580
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,297
and spend more time
improving this paint job.

581
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,533
One hour left, guys.
One hour.

582
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,108
Today, everything
is going ridiculously well.

583
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,744
The face piece fits him great,
it emotes.

584
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,345
He can move his mouth, nose--
everything works,

585
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,181
from the makeup
to the broomstick pony.

586
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,449
Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly like that.

587
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,418
Hopefully,
things keep going well.

588
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,621
12 minutes!

589
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:56,026
It's almost
the end of application,

590
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,295
and my model's barely painted
and the hands aren't finished.

591
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,365
There's gonna be a lot to paint
in last looks.

592
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,272
That's time, everybody!

593
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,241
Time.
Let's get out of here.

594
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,845
I don't know if I can
finish painting

595
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,147
the entire piece in an hour.

596
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,517
I really think
I could be going home.

597
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:25,588
Coming up...

598
00:25:25,623 --> 00:25:27,324
Come on, airbrush!

599
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,226
I have a feeling
I might be in trouble.

600
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,894
I think he's terrific.

601
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,296
That's not a good place to be
this week.

602
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,363
What have you done?

603
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:41,584
Go, go, go.

604
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:44,153
Good luck, guys.

605
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:45,754
It's last looks,
so we have one more hour.

606
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:48,891
Sit down right here.
We have a lot to do.

607
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:50,793
I need to paint the highlights
and shadows

608
00:25:50,828 --> 00:25:52,896
as quickly as possible,
'cause she's just pink.

609
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,631
Let me see your hand.
Okay.

610
00:25:54,665 --> 00:25:55,899
Can you do this?

611
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:58,568
Having to start over
was really rough for me.

612
00:25:58,602 --> 00:25:59,669
Close your eyes.

613
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:01,037
Now I'm worried
this is not gonna read

614
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:03,639
as the classic, cartoon-style
ghost character.

615
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:05,207
Anybody have
any black gaff tape?

616
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,943
Yup.
Right over here.

617
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:07,944
I'm probably
in the best position

618
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:09,178
I've been in this season.

619
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:10,713
Now all I got to do
is just touch up the eyes

620
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:11,948
and her mouth,

621
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:13,449
and attach the hands
to the trench coat.

622
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:14,517
Oh, my God.

623
00:26:14,551 --> 00:26:16,119
My airbrush starts acting up,

624
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:17,820
and I don't have time
to clean it,

625
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,655
and that's what I was trying
to do all my detail with.

626
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,357
Come on, airbrush!

627
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:24,360
And it's just taking longer
than I expected,

628
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:25,794
and I'm not getting
the paint I want.

629
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:28,363
Ugh!
Stop clogging, please.

630
00:26:28,397 --> 00:26:29,464
Ten minutes!

631
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:30,699
Here.
Come here.

632
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,604
Time's up, everybody!

633
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,972
Whoo!

634
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:39,407
Looking across the room,

635
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:41,609
I'm seeing a lot
of amazing makeups.

636
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:44,578
I think I might
be in trouble this week.

637
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:55,622
Welcome to the Face Off
reveal stage.

638
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:59,793
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

639
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,928
Say hello
to our talented judges.

640
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:04,865
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

641
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:07,234
- Good evening, guys.
- Hey.

642
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:10,170
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

643
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:11,705
Hi, everybody.

644
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:12,939
- Hey, Ve.
- Hi.

645
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:16,042
Creature and concept designer,
Neville Page.

646
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:18,144
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Neville.

647
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,313
This week,
your spotlight challenge

648
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,982
was to create
an original ghost character

649
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,584
that was both scary and funny.

650
00:27:25,618 --> 00:27:27,519
So let's take a look
at your ghosts

651
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:29,788
while the audience at home
tweets about their favorites

652
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:32,124
using #FaceOff.

653
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:35,194
First up, Laura's creation.

654
00:27:58,884 --> 00:28:00,785
I'm proud of this character.

655
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:04,355
He looks like he belongs in
a world where ghosts are funny.

656
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,612
I just can't stop laughin'
at it.

657
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:28,047
It's just so funny.

658
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,550
And you can't
send somebody home

659
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,719
that puts a smile on your face.

660
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,944
From afar,
I'm not happy with it.

661
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:57,179
If I were to do it again,

662
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,982
I would have made the face
more human-like.

663
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:21,203
I'm proud of this character,

664
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:22,705
and I'm especially proud

665
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:24,206
of the amount of work
I pulled off.

666
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,208
I think I definitely nailed
what was asked of me

667
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:28,778
for the challenge.

668
00:29:49,535 --> 00:29:52,469
I think she looks more silly
than she does funny,

669
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:54,805
but at least
it's pulled together.

670
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,474
I'm just hoping
to get by this week.

671
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:20,699
The lightning bolts aren't
as bright as I want them to be.

672
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:22,768
Hopefully, when the judges
take their closer looks,

673
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:24,937
they'll be able to see,
but for me,

674
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:28,442
I absolutely love
what I've created.

675
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:35,348
Judges, why don't you
go ahead and get up close

676
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,784
to the ghosts?

677
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,691
It's very ghost-like
and ethereal.

678
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,593
I like the way she got
a little bit of it up there.

679
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,261
- That's cool.
- Can you look that way, please?

680
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:49,530
'Cause there's
a nice little slit ear.

681
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:51,332
Ooh, look at that.

682
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,036
- That's a lot of work.
- Yeah.

683
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,204
He shouldn't have wasted time

684
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,473
putting prosthetics
on her face.

685
00:30:58,507 --> 00:30:59,707
No, I don't get it.

686
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:01,409
Although it does at least
make her look dead-ish.

687
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:02,700
Yeah.

688
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:05,746
All right.

689
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:07,180
What the heck?

690
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:10,217
Turn, so we can check out
the back.

691
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:12,152
What's with the artichoke head?

692
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:14,187
I don't get it.
Like, why is that "Ghost"?

693
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:15,622
- Turn this way.
- Is it, like, an ethereal form?

694
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:17,858
The hat shape
stuck with his head?

695
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:21,395
I see Glenn doing this,
and that is never a good sign.

696
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:22,829
I could be on bottom this week.

697
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,534
Oh, they're little worms.

698
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:30,103
Yeah.
I love the hair.

699
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:32,272
- This is so nice.
- That is cool.

700
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:35,142
And it's stayin' on
really good.

701
00:31:35,176 --> 00:31:36,543
Thank you.

702
00:31:39,448 --> 00:31:41,315
- Who is he?
- Oh, that's my husband.

703
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,383
- Nice.
- Hmm.

704
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,751
This could have benefitted

705
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:45,286
from some more color in here.

706
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:47,442
_

707
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,492
It's just so monotone.

708
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:53,161
I don't like anything
about my makeup this week.

709
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:57,098
I just hope I'm not going home
for this one.

710
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,702
Who made
your favorite ghost tonight?

711
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:04,406
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

712
00:32:08,664 --> 00:32:10,234
It's just so monotone.

713
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:13,668
***

714
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:15,569
I did the best I could
with this challenge,

715
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,804
but I'm just not a fan
of this character,

716
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:20,438
and I'm probably
gonna be in trouble.

717
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,542
She's pretty cool.

718
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,944
I just don't like
this all-gray look.

719
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,880
It's these hard form choices.

720
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,947
- Yeah.
- Can you open your mouth?

721
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:33,182
Thank you so much.

722
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,249
Okay.

723
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:36,718
All right.
Thank you.

724
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,453
Thank you.

725
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:44,524
The judges
have scored your creations,

726
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:46,659
so let's find out
what they thought.

727
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:49,460
Miranda...

728
00:32:49,494 --> 00:32:53,129
Tate...

729
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:55,131
Congratulations,
you are both safe

730
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,566
and can head back
to the makeup room.

731
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,933
- Thank you, guys.
- Thanks, guys.

732
00:32:58,968 --> 00:33:01,536
Thank you.

733
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:06,873
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

734
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:08,974
Now, the judges would
like to speak with each of you

735
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:11,009
to learn more about your work.

736
00:33:11,043 --> 00:33:13,144
Laura, please step up.

737
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:19,882
Laura, tell us
about your concept this week.

738
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,583
I decided on mad scientist,

739
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:23,318
because he could be
in an explosion

740
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:24,486
and he doesn't know he's dead.

741
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,087
And once he figures out
he's dead,

742
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:28,122
then he'll finally cross over.

743
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:31,525
I think it's superb.

744
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,893
Your decision making this week
was spot-on.

745
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:36,294
The edges are beautiful,
as they always are,

746
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,862
and it feels like
something from films

747
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:42,164
like the Frighteners
or the Beetlejuice world.

748
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:45,267
- It's quite well done.
- Thank you.

749
00:33:45,301 --> 00:33:47,669
You did a massive amount
of work yet again.

750
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:49,804
You treated his entire body,

751
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:51,572
and I love the little nurnies
and stuff

752
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:52,873
you stretched all over.

753
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:54,507
Once again, a beautiful makeup.

754
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,475
- Thank you.
- It's a good piece of work.

755
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,844
It really is, and I like
the big, bushy eyebrows

756
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:00,712
and his frazzled hair.

757
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:02,613
He feels like a mad scientist.

758
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:04,014
I just wish it was funnier.

759
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:05,481
I agree.
Thank you.

760
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:07,382
Laura, please step back.

761
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:13,186
Eddie.

762
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:20,025
Eddie, tell us
about your concept

763
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,526
for your ghost this week.

764
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,794
My character
was a baseball player

765
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,128
with a raging temper,

766
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,997
and one game, he decided
to throw his bat

767
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:29,364
at the opposing team's dugout,

768
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,799
and it came back
and knocked him on the head,

769
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,601
and that's how he passed away.

770
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:35,603
It doesn't look funny.
It just looks weird.

771
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:37,238
I'm very confused.

772
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:40,676
I don't understand this weird,
kiss-like apertures

773
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,044
around his eyes,

774
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:45,014
and the pointed chin,
and the artichoke head.

775
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,184
Why did you go that route?

776
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,552
Well, that was more
of an aesthetic choice,

777
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,722
just to make it kind of
on the cartoony-side.

778
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,824
I think you missed
the funny part of it.

779
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,760
For me, if this guy gets hit
in the back of the head,

780
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,628
his eyeballs
would be bulging out.

781
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,730
All kids of crazy stuff
should be happening.

782
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:05,268
I think you fell short
on that whole aspect.

783
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:08,071
I laughed inside
when he was looking for the bat.

784
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,639
It was kind of funny
that he couldn't find it,

785
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,041
and it was stuck to his head,

786
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:14,178
but, aesthetically,
it's so nightmarish and weird.

787
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,880
That doesn't fly as comedic.

788
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,982
The kiss makeup
around his eye--

789
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,584
what are you pulling from?

790
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,052
That was kind of
just an aesthetic choice.

791
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,120
That's a problem
when you can't tell me that.

792
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,422
- You see what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

793
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,157
It's not funny.

794
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,259
It's not telling me the story,

795
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,030
- and it doesn't feel at all like a ghost.
- Yeah.

796
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,832
Eddie, please step back.

797
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,201
Thanks, guys.

798
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,473
Roy.

799
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,546
Roy, what have you done?

800
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,813
Well, these
are the Cain Brothers,

801
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,281
and they were Vaudevillian
performers.

802
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,049
They had a drinkin' problem,
and one night

803
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,085
they stepped into traffic
and got hit by a streetcar.

804
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,120
They were killed, so this
is how they have to live

805
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,688
in the afterlife.

806
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:01,625
It works.

807
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,027
At a distance, head looks real.

808
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:09,099
It almost passes
for a genuine little person.

809
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:10,701
I laughed out loud on this one.

810
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:11,868
Thank you.

811
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,869
It's quite genius,

812
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:15,138
because you manage so deftly

813
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,773
to capture the humor aspects
of the challenge.

814
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,344
I love the simplicity
of the arm gag.

815
00:36:21,378 --> 00:36:22,945
- Really well done.
- Thank you.

816
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:27,015
This is a quintessential
Vaudevillian trick.

817
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,651
They would put two little kids
on top of each other

818
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:30,919
to create an adult,

819
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:34,322
and you pulled it off
so well with one person.

820
00:36:34,357 --> 00:36:36,591
Unbelievable, honey.
You did a great job.

821
00:36:36,626 --> 00:36:37,726
Thank you.

822
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,761
Roy, please step back.

823
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:47,035
- Nice job.
- Laney, please step up.

824
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:54,943
Laney, tell us
about your character.

825
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:56,278
Her name
is "Electro-Cute,"

826
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:58,981
and she
was a rock band guitarist

827
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:00,482
that was playing
an outdoor festival,

828
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:02,851
and during the show,
it started to rain,

829
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:05,221
and she became electrocuted
by her guitar.

830
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:08,357
It does not tell me
the story about her

831
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,860
and how she's a ghost.

832
00:37:11,895 --> 00:37:15,231
I don't understand why
her skull looks like that.

833
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,334
You used
these very confusing forms

834
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:20,069
to create your head sculpture,

835
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:21,904
and it does not make me laugh.

836
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:25,407
It just makes me confused.

837
00:37:25,442 --> 00:37:26,976
Well, she's very cute,

838
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,779
but she looks to me
more like a punk rock alien.

839
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,115
You don't have anything
on her that looks like

840
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:35,083
she was electrocuted--
like she would have had

841
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:38,553
singeing marks
or something crazy somewhere.

842
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:40,355
It just missed for me
this week, honey.

843
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,824
These are good ideas,
but you've got to turn it up,

844
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:44,993
because it's
supposed to be funny.

845
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:47,429
You have to make it
a caricature.

846
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:49,865
I'm pleased
with how ambitious you are,

847
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,603
but I'm disappointed that this
doesn't satisfy the challenge.

848
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:58,240
Laney, if you'd please
step back.

849
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,648
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

850
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:07,450
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

851
00:38:07,484 --> 00:38:09,018
while they deliberate.

852
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:11,253
Thank you.

853
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,725
Okay, judges.

854
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,960
Let's start with the looks
you liked the most this week.

855
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:20,463
Why don't we begin with Laura?

856
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:21,631
Loved it.

857
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,533
Liked it.
I didn't laugh out loud.

858
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,134
Clean, beautiful,

859
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,871
and sound decision making
each step of the way.

860
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,173
She did a fabulous job again.

861
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,474
She could have pushed it
a little further,

862
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,376
and then it would have
really been funny.

863
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,978
All right,
let's move on to Roy.

864
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,447
Okay, well, Roy really knocked
it out of the park for me.

865
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,981
I got it immediately.

866
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,518
The face on the small person
carrying her is quite funny.

867
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:44,352
I'm really happy
with his work this week.

868
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:47,121
I'm happy to see this Roy back.

869
00:38:47,156 --> 00:38:49,724
Okay, let's move on to
the looks you liked the least.

870
00:38:49,758 --> 00:38:52,360
Why don't we start with Eddie?

871
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:56,497
Just so un-obvious
as to what it is supposed to be.

872
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:58,766
The things around the eyes
are just so bizarre.

873
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,334
I really don't like it.

874
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:03,070
I've had enough of backstories
that try to make sense

875
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:05,240
out of something
that is not fitting in

876
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:06,942
to what it is
that we asked them to do.

877
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:09,043
You would never be able
to pull that off on set.

878
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:11,479
All right,
let's move on to Laney.

879
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:12,981
She had a really cute idea.

880
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:14,716
It could have been done
really well.

881
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,719
I loathe the forms
that she used on the head.

882
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:19,287
They make no sense at all.

883
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:21,957
She has got to stop
infusing every piece

884
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:23,525
with her personality.

885
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,894
- Yeah.
- It needs to be stand-alone.

886
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,863
So, judges,
have you made your decisions?

887
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:28,897
Yes, we have.

888
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,266
Let's bring them back out.

889
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:38,507
All right, Glenn, why don't you
tell us about the top looks?

890
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:40,809
Laura...

891
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:43,845
Your makeup
was especially well done,

892
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,580
and it hit just the right note

893
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:47,449
for this week's
particular challenge.

894
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,017
And, Roy...

895
00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:51,587
We loved your crazy concept
this week,

896
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:54,657
and more than impressed
by all the snap decisions

897
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:56,659
that you've had to make
in order to pull it off

898
00:39:56,693 --> 00:39:57,827
for this challenge.

899
00:39:57,861 --> 00:40:00,029
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

900
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,597
The winner tonight is...

901
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:11,707
Who is the winner
of this challenge?

902
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,276
The winner tonight is...

903
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:19,548
Roy.

904
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:21,550
Yay!
You got one.

905
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,953
Only you could have
come up with and executed

906
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:25,221
something like this character

907
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:27,690
on the level
that you did this week,

908
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:29,425
and it all worked so well.

909
00:40:29,459 --> 00:40:30,760
Thank you very much.

910
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:32,662
It feels good
to finally win one.

911
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,164
It's our tenth challenge,
and this is my first win.

912
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,333
About damn time.

913
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,302
Roy, congratulations.

914
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,051
You and Laura can head back
to the makeup room.

915
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:43,307
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

916
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:52,481
Unfortunately, that means,
Eddie and Laney,

917
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:54,049
you are on the bottom
this week,

918
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:56,586
and one of you
will be eliminated.

919
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,829
Please step forward.

920
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,831
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

921
00:41:08,865 --> 00:41:13,135
Eddie, while your concept
was interesting,

922
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,304
very little of it
was evident in your makeup

923
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,240
because of the hyper-stylized
choices that you made.

924
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,811
Laney, we were disappointed
in the shapes that you used

925
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:25,580
in the face and thought
that it maybe looked

926
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,149
more alien than it did ghost.

927
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:30,051
So who's going home tonight?

928
00:41:30,086 --> 00:41:32,420
The person going home
tonight is...

929
00:41:36,558 --> 00:41:38,661
Eddie.

930
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:42,398
Your character was neither
here nor there for us tonight.

931
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:45,301
It wasn't particularly scary
or funny,

932
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,770
and we weren't really sure

933
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,906
what it was
that we were looking at.

934
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,608
Eddie, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

935
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:56,111
That means, Laney,
you are safe this week.

936
00:41:56,145 --> 00:41:59,447
You can head back
to the makeup room.

937
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:07,289
Eddie, you're a young guy.

938
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:08,857
You got a long road
ahead of you,

939
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:11,326
and I'm excited to see
where you take it,

940
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,161
because you've got
a real bold aesthetic,

941
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:14,463
and that's an asset.

942
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:15,798
Thank you.

943
00:42:15,832 --> 00:42:18,233
Eddie, it's really been great
having you here with us.

944
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:20,335
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

945
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,536
and pack up your kit.

946
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:22,704
Thank you, guys.

947
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,239
I've had
an incredible experience.

948
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:25,240
Thank you.
Good luck.

949
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:26,542
Bye, Eddie.

950
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:28,877
I'm very happy that I made it
ten challenges in,

951
00:42:28,912 --> 00:42:32,181
and I've learned
so many things.

952
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:33,582
Hey, guys.
It's me.

953
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,118
Aww.

954
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,520
I'm feeling all right.

955
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,088
I've gotten to know
a lot of great people,

956
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,091
and I've gotten feedback
from industry professionals.

957
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,159
Oh, boy.

958
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:44,761
I know I have a lot to learn,

959
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:47,830
and Face Off has really
inspired me to keep at it.

960
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,301
I'm gonna go home
with my head held high,

961
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:55,296
and I feel like I've already won
by just being here.
