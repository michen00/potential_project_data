Previously on<i>Face Off...</i>

2
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:10,496
Miranda's creepy mole rat
brought her her third win.

3
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:11,680
Your creature
worked on every level.

4
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:13,716
Thank you guys so much.

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,467
Adolfo's piece fell short,

6
00:00:15,518 --> 00:00:18,721
and he was sent home.

7
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:22,424
Now 11 artists remain,
and tonight,

8
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:25,260
they'll face the mother
of all challenges...

9
00:00:25,295 --> 00:00:27,730
The ultimate giver of life,
Mother Nature.

10
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:29,298
That's my babe.
I love her!

11
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:33,335
But some will lose their heads.

12
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,570
Head came off the mannequin.

13
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:36,105
I've never seen anything
like it.

14
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:37,873
So bad.

15
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,708
It's really hard to focus.

16
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:41,510
My head's in the wrong place.

17
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:43,746
It sucks.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,814
Have you ever done
a beauty makeup?

19
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:47,716
I mean, the eyelashes
aren't even on properly.

20
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:51,253
I do love the overall nature
of this piece very much.

21
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:53,489
It is only with contempt

22
00:00:53,523 --> 00:00:55,557
that I regard
that particular decision.

23
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,326
In the end, one will win

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,995
a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

25
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:02,898
to one of their
85 international locations,

26
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:05,834
a 2013 Fiat 500,

27
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,471
and $100,000.

28
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:12,241
Who will be the next great name
in movie magic?

29
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:14,243
Only one will win <i>Face Off.</i>

00:01:58,555 --> 00:02:00,189
How are you feeling
this morning?

32
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:03,675
Still a little shaky.
I didn't sleep very well.

33
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:06,061
Yeah, me neither.
I was embarrassed.

34
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,463
After the last challenge,
I feel like I dodged a bullet.

35
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:09,765
I just felt awful

36
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,600
because it wasn't what I wanted
to put out there,

37
00:02:11,618 --> 00:02:12,835
and it was a piece of crap.

38
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:14,253
I was prepared to hear my name.

39
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,871
Me too.

40
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:17,990
I'm sorry it was Adolfo, but I'm
glad it was him instead of me.

41
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,508
Yeah, I thought
for a split second there

42
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:20,508
we were gonna have
two middle-aged men

43
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:21,894
with heart attacks.

44
00:02:21,945 --> 00:02:23,011
Now I'm trying to get my head

45
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:25,230
back in the game
for this next challenge.

46
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:27,916
If I don't get serious,
I will be going home quick,

47
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:30,636
and I don't want
to go home quick.

48
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:42,564
So we're at the LA Arboretum...

49
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,666
Oh, it's beautiful out here.

50
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,202
I'm just like,
"Planting flowers, oh, my God"

51
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,671
I am so ready for
this challenge, whatever it is.

52
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:50,772
Good morning, guys.

53
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:52,374
- Good morning, girl.
- Morning.

54
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:54,042
Welcome
to the Los Angeles County

55
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:57,145
Arboretum & Botanic Garden.

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,881
Featuring plants
from all around the world,

57
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:01,683
it's also been seen
in hundreds of movies,

58
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:05,153
such as <i>Jurassic Park,</i>
<i>Meet The Fockers,</i> and <i>Tarzan.</i>

59
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:06,388
Wow.

60
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:08,223
This week's
spotlight challenge is based

61
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:11,493
on one of the most well-known
mythological characters

62
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:12,694
of all time.

63
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,764
She's the ultimate giver
of life, Mother Nature.

64
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:17,599
That's my babe.
I love her!

65
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,920
For this week's
spotlight challenge,

66
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,424
you will each create an original
Mother Nature goddess...

67
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:28,243
But I want these characters

68
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:31,713
to be really personal
for you guys too,

69
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:33,498
so I want each of you
to include a feature

70
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,050
in your makeup that represents

71
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,785
your mom.

72
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,986
Aw.

73
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,204
This is so sweet.

74
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:41,156
Honestly, I'm inspired
by my mother

75
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,591
every single challenge.

76
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,459
She's an incredible artist
herself.

77
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:46,461
Now, before you get started
on your designs,

78
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:48,630
I'd like to introduce you
to a special guest

79
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:51,733
who knows exactly what it takes
to impress the judges--

80
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:55,537
last season's <i>Face Off</i> champion,
Anthony Kosar.

81
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:57,539
Aw.

82
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:58,523
Cool.

83
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,377
- Great to see you again.
- Great to see you too.

84
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:03,778
I'm very excited
because I watched

85
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:04,980
every episode of season four,

86
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:06,815
and Anthony was one
of the best artists

87
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:07,883
to be on <i>Face Off.</i>

88
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:09,818
And to have his feedback
and advice

89
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:11,253
in this challenge
is incredible.

90
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:13,238
You created a couple
of winning makeups

91
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,791
that showcased
nature and beauty,

92
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:17,426
so how can these artists
make sure

93
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,094
that their goddesses stand out?

94
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,612
You really want to bring out
the feminine features,

95
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:23,398
make all the forms soft, subtle,
and really elegant.

96
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:24,616
Great. Thank you.

97
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:25,667
- Anthony, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

98
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:26,668
And thank you
for being here today.

99
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:27,703
Thanks for having me.

100
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:29,638
All right, guys, keep in mind,

101
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:31,873
the judges will be looking
for beautiful characters.

102
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:35,193
Now go ahead and explore
these amazing gardens.

103
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:37,045
- Thank you.
- Bye!

104
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:43,518
Laura and I head off
to the rose garden.

105
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:46,154
I love my mom very much,
and she's very hardworking,

106
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,457
so being in the rose garden
inspired me

107
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,426
to incorporate thorns resembling
her strength and hard work.

108
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:52,427
I'm playing around
with the idea

109
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:56,064
of making her skin
a tree texture.

110
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:59,234
My mother, she's been
such an inspiration to me,

111
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,169
and she's so into music,

112
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,804
so I'm gonna try to incorporate

113
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:06,241
a trumpet-looking flower
into the design.

114
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:09,828
I love my mom, and we've had
a really rough year,

115
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:11,413
and it's clouding
this challenge.

116
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,815
We lost my dad.
My mom has Parkinson's.

117
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,451
It's been getting
progressively worse,

118
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:18,086
so it's hard to separate
what I'm supposed

119
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:23,241
to try to do on this,
so I'm just doodling.

120
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:26,828
I can't really focus
on what I need to do.

121
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:30,799
My mom, she's known
for her hair like I am,

122
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,200
and her silhouette
really comes forward,

123
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:34,469
so I want to put that
in my design.

124
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:37,172
I love my mom,
and I want to bring that emotion

125
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:40,375
into my character as well.

126
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,027
My mom used to have
a green thumb.

127
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:45,113
She could take a snip
of any plant and make it grow.

128
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:47,215
Mother Nature
is like the giver of life,

129
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,084
from the roots
all the way to the top,

130
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:53,355
so I'm gonna incorporate
a little bit of all that.

131
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,359
My mom is a florist,
and we worked in the gardens,

132
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:59,694
and she taught me
the beauty of nature,

133
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:01,113
like spiders that are beautiful

134
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,497
and how they're meant
to be here.

135
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:05,033
So my idea is to incorporate

136
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:08,403
a lot of beautiful insects
into my makeup.

137
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:10,672
Okay, guys,
let's head back to the lab.

138
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:11,740
Whew.

139
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:17,679
So we have six hours today
in the lab.

140
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:21,299
First thing we have to do
is pick our models.

141
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,785
I start right off the bat

142
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,239
with sculpting out the wood
textures on my chest piece.

143
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,458
The wood textures
remind me of my mom

144
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,159
because she grew up on a farm,

145
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:34,863
and she loves wood in her home.

146
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,603
I've already done this makeup
on this show.

147
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:46,074
On season two finale,
I did an Earth Mother goddess,

148
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:49,044
so I have no idea
what to do at this point.

149
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,647
First thing that pops
into my head is

150
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:54,682
my mother was really pretty
in the '60s,

151
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,152
when she had
these beehive hairdo pictures.

152
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:58,787
And I'm thinking,

153
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,625
let's do
a 1960s retro, crazy mama.

154
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:10,899
My mother raises deer,
so I decide to go with a deer.

155
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,267
I want to keep a lot
of the feminine qualities alive

156
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,368
in the face.

157
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,770
My mother is also
a very spiritual person,

158
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:17,639
so based
on my mother's spirituality,

159
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:19,241
I'm going to do a tree of life.

160
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:22,177
I may be getting too far away
from Mother Nature,

161
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,662
but I can't pass up
this opportunity

162
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:26,047
to do something great
for my mom.

163
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:29,084
My concept is
a feminine-shaped tree

164
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,452
that's gonna have a belly,

165
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:32,754
so I'm thinking
it could be pregnant.

166
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,390
For me, being pregnant
brought me together

167
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:37,025
so tight with my mom.

168
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:40,545
It's a very magical thing
in a woman's life.

169
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:42,030
Hey, guys, my dad and I
are here for a walk-through.

170
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:44,232
- Oh, my God, yes!
- Hi.

171
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,217
Anthony's joining us.

172
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,035
How you guys doing?

173
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:48,970
It's really cool
to have Anthony here

174
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,389
because he's been where we are.

175
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,575
- Hey, Miranda.
- Hey, guys.

176
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,510
Tell us about
your Mother Nature goddess.

177
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:58,079
I'm going
with a leaf-inspired makeup.

178
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:59,514
I'm gonna do a cowl...

179
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:01,032
Is this gonna come down
around the head?

180
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,318
I'm thinking
I'll try to cover her eyebrows.

181
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,786
Eyebrows create expression,

182
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,788
and if you don't
make them right,

183
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:08,690
you can either make them
look sad or clown-like

184
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,958
- or happy or something...
- Yeah.

185
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:12,310
So I would suggest bringing
your forehead down

186
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,229
to where you could literally
get rid of them then.

187
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,231
I want to have
a pregnant belly.

188
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:17,666
I want to make it clear,

189
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,068
so I can have something inside
that you can see.

190
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:22,170
One thing you might want
to consider is,

191
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,705
you know,
how animals live inside trees.

192
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,974
That's an idea.
Thank you.

193
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:28,076
My plan was to add a wig
or some hair

194
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,011
and transition that hair
into this river

195
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:32,647
and then that river carry on
through armpieces.

196
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:34,516
I would even airbrush
some green into the wig

197
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,817
to tie it in
to what you're doing here.

198
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,352
At this point, I'm unsure

199
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,387
as to whether I'm gonna take
Mr. Westmore's advice.

200
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:42,557
It's fair to say
that I'm not sure what to do.

201
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:44,793
I'm going
for this caterpillar motif.

202
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:46,528
I didn't really get
a caterpillar out of it.

203
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,096
I actually got more
of, like, a Venus flytrap.

204
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:49,297
Mm.

205
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:51,633
Keep it very feminine
so that people can get

206
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,201
a first glance,
see the beauty in it.

207
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:54,369
So keep
some of the features softer.

208
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,137
Okay.

209
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:57,822
- Good luck!
- Good luck, guys.

210
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,024
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

211
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:00,642
Bye.

212
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,870
I'm in such a weird headspace,

213
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:14,656
it's hard for me to come up
with anything beyond just--

214
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,591
I got a drawing down.
I'm just gonna build this.

215
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,927
So the first drawing
I come up with

216
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,362
is kind of what I stick to,

217
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,464
incorporating the flower
and those leaves,

218
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,049
and that's pretty much it.

219
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,433
As the day keeps going on,

220
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:28,136
I'm just getting
more and more frazzled.

221
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,506
It's just--
my head's in the wrong place.

222
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:38,480
This is a new one for me,

223
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:41,266
being one of the first people
into the mold room,

224
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,919
and I feel good about it
'cause I'll have these things

225
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:47,088
all ready to paint tomorrow.

226
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:55,697
I could see Frankie's
not feeling this challenge,

227
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,332
and I think I know why.

228
00:09:57,366 --> 00:10:00,118
He just lost his father
this year.

229
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:02,237
His mom is not
in the greatest health.

230
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:04,439
I just keep thinking
about my mom.

231
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:07,975
She's having the hardest year
of her life,

232
00:10:07,994 --> 00:10:11,713
and it's really hard
for me to focus.

233
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:12,947
Coming up...

234
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:14,849
I'm starting to have
a panic attack.

235
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,052
Damn!
What in the hell is she doing?

236
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:18,486
This is gorgeous makeup.

237
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,523
I think it was a grave mistake
this week.

238
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:31,202
This is
a Mother Nature challenge,

239
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:34,639
and our design needs to be
influenced by our mothers.

240
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:36,808
Frank's had a rough year.

241
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:38,777
His mom is not
in the greatest health,

242
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:43,031
and I could see
that he is losing it.

243
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,182
If this were a job
in the real world,

244
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,567
I probably would've passed.

245
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:48,086
It's too close to home
right now, too fresh.

246
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:52,574
I really don't want to see
my friend lose himself.

247
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,359
He really needs
to stand up straight

248
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:55,794
and stiffen up that upper lip,

249
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:59,381
like, just do
what he needs to do.

250
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,966
I can't stop
because I'm in a sad place.

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,801
If I did throw in the towel,

252
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:05,070
like, that doesn't
serve anybody.

253
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,738
That's not gonna make
my mom happy.

254
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,006
That's not honoring my dad.

255
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,974
So I just keep pushing
and pushing

256
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:13,845
and just praying
that I can at least be safe.

257
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,552
- What's the time?
- 30 minutes left, guys!

258
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,694
And that's time!

259
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:31,763
Time's up. We gotta go.

260
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:33,365
End of day one, I'm exhausted,

261
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,867
but the last thing I want
is to try and make an excuse

262
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,002
for my makeup or my concept
or my design.

263
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:41,740
At the end of the day,
I just have to do it.

264
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:49,581
- Gots a lots to do today.
- Over here.

265
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:51,616
It's day two of our challenge,

266
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,085
we have 9 1/2 hours,
and I need to get

267
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,088
my cowl and my face
completely finished,

268
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,423
both molds made,

269
00:11:58,457 --> 00:12:00,625
and I need to get started
on this bodice

270
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:01,626
that I'm going to create.

271
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,028
I got a lot of work to do.

272
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,500
Everything you do
is always so pretty.

273
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:10,652
- Thank you.
- Hire me someday, please.

274
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:12,404
I'm looking
at everybody else's things,

275
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,739
and I'm going, I'm not making
anything like that.

276
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:15,907
I'm starting to get
a little nervous

277
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,876
maybe I'm going
the wrong direction,

278
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,611
but it's way too late
to shift gears at this point.

279
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,714
So this is a calculated risk,

280
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:23,932
and they're either
gonna love this,

281
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:26,084
or they're gonna hate it.

282
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,491
I'm taking the advice
of Anthony,

283
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:36,561
and I'm using a bunny
inside the belly.

284
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:39,397
I'm making this pregnant belly
by using heat

285
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:42,133
to shape this plastic onto it.

286
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:45,203
And I like the fact that
it's wrinkling in certain spots,

287
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:48,406
because it's giving it
that realism of having veins

288
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,474
and wood texture.

289
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:52,444
I think
it's working out perfectly.

290
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:57,782
4 hours and 14 till end of day.

291
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,485
It took me a bit longer
than I wanted

292
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,653
to finish all my sculptures,

293
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,922
and everyone is
in the mold room.

294
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:06,324
And some people are already
cleaning out their mold,

295
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:07,926
which starts
to really freak me out,

296
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,862
because maybe I didn't
give myself enough time,

297
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,131
but I gotta get it done.

298
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,632
You're getting
a lot of work done, huh?

299
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:18,236
I don't want to hear what
I heard last week ever again.

300
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:22,273
I'm trying to figure out
what's gonna be

301
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,608
the best way
to make my orchids,

302
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:24,742
so what I do is
I take my orchid,

303
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:26,995
and then I put it
on the vacuform machine,

304
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:28,463
which pulls out all of the air

305
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:29,681
that's in the space in between,

306
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:32,417
so you get a perfect copy
of your sculpture.

307
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,385
And it actually looks
really good,

308
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,356
so I spend the next hour
making 12 of them.

309
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:43,728
I'm gonna add a lot of stuff.

310
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:46,965
I've fabricated the arms,
so I take two spandex gloves,

311
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,300
and I put them over the arms
and hands of a mannequin.

312
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,602
And from there,

313
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:53,170
I begin to build up
liquid latex and cotton

314
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:55,673
to form the shape
that I desire.

315
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,675
I really try to match
the textures

316
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,444
on the arms and the cowl.

317
00:13:59,478 --> 00:14:02,063
Unfortunately, I don't have
much time to pre-paint,

318
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:03,314
so I have a lot of work
to do tomorrow.

319
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:04,582
- That's sick, man.
- Thanks, dude.

320
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:06,918
You got some talent, dude.

321
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:11,322
I've got to start to do
some fabrication

322
00:14:11,357 --> 00:14:13,224
because these trumpet flowers

323
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:16,394
are a pretty important part
of the overall design.

324
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:19,430
They're the symbol of my mother
and her love of music,

325
00:14:19,465 --> 00:14:21,165
so I take some foam,

326
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,768
and I start fabricating
as best to my ability.

327
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:25,370
I don't know much
about this foam,

328
00:14:25,404 --> 00:14:28,072
but I'm hoping it'll turn out.

329
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:40,852
I thought my wig
was over the top.

330
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,054
That wig is
definitely over the top.

331
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:44,322
I don't feel so bad.

332
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:48,092
I thought my wig was large,
and I look over at Lyma,

333
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,061
and I'm going,
what in the hell is she doing?

334
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,512
It's huge.

335
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:53,097
I mean, it's cool, but...

336
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:54,799
- But it's too big?
- Damn!

337
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,752
It's almost like
we're having a big wig contest

338
00:14:57,803 --> 00:14:59,704
in this part of the lab.

339
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,914
Yeah, it's cracked
on this side.

340
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:12,100
I'm starting to get
really worried about time

341
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,085
because I'm starting to realize

342
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:17,038
I'm not sure
if my mold's gonna open.

343
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,356
If I don't have a cowl,

344
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:22,226
all I have is
my butterfly face sculpture,

345
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:25,396
and that is not enough
for a makeup at all.

346
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:29,000
All right, go ahead
and go start cleaning that out.

347
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:30,902
I'll get this off.

348
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:32,837
Finally, Tate opens it up,
he gets one side off,

349
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:36,307
and I run outside
and start cleaning it out.

350
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:39,861
I'm trying to hurry up

351
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:43,748
and get the mannequin's head
out of the mold.

352
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,166
I ripped
her mannequin's head off.

353
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:47,919
It's an "Oh, shit" moment.

354
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,887
I've never seen anything
like it.

355
00:15:49,922 --> 00:15:51,139
It's made out of fiberglass.

356
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:52,390
They make boats
out of this shit,

357
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:55,059
so I don't know what happened.

358
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:57,011
I don't like to break
other people's stuff,

359
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,796
so I've got, like, 15 minutes

360
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:02,283
to help this girl get her stuff
ready for foam.

361
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:03,618
And if we just grab
another mannequin,

362
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:04,969
it's guaranteed,

363
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:07,071
even though they're
carbon copies of each other,

364
00:16:07,106 --> 00:16:08,272
there's gonna be
something different,

365
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,224
and it's not gonna register
the same.

366
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,144
Head came off the mannequin.

367
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:14,679
Tate comes outside,

368
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:16,748
and the entire mannequin head

369
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:19,784
is ripped off of my mannequin.

370
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:23,371
I am just freaking out.

371
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,149
Head came off the mannequin.

372
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,651
Tate comes outside,

373
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:34,122
and the entire mannequin head
is ripped off of my mannequin.

374
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:35,290
The head snaps off,

375
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:39,227
and I've never seen
anything like it.

376
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:40,628
I am so scared.

377
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:44,082
I do not think I'm going to have
a good piece tomorrow.

378
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,668
Oh, my God, so bad.

379
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:48,536
I've got, like, 15 minutes

380
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,505
to help this girl get her stuff
ready for foam.

381
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:53,041
And if we just grab another
mannequin, it's guaranteed,

382
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,310
even though they're
carbon copies of each other,

383
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:56,761
there's gonna be
something different,

384
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:58,513
and it's not gonna register
the same.

385
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,515
And I can't have that
on my conscience.

386
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:03,251
I'll put epoxy on it and then
just wrap it in duct tape.

387
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:04,419
It should cast fine.

388
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:06,220
He says that he can fix it,
no problem.

389
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:09,824
I trust him,
so I'm just gonna let him do it

390
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,426
and just hold my breath.

391
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,796
- Thank you so much.
- You got it.

392
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,368
That's amazing!

393
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:21,703
So by the end of day two,

394
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:24,155
I get the idea of making
a crown of leaves,

395
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:28,393
and so I grab some L200 foam
and some raffia.

396
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:31,179
And I have to paint some leaves

397
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:33,114
because all we have
were some deep red ones,

398
00:17:33,148 --> 00:17:35,283
so I want them to be orange.

399
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:36,267
Just sprayed them
with a little light toner

400
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:37,385
- and some yellow...
- Yeah.

401
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,586
And they came out pretty good,
actually.

402
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:41,556
Hopefully, I'll have time
to finish it.

403
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:44,325
What's that time say, Frankie?

404
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,728
- 17.
- 17?

405
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,930
Thank you.

406
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,232
So you're, like, gonna
literally make her a flower.

407
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,734
Like, blend--
Yeah, a flowery petal thing.

408
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,103
I dig it, man.
Nice work.

409
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:05,213
That's time, everybody!

410
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:06,681
Ooh.
All right, well--

411
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:09,317
- So it's the end of day two,
and I'm pretty stressed.

412
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:11,386
I don't know how my foam
is gonna come out,

413
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,787
since my mold wasn't very good,

414
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:15,857
but I guess I'm just gonna have
to sleep on it

415
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:18,860
and pray for the best.

416
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,268
It's application day.

417
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:29,403
I have four hours in the lab
and one hour last looks,

418
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:32,774
and I need to apply the cowl,
two armpieces,

419
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:34,676
and a backpiece,
paint everything,

420
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,411
and I need to make
this character beautiful,

421
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,663
or I'll be in trouble.

422
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:44,752
My foam piece
actually didn't turn out so bad.

423
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:45,987
There are some really bad edges
on it,

424
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:50,258
but I was planning
on hiding those in moss anyways.

425
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:53,895
They're here!

426
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,863
You're gonna be Mother Nature.

427
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:57,298
You're gonna have branches
coming out,

428
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:59,834
and it goes from, like-- from
spring, summer, fall, winter--

429
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:02,937
so, yeah,
we got some pretty cool stuff.

430
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,709
What is this?

431
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:11,045
- It's so ugly!
- Yeah, it's pretty ugly.

432
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,449
The wardrobe I requested
is not what I got.

433
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:16,384
'Cause I have so much to do,

434
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:17,652
I'm just gonna start
on my application

435
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:19,787
and hope
that I can finish quickly

436
00:19:19,822 --> 00:19:21,406
and construct a new wardrobe.

437
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,391
Hopefully this fits you okay.

438
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:26,961
All right, let's get
this thing glued down.

439
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:28,741
I start applying her chin.

440
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:30,524
_

441
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:32,225
_

442
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:34,699
Even though I'm working
on her chin, she keeps talking.

443
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,800
_

444
00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:38,189
I'm like, okay, shh.

445
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,078
_

446
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,444
_

447
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,045
_

448
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,945
Shh, shh.

449
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:46,113
I'm losing time
when I need to be spending it

450
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,515
on other aspects
of this character.

451
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:50,384
I'm gonna spin you around
this way.

452
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:59,594
My game plan today is

453
00:19:59,628 --> 00:20:00,978
to just get it all done
as fast as possible.

454
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:03,047
The first thing I gotta do
is get the branches applied

455
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,499
to my cowl.

456
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,367
I definitely want to make sure
that these branches are secure,

457
00:20:06,401 --> 00:20:08,402
'cause that'd be embarrassing
to have her walk out onstage,

458
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:10,071
and she starts losing limbs.

459
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,506
But they seem to be holding
pretty well,

460
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,709
and it's not as heavy
as I thought it was gonna be.

461
00:20:16,245 --> 00:20:18,029
I have to apply
the pregnant belly,

462
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:21,516
but this was supposed to be
a bunny nest with baby bunnies,

463
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,285
but I only get two,
and they're really big.

464
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,188
They don't fit together
in the belly.

465
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:29,690
I'm deciding to only use one,

466
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:31,843
and it looks a lot like
a stuffed bunny,

467
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:34,178
so it could be a very big risk.

468
00:20:34,229 --> 00:20:35,847
But if I don't put anything
in there,

469
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:37,932
it's just gonna be
an empty belly,

470
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,200
and it won't make sense.

471
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:42,069
Two hours, everybody!
Two hours left on the clock!

472
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,756
_

473
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:49,477
It's me, Scott,
Lyma, and Laney.

474
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:50,778
_

475
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:53,314
Yeah, it's nerve-racking.

476
00:20:53,348 --> 00:20:55,416
First I apply
the facial prosthetic,

477
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,084
and then I move on
to the chest piece.

478
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:59,053
Things seem to be falling
into place...

479
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:01,088
♪ Here comes some color ♪

480
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:04,592
...and as long as the paint job
is on par,

481
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,194
I might actually have a chance
at winning this.

482
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:07,995
I like this.

483
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,832
All right,
we'll keep those there for now.

484
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:13,684
All right,
that's 30 minutes, everybody!

485
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:21,459
I want to put the wig on her
at last looks.

486
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:23,861
I don't want to put it on her
at the shop

487
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:25,396
because there's no way
that wig would make it

488
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:26,981
over to the studio.

489
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:29,350
But that's making me
a little nervous

490
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:31,919
because I didn't want to save
something that big and important

491
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:35,056
to chance it
in that hectic last hour.

492
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,624
Unfortunately,
I don't think there's gonna be

493
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,860
any other way around it.

494
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,199
The clock is ticking,

495
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:47,235
and I'm starting to get
a little nervous

496
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:49,470
because I know my character
is not the strongest here.

497
00:21:49,504 --> 00:21:51,606
My mom is one
of my biggest fans,

498
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,374
and I really don't want
to let her down.

499
00:21:53,408 --> 00:21:54,442
Time's up!

500
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:55,843
How you feeling, dude?

501
00:21:55,878 --> 00:21:57,511
I wish I was farther along
in the paint job.

502
00:21:57,546 --> 00:21:59,480
I still have to make
an entire costume.

503
00:21:59,514 --> 00:22:00,648
Oh, really?

504
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:01,716
I don't know if I'll have time,

505
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,651
but I want to do
a full body painting

506
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:04,986
during last looks.

507
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,270
I want this to be beautiful.

508
00:22:06,305 --> 00:22:09,156
I want this for my mother,
and if it sucks,

509
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:11,592
I'm gonna feel really terrible.

510
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:14,762
Coming up...

511
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:17,331
I think you made a lot
of really smart decisions.

512
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:18,883
She's freaking gorgeous.

513
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:21,535
This is a total failure.

514
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:30,741
♪ I'm gonna get the chair
I want ♪

515
00:22:32,044 --> 00:22:33,544
So there's one hour left.

516
00:22:33,578 --> 00:22:34,829
We're at last looks,

517
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:36,580
and this is the most work
I've ever had to do.

518
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:38,249
I still have to lighten up
all the colors.

519
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:40,301
I still have to add moss
and leaves

520
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:41,319
and all this other stuff.

521
00:22:41,353 --> 00:22:44,488
A part of me is freaking out.

522
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:50,227
Crap.

523
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:51,662
As soon as she sits down,
I realize

524
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:55,266
that little-bitty wrinkle
has turned into a big crack,

525
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,735
and I know they're just gonna
bust me wide open for that

526
00:22:57,769 --> 00:22:59,103
if I don't fix it.

527
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:02,106
That's 15 minutes, everybody!

528
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,209
Can we get a dust mask?

529
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:07,111
My model, she tells me
she's getting sick

530
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:09,492
and not to do
the finishing touches.

531
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:10,493
_

532
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:14,385
I went to spray glitter on her,
and that made her sick.

533
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,120
And I went to airbrush her,
and that made her sick.

534
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,806
And then she decides
that she can no longer be

535
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,758
in my makeup chair,
that she has to leave,

536
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:22,326
and I'm not gonna get
the full amount of time

537
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,463
to do this makeup,
and it really bums me out.

538
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,570
That's time, guys, that's time!

539
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:35,439
- I didn't see yours.
- She had to leave early.

540
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:36,807
- Why?
- She got super sick.

541
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:39,276
I could have a top look,

542
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:42,913
and now I might not even have
a makeup at all.

543
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,526
Welcome
to the<i>Face Off</i>reveal stage.

544
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,763
Tonight one of you
will be eliminated.

545
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:01,198
Let's say hello
to our talented panel of judges.

546
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,035
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio Glenn Hetrick...

547
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,036
Hi, guys.

548
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,370
- Hi, Glenn.
- Hi, Glenn.

549
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:09,123
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill...

550
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,975
- Good evening.
- Hi, Ve.

551
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,610
Creature and concept designer
Neville Page.

552
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:14,311
Hello, everyone.

553
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,463
- Hi, Neville.
- Hi, Neville.

554
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,181
So, guys, this week,
your spotlight challenge

555
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:20,251
was to create a beautiful
Mother Nature goddess

556
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:21,952
inspired by the beautiful plants
and flowers

557
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,922
at the Los Angeles County
Arboretum.

558
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:27,124
I also asked you
to incorporate an element

559
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:28,625
that represented
your own mother

560
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,494
to give your goddess
a personal touch.

561
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,129
Let's take a look
at your creations

562
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:35,032
while the audience at home
tweets about their favorites,

563
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:36,867
using #FaceOff.

564
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:41,388
First up is Laney's goddess.

565
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,225
I'm worried my model's
not gonna walk onstage,

566
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:46,944
and I'm freaked out
a little bit.

567
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:50,781
And finally, she walks out,
thank goodness.

568
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:10,501
Even though I didn't get to put
everything that I wanted on her,

569
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,770
she still looks beautiful.

570
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,706
I'm happy with it.
I don't think I'm going home.

571
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:33,224
My goddess looks

572
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:35,092
exactly the way
that I planned for her to look.

573
00:25:35,127 --> 00:25:38,762
I'm extremely pleased
with this makeup.

574
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:59,550
If I would've painted
the face gold

575
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:01,352
to complement the wardrobe,
that would have been better.

576
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:04,455
I really hope I don't go home
this week.

577
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:25,743
I'm so taken back
by her presence,

578
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:28,612
and I can see my mother
in this.

579
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:49,483
I'm pleased with how she looks.

580
00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:51,502
She stands out as being
a unique color,

581
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:55,339
and I'm hoping that that works
in my benefit.

582
00:27:16,962 --> 00:27:18,629
I'm not the kind of person
that's gonna regurgitate

583
00:27:18,663 --> 00:27:20,297
a makeup that I've already done,

584
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:24,101
and I wanted to do
something humorous.

585
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:43,087
I love this character.

586
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,288
I just feel like
she's so beautiful,

587
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:47,291
and it's like a breath
of fresh air.

588
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:11,482
I feel that this makeup
came together well,

589
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,684
and I think my mom's
really gonna like this makeup,

590
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:16,787
so I'm proud of it.

591
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:37,691
I think she's stunning,
and I'm feeling very proud.

592
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:01,899
I love the bright color
in the center

593
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:04,468
going out into darker colors.

594
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:06,203
Maybe it's too colorful.

595
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:09,840
Oh, well,
that's the risks you take.

596
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,893
It's not the strongest piece
out there,

597
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:31,862
and it's definitely
not the weakest.

598
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,198
So I'm feeling pretty good,
but I'm still nervous,

599
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:37,935
'cause I never know which way
the judges are gonna decide.

600
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:43,674
Judges, it's time to take
a closer look at these beauties.

601
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:53,751
This is kind of cool,
the honey dripping down.

602
00:29:53,785 --> 00:29:55,686
Actually, there's more
metallic on the left side

603
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,687
than there is the right.

604
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,338
I'm so nervous.

605
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,959
I'm worried the judges are gonna
think it's a bit incomplete.

606
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:05,863
This is pretty cool.

607
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,631
I love the color choices
of flowers.

608
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:08,682
Love the colors.

609
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:10,551
- I love--
- I like this.

610
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:11,602
They're totally
into the leaves,

611
00:30:11,636 --> 00:30:15,806
and the balance
is so important.

612
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:19,443
The only thing that says
femininity is the dress.

613
00:30:19,477 --> 00:30:22,780
This shape is
absolutely confounding to me.

614
00:30:22,814 --> 00:30:24,448
I'm watching the judges,

615
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:27,084
and I don't think
they're saying good things.

616
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:31,338
I have a feeling I might be
going home this week.

617
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:34,725
Who made
your favorite beauty tonight?

618
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:37,811
Tell us on Twitter
using #FaceOff.

619
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:41,570
Very confused by this.

620
00:30:41,604 --> 00:30:44,072
A cheap vacuum-form
topographical map.

621
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:45,240
Yeah.

622
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:47,643
I see Glenn
shake his hand frantically.

623
00:30:47,677 --> 00:30:51,847
I know that's not a good sign.

624
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:55,367
The choice of this barky shape
is just a mystery.

625
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:57,319
Yeah.

626
00:30:58,521 --> 00:31:01,356
- What is this?
- It's all bronzy.

627
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:02,691
I just don't know what to say.

628
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:05,527
It's a curiosity.

629
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:07,429
I see the judges
walk up to the makeup

630
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:08,764
and just keep on going.

631
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,401
I feel like
I really screwed up.

632
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:15,637
This is a really cool shape.

633
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:19,741
And her head thing
is groovy too.

634
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,178
This is
really intelligent design.

635
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:24,847
She even airbrushed
into the hair.

636
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,049
That's cool.

637
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:30,536
Can you give us a profile?

638
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:32,087
I don't even want to look
in their direction.

639
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:34,823
I don't want to even try
and guess what they're thinking.

640
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:37,559
This is all constructed,
which is pretty difficult.

641
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:39,495
Yeah.

642
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:48,637
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

643
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:49,972
so let's find out
what they thought.

644
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:52,241
Alana...

645
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:54,843
Miranda...

646
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:56,411
Laney...

647
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:58,413
Tate...

648
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:01,250
Frank...

649
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,584
Congratulations.

650
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,888
You are all safe and can head
back to the makeup room.

651
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:12,060
The rest of you are the best
and the worst this week.

652
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:14,279
The judges would like to speak
with each of you

653
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:15,964
to learn more about your work.

654
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,700
Roy, please step forward.

655
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:27,543
Roy, tell us about your design
this week

656
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,645
and also how you incorporated
your mother.

657
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,313
My mother's one of those people

658
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:33,282
that can take any kind of plant
and make it grow.

659
00:32:33,316 --> 00:32:35,917
She is also, like, the root
and foundation of our family,

660
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:38,136
so I used the roots
to represent my mother.

661
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:41,456
This is a beautiful treatment
of the goddess concept.

662
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:42,724
Thank you.

663
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,960
I think that you made
a lot of really smart decisions

664
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:46,712
within the design.

665
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:49,331
I love the choice of colors.

666
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:50,632
I think
she's absolutely stunning.

667
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:54,436
I love the way the pink
is peeking through on her face,

668
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,071
which ties
all of these other pinks,

669
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:58,307
this beautiful pale lavender
you have on the chiffon--

670
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:00,108
Beautiful makeup job this week.

671
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,811
It is one of my favorites
as well.

672
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:05,314
It's elegant and balanced.

673
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:06,582
Thank you very much.

674
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:08,984
Please step back.

675
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,788
Eddie, you're next.

676
00:33:18,945 --> 00:33:21,897
Tell me about the concept
of your Mother Earth.

677
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:25,517
I wanted the overall look
to resemble a warrior goddess.

678
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,552
It's a metaphor about my mom

679
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:29,204
being the most important thing
in the world to me.

680
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:31,657
This was a really great time
for you guys

681
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,610
to show us what you could do
with beauty makeup.

682
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:37,145
Unfortunately,
you did not show me that.

683
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,815
You left her
completely natural,

684
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,484
so it falls a little short
for me tonight.

685
00:33:42,518 --> 00:33:45,220
So much stuff, and you
just didn't get it all done.

686
00:33:45,254 --> 00:33:46,571
The sculpture's very rough,

687
00:33:46,623 --> 00:33:49,057
and these are
not difficult textures.

688
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:51,760
I think you were trying
to do too much.

689
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:53,795
Eddie, please step back.

690
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,735
Lyma.

691
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,174
So tell us about your concept

692
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,110
and also what aspects
of your mother you used.

693
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:11,129
When I think about my mom,
I think about permanence.

694
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,949
And when it comes to family,
she's a tree of life.

695
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:16,201
My first impression
in silhouette

696
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,687
was very, very good.

697
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:21,356
It was bold,
with that huge hair

698
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,992
and the tree bark
around her hips.

699
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:27,396
I do love the overall nature
of this piece very much.

700
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,364
- Thank you.
- This is cool.

701
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,934
Unlike anyone else,
you've managed to create

702
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,504
this heavenly approach
to the hair,

703
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:38,907
and the vines reach
so far to the sky.

704
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,676
And this use of a rabbit

705
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,511
as a symbol of fertility
is genius.

706
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:44,513
Thank you so much.

707
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:47,649
Lyma, please step back.

708
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:52,554
RJ.

709
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:58,627
RJ, tell us about your design

710
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:00,962
and how you incorporated
your mother.

711
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:04,900
As you know, the last time
I was on this show,

712
00:35:04,934 --> 00:35:07,402
I did a Mother Earth character.

713
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:09,404
I did not want to do

714
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:11,773
a regurgitation
of those themes,

715
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:13,775
so instead of going a goddess,

716
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,577
I thought that it would be cute
to incorporate

717
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:18,814
a 1960s spritely character.

718
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:21,516
To essentially dismiss
core elements of the challenge

719
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:24,052
because you've done
something similar in the past,

720
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:25,253
it is only with contempt

721
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:29,124
that I regard
that particular decision.

722
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:31,793
It ends up being
an almost unnerving display

723
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:35,397
of design deficiency.

724
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,532
I thought, "My God, 1965.

725
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:38,700
I'm not sure
where we are with this."

726
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:40,368
I just wanted to do
something different

727
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,470
than what everybody else
was doing.

728
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:43,605
Okay, have you ever done
a beauty makeup?

729
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,773
Yeah.

730
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:45,774
Could you have done
a beauty makeup

731
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:46,842
on this gorgeous woman?

732
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:48,393
Yeah.

733
00:35:48,444 --> 00:35:51,279
This is a total failure
this week, honey.

734
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:57,085
RJ, please step back.

735
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:03,642
Laura, you're up.

736
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:08,897
Tell us about your concept
for your goddess.

737
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:11,066
Well, we went
to the rose garden.

738
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,301
I found a particular rose
that I decided to incorporate,

739
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:15,337
as far as the color
was concerned.

740
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:16,705
My mother loves music,

741
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:20,225
so I put the trumpet flowers
to represent that.

742
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:23,411
She's also into buddhism,
so I thought, "caterpillar,"

743
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:26,364
and I merged the flower
with the caterpillar idea,

744
00:36:26,415 --> 00:36:27,532
which explains the chest piece.

745
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,167
Well, I gotta tell you,

746
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:33,221
this is
astonishingly gorgeous makeup.

747
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:35,190
The paint job is probably
one of the most amazing

748
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:37,442
- we've had on this show.
- Thank you.

749
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:38,944
She's freaking gorgeous.

750
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:41,896
This is such a sublime palette.

751
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:44,132
I want to use it
because it is so beautiful,

752
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,867
and I can't get over it.

753
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:47,135
Thank you.

754
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,404
Laura, please step back.

755
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,877
Scott, please step up.

756
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,683
So tell us about your concept.

757
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:03,652
Well, I saw a lot of wood,

758
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:05,554
and the first thing
that jumped into my mind

759
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:07,189
was my mother,
who grew up on a farm,

760
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:08,723
and harvest.

761
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:12,394
I can't get
beyond the chest plate,

762
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:15,197
'cause it feels as if skin
has been flayed back,

763
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:16,664
revealing something underneath.

764
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:20,468
It borders on
horror makeup or design,

765
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:21,670
versus beauty.

766
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:23,038
Okay.

767
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,272
It's not very feminine,

768
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,541
some of the shapes
that you've created.

769
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:27,826
If you're asked
to do a goddess,

770
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:29,611
then you have to really think
about beautiful details,

771
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:33,949
and I think there's
just too much orange in it.

772
00:37:33,983 --> 00:37:36,751
Scott, thank you very much.
Please step back.

773
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:42,440
All right, guys, the judges
have heard what you have to say.

774
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:43,925
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

775
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,227
while they deliberate.

776
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:47,295
Thank you.

777
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,017
All right, why don't we talk
about the looks

778
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:53,168
you liked the most?

779
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:55,537
- Let's start with Roy.
- So well done.

780
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:57,272
It's not a likely palette.

781
00:37:57,306 --> 00:37:59,307
Who's gonna choose
a gray tree to do?

782
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:00,642
Yeah.

783
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:03,361
But it was so clever to use
that really pale color

784
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:04,679
'cause it's so feminine.

785
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:06,565
He used his model's eyes,

786
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,651
and they were the perfect color
with the makeup.

787
00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:11,286
All right,
let's move on to Lyma.

788
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,155
She made
some really interesting choices.

789
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,458
I mean, to put
that white hair in there

790
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:19,077
and the tree branches
and the fertility bunny.

791
00:38:19,128 --> 00:38:21,296
That idea of creating
a window into her belly

792
00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:22,697
and the womb of Earth--

793
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:25,500
I'd like to see that idea
expanded upon, personally.

794
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:27,035
All right,
let's move on to Laura.

795
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,236
Stunning.

796
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:30,839
I so want an image of that.

797
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,908
The paint job
is absolutely unbelievable.

798
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:35,110
Sick, yeah.

799
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:37,329
If this was a group challenge,

800
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,814
I would have been thrilled
with the level of detail,

801
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:42,317
- and she did it by herself.
- Yeah.

802
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:43,935
All right,
let's talk about the looks

803
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,020
you liked the least.

804
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:46,421
Why don't we start with Eddie?

805
00:38:46,455 --> 00:38:48,623
Really, really unhappy
with this makeup.

806
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:50,425
Yeah, for me,
it wasn't a makeup at all.

807
00:38:50,459 --> 00:38:52,227
It was just like
a big rubber suit

808
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:55,931
and completely lacking
feminine qualities.

809
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:57,582
All right, let's move on to RJ.

810
00:38:57,633 --> 00:39:00,802
I don't know what the heck
he was thinking of tonight.

811
00:39:00,836 --> 00:39:02,370
Just because you've done
something once

812
00:39:02,405 --> 00:39:04,472
doesn't mean
that you can't find variation.

813
00:39:04,506 --> 00:39:06,608
I would hope that
he would have done something

814
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:07,842
like this once
and then learned from it.

815
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:09,844
He didn't even attempt
to do a beauty makeup.

816
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:11,379
Everything was a bad decision.

817
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:13,114
All right,
let's move on to Scott.

818
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,266
I think Scott doesn't have

819
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:17,485
a lot of experience
doing beauty,

820
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,554
plus the bad decision
with the breastplate--

821
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:20,689
- I couldn't get past that.

822
00:39:20,723 --> 00:39:23,158
Yeah, I think
this is just not his genre.

823
00:39:23,192 --> 00:39:25,360
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

824
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:26,494
- Yeah, I think we have.
- Yeah.

825
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,547
All right,
let's bring them back out.

826
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:37,088
Glenn, tell us
about the top looks.

827
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:39,874
Roy, we loved the tonality

828
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,042
of your character's
color palette,

829
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:43,712
and she had
a magnificent overall balance.

830
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:48,283
Laura, we were very impressed
with your design decisions

831
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:51,653
and the way that you managed
to seamlessly blend colors.

832
00:39:51,687 --> 00:39:53,488
Lyma,

833
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:56,725
you made some very,
very bold choices this week,

834
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:59,227
and that really paid off
in an eye-catching makeup.

835
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,396
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

836
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,132
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

837
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:10,695
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

838
00:40:10,729 --> 00:40:12,880
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

839
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:18,269
Laura.

840
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:19,670
Thank you.

841
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,573
You made some cool

842
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:24,208
and interesting
sculptural decisions,

843
00:40:24,243 --> 00:40:25,376
and they were complemented

844
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:27,995
by a beautiful
and intricate paint job.

845
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:30,314
This was a true accomplishment.

846
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:32,250
Thank you.

847
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:33,484
This feels really good,

848
00:40:33,502 --> 00:40:35,319
and I'm happy
that I could show the world

849
00:40:35,354 --> 00:40:36,921
how much I love my mom.

850
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:38,189
Laura, congratulations.

851
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:41,626
You, Lyma, and Roy
can head backstage.

852
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,896
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

853
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:51,185
Unfortunately,
that means the rest of you

854
00:40:51,236 --> 00:40:52,403
are on the bottom this week,

855
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:55,606
and one of you
will be eliminated.

856
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:59,444
Please step forward.

857
00:41:03,882 --> 00:41:05,917
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

858
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:09,520
Scott, despite
some good technical painting,

859
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:10,888
your makeup fell down

860
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:13,558
in its design
and color decisions.

861
00:41:13,592 --> 00:41:16,527
RJ, we had issues
with your character

862
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:20,031
in terms of both execution
and concept.

863
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:22,400
It boiled down to poor choices.

864
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:26,838
Eddie, you had some really
interesting ideas this week,

865
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:30,408
but you took on too much,
and ultimately,

866
00:41:30,442 --> 00:41:31,943
it just didn't come fruition.

867
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:33,811
So who's going home tonight?

868
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:35,880
The person going home
tonight is...

869
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,551
RJ.

870
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:44,755
We didn't understand
your decision

871
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,692
to diverge so far
from this week's challenge,

872
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:49,760
and what little makeup
you did do

873
00:41:49,795 --> 00:41:52,079
wasn't well applied.

874
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:56,033
RJ, I'm sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

875
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:59,303
And Scott, Eddie,
you are safe this week

876
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:03,841
and can head
back to the makeup room.

877
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,446
RJ, you know that we love you,

878
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,681
and I can't wait to see
more of your fantastic creations

879
00:42:10,716 --> 00:42:13,551
in the future,
and I know that we will.

880
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:16,220
Thanks, I appreciate it.

881
00:42:16,255 --> 00:42:18,089
RJ, it's been so great
having you here with us.

882
00:42:18,123 --> 00:42:19,891
If you'd please
head back to the makeup room

883
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:21,592
and pack up your kit.

884
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:22,693
I gotta do this.

885
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:24,862
- Real pleasure to meet you, Neville.
- Thank you.

886
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,832
I am disappointed in myself,

887
00:42:27,866 --> 00:42:30,134
and I know
that I'm capable of better.

888
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:32,603
I'm sorry I disappointed
my family and my friends

889
00:42:32,638 --> 00:42:35,740
and my fans, especially.

890
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:37,825
Me.

891
00:42:37,876 --> 00:42:39,076
- No!
- No!

892
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,494
This competition has become

893
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:42,179
mentally
and artistically harder,

894
00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:45,116
but it's an honor
just to be asked to come back.

895
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,051
It's very touching.

896
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:49,453
Makeup is part of who I am,

897
00:42:49,488 --> 00:42:52,840
so I'm gonna just work harder
to be successful.

898
00:42:52,891 --> 00:42:54,926
I've been doing this
since I was 12 years old,

899
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,345
and I won't give this up.
