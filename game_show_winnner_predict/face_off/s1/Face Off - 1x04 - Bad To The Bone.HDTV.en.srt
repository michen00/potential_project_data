1
00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:03,870
McKenzie: Previously on "Face Off"...

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,950
12 talented special effects makeup artists

3
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:10,101
came to Los Angeles to compete
to join the world's elite.

4
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:12,903
I wanted to get you an ice
cream cake or something.

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,140
I think she's just trying to
win him over with her "charm."

6
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,176
You will work in teams of two
and create an alien species.

7
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,544
Holy crap, we're gonna do aliens.

8
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,485
This is a perfect example
of piss-poor collaboration.

9
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:29,954
You did a beautiful job. Congratulations.

10
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:32,490
And the winner is... Conor.

11
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:35,359
The person going home tonight is...

12
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:37,395
- Frank.
- I'm out, bitches, I'm out!

13
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:40,097
Now, only nine remain.

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,866
And tonight on "Face Off"...

15
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,067
I see the psycho house up on the hill,

16
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:44,769
mother bates up in the window.

17
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,240
Your challenge this week

18
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,639
is to create your very own movie villain.

19
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,875
It's a great overall design. Well done.

20
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,476
It's genius.

21
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:55,813
This design is a vessel of your ineptitude.

22
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,982
To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress

23
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:00,184
our award-winning panel of judges...

24
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,486
Ve Neill, legendary makeup artist

25
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,722
who's work includes "Edward Scissorhands",

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,958
"Beetlejuice", and the "Pirates
of the Caribbean" films;

27
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,495
Glenn Hetrick, cutting-edge makeup
effects artist on "Heroes",

28
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:14,064
"Legion", and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer";

29
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:16,734
and Patrick Tatopoulos,
visionary creature designer

30
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:18,803
for "Independence Day", "Godzilla",

31
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,672
and director of "Underworld:
Rise of the Lycans".

32
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,108
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic

33
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:26,210
and earn $100,000

34
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,879
and a year's worth of makeup from Alcone?

35
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,044
Get ready for "Face Off".

36
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,455
Kinda un-fun right now.

37
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,791
It's not very fun at all. It sucks.

38
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,560
Frank's elimination, in one fell swoop,

39
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,263
divided the whole group, like,
straight down the middle.

40
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:22,666
Either you're with Tommy and Jo,

41
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,902
or you're with Conor and Megan,

44
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,977
are, like, "Guys, are you for real?
How old are you?"

45
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:34,979
Frank went home and not Megan?

46
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:37,248
It's just insane that she's still here.

47
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:38,415
Yeah.

48
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:39,917
It's about to get really nasty.

49
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:41,886
With Conor and Megan, the way
that that's working out,

50
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,555
lot of people are starting to get upset

51
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,156
and really seeing it for what it is.

52
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:48,859
We saw with the body painting,
Conor does have weaknesses.

53
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,561
When he's out of his element, what happens?

54
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,596
He dropped all the way to the...

55
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:54,465
All the way to the bottom
and then freaked out.

56
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,534
He was a nervous wreck that entire time.

57
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:59,570
I just hope Megan becomes Conor's weakness.

58
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,539
We'll see how it plays out.

59
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,310
Could Megan be used as
a tool against Conor?

60
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,846
Quite possibly, because I think he's gonna

61
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:11,448
get sucked into the drama
and forget about the art.

62
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:18,656
We find out that we're going

63
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:23,227
to universal studios on the back lot.

64
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,829
And it's pretty strange because
we don't know what's cooked up,

65
00:03:25,897 --> 00:03:28,899
and then we see the Bate's motel sign.

66
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,701
We're all, like, pretty excited

67
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,704
because it's only one of the
most iconic film images ever.

68
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,140
As we walked around the corner,

69
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,242
I see the psycho house up on the hill,

70
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,045
mother bates up in the window,
rocking back and forth.

71
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:43,881
This is definitely my element.

72
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:46,650
Welcome to the famous bates motel and house

73
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:49,086
from the Alfred Hitchcock
classic, "Psycho."

74
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:50,269
The reason we're here is

75
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,222
because your spotlight challenge this week

76
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,026
is for each of you to create
your very own movie villain.

77
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,365
And Norman bates, as we all know,

78
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:03,500
is one of the original movie villains.

79
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,669
And since then, we've seen
the likes of Freddy Kruger,

80
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:09,139
pinhead, Jason Voorhees, and many others.

81
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,609
With me today is our guest judge

82
00:04:11,676 --> 00:04:13,577
who, over the past 30 years,

83
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:15,679
has produced more than 25 films,

84
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:19,116
including "Friday the
13th", "Deep Star Six",

85
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:21,151
"Freddy vs. Jason", "The New Kids",

86
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,853
and "The Last House on the Left".

87
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:26,090
He's the man who brought Jason
to life on the big screen.

88
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:29,193
Producer and director, Sean Cunningham.

89
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,463
Oh, my God. It's Sean Cunningham,

90
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,000
who did all these awesome
movies I grew up with.

91
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,187
So, Sean, why do you think

92
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:38,869
Jason resonated so much with audiences?

93
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:42,106
Jason is, I think, the
quintessential boogieman.

94
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:44,842
There's something profoundly scary

95
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,078
about a death threat that
can't be negotiated with.

96
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:49,847
Also, I think, the hockey
mask doesn't hurt at all.

97
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,517
So, then, in your opinion,
what does it take

98
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,952
to make a great movie villain?

99
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,554
I think a great movie villain
has got to be rooted in...

100
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,624
in some kind of unspoken fear,

101
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,259
the kind of thing that, as a kid,

102
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:04,428
you felt there might be
something beneath the bed,

103
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,864
something that could
attack you at any moment.

104
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,433
It has to have a strong presence,

105
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,236
and it doesn't hurt to have
an unforgettable weapon.

106
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:15,539
Normal serial killer
villains aren't something

107
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,675
that's right up my alley, so
it's gonna take me some time

108
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:19,209
to figure out what I'm doing.

109
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,911
I don't know, maybe I can use Megan.

110
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,048
That would be my villain at this point.

111
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,617
These days, it takes an
original marketing campaign

112
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:29,820
and a great movie poster to get
your audiences into the theater.

113
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,231
So your job is not only to

114
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,557
create the villain and
his or her back story,

115
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,126
but you will also be working
with a production designer

116
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:40,464
to create a movie poster,
complete with title and tagline.

117
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:42,466
Oh, that is cool.

118
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:45,402
On elimination day, you will
reveal your villain on stage,

119
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,867
in front of your custom movie poster image,

120
00:05:47,868 --> 00:05:49,373
just to help set the scene.

121
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,242
The judges will be looking
not only at your technique,

122
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,346
but also your overall concept,
and movie poster design.

123
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:58,716
All right, when you get back,
you can pick your models

124
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:00,250
in the order that was selected randomly.

125
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,420
Get out of here and start working.
Good luck.

126
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:11,195
We get back to the lab,

127
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,731
and there's a certain
level of tension there

128
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:16,533
because Sean Cunningham
is the judge of this,

129
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:18,068
he's the guy who created Jason.

130
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:21,872
So today, we only have 4 hours,

131
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,607
and what we want to do is

132
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:26,410
just sketch our ideas and start sculpting.

133
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:28,545
This challenge will force
everyone in the room

134
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:30,147
to put their money where their mouth is.

135
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,982
There's no hiding from this competition.

136
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,184
You have to sculpt, you have to
mold, you have to be creative.

137
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,152
People's weaknesses are

138
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,954
gonna really be highlighted
on this challenge.

139
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,730
Gage and Marcel hanging out together

140
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,632
is kind of a cool thing because I think

141
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,501
their creative energy feeds off each other.

142
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,202
I hope it doesn't bite 'em in the butt

143
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,371
and make their pieces look too similar,

144
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,073
like their coming from the same project.

145
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,742
We did the same thing. No, we're not.

146
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,979
They're brothers. And they kill people.

147
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,884
We're the only ones that talk anymore.

148
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:09,953
I know, I think it's because
everyone's just deep in thought,

149
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,389
and really trying to bust out
their ideas, and get them going.

150
00:07:14,793 --> 00:07:18,428
I feel so pressured by this challenge

151
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,264
because I can't sit back and be, like,

152
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,966
"I'm gonna run another
foam latex appliance,"

153
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,335
or, "Oh, I'm gonna sculpt
something really easy."

154
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,538
I've gotta go big or go home.

155
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,709
I'm feeling a little uneasy
going into this challenge

156
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:35,312
because I just didn't have something there,

157
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,580
and all I could start
thinking about are these

158
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:39,149
Halloween characters I created years ago,

159
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:42,486
and after the whole situation with Frank,

160
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:43,587
I want to choose for safe.

161
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:45,622
Do you mind if I, uh...

162
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,058
No, Conor, I'm using all of 'em. Yeah.

163
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,596
Shut up, Meg.

164
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:55,999
Oh, that's very pretty on you.

165
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,502
- It goes with my eyes.
- Yeah.

166
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:04,641
Megan's laugh is terrifying,
and it makes me violent.

167
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,344
Every time I hear her laugh, I
want to punch someone in the face.

168
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:16,420
As a girl, I was terrified
of porcelain dolls,

169
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:19,156
so I'm making a broken doll face

170
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:21,191
because it was that specific
face that scared me.

171
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,762
This character, she's a nun,

172
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,065
and she comes out of surgery deformed,

173
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,567
and she takes everyone's confessions,

174
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,669
and goes out into the world

175
00:08:32,737 --> 00:08:34,238
and kills them by the way
that they're sinning.

176
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:39,743
I am creating a deformed burn person,

177
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,979
but I don't want it to look super realistic

178
00:08:42,046 --> 00:08:44,214
and disturbing, I want it to be fun, too.

179
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,090
My goal today is to get
all of my sculpting done

180
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,193
so the following day, I
can mold it and cast it.

181
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:57,861
To bring my character to life,

182
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:00,264
I'm sculpting a gigantic head appliance.

183
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,332
He has these makeshift arm crutches

184
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,668
that support the weight of the head.

185
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:11,141
No, no, he's a genetic anomaly,

186
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,144
and he has a completely
weak and incapable body,

187
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:16,079
but he controls people with his mind,

188
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,115
so he can make people murder themselves.

189
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,584
Tate's character is all mental power,

190
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:23,153
and he sculpts this huge
head, and he tells me

191
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:24,297
he's gonna run it in silicone,

192
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:25,589
and I was a little concerned for him

193
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:28,392
because silicone prosthetics
can be very heavy.

194
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,066
I'm sculpting the facial
prosthetics for my character.

195
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:40,003
He refused to grow up, and
he has this Teddy bear

196
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:42,372
that's probably been tied to
his face most of his life,

197
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,442
so I am going to use a silicone skin

198
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,046
for his flesh area, and
then the Teddy bear,

199
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:51,048
the mask part will be fabricated

200
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:54,217
between fur and maybe some soft polyfoam.

201
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,394
I haven't even looked at it 'cause

202
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:05,829
you're sculpting on the other
side, and I can't see it.

203
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,431
You should come look.
Come look at it, Tom. Yeah.

204
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:09,766
I'm sculpting a very intricate piece.

205
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:14,104
I'm running it out of silicone,
something I've never done,

206
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,183
and I'm having to pull

207
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:17,207
this thing together and
make her look scary.

208
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,809
Ooh, I love those teeth.

209
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,111
And the cleft lip's cool.

210
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,246
It's 'cause she went through a windshield.

211
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:25,349
Jo's nun looked like she took Julie Andrews

212
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,372
and put a lighter to her face,

213
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:29,720
and just put some corn in the mouth.

214
00:10:29,787 --> 00:10:31,655
- What are you gonna make it out of, silicone?
- Silicone.

215
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,892
As soon as I hear her say
she's gonna use silicone...

216
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,930
Okay. I mean, it's your project.

217
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,598
Let's see what you can do.

218
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,567
Everyone all of a sudden

219
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:45,469
is jumping on the silicone bandwagon

220
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:48,805
because the judges liked
my silicone prosthetics.

221
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:51,208
But silicone is not always the way to go,

222
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,176
especially if you're not
experienced with it.

223
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:54,606
It can be really difficult

224
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,913
to blend and glue down,
and sometimes paint.

225
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:59,282
I think Jo's in trouble.

226
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,219
I am extremely worried that this
is not gonna turn out well.

227
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,787
With this challenge, we
are gonna have to make

228
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:17,523
original movie posters, so you
have to design a tag line,

229
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:18,958
you have to design a title,

230
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,960
you have to design the
aesthetics of the poster,

231
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,928
what happens within it,
and then your makeup

232
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,463
is the forefront of the challenge.

233
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:25,998
Oh, I'm gonna make it...

234
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,434
We'll be meeting with the
production designer today

235
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:31,037
to help us with our movie poster.

236
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,805
- How are you doing?
- Tate.

237
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,507
I'm Majken, the production designer.

238
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,142
- Nice to meet you....
- Nice to meet you.

239
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,677
My concept with this character,

240
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:41,781
he's definitely been locked away
from people for a long time.

241
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,816
I'm calling him "him", h-i-m,

242
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:46,118
which will be the name of the film as well.

243
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:50,656
My tag line is "Your mind, dot, dot, dot

244
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:52,691
his playground."

245
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:56,562
My whole piece takes place
in the late 70s, early 80s.

246
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,164
- Okay.
- And it's a slasher film.

247
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:00,266
And it takes place in a
roller-skating rink.

248
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,902
My movie is supposed to
be funny and kitschy.

249
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:05,638
That's part of the vibe.
I just hope the judges get it.

250
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,772
The move is called...

251
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,140
- "Final Skate."
- "Final Skate."

252
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,675
"The class of '78 is going to pieces."

253
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,615
I want to have my model placed
here on the right hand side.

254
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:19,185
And I was thinking of
having a lighthouse here.

255
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:21,153
The title's gonna be "Cautionary Point."

256
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,888
My tag line is "Heed the warning."

257
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,926
My villain is a lighthouse operator,

258
00:12:26,993 --> 00:12:29,528
so I want my killer to be half-burned,

259
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:32,398
and then the other half,
a water-logged corpse.

260
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,766
We only have four hours today,

261
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:35,434
so I'm sculpting everything out in Clay,

262
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:38,037
so I can start molding the skull
in the amount of time allotted.

263
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,177
The name of the movie is "London Twilight,"

264
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:49,248
and the idea is that it's a
roving gang of psychopaths,

265
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:51,650
and the villain is a psychotic
surgeon who's deformed.

266
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,586
- Tag line?
- I'm working on it.

267
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:54,661
I'm gonna keep it clean,

268
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:56,722
I'm gonna keep it simple.
I'm not gonna go crazy.

269
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,492
Because I'm rehashing this
character I made in '97.

270
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,528
I'm thinking "The Doctor is Out",

271
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:05,764
and then dot, dot, dot, "of his mind.

272
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:08,300
- You wanna do that?
- That's the first one right now,

273
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,503
and I know it might come
off a little cheesy,

274
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,938
so I gotta really play with that idea.

275
00:13:13,006 --> 00:13:15,474
I would like a backdrop of a church.

276
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,310
Maybe, like, blood dripping
from either the top

277
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:19,745
or, like, from the door.

278
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,181
- Name?
- "Confession."

279
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:25,451
- Tag line?
- "Confession won't always save you."

280
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,453
I'm going outside of the box with my idea,

281
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:29,455
and I'm excited about running the silicone,

282
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,457
but on the other hand, you know, it's scary

283
00:13:31,525 --> 00:13:32,925
because I don't really know how to do it,

284
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:34,660
so I'm gonna have to learn
that, too, you know,

285
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:37,096
in 13 hours of getting this
entire thing together,

286
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,532
if there could be a portrait here

287
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:43,502
of a blondish family, because
this girl has black hair.

288
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,039
For the title of the movie, I've
decided to go with "Baby Doll",

289
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:48,140
and the tag line is

290
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:50,643
"Daddy's little secret
has come back to play."

291
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,281
Sam's one of those people that
could easily be a dark horse.

292
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:58,150
She hasn't shown a lot of weakness.
She's got skills.

293
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:00,386
She's a really good illustrator,
she's really good at sculpting.

294
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,688
Sam's coasting through the
middle under the radar,

295
00:14:02,756 --> 00:14:05,124
and I think that's a good place to be.

296
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,393
My idea is a demon of vengeance,

297
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,428
and through voodoo, he's summoned,

298
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:11,897
so the title for the
concept is "Voodoo Dawn."

299
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:13,866
It's supposed to take place in the bayou.

300
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:16,368
I'd like some kind of a swampy backdrop.

301
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:18,037
Okay, do you have a tag line for me?

302
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,072
"Death is just the beginning."

303
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,106
Okay.

304
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:28,514
I am trying to get more
reference down of wrinkles,

305
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:30,282
and so I start scrunching my face

306
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,085
and trying to see my brow furrow.

307
00:14:33,153 --> 00:14:36,355
And I'm, like, "Oh, who has
a really pissed off face?"

308
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,761
- Hey, Conor?
- Yeah.

309
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,129
Could you do this for me?

310
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,464
You want to see crow's feet?

311
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,235
All right, very good. Thanks.

312
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:53,138
I see all the happy little crow's feet,

313
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:55,074
and I'm, like, "Oh, perfect. Thank you."

314
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,710
Why did you come to me for that?

315
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,578
Uh, you were the closest.

316
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,814
And I have the most wrinkles.

317
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:08,220
I picture a kid's bedroom, but dark.

318
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:10,335
And I would love to use kid's play blocks,

319
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,457
you know, with letters.

320
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,759
I want it to say "Teddy told me to".

321
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,263
And then, my tag line is

322
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,896
"It's all fun and games
until someone dies."

323
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:21,967
I think Tom does kind of
Halloween quality work.

324
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:23,362
That's not the kind of

325
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,138
stuff I would expect to
see in a feature film.

326
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:29,475
My concept is an evil photographer,

327
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:32,845
and his victims are the people
that he takes photos of.

328
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:35,180
- Do you have a name?
- "Chester's Photography".

329
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:38,050
"A picture says a thousand
words, his victims say none."

330
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:39,385
Okay.

331
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:40,953
I don't know that I would

332
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,888
want to go see "Chester's Photography"

333
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:45,124
because when she explained the concept,

334
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:47,092
it sounded a little thrown together.

335
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:53,632
As I'm sculpting, I'm just not feeling it.

336
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:59,071
Anthony, it seems like he's just
really taking a safe route.

337
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,608
I think this is the time to take chances

338
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:05,110
and make something mind blowing.

339
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,313
I don't feel good about
creating this character anymore

340
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,215
because as an artist, I'm
not trying anything new.

341
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,317
What's your story? Can I ask?

342
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:12,718
You wanna know what it is?

343
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:14,687
It's a big, big, epic story

344
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:17,489
of none of your business.

345
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,391
What am I gonna do now?

346
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:22,895
I'm in trouble.

347
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,064
I don't have time to start all over again.

348
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:37,006
- Thank you, Marcel.
- Marcel: You're welcome.

349
00:16:37,074 --> 00:16:39,241
Oh, my God, what are we gonna do?
We only have eight hours.

350
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:41,477
It's the second day of
our spotlight challenge,

351
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,813
and there's still a lot to do.

352
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,015
Just being able to bring it in
the amount of time allotted

353
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,050
gets really hard because
we're on such a schedule.

354
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:55,658
And then Glenn walks in with McKenzie.

355
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:57,727
Hello, Megan.

356
00:16:57,794 --> 00:16:58,894
Oh, hey.

357
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:00,463
- Scared you, huh?
- Yes. Hi.

358
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,531
Well, that's appropriate for the category.

359
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,900
Good God. I'm gonna have a heart attack.

360
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:06,535
What are your plans for this?

361
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:08,504
This is gonna be a foam piece,

362
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,906
and then the teeth are gonna
be made out of acrylic.

363
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,275
When he articulates,
what's going to happen?

364
00:17:13,343 --> 00:17:14,910
Are the teeth going to move with the foam?

365
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:17,780
I wasn't planning on him articulating.

366
00:17:17,848 --> 00:17:21,083
I don't think Megan's works
because it doesn't move.

367
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,985
I get her guy's about photos,

368
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:26,088
but it's more a mask than a prosthetic.

369
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,656
Are we gonna see under the mask...

370
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,091
- No.
- ...During the reveal?

371
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,660
This mask is fused to his face.
It doesn't come off.

372
00:17:31,728 --> 00:17:33,829
He's also gonna have a giant yo-yo.

373
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,598
He's beaten people with it

374
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,266
- or strangled them, or whatever.
- Okay.

375
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:39,602
Every horror villain needs his machete,

376
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:42,127
so I picked a yo-yo
because it's a kids' toy,

377
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,439
and it's kind of creepy.

378
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:46,876
I really love early 70s,
early 80s slasher flicks.

379
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:48,611
I remember watching those,
and it just scared me,

380
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:51,180
the idea of a deformed
person chopping up people.

381
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:52,515
Foam or silicone?

382
00:17:52,582 --> 00:17:54,150
- I'm gonna do silicone.
- Cool.

383
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,918
It's gonna be a one-piece face appliance.

384
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,820
I'm gonna try and do silicone on it.

385
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:01,157
I'm planning on doing a silicone mold.

386
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:02,658
I'm doing everything in silicone.

387
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,193
- You're gonna run in silicone?
- Seems to be working for me.

388
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,795
It's got three-piece silicone.

389
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,897
So I'm gonna go more flesh,
so I'm doing it in silicone.

390
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:09,498
I really want more articulation.

391
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:10,733
All right, well, we'll leave you to it.

392
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:12,368
- Thank you.
- See you guys.

393
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,574
What do you think of some of the work?

394
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:21,243
A little worried about
some of the color choices.

395
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,814
- Really?
- On the whole, yeah. Marcel, Anthony.

396
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:27,516
When you're working with
realistic-looking skin,

397
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,151
it's more difficult.

398
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,453
In the end, it'll sell better

399
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,556
as a realistic makeup
if you can pull it off,

400
00:18:33,623 --> 00:18:35,558
but there's less latitude there.

401
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,055
And it's more monstery, if you will,

402
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:38,327
when you go with heavier colors.

403
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:41,564
How do you feel about everybody
seems to be doing silicone?

404
00:18:41,631 --> 00:18:44,200
Well, I think that they're
learning as they go

405
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:47,303
that it reads better.
It's not always the right choice.

406
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,072
This is gonna be a true test
of their painting skills.

407
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,874
- That's gonna be interesting.
- It is.

408
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:53,776
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

409
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:54,777
See you tomorrow. Good luck.

410
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,583
Messing up the Teddy hair?

411
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,685
Yeah, I'm gonna trim it all down,

412
00:19:02,752 --> 00:19:05,387
- and make it look like it's been used.
- Awesome, man.

413
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,489
Is there a text book way
to make a Teddy bear?

414
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:09,592
Maybe. Do I know that? No.

415
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:12,228
To me, it's not how you
get to grandma's house.

416
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:14,163
It's just the fact that you get there.

417
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:17,299
Today we need to get everything into molds,

418
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:19,168
and start casting the prosthetics.

419
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,872
To make a mold, you have to cover
your sculpt in wet cement.

420
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:25,875
When your mold has set, you're
gonna take your silicone

421
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:28,611
and pour that into your mold.

422
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:30,713
Oh, God. Please be good please be good.

423
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,116
Running the silicone is
pretty nerve-wracking.

424
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:37,286
I don't know if it's gonna
set completely or not,

425
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,622
so I'm nervous to see what
it's gonna come out like.

426
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:41,924
Did you vaseline your stone?

427
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:43,926
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, this scares me.

428
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:46,562
Me and Gage forget to release our molds.

429
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:50,532
Releasing the mold is where
you put in something

430
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,768
that puts up a barrier between the plaster

431
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:54,937
and whatever you're putting in there

432
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:59,308
so it doesn't stick to the
plaster or seal itself shut.

433
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:00,843
Adding mold release is easy enough.

434
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:02,544
Let's see, what have we got here?

435
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,847
You can use cooking spray,
anything oil-based.

436
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:07,516
Soap, shaving cream, baby powder works.

437
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,686
It allows you to easily
peel your appliance away.

438
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,488
If not, it forms a bond.

439
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:14,857
That can be bad because
silicone is really tough.

440
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:16,592
You guys just pop these things open?

441
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,927
Or did he have to use that thing?

442
00:20:17,994 --> 00:20:19,461
I literally had to put then
on my feet and pull it.

443
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,530
If it flies, it's gonna
break my fingers off.

444
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:23,032
One, two...

445
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,937
Beautiful piece.

446
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:29,371
God, you scared me.

447
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:33,042
It came out great, and it's beautiful.

448
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:36,412
That's something that my mother
would be proud of me in the end.

449
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,780
I'm proud of it, definitely.

450
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,115
Ooh, it's exactly how I wanted it, too.

451
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:41,368
♪ I'm excited ♪

452
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:42,584
Anthony: That's a good release there, Jo.

453
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:45,621
That came right out.

454
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,523
Yeah.

455
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,758
Son of a bitch.

456
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:51,660
Hey, Conor, could you
come here for a second?

457
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:55,230
- I forgot to release it.
- Oh.

458
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:56,799
What?

459
00:20:59,502 --> 00:21:02,071
- It's coming.
- Okay.

460
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:05,841
Okay, got mine out. Thank you, buddy.

461
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:07,743
We got it out, I was, like, "Whew."

462
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,678
- Conor.
- Conor: Yo.

463
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,413
Can you help me with mine?

464
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:13,549
Oh, for ***.

465
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:16,885
Okay, if mine is this hard to
open, Gage's gonna be bad, too.

466
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:18,587
Yeah, just hold it right there.

467
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,424
No.

468
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:25,060
Hold it steady.

469
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,695
Everyone's coming over
and trying to help me.

470
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:29,031
Oh, dude, that's not...

471
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:30,699
Gage's will not open for anything.

472
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,067
It's, like, sealed shut.

473
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,270
You're gonna have to chip it out. Sorry.

474
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:36,803
I'm looking at my mold,

475
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:39,608
and I'm totally worried
about my prosthetic.

476
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:42,044
I'm screwed.
I basically have lost everything.

477
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,847
Coming up...

478
00:21:44,914 --> 00:21:46,248
The eyes don't fit.

479
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:47,783
This is gonna be a heck of a horror film.

480
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:49,451
I really like this makeup.

481
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,554
This design is a vessel of your ineptitude.

482
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:55,591
Tonight, one of you will be eliminated.

483
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,379
AAA

484
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:02,192
no.

485
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,061
I am looking at my mold,
and I am freaking out.

486
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,063
You're gonna have to chip it out.

487
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:08,765
Now I'm really worried for him.

488
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,166
If you guys need any help,

489
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:11,234
I don't want to shove my hands in there.

490
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:12,969
No, no, you're good.

491
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:16,740
Gage forgot to release his mold.
It's stuck in there.

492
00:22:16,807 --> 00:22:18,908
You're either gonna ruin your
mold or your prosthetic,

493
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,411
and you probably won't get a
chance to get a second go at it.

494
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:24,948
The face lifecast, we have copies of those.

495
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:28,118
The sculpt, on the other
hand, was a one-time deal.

496
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:32,155
So he needs to be able to preserve
the sculpt part at all costs,

497
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:35,025
especially because there's
already silicone inside of it.

498
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,961
It just comes down to having
to break the lifecast.

499
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,899
It's going to cost him a lot of
time, chipping this lifecast out.

500
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:44,434
Let me see? How is it?

501
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,036
- Here.
- Oh, here we go.

502
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:47,837
It tore. Meg, you're tearing it.

503
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:51,207
Really?

504
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:54,010
She starts ripping it off,
and then she leaves.

505
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:55,178
Yeah. Just... yeah.

506
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:00,884
Awesome. Thank you.

507
00:23:00,951 --> 00:23:04,020
That's just another kink
in the whole process.

508
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:05,655
Already being under a time crunch,

509
00:23:05,723 --> 00:23:07,490
already having to pull it out and
paint it and everything else.

510
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:08,792
No, I think it's coming.

511
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:11,261
Now I have to sit here
and pull everything out

512
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,430
piece by piece, literally.

513
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:15,865
Here we go.

514
00:23:17,868 --> 00:23:20,036
It's almost like peeling a
stubborn hard-boiled egg.

515
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:21,471
It's, like, you get a piece off,

516
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:22,972
and there's little pieces that cracked,

517
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,075
and you have to go through individually

518
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,324
and get all those little, tiny pieces off,

519
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:28,325
so he spent a good time doing that.

520
00:23:28,612 --> 00:23:31,715
I'm, like, peeling it out piece by piece.

521
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,516
And it sucks.

522
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:46,896
Today's the day of the application,

523
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:50,700
and we have five hours to
complete this project.

524
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,804
- How you doin'?
- What's going on?

525
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:56,373
Your face definitely helped a lot.

526
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,375
Does that feel about
right on your chin area?

527
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,610
- Yeah.
- Just go ahead and...

528
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:03,179
Take your hand and just
hold it there for me. Cool.

529
00:24:03,247 --> 00:24:06,216
Megan ripped my prosthetic, but
because it's a nice, clean tear

530
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:07,917
it's gonna fit right back together.

531
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:09,386
And then whatever crease is there,

532
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:11,388
I'm just gonna use
silicone to go over that.

533
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:13,757
So I think it's gonna work out really well.

534
00:24:19,163 --> 00:24:21,498
I'm placing the appliance on her face,

535
00:24:21,565 --> 00:24:23,700
and I'm realizing, like, my
edges aren't that great.

536
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:27,804
An edge is literally where the
prosthetic meets the skin.

537
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:30,373
If that doesn't blend down, you can see it.

538
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,342
It automatically looks fake.

539
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,943
Really great.

540
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:39,115
My edges are not staying down.

541
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:42,085
They are lifting up again
and again and again,

542
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:44,087
and I am having to keep adding more glue.

543
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:48,258
The chest piece, instead of backing it up

544
00:24:48,325 --> 00:24:49,339
with a lighter weight foam,

545
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,994
I just filled the whole
thing with silicone,

546
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:53,963
and it ended up kind of weighing a ton.

547
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:56,099
You wear safety pins?

548
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:59,569
I have not connected my head
piece to my chest piece.

549
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:00,937
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

550
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:02,439
I have not connected the horns,

551
00:25:02,506 --> 00:25:04,474
and I've still got plenty
of painting to do.

552
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,942
My work's cut out for me.

553
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,645
Think "Clockwork Orange".

554
00:25:08,712 --> 00:25:11,281
Think sort of like Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde.

555
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:12,516
I'm starting to get scared,

556
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,551
looking around the room
during application day,

557
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:16,386
'cause I'm starting to see these characters

558
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:18,188
actually flush out and come together.

559
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:19,803
I basically just recreated

560
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:22,425
stuff that's been done
a million times over.

561
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:24,694
I think this is it, I'm gonna lose,

562
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,629
and I have no one to blame but myself.

563
00:25:33,204 --> 00:25:35,972
We're packing up our kits
to go over to the stage

564
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,341
for last looks, and we
still have so much to do.

565
00:25:42,413 --> 00:25:44,113
We've got an hour to
finish up our characters,

566
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:46,549
and I could be in trouble.

567
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:49,486
The success or failure completely hinges on

568
00:25:49,553 --> 00:25:52,489
the application end of it.

569
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:54,824
I get so jittery.
My edges are starting to look bad.

570
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:57,126
I have to constantly
keep adding more stuff.

571
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,294
It's a complete bummer.

572
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:03,766
The eyes don't fit.

573
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,702
I am worried.

574
00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:08,037
I sculpted out her eyelids because
my character doesn't blink.

575
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:10,640
My problem is the eyelids have stretched

576
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:14,010
well beyond the size of
my eyes that I created,

577
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:16,312
and there's no more time
to make bigger eyes.

578
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,915
Hey, guys, there's only 15 minutes left.

579
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:21,117
I'm freaking out inside
so much that I'm, like...

580
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:23,186
"Okay, gotta get it together.
Get it together."

581
00:26:23,254 --> 00:26:25,855
But it's so intense and so stressful,

582
00:26:25,923 --> 00:26:27,757
and I really tried on this.

583
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:30,693
One minute. Okay, stand up, jump up.

584
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:54,918
Welcome to the "Face Off" reveal stage.

585
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:58,788
Tonight, one of you will be eliminated.

586
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:02,358
Say hello to your judges.

587
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:04,294
Owner of optic nerve makeup effects studio,

588
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:06,396
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hello.

589
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:09,098
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

590
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,533
Welcome back, everybody.

591
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:13,670
Creature designer and
director Patrick Tatopoulos.

592
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:14,704
Hi, guys.

593
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:16,139
And our guest judge this week,

594
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:18,575
the man who ought Jason Voorhees to life,

595
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:21,144
director a producer Sean Cunningham.

596
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:23,413
- Hey, guys.
- All: Hi, Sean.

597
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,725
This week, your spotlight

598
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,216
challenge was to create an
original movie villain,

599
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:30,420
along with a movie poster,
title, and tag line.

600
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:32,422
So, let's see what you've come up with.

601
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:50,106
When my poster comes up, my guy comes out

602
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:52,175
walking on these arm crutches,

603
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:54,844
and it's the creepiest
thing I've ever seen.

604
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:20,370
With the risk that I took, I
couldn't have been happier.

605
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:23,473
Cunningham has, like, a
huge smile from the get go.

606
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:38,755
I'm looking at him,

607
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:40,056
and I look at all the
other guys, I'm, like...

608
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,592
I knew I'd kind of just
thrown this one away,

609
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,261
and I just felt sick.

610
00:28:57,975 --> 00:28:59,976
I'm happy with the end result.

611
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:01,811
I really incorporated all the elements

612
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:04,247
into my character that I wanted to.

613
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,495
When Kimie looks around
with those creepy eyes,

614
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:22,231
I can see people who are watching this

615
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:24,667
get physically uncomfortable around her.

616
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:40,249
I feel like mine was the creepiest.

617
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:42,351
He does his little wave.

618
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,887
I mean, it was so me. I love this villain.

619
00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:01,370
I feel like it's exactly
what I had in my mind.

620
00:30:01,438 --> 00:30:04,407
It was cool seeing up
there, all put together.

621
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,585
As soon as I saw my poster come up,

622
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:17,019
I was just, like, "Oh, my God. Oh, my God."

623
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,122
I don't like to look at
the judges reactions

624
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:21,758
because not only is it
Ve, Glenn, and Patrick,

625
00:30:21,825 --> 00:30:24,193
it's also Sean Cunningham.

626
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:27,296
It's hard to hear people you
admire so much tear you down.

627
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,432
It really, really cuts deep.

628
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:47,116
As my character comes up, I realize...

629
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:48,985
What if the judges don't get it?

630
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:58,528
All right, judges, why don't
you take a closer look?

631
00:30:58,595 --> 00:30:59,562
Indeed.

632
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,202
Can you see right here?
Can you see my hand?

633
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,037
Without turning your... No.

634
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,643
Is this built into the lip prosthetic?

635
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:21,717
Don't go past it, don't go past it,

636
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:23,219
don't go past it, don't go past it.

637
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:24,887
You, you, you.

638
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:37,656
There was no way in hell
mine was gonna be best.

639
00:31:37,724 --> 00:31:39,325
I wasn't shooting for best.

640
00:31:39,392 --> 00:31:40,726
I was shooting for middle ground.

641
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:43,595
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,202
Let me see your mask on.

643
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,272
- Did she make the mask, too?
- Glenn: Indeed.

644
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,541
Are you able to move your mouth,
open your mouth and close?

645
00:31:57,777 --> 00:31:59,578
Can you turn your head this way?

646
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:00,979
I'm feeling nervous because

647
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:02,948
I didn't know really where I stood.

648
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:04,483
Oh, my God.

649
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:07,319
Everyone's was so different.

650
00:32:07,387 --> 00:32:08,420
Can you turn your head, please?

651
00:32:12,158 --> 00:32:13,592
Okay.

652
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:17,963
Well, the judges have
scored your creations.

653
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,669
Conor...

654
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:25,871
Sam...

655
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:27,506
Jo...

656
00:32:27,574 --> 00:32:30,809
- You are safe this week.
- Thank you, God.

657
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:33,579
If you would please head
back to the makeup room.

658
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:35,414
Thank you.

659
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,184
Come on, beautiful.

660
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:45,124
Oh, my God. I'm so happy I'm back here.

661
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:53,298
The rest of you were the best
and the worst of this week.

662
00:32:53,366 --> 00:32:54,743
The judges would like to speak

663
00:32:54,744 --> 00:32:56,902
with each of you to learn
more about your work.

664
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,138
First up, Gage.

665
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:08,847
Gage, can you tell us a little
bit about your character.

666
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:11,617
Yeah, absolutely.
He used to be a lighthouse worker

667
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:16,288
and maybe fell asleep behind
the light, and it burns him.

668
00:33:16,356 --> 00:33:18,724
So, after that, other people there

669
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,993
are starting to get killed off one by one.

670
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,422
I chose silicone for the translucency,

671
00:33:23,423 --> 00:33:25,164
especially on the burn, so...

672
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:28,133
I like it. The paint job I like.

673
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:30,769
I think it's kind of like
an old '50s horror movie,

674
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:32,971
and that's kind of really
cool that you went for that.

675
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,907
I think you did a great job.
Congratulations.

676
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:36,575
Thank you, Ve.

677
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:39,411
Some of those characters we're
seeing tonight inspire more pity.

678
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,147
They look like twisted being
that will not frighten me,

679
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:43,649
but this one felt very powerful.

680
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:45,350
- That was a big deal for me.
- Thank you.

681
00:33:45,418 --> 00:33:49,388
I thought the lighthouse,
and the remote place,

682
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:53,525
and this great weapon, and
I think it's really scary.

683
00:33:53,593 --> 00:33:54,860
This is gonna be a heck of a horror film.

684
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:57,062
Thank you so much. Thank you.

685
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,730
All right, Gage, thank you.

686
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:01,834
All right, Anthony.

687
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:06,538
What's this guy's deal?

688
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:07,940
Why should I be so afraid of him?

689
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:10,209
Dr. Edward psychobabble

690
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:13,011
is the leader of the gang London twilight,

691
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,914
and the idea is that
they were a roving gang

692
00:34:15,982 --> 00:34:20,252
similar to "A Clockwork Orange",
where they terrorized London.

693
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,455
And I'm more into, like, mental horrors

694
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:25,757
than a brute standing in a
doorway, hacking people up.

695
00:34:28,061 --> 00:34:31,196
Not... not to say anything
about "Friday the 13th."

696
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:33,198
What it seemed as if you were doing

697
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:36,235
was a movie that I've just seen to death,

698
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:37,826
and I was thinking why

699
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:40,806
today am I gonna go out and see this movie?

700
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:43,242
I'm not real happy with this
makeup, to tell you the truth.

701
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:46,912
- Okay.
- The paint job's crappy, his mouth is off.

702
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,681
I think you kinda, like,
flunked out on this one.

703
00:34:49,749 --> 00:34:51,817
You've squandered an opportunity here

704
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:54,686
to come up with something truly original.

705
00:34:54,754 --> 00:34:56,321
This design, unfortunately,

706
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,591
has become a vessel of your ineptitude.

707
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:02,928
I'm very disappointed.

708
00:35:02,996 --> 00:35:04,229
Anthony, thank you.

709
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:05,831
I felt like crying right there

710
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:08,667
'cause I knew it wasn't who I was.

711
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:10,869
I could do so much more.

712
00:35:12,605 --> 00:35:13,672
Megan.

713
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:21,413
It's a very simple makeup.
You had one feature.

714
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:23,248
We concentrate on the teeth,

715
00:35:23,316 --> 00:35:24,583
and I wish you'd gave them more depth

716
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:27,319
because it's your central piece.

717
00:35:27,387 --> 00:35:29,721
I agree with Patrick that the
smile didn't work for me at all.

718
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:33,025
He can't articulate, he
can't do any of the things

719
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:35,160
that you would need him to do dramatically.

720
00:35:35,228 --> 00:35:36,519
I'm not sure you've quite

721
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,897
thought through how it
would actually be used.

722
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:41,833
We never design anything
to be a single shot,

723
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:44,670
even if it's supposed to be a single shot.

724
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:47,940
Unfortunately, I think
you've missed the mark here.

725
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:49,374
All right, Megan, thank you very much.

726
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,279
All right, Tate.

727
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:03,255
I think design-wise, this
is very impressive to me.

728
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:04,772
The proportion of the eyes has

729
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:07,092
something very mystical
and disturbing about it.

730
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,860
It feels like a mummified creature.

731
00:36:08,928 --> 00:36:12,431
There is something very
much alive about this face

732
00:36:12,498 --> 00:36:13,966
and that, to me, is quite amazing.

733
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,867
Thank you very much.

734
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:17,322
I think I would have liked

735
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:19,404
to have seen just possibly a little bit

736
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:22,975
more highlighting going on on the
actual paint job on the head,

737
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:25,043
and I think you lose a lot of the detail.

738
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:28,380
Other than that, all in all, the
totality of it is wonderful.

739
00:36:28,448 --> 00:36:29,615
- Well done.
- Thank you.

740
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:30,916
- I really appreciate that.
- Congratulations.

741
00:36:30,984 --> 00:36:34,853
I wish you would have made the eyes blend.

742
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,856
The static eyes are one of the
things that throw me off.

743
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:41,093
I absolutely find it, overall,

744
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,029
visually riveting. I love this makeup.

745
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:45,998
Thank you very much.
That means a lot. Thank you.

746
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:47,432
All right, Tate. Thank you.

747
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:51,603
Marcel.

748
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:02,614
How successful do you feel
you've been with this makeup?

749
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:03,982
Painting silicone is tricky.

750
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,551
I wanted to keep it translucent.

751
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:09,121
I feel like, for the time
I had, I'm happy with it.

752
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,390
I'm not.

753
00:37:11,457 --> 00:37:13,692
I'm just not getting the character

754
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,494
and how the character lives
in that environment.

755
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:18,497
I love late '70s, early '80s slasher films.

756
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:21,433
His graduation class decides
to break into the roller rink.

757
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:23,602
She busts in, or he busts in, with an ax,

758
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,737
and dispatches them in
horrible, horrible ways.

759
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:30,008
I see a crazy person on
roller-skates chopping people up.

760
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:31,591
You know, I didn't have a

761
00:37:31,592 --> 00:37:34,379
sense of being scared.
I could be grossed out.

762
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:37,015
You know, your coloring
is a little bit off.

763
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,917
I think, possibly, you might have been

764
00:37:38,985 --> 00:37:40,852
better off doing this out of foam.

765
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,988
I mean, it doesn't really
match up around her mouth.

766
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:46,124
So I don't think you really
completed the makeup job.

767
00:37:46,192 --> 00:37:48,293
It doesn't look like a makeup
to me, it just looks like

768
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:51,630
a rubber mask you've stuck
on and tried to paint.

769
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:54,966
I wish you fill out more, the actual...
the weapon, for example.

770
00:37:55,034 --> 00:37:57,402
We're on the skating rink, you
could have used something

771
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,806
more related to the skating world.
It doesn't feel iconic.

772
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:03,909
Marcel, thank you very much.

773
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,014
All right, Tom.

774
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:13,952
Well, I gotta tell you,
when you walked out,

775
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,155
or I should say, when he
walked out, I thought,

776
00:38:17,223 --> 00:38:21,193
this guy has got some deep rooted
problems with a Teddy bear.

777
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:26,498
I took a note from Sean when we
met him at the psycho house,

778
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:28,300
he said one of the things
that scares people the most

779
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:30,769
is stuff they were afraid
of in their childhood.

780
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:32,437
You just did a really good job.

781
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:35,073
I also like the way you took
the time to finish the hands.

782
00:38:35,141 --> 00:38:36,508
Thank you.

783
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:40,178
I love the button eye.
It's so creepy. I'm a fan.

784
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:42,948
I'll go see this movie. Well done.

785
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:46,885
It's genius, and I don't
need to tell much more.

786
00:38:46,953 --> 00:38:48,687
I think you've created a character there,

787
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:50,756
and it's very, very strong.

788
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:52,023
The way you blended the fur

789
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:54,526
into your prosthetic is flawless.

790
00:38:54,594 --> 00:38:56,495
Other than that, I think all I have to say

791
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:57,590
is that if you win, I hope

792
00:38:57,591 --> 00:38:59,331
that you spend some of
the money on therapy.

793
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:03,869
All right, Tom. Thank you very much.
You can step back.

794
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,171
- Good job, man.
- Nice work.

795
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:10,675
Glenn, tell us about the top looks.

796
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:12,477
This week's top looks came from Tate.

797
00:39:12,545 --> 00:39:15,013
Very strong. Great profiles.

798
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:17,749
Also from Gage. A really cool,

799
00:39:17,817 --> 00:39:20,218
cohesive concept, your character.

800
00:39:20,286 --> 00:39:22,788
And from Tom, the really exciting

801
00:39:22,855 --> 00:39:24,856
and unique take on the villain.

802
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:27,392
This week's winner is...

803
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:31,530
Tom.

804
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,400
Tom, congratulations.

805
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,502
You have earned the right
to consult with the judges

806
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,538
on who you feel should be eliminated.

807
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:41,807
The rest of you can head
back to the makeup room

808
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:44,442
until the judges have made their decision.

809
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,378
Thank you, guys.

810
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,750
Good work.

811
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:57,132
Who do you think should go home this week?

812
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:02,093
My honest opinion is I think
Megan should go home.

813
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,996
I believe that she's the weakest
artist left your group.

814
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:08,934
She has slipped through
the radar several times.

815
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,369
I just feel like today sold it.

816
00:40:11,437 --> 00:40:13,905
It was not functional, like you guys

817
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:16,575
all pointed out, as far as the mouth.

818
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:18,577
Tom, thank you.

819
00:40:18,644 --> 00:40:21,246
- You can head back to the makeup room.
- Alright.

820
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,115
All right, judges.

821
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:26,051
Let's start with Megan.
What are your thoughts?

822
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:29,654
That makeup, we've seen
done well a lot of times.

823
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:31,957
- Right.
- And this wasn't one of them.

824
00:40:32,024 --> 00:40:33,892
To stick that big old plastic mouth

825
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,660
in there was not really adequate.

826
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:36,995
She really hasn't performed

827
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:38,830
and done anything really exceptional.

828
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:41,766
You're right. It's an awful decision.

829
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,401
- I wish she would have gone another way.
- Bad, bad.

830
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:45,203
- And the teeth were even badly done.
- Bad.

831
00:40:45,271 --> 00:40:47,239
What did you all think
about what Tom had to say?

832
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,307
I'm feeling that most of that

833
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:51,843
is animosity generated by
last week's situation.

834
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:53,879
I think we have to take
that into consideration.

835
00:40:53,946 --> 00:40:55,347
What do you think about Marcel?

836
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:57,315
Marcel seems to be always quite satisfied

837
00:40:57,383 --> 00:40:59,618
- with what comes out.
- Exactly.

838
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:01,319
And I'd like him to be a
little bit more self critical.

839
00:41:01,387 --> 00:41:03,021
It makes me feel like someone that may not

840
00:41:03,089 --> 00:41:05,690
feel he needs to progress.

841
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:07,826
I really just didn't get
the whole thing today.

842
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:10,862
I mean, I think that he
threw the burn makeup in

843
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,199
as something to do, as opposed
to creating an iconic character

844
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:16,601
that would carry through franchise films.

845
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:18,336
I've seen far too many people like that.

846
00:41:18,404 --> 00:41:20,005
They actually think what
they are doing is good.

847
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:23,842
It makes it impossible for
them to learn and to grow.

848
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,378
I like that Marcel took his chances,

849
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:30,582
I just didn't much like the concept.

850
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,018
And what are your thoughts about Anthony?

851
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:34,380
Anthony has proven to be

852
00:41:34,381 --> 00:41:36,755
a pretty decent artist,
but today he failed.

853
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:38,590
It was just very plain and very boring.

854
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:41,426
He had that poster with the fog,

855
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:44,396
but there wasn't anything
scary or anything...

856
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,031
Special about it at all, I didn't think.

857
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:47,899
We don't want someone in our industry

858
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,935
who's gonna constantly
be ducking and covering

859
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:52,637
every time there's a big
challenge that comes our way.

860
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:55,106
It's not a very good strategy, I agree.

861
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:57,142
Judges, have you reached a decision?

862
00:41:57,209 --> 00:41:58,043
We have.

863
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,615
So who is going home tonight?

864
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:15,538
Glenn, who is going home tonight?

865
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:21,425
Marcel...

866
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:24,562
Really unhappy with the
quality of the sculpture

867
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,697
and the paint job and the overall concept.

868
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:32,970
Megan, the decision to
make a inarticulated mouth

869
00:42:33,038 --> 00:42:35,306
was a poor one.

870
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:39,410
And Anthony, you
obviously played it safe.

871
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:41,512
There's no room in our industry

872
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,748
for people shooting for mediocrity.

873
00:42:45,017 --> 00:42:47,785
The person going home tonight is...

874
00:42:54,092 --> 00:42:56,126
Marcel.

875
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:00,931
Glad I got this opportunity,
and I want to thank you guys.

876
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:03,500
Please head back to the makeup
room, and pack up your kit.

877
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:10,808
- I'm out, guys.
- Jo: No, you're not.

878
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:11,809
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

879
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:12,910
Are you kidding?

880
00:43:12,978 --> 00:43:15,179
- I don't know.
- Jo: What?

881
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:16,413
- McCloud.
- Nice meeting you, dude.

882
00:43:16,481 --> 00:43:18,949
- Come here, Jo.
- No.

883
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:20,684
I tried my best.

884
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:22,486
I tried my hardest on each challenge.

885
00:43:22,554 --> 00:43:23,754
I met great people.

886
00:43:23,822 --> 00:43:25,489
You don't deserve to leave, Marcel.

887
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:27,725
We will see you after this.

888
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,126
I started out when I was a little kid,

889
00:43:29,194 --> 00:43:32,296
no formal training, and
I've got pretty far,

890
00:43:32,364 --> 00:43:34,500
and this is what I'm always gonna do.
