00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,242
<i>Previously, on "Face Off".</i>

2
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:07,345
<i>12 talented special
effects makeup artists</i>

3
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:10,481
<i>came to Los Angeles to compete
to join the world's elite.</i>

4
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:14,686
Your first competition
starts right now.

5
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:16,688
Frank: I'm just about done,
so you guys can just

6
00:00:16,855 --> 00:00:18,623
take your time on
the rest of that hour.

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,091
Wow, this guy is really full of...

8
00:00:20,258 --> 00:00:21,693
- [balloon pops]
- You're gonna have to create

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,928
a half-human, half-animal hybrid.

10
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:26,798
- [trumpets]
- Man: There can only be one winner.

11
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:28,132
Conor.

12
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:30,535
McKenzie: Who is going home tonight?

13
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:32,837
Glenn: Jessica.

14
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:34,072
<i>And tonight on "Face Off"...</i>

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,041
Everybody, drop 'em.

16
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,478
It is birthday suits
as far as the eye can see.

17
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,213
Oh, that's awesome.

18
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,048
<i>To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress</i>

19
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:46,618
<i>our award-winning panel of judges...</i>

20
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:48,553
<i>Ve Neill, legendary makeup artist,</i>

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,089
<i>whose work includes
"Edward Scissorhands",</i>

22
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:54,459
<i>"Beetlejuice", and the "Pirates

23
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:58,162
<i>Glenn Hetrick, cutting-edge
makeup effects artist on "Heroes",</i>

24
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,198
<i>"Legion", and
"Buffy The Vampire Slayer";</i>

25
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,167
<i>and Patrick Tatopoulus,
visionary creature designer</i>

26
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:05,403
<i>for "Independence Day", "Godzilla",</i>

27
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,106
<i>and director of "Underworld:
Rise of the Lycans".</i>

28
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:09,641
I'm a very, very
big fan of your work.

29
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,043
- I'm blown away.
- I love this challenge.

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,312
<i>Who will be the next
great name in movie magic</i>

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,581
<i>and earn $100,000 dollars</i>

32
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:19,050
<i>and a year's worth
of makeup from Alcone?</i>

33
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:22,086
<i>Get read for "Face Off".</i>

34
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,097
We couldn't hear a word
anybody was saying.

35
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:07,632
Like, what happened?

36
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,968
Well, I mean, we were
up on the chopping block,

37
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:13,304
and they just pretty much slaughtered
us, and told us that our makeup

38
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,474
wasn't even good enough for,
like, a child's television show.

39
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:18,910
Being on the chopping block
during the first competition,

40
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:20,912
that is rough.

41
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,914
When Jessica's name got brought up,

44
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:29,354
They called all four of us out,
they dismissed me,

45
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:32,090
and said "Next time, you have another
chance to prove to us what you can do.

46
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:33,758
I suggest you use your time wisely."

47
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:38,463
But they, like,
each took a turn tearing it down.

48
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,231
I grew up with people
tearing me down,

49
00:02:40,398 --> 00:02:42,934
and I know how to build
myself back from that,

50
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,503
and I'm ready to prove
those judges wrong.

51
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,238
When Jess came back
through the curtain,

52
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,374
I don't really know
if it was the right choice.

53
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,508
Dude, I was shocked.

54
00:02:57,582 --> 00:03:00,351
Sergio: Everything here has been
like going on a roller coaster.

55
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:02,720
It's very hard to think about
what's going to be next,

56
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,889
but that makes it fun.

57
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,290
Hey, everybody.

58
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:09,060
Welcome to your next
Foundation Challenge.

59
00:03:09,227 --> 00:03:11,896
Now, as you all know,
the winner of the Foundation Challenge

60
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:15,400
gains some sort of perk or advantage
going into the Spotlight Challenge.

61
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,703
But today's challenge
is all about...

62
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,504
tattoos.

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,943
We're doing tattoos.
That excites me.

64
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,280
A good makeup artist
can create, design,

65
00:03:29,447 --> 00:03:33,017
and apply a tattoo onto an actor
that looks very realistic,

66
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:35,286
and can also help tell a story.

67
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,388
So today, you will have two hours

68
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:41,292
to design and apply
an original tattoo

69
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,761
that has some sort of personal
significance to your model.

70
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:47,130
But you will be your own models.

71
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:50,701
I love to draw,

72
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,970
but drawing on myself upside down?

73
00:03:53,137 --> 00:03:55,306
It is extremely difficult.

74
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:59,010
And to judge today's challenge,
we have an expert with us.

75
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:03,880
Please welcome world-famous
tattoo artist Thomas Pendelton.

76
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,554
Gage: The pressure's
on because Thomas

77
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,789
is a world-famous tattoo artist,
everybody knows of him,

78
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:15,293
and I know that it takes a lot
of discipline to get good,

79
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,395
because working on the skin
is a totally different medium

80
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:20,164
than paper or canvas,
so I have a tremendous

81
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:22,066
amount of respect for Thomas.

82
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,502
All right, what are you going to be
looking for in some of their work?

83
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,871
I'm looking for something
that means something to you guys.

84
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:28,706
You know, something that
is a legitimate tattoo

85
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:30,575
that would last the test of time.

86
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:33,144
I'm nervous.
I'm hoping that I can show the judges

87
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,479
that I do deserve to be here.

88
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,115
Your materials are
already at your stations.

89
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:39,182
So let's start tattooing.

90
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:46,624
There are several different
ways to do a tattoo makeup.

91
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,160
I mean, some people
like to use transfer paper,

92
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,561
some people like to use tattoo pens,

93
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,263
some people like
to use acrylic paints.

94
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,165
Every artist has their own method.

95
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:59,804
Frank: I have two tattoos,
which is what

96
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:01,672
I'm kind of going over right now,

97
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,342
and both of my tattoos
are in black light ink,

98
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,512
so I can't even see 'em
to even know how they look.

99
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,515
Tracing tattoos, tracing in general,

100
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,516
it's cheating.

101
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,189
Tate: I came up with this cool concept.
I'd never tried it before.

102
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:22,160
But I drew the outline
on a piece of clear plastic,

103
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:26,264
and then I let it dry,
and then I spritzed it with alcohol,

104
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:28,266
and I pushed it
on to myself to transfer.

105
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,067
The happy accident about that

106
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:32,603
was the alcohol grabbed up the ink,

107
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,706
and it spread out, so it instantly

108
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,508
created shading for me.
It was great.

109
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:39,577
Funny thing is,
this is the exact tattoo

110
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:43,214
that I designed and planned
to have right here.

111
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:44,715
I'm a proud New Yorker.

112
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,984
I basically wanted to incorporate

113
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:48,653
parts of New York
that were in my life.

114
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,457
My grandfather had
a, like, from the 1920s,

115
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:56,294
a really old, like, you know,
tattoo, like, just like this.

116
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:58,296
Oh, cool.

117
00:05:58,463 --> 00:06:00,865
Him and my grandma
passed away just recently,

118
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:05,102
so I figured I'd put them
together with this tattoo.

119
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,171
Sergio's still drawing
on the transfer.

120
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:09,006
He's doesn't understand
time management.

121
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:10,340
That's gonna be a problem for him.

122
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:16,714
I'm creating a stylized portrait
that's representative of my mother.

123
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:19,383
The side portrait
of a woman is something

124
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,120
that's often replicated
in tattoo artwork.

125
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:26,157
I'm done, guys.
I'm gonna take a nap.

126
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:27,758
Let's see it.

127
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,527
Frank: I've done what
the challenge is,

128
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:32,029
to make tattoos, and
make them look believable.

129
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:35,700
So I just sit around, put my feet up,
just relax. What else am I gonna do?

130
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,469
I'm not gonna start making up other
things that I don't want as tattoos.

131
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:40,270
You have 15 minutes.

132
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:49,146
I thought, "Well, I've been away from
my girlfriend, I kind of miss her."

133
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:53,083
So I chose to do the words
"Till death do us part".

134
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:55,753
Frank: Tom, do you realize

135
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,589
that your tattoo is backwards?

136
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:00,891
'Cause you're doing it
in the mirror, it's backwards.

137
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:02,860
[chuckles] I do now.

138
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:05,363
I'm [bleep].

139
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,065
Tom: But I got a chance
to look at Sergio's.

140
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:12,502
We had two hours, and he had a crooked
anchor with upside down letters.

141
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,474
Sergio: I sprayed the wrong side,
and it kind of melted away

142
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,709
the whole design
that I had just spent

143
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:22,112
tons of time working on,
so that wasn't good.

144
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,726
Time's up, everybody.
Time to stop working.

145
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,997
And I look over, and I see Jo,

146
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:43,567
and she just has tears
welling up on her face.

147
00:07:52,777 --> 00:07:55,011
I told her, you gotta keep going.
You have to keep going.

148
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,619
- Hi.
- Hey, Jo. Tell us about this.

149
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:05,623
This is just a shadow of this flame
stack that we had in this town

150
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,492
that I went to special effects school,
and it means a lot to me.

151
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,628
I think it's cool,
it's just placed a little weird.

152
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:12,563
Like, it's...
It's kinda at an angle up here,

153
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,433
and you're hitting
your knee right here.

154
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,803
I like tribal tattoos.
Werewolves were my inspiration

155
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,438
for getting into the business
in the first place,

156
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:25,142
so I decided to try and do
a werewolf tribal design.

157
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:27,078
I mean, the goal here is to make
it look like you're an actor

158
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:29,113
- that's tattooed, right?
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,449
The problem with this thing is it
looks like you scarred up your talent.

160
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:38,289
I'm from New York city,
so I incorporated Manhattan,

161
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:41,225
Bronx, Queens,
Brooklyn, Staten Island,

162
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:43,894
the skyline of New York City with
the World Trade Center in it.

163
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:45,463
I think it looks cool.

164
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,198
This is my deer skull.

165
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:50,101
Some of my fondest memories are
camping and hunting with my father.

166
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,969
Everybody's done theirs facing them.

167
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:53,704
Why did you choose
to do it this way?

168
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:55,306
I felt that it flowed
with my anatomy better,

169
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:58,342
and it gives me more options if
I wanted to go with a sleeve.

170
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,379
You thought out your placement,
which is really important.

171
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,814
It's sort of
a representation of my mother.

172
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:05,383
It looks like a traditional tattoo.

173
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,585
It definitely has that flavor.

174
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:10,821
It looks good.
You did a nice job.

175
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:12,990
So, what you got going on here?

176
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:17,495
I got my broken leg, which I actually
have tattooed in black light ink,

177
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:20,097
and then I have
"Send more paramedics",

178
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:22,666
which I actually have
tattooed in black light ink,

179
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,136
and then this is where
I broke my wrist.

180
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,971
You just recreated
tattoos you already have?

181
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,672
Okay.

182
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,243
It seems to me, as an artist,
that you would have really dug deep.

183
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,177
I mean, this just
looks like you're clumsy.

184
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,716
I look around the room,
and everyone's tattoos are great.

185
00:09:38,883 --> 00:09:42,218
It wasn't hard at all, I think, for
the other guys to come up with ideas.

186
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:48,592
So, Thomas, what did you think
about some of the work today?

187
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,428
I thought some of it was good
and some of it was... was tough.

188
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,466
Who do you think fell short
of today's challenge?

189
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,968
I think Sergio's anchor
was a little tough.

190
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,870
It seemed, like you
got lost in that piece.

191
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:02,840
It definitely could have been
a lot better had it been finished.

192
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:06,877
Frank's bones tattoo.

193
00:10:07,044 --> 00:10:08,612
It seemed like you didn't even
want to do this challenge, brother.

194
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,015
I saw you reading a book
for about an hour, so...

195
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:14,819
I had no idea he was gonna judge
me on the bottom with Sergio.

196
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:17,888
Well, is this a show about
your personal taste in tattoos,

197
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,990
or is this about whether
or not our tattoos

198
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:21,926
are competently done
as makeup artists?

199
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:24,929
Competently as a makeup artist?
I don't think it was either.

200
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:29,033
It looked like a kid drew on your leg.
Sorry, brother.

201
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,968
Who were some of your favorites?

202
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:32,636
I think Tate's tattoo
was done really well.

203
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:35,306
I think you thought
about the layout,

204
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:37,041
you thought about the piece.

205
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,644
I think Anthony's tattoo,
as far as an onscreen piece,

206
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:42,513
I think it would have
the most dramatic effect.

207
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,483
I thought Sam's traditional
tattoo was beautiful.

208
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,685
I think it looked like
a legit tattoo.

209
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:50,588
You would think
it was definitely real.

210
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:54,058
So, who is the winner
of this challenge?

211
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:57,561
The winner of this challenge is...

212
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,463
Tate.

213
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,800
Thank you.
Very much.

214
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,735
I'm glad he got it.
I thought the tattoo looked great,

215
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:06,537
and I'm usually my biggest critic.

216
00:11:06,704 --> 00:11:09,006
Congratulations, Tate.

217
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:11,809
You have won this
Foundation Challenge,

218
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:14,278
which is going to
give you a big advantage

219
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,247
going into tomorrow's
Spotlight Challenge.

220
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:19,816
So, with that,
I will see you all later.

221
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,796
Oh, man, this is
gonna be a crazy day.

222
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:35,566
Frank seems like he's, like,
digging himself a hole.

223
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:37,635
If it's a strategy,
I don't think it's a good one.

224
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:40,004
Frank obviously has mad skill,

225
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,439
but he's kicking his feet up
every chance he gets.

226
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:44,508
Well, whatever
the Spotlight Challenge is,

227
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:46,977
if he really rocks it out,
he can bring himself back.

228
00:11:47,144 --> 00:11:49,079
Tate: How much you wanna bet
he finishes an hour early

229
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,580
and reads a book, though?

230
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:58,589
Megan: We walk in the lab today,

231
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:01,859
and we see these big canvases,

232
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,361
and each one of them
are different pictures.

233
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:07,331
Welcome to your next
Spotlight Challenge.

234
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:10,200
First, let's meet the models.

235
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:13,404
Gage: Our models all walk
out in a single file line,

236
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,639
and line up in front
of the backdrops,

237
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:16,807
so we don't quite
know what's going on.

238
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:18,175
Wow.

239
00:12:18,342 --> 00:12:20,678
Before we go any further...

240
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:23,647
Everybody, drop 'em.

241
00:12:23,814 --> 00:12:26,449
Megan: Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?

242
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:35,159
Tom: The models walk out,
and they're in robes.

243
00:12:35,326 --> 00:12:38,062
That's kind of odd.
What the heck are we doing?

244
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,531
- Wow.
- Before we go any further...

245
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:43,233
Everybody, drop 'em.

246
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:49,773
Megan: Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?

247
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,909
It is birthday suits
as far as the eye can see.

248
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:53,277
Okay.

249
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,245
Tate: What do you know?
Robes come off,

250
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,948
nothing but boobs and wieners
all around the room.

251
00:12:58,115 --> 00:12:59,883
You guys doing okay?

252
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,753
Guys, it's just a wiener.
It's just some boobs, you know?

253
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,223
Well, I hope that you're ready
to transform these lovely people

254
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,360
into actual living pieces of art,

255
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,562
because that's what
this challenge is all about.

256
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:13,630
Nude body painting.

257
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,070
It's a shocker. I've never painted
anybody, naked, clothed, either way.

258
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:23,807
As you can see, each of the models
is in front of a different backdrop.

259
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:27,244
It's up to you to figure out how
you want to incorporate your model

260
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:30,981
into the background,
whether you paint them in an outfit,

261
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:33,684
or you blend them in.
Whatever you want to do.

262
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:37,221
Your final look needs to be
worthy of a magazine cover.

263
00:13:37,388 --> 00:13:40,090
You'll be judged on
creativity, technique,

264
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:43,560
and the overall presentation
of your final photo.

265
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:46,430
Okay, models, I think they get the idea.
You can cover up.

266
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:49,867
Now, I've brought in an expert
to help judge this challenge.

267
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,202
Would you please all
welcome one of the world's

268
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:57,007
premier body painters Filippo Ioco.

269
00:13:57,174 --> 00:13:59,009
- Hi, Filippo.
- Hi, McKenzie.

270
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:01,912
- Thanks for having me.
- Thank you so much for being here.

271
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,814
I've seen some
of Filippo's work before.

272
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:06,717
It's amazing stuff.
It's really cool.

273
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,920
I was glad that he was
there as a judge for it.

274
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:12,556
Filippo, can you tell them,
what does it take

275
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,358
to make a great cover shot?

276
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,360
I think what makes
a great cover shot

277
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:19,596
is using the power of your
imagination to the fullest,

278
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,899
making sure you
have your detail down,

279
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,334
your color, because
at the end of the day,

280
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,770
this cover is gonna
be seen by everybody.

281
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:29,773
It really breaks out from the whole,

282
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,909
"I'm a special effects artist. All I do
is blood and guts and monster movies."

283
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,646
Let's get this underway.

284
00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:39,249
Tate, as the winner of
the Foundation Challenge,

285
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,986
you get to choose your backdrop
and your model first.

286
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:46,323
Tate: I look down the line,
and the first backdrop

287
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,159
that grabs me is the rainforest.

288
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:51,095
Then I see that
the model in front of it

289
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:53,696
has this big afro,
and I'm, like, lion's mane.

290
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,968
Next up, Tom.

291
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:02,740
Tom: I don't think I was
as shocked at the nudity

292
00:15:02,907 --> 00:15:05,142
because I was looking at
the backgrounds, trying to decide,

293
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,643
"What am I gonna do
with this project?"

294
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,880
I think I'll go with this one.

295
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,882
Sergio.

296
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:15,119
As each name is being drawn,
I think all the guys

297
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:17,287
are just kind of hoping that they get
a chance to pick a girl.

298
00:15:17,454 --> 00:15:20,991
I did, too, but I think I got
a better image in my head

299
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:24,695
of what I wanted
art-wise with tornado.

300
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:27,331
So, I'm trying to narrow down,
"Okay, if I get this one,

301
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:29,900
this is what I'm gonna do," and they keep
picking names, they keep picking names.

302
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:32,736
Jo.

303
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:34,505
Anthony.

304
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:35,706
Frank: I'm just getting
crankier and crankier.

305
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,674
Gage.

306
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:39,276
- Okay. How's it going?
- How you doin'?

307
00:15:39,443 --> 00:15:41,311
Aw, crap.

308
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:42,979
I was gonna take that one.

309
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:47,284
- Marcel.
- Awesome.

310
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,019
Go ahead and make your pick.

311
00:15:49,186 --> 00:15:50,721
- I'm gonna go with you.
- Nice to meet you.

312
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:52,656
I got one of my top two picks,

313
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:54,858
which was the moss
waterfall one, so I was happy.

314
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,326
Conor.

315
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,131
- How you doing?
- Let's do this.

316
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:02,666
Frank: It's me and Megan,

317
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,168
and there's an abstract painting,

318
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:05,769
and a picture of an elevator,

319
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,603
and I'm just praying
"Do not give me the elevator."

320
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:21,585
All right, two left.

321
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:23,920
Let's see who it is.

322
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,424
- Yes.
- Megan, go ahead.

323
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,560
Hey, girl, what's up?

324
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,029
Yeah.
We're gonna have fun.

325
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:34,798
Cranky Franky's pretty much
in full force at this point.

326
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:39,369
I was obnoxiously annoyed at the fact
that I was last to pick again.

327
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:42,973
So now that you all have
your backdrops and your models,

328
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,743
you'll have six hours until the photo
shoot to complete your body paint.

329
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,579
Good luck, because
this challenge starts now.

330
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:53,884
Jessica, I'm Megan.

331
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:55,419
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

332
00:16:55,586 --> 00:16:58,355
I'm very nervous about this
project because I've never

333
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:00,724
done the body paint
on a model before.

334
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:02,459
Get your body
aligned with your hips.

335
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:05,095
Okay, knees in just a little bit.

336
00:17:05,262 --> 00:17:08,098
I'm not a fan of being
that close to naked people.

337
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,200
So, yeah.
Not my challenge.

338
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,536
Sorry, I don't really know the protocol
of working with naked models.

339
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,238
- This is a first time for me.
- It's okay. No, I do it all the time.

340
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:17,107
I want to actually
turn you into a fish.

341
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:20,911
This is gonna be interesting because I
didn't do too well on the last challenge,

342
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,080
so I really have to
show off this time.

343
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:26,683
I'm just going off of my own
imagination to make this fish lady.

344
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,388
What I'm going to start off with
is maybe something that is...

345
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:35,025
like you're holding a book,
standing a little bit to the side.

346
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:38,262
I had a definite idea of what
I want to do with the bookcase.

347
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,431
I wanted to jump at that chance
to give somebody painted clothes.

348
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:44,735
All right, I'm gonna have you
go ahead and try another pose.

349
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:47,271
Bring your head up
a little bit more.

350
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:49,273
That could be cool.

351
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,676
The actual challenge
is to create a photograph

352
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:54,878
that's going to be
shown to the judges,

353
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:57,247
so that was really important
for me to get that pose right.

354
00:17:57,414 --> 00:17:59,016
There'll be a lot of me thinking.

355
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:00,984
Maybe I'll bounce ideas
off of you or something.

356
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,320
I actually thought
this was a Venice backdrop,

357
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:06,156
and not a New Orleans,
but we're gonna do a statue anyway.

358
00:18:06,323 --> 00:18:08,025
I may not have the backdrop I want,

359
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,793
but I'm still
a competent makeup artist.

360
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,330
It's like painting by numbers.

361
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:15,499
Tate: I felt really
bad for Frank's model

362
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,834
because he seemed like a nice guy,
and he was obviously there

363
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:21,038
to help Frank achieve something, and
Frank just completely disregarded him.

364
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:24,341
My artist hasn't even introduced
himself to me. I don't know his name.

365
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:26,310
He had his back to me
the whole time.

366
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:27,878
Frank: Just having a bad day, FYI.

367
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:30,614
My name is, uh, Jeantel, by the way.

368
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,683
Yeah.

369
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,352
I'm sitting at my desk,
and I'm looking at a blank sketchpad,

370
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,154
and I have no idea what to do.

371
00:18:37,321 --> 00:18:40,056
And I'm like, "You know what?
I'm just gonna forfeit this."

372
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:49,733
Frank: Our challenge
is a body painting.

373
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,469
I'm looking at a blank sketchpad,
and I have no idea what to do.

374
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,871
And I'm, like, "You know what?
I'm just gonna forfeit this."

375
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,307
Conor: Dude...

376
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:58,742
Huh?

377
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:00,443
I don't know, I haven't decided yet.

378
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:11,688
I was talking to Conor,
and then it just clicked.

379
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:14,825
It's, like, I can't do that. I can't throw
in the towel, not on something like this.

380
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:16,526
It's...
That's not the way I am.

381
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:20,397
I have to, at least,
make it into the safe zone.

382
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:24,233
So I decide that I'm gonna just
paint him into the picture,

383
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:34,411
Everyone's doing a really great job.

384
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,412
I'm actually pretty intimidated
by what they're doing.

385
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:44,021
I'm feeling great about this. It's coming
together exactly how I envisioned.

386
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:46,390
She's gonna be the cobblestone road

387
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:48,658
beneath the base of these stairs.

388
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:52,629
This is gonna be like weeds coming
out of the cracks in the road.

389
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,799
Anthony: I'm basically gonna
camouflage this girl into the painting.

390
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:58,035
The whole thing is petrified wood.

391
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:01,571
When a forest burns down, it gets
rid of the dead weight and rebuilds,

392
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,741
so I started coming up with this
idea of her peeling off the bark.

393
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:08,145
You can actually bring it down just a
little bit so we're covering the cooch.

394
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:10,347
Cover the cooch?

395
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:12,349
Marcel:
I'm doing a living wallpaper,

396
00:20:12,516 --> 00:20:14,584
so I'm gonna blend him
completely into the picture.

397
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,753
I have painted a nude person,
but I've never done

398
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,555
where you try
and blend them into a wall.

399
00:20:18,722 --> 00:20:22,926
My model was a male,
and he played with his penis a lot.

400
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:26,730
He's constantly,
like, adjusting himself.

401
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:28,598
I was uncomfortable,
and other people noticed it to.

402
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:31,200
I was, like, "Just quit playing
with yourself, and we'll get going."

403
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:34,538
Tom: Oh, that's awesome.

404
00:20:34,705 --> 00:20:37,808
I see what you're doing.
That's awesome.

405
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:41,678
I wanted my model to have boots
because I think that, painted on,

406
00:20:41,845 --> 00:20:44,281
if you do it just right,
it can look amazing.

407
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,750
I cut out these
two little wooden blocks

408
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,185
so that she looks like
she's wearing high heels.

409
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:50,653
She can't stand on them,
but she'll have to tiptoe.

410
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:53,824
Gage: I'm turning
my model into a statue.

411
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,493
He's in a museum,
according to the backdrop.

412
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,794
What I've done is
I've gone in with wet clay,

413
00:20:57,961 --> 00:21:00,263
which is a really easy,
sculptable clay.

414
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,668
I can go in, work with it quickly,
get that texture in his hair.

415
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:08,238
I am super-focused,
but I'm looking around, of course.

416
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:09,973
Frank still hasn't really done much.

417
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,042
No, this wasn't my first choice.

418
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,377
Didn't particularly feel
like painting wieners.

419
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:16,346
Tate: Frank makes
his guy face the wall

420
00:21:16,513 --> 00:21:18,748
because he didn't want
a penis in his face.

421
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:22,085
I understand the concept, but,
you know, you have to make exceptions.

422
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:24,888
Frank: I can't figure out any
way to incorporate his hair.

423
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:27,324
Gage: Frank's telling his
model to face the wall.

424
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,559
He also put a lampshade on his head.

425
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:31,628
It lowers your model's
self-esteem a bit.

426
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,697
Frank is just...
He's done.

427
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:35,132
Yeah, if he's in the bottom,

428
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,935
I don't care who wins.
He needs to go.

429
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:40,670
It's not about the personality.

430
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:42,672
He slept through
the [bleep] bar challenge,

431
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,142
he slept through the tattoo challenge,
he slept on your bug.

432
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,377
I don't think he's used
to this kind of pressure.

433
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,546
He might be able to handle a shop,
but, I mean,

434
00:21:49,713 --> 00:21:52,148
this isn't a shop.
This is madness.

435
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,122
Well, my concept is a bronze statue.

436
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,424
I'm gonna start doing patinas

437
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,894
to make it look like he's
been out in the weather,

438
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,995
exposed to the elements
for a period of years.

439
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,836
Tate: If Sergio doesn't
get his stuff together,

440
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:15,539
this will likely be the end of him.

441
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:17,140
We're like four hours
into the competition,

442
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:19,409
and his model's still
just standing there nude.

443
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:23,647
I'm, like, you know, the same reason
our piece failed the first time,

444
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:26,249
the same reason the tattoo... his
piece failed in the tattoo challenge,

445
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,585
is exactly what's about to happen.

446
00:22:28,752 --> 00:22:32,189
I'm, like, dude, get with it.
Like, start doing more.

447
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:35,058
Time? I'm actually not very anxious.

448
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:38,227
I've done body painting before, so I'm
feeling pretty confident about this one.

449
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:53,810
How's everything working out?

450
00:22:53,977 --> 00:22:55,378
Well, look at this paint.

451
00:22:57,781 --> 00:23:01,084
I grab white paint.
I thought it was body paint.

452
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:03,420
Turns out to be acrylic paint.

453
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,789
Yeah, that's what
I realize now, after...

454
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:08,158
yeah, putting it on her.

455
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,859
I was really panicking
at that point.

456
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:11,728
I'm extremely apologetic about that,

457
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:15,232
'cause I know that it's an uncomfortable
paint to have on your body.

458
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,033
Poor Jo is, like,
really scared, I think.

459
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,069
She thought it was body paint,

460
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:21,204
but it was actually
just regular acrylic,

461
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,039
so that ends up, as it sticks,

462
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:25,074
it ends up like kind of
peeling and cracking.

463
00:23:27,778 --> 00:23:29,879
Jo: I'm thinking
that I'm gonna have to peel

464
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:33,617
every piece of this acrylic paint off
of her, and completely start over,

465
00:23:33,784 --> 00:23:36,653
and that I'm not gonna pull it
together by the end of the challenge.

466
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,188
I'm gonna be on the chopping block.

467
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:40,423
They're gonna rip me to pieces
again in front of America.

468
00:23:43,393 --> 00:23:45,195
<i>McKenzie: Coming up...</i>

469
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:48,765
I'm panicking. Do I even get
a chance to have one photo?

470
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:50,500
Glenn: A very striking image.

471
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,435
I think you should
push it much further.

472
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:54,170
You bit off more
than you could chew.

473
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:05,448
Megan: I'm looking around the room,

474
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:08,585
and I see Jo used acrylic paints,

475
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:11,821
and her fish is cracking.

476
00:24:11,988 --> 00:24:13,290
So what are you gonna try and do?

477
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:14,724
I'm gonna have to just go with it.

478
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,693
Jo: At this point,
I don't have time to turn back.

479
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,061
I have to just go with it.

480
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:20,297
I have to seal her
and hope that the sealer

481
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,998
is strong enough to hold
the acrylic paint together.

482
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,805
Anthony: It's not just the makeup.

483
00:24:28,972 --> 00:24:30,640
We're not bringing
the models on stage.

484
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:32,809
The judges are gonna see photos,

485
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,078
so it's not just what it looks like

486
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:37,913
in front of you in real life.
It's gotta read on camera.

487
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:42,952
McKenzie: That's time!

488
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:47,157
- How are you?
- How's it going?

489
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:48,758
- I'm Travis.
- Nice to meet you. Marcel.

490
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:50,393
Marcel:
Travis the photographer comes out,

491
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,796
and we each have 10 minutes
to take the pictures,

492
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:55,098
which is scary because
trying to line up someone

493
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:57,500
to match a background
can take 10 minutes alone.

494
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,836
Ah, I need white!

495
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:00,836
Just a little bit this way.

496
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:05,508
- Great.
- Let's go with our marks.

497
00:25:05,675 --> 00:25:07,110
Travis: Yeah.

498
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:09,112
You know, he's maybe
coming back from the well,

499
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,816
and he's getting this huge
sandstorm right behind him.

500
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:15,719
Your whole concept has to
come through in one shot,

501
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:19,022
so it was really important
for me to get that pose right.

502
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,657
Oops.

503
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:22,125
Did he just hit him
with a tumbleweed?

504
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,460
- That's good.
- Yeah, there you go. There you go.

505
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:24,928
Perfect.

506
00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:26,196
Yeah, keep it going, man.

507
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:27,797
Sam: I was afraid for Sergio.

508
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:31,668
When I saw his model,
I thought, "He's naked.

509
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:33,970
That is a naked man." [laughs]

510
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,805
That is a naked man with a headband,

511
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:39,642
and that was just six hours of work.

512
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:44,848
Conor: My models' having
a hard time balancing,

513
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:46,616
so I'm trying to be there for him.

514
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:49,619
I'm just thinking
get the pose right,

515
00:25:49,786 --> 00:25:51,954
and, you know, let's
get some good pictures.

516
00:25:54,824 --> 00:25:56,826
Lay down.

517
00:25:56,993 --> 00:25:58,962
Tony: I definitely
saw some strange looks

518
00:25:59,129 --> 00:26:01,531
from the other contestants
when they noticed

519
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:04,801
that I put a weed growing
from my model's rear end.

520
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:06,703
To me, in the image, it made sense.

521
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,105
I wasn't trying to be silly.

522
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:11,007
Looks really cool.

523
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:12,975
The idea is that she's
picking her bark apart.

524
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:17,180
I wanted everything
to be balanced perfectly,

525
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:19,682
because whether it's a photo,
whether it's for film,

526
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:22,017
you have to envision
your makeups as a whole.

527
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,093
Okay, good luck, man.
That was awesome.

528
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,695
Didn't need my ten minutes!

529
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:36,132
Frank was, like, "All right,
I'm done with five minutes to spare."

530
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:38,067
Then he left his model
standing there.

531
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:41,004
We were supposed to take
our models and walk with them.

532
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:42,205
Tom: He doesn't know you're done.

533
00:26:42,372 --> 00:26:44,140
... take your lampshade off.
I'm sorry, dude.

534
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:46,843
It was sad.
I felt so bad for his model.

535
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,446
Okay. Let's have you stand up there.

536
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:52,615
Megan's turn comes up,
and she has ten minutes.

537
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,617
For the first seven minutes,

538
00:26:54,784 --> 00:26:57,119
the only thing
she's doing is touch ups.

539
00:27:01,858 --> 00:27:04,861
Time is flying,
and she's still painting.

540
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,262
Megan, go.

541
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:09,098
Gage: She's not hearing us.
Something is amiss.

542
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,867
She could be eliminated for
not having a photo of her work.

543
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:15,004
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

544
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:17,874
I failed to realize

545
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:20,577
that we only have ten minutes

546
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:23,580
to do touchups and take the photos.

547
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:25,281
Two minutes, Megan.
Less.

548
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:26,449
Oh, really?

549
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:28,818
So, I was, like, "Oh, my God, no!"

550
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:33,622
I'm panicking. Do I even get
a chance to have one photo?

551
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:51,107
Welcome everybody,
to the "Face Off" reveal stage.

552
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:53,475
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

553
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,548
Say hello to our panel of judges.

554
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:00,250
Owner of Optic Nerve
makeup effects studio,

555
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:01,784
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hey, guys.

556
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:04,787
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

557
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:06,523
Welcome back, everybody.

558
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,193
Creature designer and director
Patrick Tatopoulus.

559
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,361
Good to see you again, guys.

560
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:13,062
- Okay, Patrick.
- Good to see you.

561
00:28:13,229 --> 00:28:15,064
And this week, special guest judge

562
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:17,734
renowned body painter Filippo Ioco.

563
00:28:17,901 --> 00:28:19,702
- Hi there, guys.
- Hey.

564
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,204
This week, your Spotlight Challenge

565
00:28:21,371 --> 00:28:23,406
was to do a head
to toe body painting

566
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:25,842
on a nude model
for a magazine cover.

567
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,743
So let's get started.

568
00:28:32,515 --> 00:28:34,250
Tate: My whole strategy
in this was to show

569
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:37,086
how much I can do
in a little amount of time,

570
00:28:37,253 --> 00:28:38,655
and I painted the [bleep]
out of that girl.

571
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:40,924
I put leaves, flowers,
butterflies, and rocks.

572
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:42,758
That's my golden ticket.

573
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,936
Jo: They can say, "Your execution

574
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:55,538
was horrible,
you used acrylic paint."

575
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:58,708
You know, I'm hoping that they just say,
"You may leave."

576
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,610
I do not want to be
on that middle circle.

577
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,323
Frank: I wasn't super-duper
impressed with my shot.

578
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,824
My lampshade wasn't
anything special,

579
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:17,526
but if it was
an IKEA catalog, maybe.

580
00:29:27,604 --> 00:29:29,205
Tom: I was
very impressed with my photo

581
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:31,975
because it looked exactly to
me how it looked in person.

582
00:29:32,142 --> 00:29:34,444
It came out how I envisioned it,

583
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:37,079
and it represents me as an artist.

584
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:48,391
Sergio: I think it definitely
represents what I was going for.

585
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,627
I'm still just worried
about whether or not

586
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:53,395
the judges will know
how much work went into it.

587
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:06,609
Gage: I'm feeling really good.
I'm, like, see that, judges?

588
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:08,411
I can do it.
I can do it all.

589
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,946
'Cause I really
wanted to prove myself.

590
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,525
Marcel:
I felt like if I'd had more time

591
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:24,761
to, like, really line him up perfect,
it could've been better.

592
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:26,362
But for what it was
and the time I had,

593
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,565
I feel like it turned out
really, really well.

594
00:30:29,732 --> 00:30:31,901
Tate: Marcel's,
the color match is impeccable.

595
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:34,203
So he blew me away.

596
00:30:41,077 --> 00:30:44,547
Sam: When the challenge is done,
I'm able to finally

597
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:47,483
step back a little bit,
and I'm just blown away.

598
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,185
I think I did a great job on it.

599
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,698
Conor: I was satisfied.
He's chiseled,

600
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:05,434
he's a perfect bronze statue.
I'm now thinking I'm safe.

601
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:21,084
Anthony:
I look at the picture, I'm just like,

602
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:23,920
"I don't know, Anthony, maybe you're
not too sure of yourself anymore."

603
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:27,090
And good, 'cause if
I get a little too cocky,

604
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:29,758
then I'm just as bad as Frank.

605
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:42,105
Megan: I love my work,
but I'm my harshest critic.

606
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:45,908
I felt that it could
have been better.

607
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,919
McKenzie:
The judges have scored your final shots.

608
00:31:57,086 --> 00:32:00,556
Sam...

609
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:02,759
Gage...

610
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:05,027
Megan...

611
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:07,997
Marcel...
and Frank.

612
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:10,133
Frank: Standing up there, whether
you're on the chopping block or not,

613
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,369
man, is it a lot of stress.

614
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:16,706
You're all safe.
Congratulations.

615
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:19,074
Please, head back
to the makeup room.

616
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,580
Frank: Can I just say,
thanks sweet baby [bleep]?

617
00:32:24,747 --> 00:32:26,715
I know, I was surprised
at you, Frank.

618
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:35,124
The rest of you were the best
and the worst of the week.

619
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,893
Now, the judges would like to
have a word with each of you

620
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,427
to learn more about your work.

621
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:41,230
Jo, please step forward.

622
00:32:41,397 --> 00:32:43,332
There's so many things
that they could say.

623
00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:47,603
"No, no, that's not right.
Your execution was horrible"

624
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,871
There's many things that
they could eat me alive with.

625
00:32:56,612 --> 00:32:59,448
Jo, please step forward.

626
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:01,551
I have no idea what
they're gonna think of it,

627
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,452
if they're thinking
it's too childish,

628
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,888
if they don't think that
my skills are up to par.

629
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:08,391
There's many things that
they can eat me alive with.

630
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,293
Is this the first time
that you've body painted?

631
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:14,831
Oh, yeah?

632
00:33:14,998 --> 00:33:17,632
It's the third time I've ever really
picked up an airbrush in my life.

633
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:23,673
Well, I would like to congratulate
you on a terrific job.

634
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,642
- Thank you.
- Because I love, love all the detail.

635
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:29,512
The imagination
that you put into it,

636
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,083
you accentuated her body,
you brought her beautiful features out.

637
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,351
Glenn: I think you did a great job.

638
00:33:35,518 --> 00:33:38,287
Very striking image all together.

639
00:33:38,454 --> 00:33:41,257
- It's bold. I really, really like it.
- Thank you.

640
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:43,726
I love the fact that
you painted her entire body.

641
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:47,163
Your paint scheme is gorgeous.

642
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,032
It's beautiful.
Congratulations.

643
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:52,735
- It's awesome.
- Thank you.

644
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:55,037
I can see in this image
that it was very thought out.

645
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:57,306
I couldn't be happier
because it looks like

646
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,809
what we talked about last week is
reflected on your work this week.

647
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:02,011
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

648
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:03,646
I feel good about what I've done,

649
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:06,114
and I do feel redeemed
after the first challenge.

650
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:10,553
[whispers] Thank you.

651
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,455
All right, Tate. You're up next.
Please come forward.

652
00:34:16,692 --> 00:34:18,027
Hi, everybody.

653
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:22,231
Unfortunately, Tate,
this did not go well for you.

654
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,102
As an image, it's just
sort of too monotone.

655
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:27,937
I think you could have
succeeded by bringing

656
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:30,373
those lighter colors in,
and punching up the contrast.

657
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,776
I do agree. I had some trouble
with some of the colors.

658
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:35,378
I couldn't get
the vibrancy that I wanted.

659
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:37,413
Regardless, I do agree.

660
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,315
Well, great. That's good
that you know what went wrong.

661
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:43,119
- Absolutely.
- The picture has this big detail,

662
00:34:43,286 --> 00:34:45,521
and you did a whole
bunch of small detail.

663
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:49,058
If your detail would have been
the same size as the backdrop,

664
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:51,560
I think it would have
looked really cool.

665
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:53,362
You bit off more
than you could chew.

666
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:55,731
Okay, I appreciate your criticisms.

667
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:58,166
Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

668
00:35:03,573 --> 00:35:06,041
Sergio, please come forward.

669
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:12,481
Okay, what is your
concept here, Sergio?

670
00:35:12,648 --> 00:35:16,085
I looked at all the backgrounds,
and I saw this big tornado,

671
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:18,487
and so I got an image
real quick about somebody

672
00:35:18,654 --> 00:35:21,123
from a very indigenous area in like
South Africa or something like that,

673
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,491
to get some food for his family.

674
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:24,427
Uh-huh.

675
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:28,464
Boy, that's a long story
for a very short makeup.

676
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:32,535
I don't really see all that much
on him except for some white paint

677
00:35:32,702 --> 00:35:34,670
and a little bit of jewelry
that you've painted on him.

678
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:36,639
What did you do with your six hours?

679
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,040
Well, he was a lot
lighter, actually.

680
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:40,142
I mixed up three different shades

681
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,011
of darker skin tone
so I could darken him up a lot.

682
00:35:42,178 --> 00:35:44,714
Anybody can do
body makeup like that.

683
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,016
You could have done so much more.

684
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:48,551
You should have spent your time

685
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:51,287
developing that jewelry
that you painted on him.

686
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:54,890
Your not making really
good choices, Sergio.

687
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:58,394
I do like the image,
maybe more than most of us here.

688
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:01,664
I think the tones are very warm,
there's a great intensity,

689
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:03,799
the character's amazing,

690
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:05,701
but you didn't challenge yourself.

691
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:08,471
I think you should
push it much further.

692
00:36:08,638 --> 00:36:10,272
Glenn: I have to agree
with everyone else.

693
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,008
I'm not happy with
this piece of work.

694
00:36:12,175 --> 00:36:16,245
I think that because of
your decision making, it's a failure.

695
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:18,381
I really appreciate all your input.

696
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:20,415
Thank you, guys.

697
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:25,887
McKenzie:
Anthony, please take a step forward.

698
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:30,559
Ve Neill: Can I just say one thing?

699
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:32,661
This was awesome.

700
00:36:32,828 --> 00:36:35,197
- Thank you.
- If you hadn't have had those open spaces,

701
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:37,333
I think it would have
been very difficult

702
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,635
to pick out where your person was.

703
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:42,304
It's like she ripped a piece of
her body off, and is screaming.

704
00:36:42,471 --> 00:36:44,473
I just really love it.

705
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,076
Coming from you, that is an honor.
Thank you.

706
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,011
When I first look at the image,

707
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:51,347
I loved the orange as being
such a strong statement.

708
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:53,416
It looks like the rocks
are getting lighter

709
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:55,985
as they come to her body,
so you bring all the attention

710
00:36:56,152 --> 00:36:59,355
to that center orange spot.
It's very, very powerful.

711
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:02,091
I gotta give you a lot of
credit for making this decision

712
00:37:02,258 --> 00:37:05,995
and sticking with it, because it is
difficult, and if it didn't work out,

713
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:07,496
it would have really not worked out.

714
00:37:07,663 --> 00:37:09,698
It would have just been
someone with gray paint

715
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:11,700
standing in front of a rock.
Congratulations.

716
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:14,035
Thank you, sir.
Thank you again.

717
00:37:16,038 --> 00:37:18,473
Tom, please take a step forward.

718
00:37:23,546 --> 00:37:26,982
I really like this.
Very, very cool, very well done,

719
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:31,020
and you're demonstrating
proficient skill with the airbrush.

720
00:37:31,187 --> 00:37:33,355
There's a lot of different techniques,
and I see all the things

721
00:37:33,522 --> 00:37:35,224
that went into it and
it's pretty impressive.

722
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:36,759
Thank you.

723
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:39,295
I think this is terrific.
I just love it.

724
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:42,565
And I love the way that you turned
her hair into the little weed patch.

725
00:37:42,732 --> 00:37:46,168
The other weed patch...

726
00:37:46,335 --> 00:37:48,204
Well, we all know
that's her derriere,

727
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:51,474
so I think maybe you could have
chosen to move it over just a smidge.

728
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,676
Other than that,
I think it's just a beautiful job.

729
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:55,611
Very well done, Tom.

730
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:58,981
Love this image that you created.

731
00:37:59,148 --> 00:38:02,084
What I liked the most
about this image

732
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:04,553
is that it's so inviting

733
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,323
that you actually
want to walk into it,

734
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,325
and I really like that a lot.
Congratulations.

735
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:10,525
Thank you so much.

736
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:14,263
[whispering] Thank you, thank you.

737
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,365
Conor, you're up next.

738
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:18,934
I don't know where I stand now.
I don't know if I'm safe.

739
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:21,003
Nothing's making sense to me.

740
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,404
McKenzie: Patrick,
why don't you start us off on this one?

741
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:25,407
I do like the clever idea
of the bird dropping,

742
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:27,576
I think this is very
cool, the concept.

743
00:38:27,743 --> 00:38:29,745
I'm not a big fan of the makeup
or the way it was shot.

744
00:38:29,912 --> 00:38:31,747
I'm not seeing the bronze in there,

745
00:38:31,914 --> 00:38:35,084
I'm seeing a naked man with
dirty patches on his body.

746
00:38:35,251 --> 00:38:36,618
I was disappointed.

747
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,755
Filippo:
He should be more weathered.

748
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:42,725
When there's a bronze
statue or a copper statue,

749
00:38:42,892 --> 00:38:46,495
if it's out in the elements,
it starts to patina,

750
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:48,898
get all the green and the blue,

751
00:38:49,065 --> 00:38:52,034
and I think it's
really missing that.

752
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:54,269
Okay.
Thank you.

753
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:02,311
All right, judges.
Who's the winner of this challenge?

754
00:39:02,478 --> 00:39:05,080
Well, Anthony's work this
week was really fantastic.

755
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:07,249
Tom's work is very comprehensive.

756
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:08,951
And Jo, I think that
you really showed us

757
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:11,687
some skills, and could fight back.

758
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:14,156
All right, Glenn.
Who is our winner?

759
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:16,991
This week, our winner is...

760
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,798
Anthony.

761
00:39:22,965 --> 00:39:24,266
- Congratulations. You deserve it, man.
- Thank you, guys.

762
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:26,335
Thank you so much.

763
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:28,871
McKenzie: Congratulations, Anthony.

764
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:31,173
Anthony: That was one of
the most happiest moments of my life.

765
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,343
I'm ready to cry. It was...
Honestly, that right there

766
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,512
was better than winning
any Academy Award.

767
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:39,682
- Anthony, congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

768
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:42,218
Please step forward, because you
have earned the right to consult

769
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:45,221
with the judges now as to who you
feel should be eliminated this week.

770
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:49,190
Everybody else, if you could please
head back to the makeup room.

771
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:56,599
Well, Anthony, out of Tate...

772
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:58,534
Sergio...

773
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:01,070
or Conor...

774
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:03,806
who do you think
should go home this week?

775
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:05,708
Oh...

776
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,744
I really have a hard time
making that decision 'cause...

777
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:10,746
- Understandably so. Yeah.
- It's...

778
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:14,650
I would like to go up against
Tate and Conor in sculpting

779
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:16,752
and see where we stand there.

780
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:18,621
That would make me
feel better as an artist,

781
00:40:18,788 --> 00:40:21,223
not just taking the easy way out
and getting rid of the best man.

782
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,792
- Mm-hmm.
- So I'd have to say Sergio.

783
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,995
Okay.

784
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:28,897
Before you leave,
Filippo has been kind enough

785
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:32,935
to bring in a signed, limited edition
copy of one of his body paintings.

786
00:40:33,102 --> 00:40:34,803
Oh, my God.

787
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,338
- Oh, my God.
- There you go.

788
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:40,042
Thank you so much.
Thank you again, sir.

789
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:42,878
Thank you so much. If you would
please head back to the makeup room.

790
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:44,679
Thank you.

791
00:40:46,248 --> 00:40:47,816
All right, judges,
let's get started on this.

792
00:40:47,983 --> 00:40:49,585
What are your thoughts on Sergio?

793
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:52,855
I really think that Sergio lacked

794
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:54,957
use of imagination on this photo.

795
00:40:55,124 --> 00:40:57,526
He could have used
the six hours of painting

796
00:40:57,693 --> 00:41:01,030
a better way than
just making somebody

797
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,932
dark skinned, you know, darker.

798
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:07,603
I'm underwhelmed by
Sergio's performance again.

799
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,872
He needs to work on his skills more.

800
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,307
What are your thoughts on Conor?

801
00:41:11,474 --> 00:41:13,208
With the coloring,
it just got muddy.

802
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:15,944
Whatever it was he was trying to do, got
lost. He didn't have enough contrast.

803
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:17,313
He over painted, basically.

804
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,348
I would have been a lot happier

805
00:41:19,515 --> 00:41:21,483
if he would have told me
that he wasn't happy with it,

806
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,986
- and that the colors just got away from him.
- Yeah, you're right.

807
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:25,521
And what are your thoughts on Tate?

808
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:27,690
I see where Tate was going with it,

809
00:41:27,857 --> 00:41:30,459
but I think he kind of...
It didn't happen for him.

810
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,828
This image looks like
he got cornered into

811
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:35,397
this stomach piece
and forgot the big picture.

812
00:41:35,564 --> 00:41:37,599
All right, judges.
Have you come to a decision?

813
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:38,500
- Yes.
- We did.

814
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:39,634
Yes, we did.

815
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,351
All right, judges.
Who is going home tonight?

816
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:11,734
All right, guys.
The judges have made their decision.

817
00:42:11,901 --> 00:42:14,136
Well, Tate, I think
it got lost on you.

818
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:16,171
I think you concentrated
on the details

819
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:18,306
without stepping back and taking
a look at the whole thing.

820
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:23,178
Serge, with the time that you had,

821
00:42:23,345 --> 00:42:26,482
we don't feel like
you did very much.

822
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:30,219
Conor, as you know,
we felt that the colors were very muddy,

823
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:34,789
and I don't feel like you
expressed your idea very well.

824
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:45,600
All right, judges.
Who is going home tonight?

825
00:42:47,603 --> 00:42:51,039
The person that's
going home tonight is...

826
00:42:57,212 --> 00:42:58,913
Sergio.

827
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,651
Thanks a lot.

828
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:04,253
Honor being with you guys.

829
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,155
Thank you.

830
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:07,656
If I may, I just want
to say thank you, guys,

831
00:43:07,823 --> 00:43:09,992
very much for your input.

832
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,461
I definitely enjoyed
this whole process and all

833
00:43:12,628 --> 00:43:14,730
but this isn't a school.
You know, it's a competition.

834
00:43:14,897 --> 00:43:17,032
Group hug.

835
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,033
Bye-bye, man.

836
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,568
It's been a pleasure.

837
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:22,104
