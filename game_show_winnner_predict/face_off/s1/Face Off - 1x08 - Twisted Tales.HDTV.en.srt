00:00:00,654 --> 00:00:03,356
Welcome to the season finale of "Face
Off".

2
00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:06,392
12 talented special effects makeup artists

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,101
came to Los Angeles to compete
to join the world's elite.

4
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:11,919
Your time starts now.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,896
You can't play it safe.

6
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:14,156
They made it really clear.

7
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:15,917
Time after time,

8
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:18,877
they showcased their tremendous
skill and creativity.

9
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:20,422
- It's genius.
- I'm blown away.

10
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:21,854
It's a stunning makeup.

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,609
And it didn't take long

12
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:25,534
for the pressure to take its toll.

13
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:27,046
You want to do details? Do details.

14
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:30,146
I don't want to lose to
the guy who's trying to get laid.

15
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,658
Every time I hear her laugh,

16
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:33,503
I want to punch someone in the face.

17
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:35,221
But challenge after challenge...

18
00:00:35,288 --> 00:00:36,489
It will be down to the second.

19
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:38,276
Their numbers dwindle.

20
00:00:38,277 --> 00:00:39,803
The person going home tonight is...

21
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:40,760
Jessica... Sergio...

22
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:41,761
Frank... Marcel...

23
00:00:41,828 --> 00:00:42,795
Jo... Anthony...

24
00:00:42,863 --> 00:00:44,664
Tom... Megan.

25
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:47,400
Now four have risen above the rest.

26
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:51,170
Your final challenge is to
reinvent two characters

27
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:52,872
from a classic fairy tale.

28
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:55,241
This is a ridiculous amount of work to do.

29
00:00:55,308 --> 00:00:57,076
It's nearly impossible.

30
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,844
They'll have to dig
deeper than ever before.

31
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:00,880
I'm ready to win this $100,000.

32
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,715
I basically just lost the competition.

33
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:04,150
I'm freaking out.

34
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:05,618
I am not sure we're getting this done.

35
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,353
But to win it all,

36
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:08,421
they'll have to blow away our judges

37
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:09,955
one last time.

38
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:12,258
Ve Neill, legendary makeup artist,

39
00:01:12,325 --> 00:01:14,727
whose work includes "Edward Scissorhands",

40
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:17,997
"Beetlejuice", and the "Pirates
of the Caribbean" films;

41
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:21,400
Glenn Hetrick, cutting-edge makeup
effects artist on "Heroes",

44
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:28,641
for "Independence Day", "Godzilla",

45
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:31,677
and director of "Underworld:
Rise of the Lycans".

46
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:33,979
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic

47
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:35,815
and earn $100,000 dollars

48
00:01:35,882 --> 00:01:37,616
and a year's worth of makeup from alcone?

49
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:40,586
One of you is our champion.

50
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:43,789
Find out who claims victory
tonight on "Face Off".

52
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,301
It's still setting, like,

53
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,137
"Wow, we're the final four."

54
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:33,105
And this final challenge
is going to be amazing.

55
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,207
They've thrown everything at us.

56
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:38,344
Growing up was really
interesting, to say the least.

57
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,379
My stepfather was a mechanic

58
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:42,381
and my family lived in a trailer

59
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,884
that was in the middle of a junkyard.

60
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:47,553
So being a winner could really
help me and my family out.

61
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:49,722
I'm determined to make that happen.

62
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,091
This next challenge will define each of us

63
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,193
individually, artistically.

64
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,895
My girlfriend, she's everything to me.

65
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,663
And we both really want kids,

66
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,431
so if I win this competition,
we'll buy a crib.

67
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,100
We'll see what happens.

68
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:04,170
I've been in the middle the entire time.

69
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:06,172
Always on the safe, you know?

70
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,207
It's like, "I didn't really
come here to be safe."

71
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,208
Yeah.

72
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:10,509
I've made it this far.

73
00:03:10,577 --> 00:03:12,278
I've got this chance to win the prize.

74
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:14,680
I know the judges have high
expectations of me now

75
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:15,881
and they're hoping to see me

76
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,516
show them something amazing.

77
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:20,753
The judges kp harping on me about concept.

78
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:23,422
I know that the one thing
I have to prove to the judges

79
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,057
is that I can think out of the box.

80
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,127
They want to see Tate-level...

81
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,696
- wackiness?
- Yeah.

82
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:32,731
I'm going to do everything
I can to win this hundred grand.

83
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,668
This isn't, "Oh, I'm just
trying this out

84
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:37,670
to see what I can make
in this competition."

85
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:39,071
I'm here to win.

86
00:03:44,778 --> 00:03:47,613
We're going in to be introduced
to our final challenge.

87
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,215
It's really nerve-wracking.

88
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,449
It kind of feels like you want to vomit

89
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:51,417
and you're happy about it.

90
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:53,586
So it's weird.

91
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:55,287
Hey, guys.

92
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:56,789
- Hi.
- McKenzie.

93
00:03:56,857 --> 00:03:58,257
Well, you should be feeling
pretty good with yourselves

94
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:00,593
because you are the final four.

95
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,028
The only thing that is
standing in between you

96
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:07,864
and $100,000 is your final
spotlight challenge.

97
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,937
Your final challenge is to reinvent

98
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:16,942
two characters from a classic fairy tale.

99
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,744
The judges have very high expectations,

100
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:21,046
so do not hold back.

101
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:22,648
I'm thinking, okay, this is great.

102
00:04:22,716 --> 00:04:25,117
I have to show my creativity

103
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:27,186
and my ability to conceptualize

104
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,654
if I'm going to impress the judges.

105
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:33,959
These fairy tales are
"Little red riding hood",

106
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:36,128
"The frog prince", "Hansel and Gretel",

107
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:39,298
"Sleeping beauty", and
"The little mermaid".

108
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:42,067
As usual, it's not quite that simple

109
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:44,036
because there's a twist.

110
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:45,506
You will also be choosing

111
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:47,806
a theme to go along with your fairy tale.

112
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:52,244
Your themes are post-apocalyptic,

113
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:53,979
haunted, industrial,

114
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:55,915
psychedelic, and outer space.

115
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:01,086
And finally, you will be working
with our production designer

116
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:03,088
to create a complete background

117
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:05,157
where you will pose your characters,

118
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:07,126
essentially creating a living work of art.

119
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:08,827
Cool.

120
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,096
And three days from now
your tableaus will be on display

121
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:13,098
during an exclusive cocktail party

122
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,733
at the "Face Off" reveal stage.

123
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:17,336
You'll be judged on creativity, technique,

124
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,853
and the final presentation

125
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:21,140
of your characters and background scenes.

126
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:25,511
This is a ridiculous amount of work

127
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:27,646
to do in the time that we've been given.

128
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,615
People have no idea how long it takes

129
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:31,116
to get stuff done in the effects world.

130
00:05:31,184 --> 00:05:32,584
This is "Mission: Impossible".

131
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:36,755
It is time to pick your fairy
tales and your themes.

132
00:05:36,823 --> 00:05:39,873
Sam, as the winner of last
week's spotlight challenge,

133
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,463
you will get to choose first.

134
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:43,807
Ooh. All right.

135
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:46,881
This one.

136
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:49,101
So it looks like you picked
"The little mermaid".

137
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:52,137
And I think I'm going to
have to go with psychedelic.

138
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,006
I picked psychedelic because I feel

139
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:57,042
that psychedelic colors and
aquatic creatures go together.

140
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,993
All right, guys, I will be
choosing you in random order.

141
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:04,088
- Tate.
- Yes!

142
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,384
Thank you, McKenzie.

143
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,919
The last thing I want is
outer space "Sleeping Beauty".

144
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,721
So I'm really excited.

145
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:13,092
"Little red riding hood".
And post-apocalyptic.

146
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:14,793
I'm already putting together a vision

147
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:17,129
for post-apocalyptic
"Little red riding hood".

148
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:18,738
Getting the opportunity to

149
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:21,467
pick that for the finals
is a dream come true.

150
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:23,135
- Yay!
- Gage.

151
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:24,737
I had my sights set on "hansel and gretel".

152
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:27,239
But unfortunately Tate
took post-apocalyptic,

153
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:29,742
which was what I really wanted.

154
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:31,477
You have industrial "Hansel and Gretel".

155
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:32,945
- Yeah.
- All right.

156
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:34,646
Who's next?

157
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:36,515
My first choice was
"Little red riding hood",

158
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,816
but Tate got it.

159
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:39,451
And he got the post-apocalyptic theme,

160
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,053
which I also wanted.

161
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:44,256
- I'll go "Frog Prince".
- Oh, okay.

162
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:45,758
But I knew a little bit

163
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,826
about "the Frog Prince" fairy tale.

164
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:49,828
I knew there was a lot of potential there.

165
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:50,963
I'm going to go with haunted.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,014
Remember, this is for $100,000.

167
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,306
Clock starts now.

168
00:07:04,444 --> 00:07:05,477
I know how much I have to do.

169
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:06,712
I'm not even thinking

170
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,981
of whether or not I can
actually get it done.

171
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:10,215
All I know is that I have to.

172
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:13,485
It's the final challenge.

173
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:16,288
I want to prove that I can, as an artist,

174
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:18,023
bring something interesting and intricate.

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,860
The first step to creating a prosthetic

176
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:24,897
is coming up with a design.

177
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:26,632
I'm not going to start
trying to sculpt today.

178
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,101
I want to really get my characters down,

179
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:31,904
knowing that they're looking
at the whole picture.

180
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:33,272
So what are you thinking of, Gage?

181
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,007
I have a scene in my head
that I really, really love.

182
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,643
I want to convey something
evil and something innocent,

183
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,478
because these kids are kidnapped by a witch

184
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,080
and they're being fed to be eaten.

185
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:43,248
They're not supposed to
be happy about that.

186
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:45,651
I think I'm doing the scene
in "The little mermaid"

187
00:07:45,718 --> 00:07:48,987
where her fin is splitting
apart into human legs.

188
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:50,273
I'm going to have her

189
00:07:50,274 --> 00:07:52,825
pinky toe with long
spires coming off of it,

190
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:54,760
and then her legs will
be together as a fin.

191
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:56,261
- That's great.
- Yeah.

192
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:59,098
But I'm trying to figure out the witch.

193
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:02,000
I see this band of renegade warrioresses

194
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:03,769
called the crimson cloaks,

195
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:08,207
and basically a world overrun
with werewolves everywhere.

196
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:09,890
These women band together

197
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,478
and they have to fight the big bad wolf.

198
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:14,246
So I'm makina werewolf.

199
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:16,648
I'm doing simple character
stuff on the female,

200
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:18,584
mostly wardrobe and scars

201
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,053
and maybe making her arm the gun.

202
00:08:22,989 --> 00:08:24,756
The next in creating a prosthetic

203
00:08:24,824 --> 00:08:27,693
is sculpting Clay on the
cast of the model's face.

204
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,263
There is this passage
where the frog describes

205
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:34,099
how he was turned into a frog by this witch

206
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,334
and he used to be a prince.

207
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,768
So at that point it struck me

208
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:39,071
that could be my scene right there,

209
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:42,774
where the witch is actually
transforming the prince into a frog.

210
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,477
And that can be painful and horrific

211
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:46,845
and that fits my haunted theme.

212
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:50,883
- Hi, Sam.
- Hello, how are you?

213
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,618
I'm good. Pretty colors.

214
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:56,288
Thank you. Well, I have the
psychedelic little mermaid.

215
00:08:56,356 --> 00:08:58,957
So things are going to be really splashy.

216
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:01,147
What I'm hoping for for the background

217
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:05,984
is a stylized coral reef...
everything brightly colored.

218
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,167
Think of the psychedelic swirls.

219
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:10,002
What kind of props?

220
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:12,171
She's reclining on something
that's either a clam,

221
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:15,207
if you can find a clam shell, or a rock.

222
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:20,379
I've got a crazy world for you.

223
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:22,581
I want to set up a battle scene

224
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,284
where my red riding hood is
facing off with the werewolf.

225
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:28,086
I'd like to see an industrial cityscape,

226
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:30,589
but the land is icy and rigid.

227
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,358
Lots of blues. I'd like it to be nighttime.

228
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:36,428
For the backdrop, what I
thought would be cool

229
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,830
would be this candy shop.

230
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:41,567
I wanted to use a lot of bright
colors for some of the stuff

231
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,068
because it would contrast perfectly

232
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:44,503
with the fact that it's all faded

233
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:46,505
and torn down and dilapidated.

234
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:49,908
So even though they're bright
colors, they can be faded.

235
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:53,412
I'm picturing the scene in which the prince

236
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,414
has the encounter with this witch.

237
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,749
It is probably outside the castle.

238
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:01,486
So maybe woodsy foreground,
castle in the background.

239
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:03,522
Vines would be great.

240
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,077
I want the whole mood to be
as frightening as possible.

241
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:12,631
All right, that's time.

242
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:13,632
Time to go, y'all.

243
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,044
I'm freaking out because we have three days

244
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,714
to design, fabricate, and
execute this makeup.

245
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,015
That's not a lot of time.

246
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,350
Not enough at all.

247
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,289
There's a lot of stuff
going through my head.

248
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:38,857
Then, of course, I'm also thinking,

249
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,592
"this is exactly the type of competition

250
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,661
that Tate could kick my ass in."

251
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:44,830
I always bite off more than I can chew,

252
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:46,098
but I will get it done.

253
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,466
I will make a werewolf in three days.

254
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,671
- Hey, guys.
- Uh-oh.

255
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:53,939
Please come gather around.

256
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,141
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

257
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:58,277
Here comes McKenzie.

258
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:01,413
Everybody knows that when we start
to hear those heels clicking,

259
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:04,358
that means she's going to
throw some kind of twist in

260
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,121
and we brace ourselves.

261
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,454
Here comes McKenzie.

262
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:18,381
Everybody knows she's going to
throw some kind of twist in

263
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:20,583
and we brace ourselves.

264
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:26,356
Yesterday you were given an
extremely difficult challenge.

265
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:28,491
It really is a lot for
one person to handle,

266
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,562
so I've brought help for you.

267
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,530
Guys, would you please come in?

268
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:38,534
- Wow!
- Oh, my God.

269
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:42,906
That's insanity!

270
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:45,391
It's overwhelming, the fact that,

271
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:47,810
suddenly, everybody's back again.

272
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:48,845
What's up, guys?

273
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:52,181
Oh.

274
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:53,616
Awesome.

275
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,919
So some of the biggest
names in makeup effects

276
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,320
are not only great artists,

277
00:11:57,388 --> 00:11:59,822
but they also know how to lead a team.

278
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,992
So each of you will choose two
of your former competitors

279
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,728
to help you with your final challenge.

280
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:06,896
There are people that I like.

281
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:08,665
There are people that I don't like.

282
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,366
I know right away who I want to pick.

283
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:13,536
I will draw your names to
determine the selection order.

284
00:12:13,604 --> 00:12:15,672
You'll each pick one person,

285
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,607
and then we'll go back
around and do it again.

286
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,108
Let's get to this.

287
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:24,347
- First name... Tate.
- Tom.

288
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:25,648
What's up, man?

289
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,750
Welcome back.

290
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,887
- Gage.
- Marcel, obviously.

291
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:32,522
I am really excited to help Gage.

292
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:33,923
I was like, "let's do this."

293
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:36,359
- Sam.
- Jo.

294
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,761
- Hello!
- Come on down, roomie.

295
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,365
- Conor.
- Frank.

296
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:46,102
Megan's my buddy, but this
is the final competition.

297
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,271
Regardless of all the
chaos he likes to cause,

298
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,139
Frank's an experienced technician.

299
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,608
Okay, you're second choice. Tate?

300
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:53,776
Anthony.

301
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,044
I'm happy with my team

302
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:56,279
because we're all indie artists,

303
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:58,047
and he have a huge task in front of us

304
00:12:58,115 --> 00:12:59,282
that I don't think a lot of shop people

305
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,516
would even consider possible.

306
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:02,652
- Gage.
- I want Jessica.

307
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,354
- Yay!
- Sam.

308
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:08,558
Um, I'm going to go for Megan.

309
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,728
I was concerned about
picking both jo and Megan,

310
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:14,330
but I really believe that the both of them

311
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:16,065
are professional enough that they can

312
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,267
take their differences and put them aside.

313
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:21,070
I wasn't jumping for joy
when Megan got picked

314
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:23,673
because I knew that I would
have to pick up the slack.

315
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:25,842
And, Sergio, go ahead to Conor.

316
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,011
How's it going?

317
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:29,445
I have my concerns about Sergio

318
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:32,248
just because of his overall
lack of experience.

319
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,517
But I think he also wants
a little redemption.

320
00:13:34,585 --> 00:13:36,386
Now, your former castmates
are here to help you.

321
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,756
How you choose to use them
is up to you, so good luck.

322
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:45,161
I wanted you because you paint faces a lot.

323
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:46,863
Yeah.

324
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,264
I know for a fact you can
do the eyes on her cheeks

325
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,733
with the tears coming
down really, really well.

326
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,268
I'm so happy to have
another shot to be back.

327
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:54,237
At least I can show people I
have so much more potential

328
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:55,738
that nobody got to see.

329
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:57,807
So basically it's the
little red riding hoods

330
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,475
versus the big bad wolves.

331
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,144
First thing I want to do

332
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:02,445
is delegate out the
sculpting responsibilities.

333
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:03,846
I'm going to get on the head.

334
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:06,949
I know tom has these great
chests that he makes.

335
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:09,452
And Anthony I've got on sculpting the legs.

336
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:15,158
I would love to have her molded

337
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:18,294
and probably the legs
molded by the end of today.

338
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:19,896
I picked jo because she did very well

339
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:21,397
in the body-painting challenge

340
00:14:21,465 --> 00:14:22,999
and I knew that my particular design

341
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,767
was going to take a lot of painting.

342
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:25,978
Megan kind of bounced

343
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:28,538
between whatever it was
I was directing her at.

344
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:31,074
The witch I'm not addressing yet,

345
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:33,509
but it's just going to be a
face appliance and fingernails.

346
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:34,710
And we're going to make a scepter.

347
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:37,380
So want don't we start
with casting your arm?

348
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:40,883
Sergio, start sculpting a right frog foot.

349
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:48,458
Okay, how's this looking for you, dude?

350
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:49,992
Good.

351
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,360
I'm looking around the room.

352
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:53,062
I see some of the work that Gage is doing

353
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,098
with his project that's orinal.

354
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:56,499
I haven't seen anything like it before.

355
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:01,737
Sam's characters, I'm not
sure what I'm seeing.

356
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:03,072
I don't want her to look
like she's got a beard.

357
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,674
Okay.

358
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:08,344
Tate's trying to do this
full body werewolf suit,

359
00:15:08,412 --> 00:15:10,513
so I think he's a bit stressed out.

360
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:11,848
There's supposed to be some sort

361
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:14,684
of big cocktail party associated with this.

362
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,953
So there's no telling what else is coming.

363
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,726
- Heya.
- Hey, what's happening?

364
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,628
Patrick walks in, and the
thing that I'm hoping

365
00:15:25,696 --> 00:15:28,431
is that I haven't done something
that seems typical to him,

366
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:32,869
because Patrick invented a lot
of really cool werewolves.

367
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:34,570
We're doing arm extensions, legs.

368
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:36,606
We've got a chest.
We're doing spring action jaw.

369
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:38,374
Right. And you have a tail.

370
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:39,642
Werewolves usually don't have any.

371
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,877
It's kind of nice to see it.

372
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:42,545
It's very different. Very impressive.

373
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:44,881
Really likes the design, the sculpt,

374
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:46,215
he likes everything he's seeing.

375
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,483
So I'm feeling really good about it.

376
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:49,418
He's going to have a frog left hand,

377
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,154
but with a human finger,

378
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:54,490
and his right leg from the
knee down will be frog.

379
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:57,827
The witch is going to have a
scepter with leds in it and stuff.

380
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,228
- Wow.
- That's your prop.

381
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:01,531
I haven't done any props up until now.

382
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:03,499
- This is a new Conor.
- Just add to it. I know!

383
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,501
Patrick is the big creature designer.

384
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:08,538
If anyone needs to be impressed
when it comes to creatures,

385
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:10,139
it's him.

386
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,441
My two characters are the witch and gretel.

387
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:15,044
All the classic witches
have this witchy nose.

388
00:16:15,112 --> 00:16:17,647
And I want her jawbones to be
dislocated and hanging down.

389
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:19,115
McKenzie oh, so that's
her jawbone up there.

390
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:21,250
And gretel is sitting like this

391
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,188
and her mouth is going to be
stuffed full with candies.

392
00:16:25,255 --> 00:16:26,923
I really want to present
something that I haven't done.

393
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,658
Something that's fresh and new,

394
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:31,160
and bring it to the plate this last and.

395
00:16:31,228 --> 00:16:34,330
The jellyfish is going to have a hood

396
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,432
that goes over the top and back.

397
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,435
And coming down from that, instead
of hair she has her tentacles,

398
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:40,803
which will then cover her chest.

399
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,505
Time wise, how do you feel?

400
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:45,508
Now that I have help, so much better.

401
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:46,976
He knows that it's a lot to get done

402
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:49,378
and it's something that's
really quite different.

403
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:53,182
It's certainly not your typical
special effects getup.

404
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,017
- Good luck, Sam.
- Thank you very much.

405
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:56,085
Thank you.

406
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,424
So what did you think of
Tate's to start with?

407
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,180
Every time he's pushing the,
the boundary, especially on the

408
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,700
amount of work as well. My
big concern is that even with

409
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:10,050
the help of Tom and Anthony, he
may not have enough time.

410
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,530
He cannot afford to have
any set backs.

411
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:13,703
So what do you think about
what Conor's come up with?

412
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,606
He knows we keep bringing
back to the table,

413
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:18,774
we need him to go about beyond boundaries

414
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:19,976
and show us something more creative.

415
00:17:20,043 --> 00:17:21,811
He knows this is the time to do it

416
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:24,280
and he's going full blown,
and I like to see that.

417
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,549
What do you think about Gage's work?

418
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,818
Gage is happy. There is so much excitement.

419
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:30,419
He's got the ultimate team
you could ever dream of.

420
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:31,754
I love seeing that.

421
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:33,256
But more than that, I'm extremely impressed

422
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:35,891
how vibrant and imaginative
Gage's vision is.

423
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,694
He could take the whole
thing if he pulls this off.

424
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:41,697
Sam's seems the least dark of all of them.

425
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:44,934
I love the color scheme and
her idea to use tentacles

426
00:17:45,002 --> 00:17:46,902
but I'm worried that if
she runs them in silicone

427
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,938
they could be really heavy.

428
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,706
You know, it's great.

429
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:53,409
This is going to be four
very different tableaus,

430
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:54,877
and a very different vibe
between the four of them.

431
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:57,313
That's going to be exciting.
Good luck, guys.

432
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,115
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, guys.

433
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:00,682
- Thanks.
- Bye.

434
00:18:02,286 --> 00:18:03,519
When the sculpture is finished,

435
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:05,121
it's time to make the mold

436
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:08,124
by putting a cement-like substance
on top of the sculpture.

437
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:10,459
Once it hardens, you clean out the Clay

438
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,795
and fill it with foam or silicone,

439
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,397
which eventually becomes a prosthetic.

440
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,443
Since the clock was ticking down,

441
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:29,078
we got to get this mold out.

442
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:31,747
So we're going to open up one of
the molds and run it in foam.

443
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:33,489
It's one of those things

444
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,419
where you're either behind or you risk it.

445
00:18:36,486 --> 00:18:38,354
- The back's coming off.
- Okay.

446
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:39,922
No.

447
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,091
- We got a major split.
- What was that?

448
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,627
I hear that crack and
immediately my heart stops.

449
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:47,630
I am.

450
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,654
What?

451
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,719
We just lost it.

452
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,221
When we opened one of the leg molds

453
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:04,811
it broke into four pieces.

454
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,288
Go get some plaster bandages
and a bucket of water.

455
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:07,985
We'll get it wrapped on our way out.

456
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,457
You can't get mad at yourself.

457
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,758
You know if you pop a mold too early,

458
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,026
it's probably going to crack.

459
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:13,728
But sometimes it doesn't,

460
00:19:13,796 --> 00:19:16,998
and that's where the reward
of risk entices you.

461
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:18,399
There's no way we're going to get

462
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,168
the bandages to set in three minutes.

463
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:22,203
We'll fix it for tomorrow.

464
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:24,572
It's lucky that we sculpted ambiguous legs.

465
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,140
They will work on either side,

466
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,309
so we're just going to run two of the one.

467
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,144
So just stack it under there

468
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,246
and make sure that we get it right.

469
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,483
You want them all in foam, right?

470
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,654
All right, guys, that's time.

471
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,922
Let's hit the road!

472
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:52,166
All of the sudden there's
more people here again.

473
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,968
I love having you guys here.

474
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:55,870
I think it's what we all needed,

475
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:58,773
you know, me and Sam, Tate and Conor.

476
00:19:58,841 --> 00:20:00,208
While I'm happy to see everyone,

477
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,176
they're kind of in party mode

478
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,278
and I'm in the finals.

479
00:20:04,346 --> 00:20:06,614
So it's hard for me to escape to anywhere

480
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:09,817
to really evaluate what I'm dealing with.

481
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:12,019
Actually, it's kind of stressful
having everybody here again.

482
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,622
Honestly, it got loud again.

483
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,593
Having everybody back is
definitely a mixed bag.

484
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,629
There are people who I'm
happy to see again.

485
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,265
And then there are people
who got eliminated

486
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,566
and I was happy to see them go.

487
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:28,302
The minute that the competition

488
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,371
and winning and money
become your main focus,

489
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,206
you lose sight of your actually makeups.

490
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,941
You've kind of already lost.

491
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:36,010
I didn't come here just for the hell of it.

492
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:37,278
I came here to win.

493
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:52,593
Walking into the lab,

494
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,062
there are lots of little
things we're behind on.

495
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,864
We need to finish sculpting the tentacles

496
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:58,599
and run them out of silicone,

497
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,501
and the mermaid fin has to be finished.

498
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,770
I'll divide that between jo and Megan.

499
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:04,605
So we should cut these and...

500
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:05,629
yeah, we could cut them

501
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,375
and make two sets of intestines with them.

502
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,844
Or not intestines. Tentacles.

503
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,979
I'm really surprised at how
well the team is working.

504
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:13,381
That definitely looks like...

505
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:14,782
so what are you going to do about this?

506
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,117
We're going to sculpt this.

507
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:18,219
We're going to sculpt two lines of that.

508
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,553
Or maybe we can do more lines

509
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,956
and it will help push them out.

510
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:23,090
- Cool.
- Go for it.

511
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,199
This is the finals.

512
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:33,200
There's never enough time.

513
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:34,435
There's always pressure,

514
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,337
there's always too many things to do.

515
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:38,539
But I do really well under pressure.

516
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:42,677
Alright, so we've got you in arm land...

517
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:43,778
- foot, yeah.
- Correct?

518
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,113
- Yeah.
- Paw land.

519
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,949
Today we have to start
assembling the werewolf suit

520
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,617
and putting the hair on it
and I've still gotta make

521
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,520
the gatling gun for little red riding hood.

522
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:54,121
That's awesome.

523
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,456
That looks good.

524
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:08,502
I'm gonna use this cotton
latex stuff for the vine,

525
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,371
I want to wrap it around there.

526
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,306
Once we get that, we'll hit it
with some browns and stuff.

527
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:13,841
Frank's working on the scepter.

528
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:16,911
He did exactly what I saw in my head.

529
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:19,680
He even came up with a couple of
cool ideas that I didn't think of,

530
00:22:19,748 --> 00:22:23,684
like putting cellophane in the
globe to give this even glow.

531
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:25,686
My hat's off to him.

532
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:28,189
The witch, I'm gonna
start painting the face.

533
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:29,155
Right away, starting off the day,

534
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,191
I feel really good about where we are.

535
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:31,192
You're so witchy!

536
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:34,462
I'm gonna start pre-painting my foam pieces

537
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:37,198
and they can focus their efforts elsewhere.

538
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:39,166
Which boob do you want out, Gage?

539
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,334
- Huh?
- Which breast do you want exposed?

540
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,836
It would be, well, she's gonna be,

541
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:44,205
it's gonna be on her right side.

542
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:45,596
Marcel and I start sculpting out

543
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,541
the chest and the belly
of the witch, you know,

544
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,543
Jessica's gonna start
working on the gretel,

545
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:51,679
so I feel really good because we're already

546
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,615
starting off with a really
great spot to be in.

547
00:22:54,683 --> 00:22:56,884
- Go crazy.
- Go crazy?

548
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:58,519
I'm gonna go get started on that leg.

549
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,354
Uh.

550
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,589
I grab the frog head and I turn it.

551
00:23:01,656 --> 00:23:03,824
It's useless.

552
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:05,644
The whole back of it's collapsed,

553
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,928
there's this air pocket about an inch thick

554
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:09,930
between the foam rubber and the skin.

555
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:11,432
For sake, really?

556
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,401
- Is it on the front, too?
- Yeah.

557
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,504
I'm thinking I can't use this foam.

558
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,305
What do I do? What do I do?

559
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:19,840
Conor's over there freaking out.

560
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:20,941
He's in trouble.

561
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:23,244
It's collapsed everywhere.

562
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:25,312
The entire back is collapsed.

563
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,615
I've just lost the competition.

564
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:28,983
Might as well give up now.

565
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,620
Coming up...

566
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:34,755
So much is going on, we
were so crunched for time,

567
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:36,290
it could make or break your career.

568
00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:37,591
She's very disturbing.

569
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:38,859
What's the concept about, though?

570
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:43,197
Just an intricate and
well-executed concept.

571
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:45,766
You achieved what it was
that you set out to do.

572
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:48,035
The winner of "Face Off" is...

573
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,869
Upon first examination,
my frog head looks great

574
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,873
and I turn it and I start to think

575
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,909
this is like some kind of bad dream

576
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,478
because the whole back of
my frog head collapsed.

577
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:10,247
I've just lost the competition.

578
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,281
I'm really lost at this point.

579
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,386
And I go back to sculpting the
witch and I'm thinking, okay,

580
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,921
"what do I do? What do I do?"

581
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,047
I just have to make this work.

582
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:25,302
So I assess it and decide to
glue the pieces back down

583
00:24:25,303 --> 00:24:26,930
just hoping this will work out.

584
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,737
Can you flip the switch from there?

585
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,939
Let's go out and start
sticking the metal pieces on.

586
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,511
What that time say? Five minutes?

587
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,725
Five minutes and 27 seconds.

588
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,055
That's time, everybody. We are done.

589
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,804
So today is application day.

590
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,307
It's a race against time
and it's a race against

591
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,142
challenging yourself and
what you're capable of.

592
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,377
I'm gonna try.

593
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:14,778
I'm gonna try my damnedest to take

594
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,912
this competition with my makeup.

595
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,588
Once the prosthetic is set up,

596
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:26,023
it can be removed from the mold,

597
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,258
applied to the model's face and painted.

598
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,693
- Hi, how are you?
- How you doin'?

599
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,194
It's good to see you.

600
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:33,263
They bring our models in and
I sit Deb down and I say,

601
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,699
"look, this is the witch
we're gonna make you."

602
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,234
We glued the chest piece and
the stomach piece down.

603
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:39,403
We started applying her face.

604
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,406
We're really able to put in

605
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:42,105
all these little details
and it was just awesome.

606
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:51,081
This is a balloon that inflates the throat.

607
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,083
So it's gonna be your task to...

608
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,318
Make it do that.

609
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,753
Normally, when it comes to

610
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,656
any kind of articulation
in a prosthetic, ideally,

611
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,493
the makeup artist handles it
himself so the actor can act.

612
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,139
But in this case, I can't stand

613
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,431
behind him blowing air
into a throat bladder.

614
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:09,079
Although I run the risk

615
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,035
of it looking like crap by exposing a tube,

616
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,352
it'll be worth it if I can

617
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,372
make this throat do what it's supposed to.

618
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,307
Blow into that tube.

619
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,241
Oh, my God.

620
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,215
We're not just doing a static piece,

621
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,684
we're doing a frame from a movie.

622
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,319
These two are gonna be at war.

623
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,121
This is going to be a battle between them.

624
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,589
There's blood, there's cuts,

625
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,624
there's actually going to
be a spear penetration

626
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:36,359
through the wolf,

627
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:37,327
bullet holes from the gatling gun.

628
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:42,365
Oh, wow, man, that came out awesome.

629
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:45,102
With the time given,

630
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:46,803
I am very worried about something

631
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,171
falling through the cracks,

632
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,273
because it's a whole lot of

633
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,709
running back and forth and
quickly switching tasks

634
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,445
and I'm feeling a little bit off my game.

635
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,180
All right, guys, that's time.

636
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,215
Time is up.

637
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:07,757
So much is going on, we were
so crunched for time, like,

638
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:10,260
there's so many pieces that
still need to come together

639
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,827
and we only now have an hour.

640
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:19,236
Two minutes.

641
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,941
All I ever said when I got here
was I wanted to build a werewolf,

642
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,643
and today I built a werewolf.

643
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,145
I'm ready to show them what I'm about.

644
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,650
Okay, guys, time is running out.

645
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,086
Let's get the characters placed
in front of their backdrops.

646
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:42,726
This is it.

647
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,597
Right foot back a bit.

648
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,766
This is make or break time for me.

649
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,334
I feel my reputation is on the line.

650
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:53,470
A little more, like,
down, yep, there you go.

651
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,105
This is the finals.

652
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,741
There is a lot at stake here
and it's really kind of scary.

653
00:27:57,808 --> 00:27:59,009
Everything's good with your gatling gun?

654
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,043
Yeah?

655
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,444
Just go ahead and pop yourself in.

656
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:04,748
Looking around the room,

657
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,250
I know that mine is not nearly as engaging

658
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,386
as some of theer pieces.

659
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:10,818
It's not the over the top thing

660
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,632
that I really hoped to
be putting out there.

661
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,629
We understand that there's
a lot on the line.

662
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,899
The possibility of $100,000.

663
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,201
That's a big deal.

664
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,535
All right, guys, that's it.

665
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,003
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

666
00:28:27,071 --> 00:28:29,071
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

667
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,346
When the party guests
come in, I'm thinking,

668
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,581
the pressure's really on here.

669
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,951
What do you have going here?

670
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,419
"Hansel and gretel."

671
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:45,889
Guests at the party are
huge in our industry.

672
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,724
It's a little overwhelming,

673
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,527
because it could make or break
your career from this point on.

674
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,165
My version of "Hansel and Gretel",

675
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,667
the only thing I did different was
that the witch gets the kids.

676
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,003
Doesn't have a happy ending.

677
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,811
This final challenge,

678
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:11,014
I'm able to create my vision,
my characters my way

679
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,816
with the people I want

680
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:14,918
and I'm super happy with
the way it's turned out.

681
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,758
Gage's witch makeup is just nuts,

682
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,161
there's just metal Springs and
shards of steel everywhere.

683
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:26,796
He has a great concept.

684
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:28,999
That's the kind of thing that
the judges are looking for.

685
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:29,933
He brought it.

686
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:34,337
In this scenario,

687
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,072
little red riding hood is the aggressor.

688
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,492
The werewolves are the victims.

689
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,812
I'm completely satisfied.

690
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,547
Yes, there are technical issues.

691
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:47,484
You can't lay 30 pounds
of hair in two days,

692
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,985
it's just not possible.

693
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,087
But it is an accomplishment

694
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:53,356
that no criticism can make me feel bad for.

695
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,958
I love it.

696
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,994
I'm looking at something
that I'm extremely proud of.

697
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:02,165
I think Tate's whole character dynamic,

698
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,135
it's so intense and so well conceived.

699
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:06,970
In "The little mermaid",

700
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,906
there's the witch that she goes
to have herself transformed,

701
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,710
and this is my... my best
stab at psychedelic.

702
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,451
I know that I just made the best thing

703
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,720
that I've made this whole time,

704
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,322
and I'm really satisfied with it.

705
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:27,557
It's the piece that I'm the most proud of.

706
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,067
Sam chose a real tough one.

707
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:38,835
But I love that she
challenged herself, you know.

708
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,673
Very imaginative, isn't it?

709
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:44,507
- It's really nice.
- Thank you.

710
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,779
I wanted to give the illusion

711
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:52,382
that she's something that
grew out of the ground.

712
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,284
This isn't human tissue.

713
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,819
Looks like tree bark.

714
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,190
And when rob operated that
bladder, just like, wow.

715
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:02,025
That's awesome.

716
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,862
So I feel good.
I'm proud of what I've accomplished.

717
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,264
Conor's is really well-executed,

718
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,700
but it's not my favorite of his, honestly.

719
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:14,704
I feel like his creativity
is still somehow typical,

720
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,774
but I can't take away from
how beautifully it's done.

721
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:26,349
Gage's is just the most disturbing
thing I've seen in years.

722
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,551
I'm looking at all the fine
details and I'm thinking,

723
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,053
boy, he hasn't missed a mark here.

724
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,255
I think what Sam did is really neat.

725
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,890
There's a lot of vibrant colors.

726
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,026
I actually like the story
that Tate's tells.

727
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:37,994
You get a chance to look around,

728
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,562
and it says a lot to me.

729
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,264
I really like Conor's.

730
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,533
It's a beautiful design in
the amount of time he had.

731
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,369
I can't believe how great he did.

732
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,271
If I had to pick one,

733
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,340
I think I'd probably go
with "hansel and gretel,"

734
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,243
because of the imagination.

735
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,847
- Hi.
- Who'd you pick?

736
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,682
- I was dying to do two of them...
- I know.

737
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,284
It's so overwhelming.

738
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,285
I'm not gonna ask you who,

739
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,920
but do you have your favorites

740
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:04,988
that are simmering in your head?

741
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:06,322
- Not yet.
- Not yet. Really?

742
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,957
This party seems to be wrapping up.

743
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:09,092
Why don't we go talk to these guys?

744
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,727
- Great.
- Yeah, let's.

745
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,328
The party dwindles down,

746
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:14,063
then McKenzie brings in the judges

747
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:16,166
and that is very nerve-wracking as well.

748
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:17,167
- Hi, Gage.
- Hi, guys.

749
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:18,868
- How are you?
- Good.

750
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,637
You gotta be ready to explain yourself

751
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:22,138
and explain your decisions.

752
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:25,175
You have industrial "Hansel and Gretel",

753
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:26,276
Yes, ma'am.

754
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:28,912
So, Glenn, why don't we start with you?

755
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:29,813
I'm sweating bullets.

756
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,980
I'm freaking out.

757
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:34,841
- Hi, Gage.
- Hi, guys, how are you?

758
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:36,309
- Good. How are you?
- I'm good, thank you.

759
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:39,746
So you have industrial "Hansel and Gretel",

760
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:40,781
Yes, ma'am.

761
00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:42,115
How do you feel you did with this?

762
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:43,750
I feel really good about it.

763
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:45,919
It was a clear vision in my head

764
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:47,888
and I feel I conveyed it pretty well.

765
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:49,523
It's very, very frightening.

766
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,993
Frightening is not an easy
concept outside of the movie

767
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,095
cut and edited, you see it as a piece.

768
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:56,496
Who's idea were the eyes

769
00:32:56,564 --> 00:32:57,664
on the outside of the lids?

770
00:32:57,732 --> 00:32:59,666
Mine. I put lenses in her, too,

771
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,001
just in case they asked to open her eyes.

772
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:02,502
Oh, could you open your eyes?

773
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,937
And they're like she's been blinded.

774
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:05,505
- It's freaky, too.
- Wow.

775
00:33:05,573 --> 00:33:06,306
Can wewe see the back?

776
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:09,009
You may want to step back.

777
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:11,745
Back it up.

778
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:13,447
She's very disturbing.

779
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:16,183
What's the concept about thshrapnel?

780
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,984
She was human at one time.

781
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:19,853
So then more of the witch
started to come out

782
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,421
and she started doing
all kinds of things to

783
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:24,090
herself with pieces of metal,
and I wanted her to be...

784
00:33:24,158 --> 00:33:26,993
really be fused with that industrial feel.

785
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:28,094
Little bit of piercing going on as well.

786
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:29,663
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Got ya.

787
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,998
Conceptually, the strongest
thing you've done.

788
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:33,266
Thank you so much. Thank you.

789
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:34,201
- Nice work.
- Good job.

790
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:35,869
Thank you. I appreciate it.

791
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:37,070
Thank you.

792
00:33:40,775 --> 00:33:41,942
- Hey, Conor.
- Hello.

793
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:43,376
- How are you doin'?
- Good, thank you.

794
00:33:43,444 --> 00:33:45,745
So you had the haunted frog prince.

795
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:47,347
How do you feel you did with this?

796
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:51,218
I know that a big issue
with me was concept,

797
00:33:51,285 --> 00:33:54,421
and so I really pushed this
as far as I felt I could.

798
00:33:55,857 --> 00:33:57,591
How does the haunted part come into this?

799
00:33:57,658 --> 00:34:00,627
I tried to take the transformation
from prince to frog,

800
00:34:00,695 --> 00:34:03,363
tried to make it look painful in
the design and the paint scheme,

801
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,565
and you can see it's not
happening to him easily.

802
00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:07,169
The left side of his face

803
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,936
has a lot of bruise
coloring and so on in it.

804
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:11,938
Tell us about the bladder.
How does it work?

805
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:14,975
I took the foam run and I cut out all this

806
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,178
and built latex in a tube
right into the mold,

807
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,913
hid the tube up underneath the lip.

808
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,982
So he operates the bladder himself.

809
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:24,050
- Yeah.
- By blowing into the tube.

810
00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:25,352
I love that that's integrated,

811
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:28,088
I love that that's intrinsic to the makeup.

812
00:34:28,155 --> 00:34:29,055
Look at the top of the head.

813
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:30,490
That's a great paint job, too.

814
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:32,526
This entire color scheme is very unique,

815
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:33,693
it intrigues me.

816
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:35,262
- Nice job.
- Great.

817
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:36,596
- Well done.
- Well, thank you.

818
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:38,098
- Conor. Thank you.
- Good luck, man.

819
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,736
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, guys.

820
00:34:42,803 --> 00:34:44,404
- How are you doin'?
- All right.

821
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:46,640
So you have the psychedelic little mermaid

822
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:47,908
of hans Christian andersen.

823
00:34:47,975 --> 00:34:48,975
That's right.

824
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,410
How do you feel you did with this?

825
00:34:50,478 --> 00:34:52,379
I started off by wanting to have something

826
00:34:52,446 --> 00:34:55,749
that was obviously bright,
almost cartoony, bubbly.

827
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:59,085
I wanted most the texture
to be subtle texture.

828
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:01,087
The background is extremely powerful.

829
00:35:01,155 --> 00:35:04,391
Very vibrant colors and you
got the characters muted

830
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,092
and so I wish the opposite
would have happened,

831
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,328
'cause if they were in front of
a much more mellow background,

832
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:09,362
they probably would come out stronger.

833
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,397
Exactly.

834
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,032
What was behind the thinking

835
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,369
leaving the arms, feet and the
middle of the face flesh tones?

836
00:35:16,437 --> 00:35:17,904
It was part of the transition.

837
00:35:17,972 --> 00:35:18,972
Her limbs would go first.

838
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,206
The face is pink.

839
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:22,042
I wanted to have it one more element

840
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:23,376
of the skin tone in there somewhere.

841
00:35:23,444 --> 00:35:25,011
Just to not have, "oh, well,

842
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,614
here's some arms and some
feet that are skin tone."

843
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:28,652
I think I would have liked

844
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:30,183
to see the makeup continue onto the face.

845
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,018
It would have pulled it together.

846
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:34,120
Yeah, because the arm now
starts to feel quite alien,

847
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:35,855
because the arms are
that pink like the face

848
00:35:35,923 --> 00:35:38,959
and you wonder what's a
natural color in there.

849
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:40,927
I do really like the shapes
that you've created.

850
00:35:40,995 --> 00:35:42,329
- Yeah, I do, too.
- A good concept.

851
00:35:42,396 --> 00:35:43,196
Thank you, Sam, good luck.

852
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,435
- Hey, Tate.
- Hey, what's goin' on, McKenzie?

853
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:50,136
- How are you?
- Good.

854
00:35:50,204 --> 00:35:52,572
So you have a post-apocalyptic
little red riding hood.

855
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,506
Yes, I love it.

856
00:35:55,176 --> 00:35:56,209
Tell me about the idea

857
00:35:56,277 --> 00:35:58,111
behind the lights in the eyes?

858
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:00,714
I'm, you know, obviously a big
graphic novel comic book fan,

859
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:03,516
and from the beginning that
this story popped into my head,

860
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:06,453
I saw japanese anime and I wanted to

861
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,089
traditionalize it with that kind of style.

862
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,557
I know there's a cheese factor,

863
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:13,126
but I really wanted to go
into the red glowing eyes,

864
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:16,196
and also, the red is my
overall theme of this so...

865
00:36:16,263 --> 00:36:19,265
well, it actually makes sense
when you describe this.

866
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,301
I think she's an incredible character.

867
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,203
She really fits well in this world,

868
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,006
and the proportions, the way she's dressed,

869
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:27,741
she's very successful for me.

870
00:36:27,808 --> 00:36:29,009
You created something very cool there.

871
00:36:29,076 --> 00:36:30,410
You made the right choices, you know.

872
00:36:30,478 --> 00:36:31,611
Thank you very much.

873
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,912
I also like the fact

874
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,048
that you actually put bullet holes in him,

875
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,317
because she is carrying that gatling gun,

876
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:40,220
so that was kind of a nice
little touch as well.

877
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:41,788
I'm really happy with what you've done.

878
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,989
You did a really good job.

879
00:36:43,057 --> 00:36:44,224
Thank you very much.

880
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:45,625
- Thank you, Tate.
- All right, Tate.

881
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:46,726
Thank you so much.

882
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:47,627
- Thank you.
- I appreciate it.

883
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:49,062
Well, judges,

884
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,797
what do you say we go chat
about who the winner is?

885
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:51,731
- All right.
- Let's do that.

886
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:52,666
Okay.

887
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,638
So it's time to figure out
who our champion will be.

888
00:36:58,706 --> 00:36:59,973
When I walked out here I went,

889
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,375
- "Oh."
- Yeah.

890
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,010
It's gonna be really hard tonight.

891
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:06,312
I mean, they all are, like, neck-and-neck.

892
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,081
I think Sam,

893
00:37:08,149 --> 00:37:10,617
the fact that she is even here
tonight says a lot for her.

894
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:12,652
It's testament to her raw skill.

895
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,851
And I think she realizes that

896
00:37:14,852 --> 00:37:18,158
she did not quite bring
it all to us tonight.

897
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:20,427
What do you think about
Conor's work tonight?

898
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:23,496
As usual, Conor has succeeded
at a technical level,

899
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:25,404
very well thought out,

900
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:29,169
and I think he did finally
expand his design.

901
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:30,423
I almost wish that he would have

902
00:37:30,424 --> 00:37:32,205
gone a little crazier
throughout the whole show.

903
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:34,908
I wish he would have taken
that note a little earlier.

904
00:37:34,975 --> 00:37:36,876
I was blown away with the witch concept,

905
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:37,774
that non-traditional approach

906
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:38,978
of coming up with this sort of elemental...

907
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:40,547
that was very effective.

908
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:41,848
And the bladder was absolutely amazing.

909
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,383
Yeah, that worked great.

910
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:46,386
I mean, that was very clever
having it be self-contained.

911
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:47,626
What I also liked, it felt

912
00:37:47,627 --> 00:37:49,656
like really something
that was in transition.

913
00:37:49,724 --> 00:37:50,876
There was a lot of energy

914
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,859
on the way the skin was pulled on the face.

915
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:55,361
Bottom line is, he really
went all the way with this.

916
00:37:55,429 --> 00:37:56,529
That brings us to Tate.

917
00:37:56,597 --> 00:37:57,831
What are your thoughts on him?

918
00:37:57,898 --> 00:37:59,099
I think he did a great job.

919
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:01,367
I mean, he actually did a full suit.

920
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:04,204
I loved the storyline, I loved
that spin on red riding hood.

921
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:05,338
I thought it was awesome.

922
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:07,373
I loved the color choices,

923
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:10,009
I love the fact that the werewolf
is white instead of brown.

924
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:13,246
The decision to just make the
red riding hood character

925
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:16,316
a really strong character
with very little makeup,

926
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:18,551
it's a great story, it's a great idea.

927
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:20,453
And then he poured it
all into the werewolf.

928
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:21,755
I think it worked out really well for him.

929
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:23,757
All right, what about Gage?

930
00:38:23,824 --> 00:38:26,326
I think Gage knocked it
out of the park tonight.

931
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:28,962
I think he totally blew me away.

932
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:30,897
- I didn't expect it, I mean...
- None of us.

933
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:32,632
He has made this challenge

934
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,768
very difficult for us to judge.

935
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:37,370
I think that it is, by far, his best work.

936
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:38,215
Oh, yes, definitely....

937
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,706
and I was excited to see
what he was gonna do.

938
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:41,574
And he blew me away as well,

939
00:38:41,642 --> 00:38:43,810
I think that it was absolutely amazing

940
00:38:43,878 --> 00:38:45,478
how far he went for this challenge.

941
00:38:45,546 --> 00:38:47,347
- He brought it.
- He did.

942
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:49,349
You know how much things
were in the pieces that

943
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:52,085
told the story of what was
going on, was happening.

944
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:53,553
Like the candy in the mouth.

945
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:57,090
Like the hands pushing in
the stomach of the witch.

946
00:38:57,158 --> 00:38:59,559
All those things were telling
you a story without, I think,

947
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:00,960
he didn't have to explain to us.

948
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:04,998
They all did an amazing job tonight, I...

949
00:39:05,065 --> 00:39:07,534
this is a really,
this is a tough one for us.

950
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:09,736
Appropriately, the hardest so far.

951
00:39:14,275 --> 00:39:16,543
So, have you reached a decision?

952
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,144
- We have.
- Yes, we have.

953
00:39:18,212 --> 00:39:20,980
All right, let's bring them
back out and crown our winner.

954
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:33,526
Welcome back to
the "Face Off" reveal stage.

955
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:38,033
Tonight, one of you will win $100,000,

956
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:42,802
and a year's worth of makeup
supplies provided by alcone.

957
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,637
Glenn, tell us about the looks overall.

958
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:47,073
Tate had a really robust concept

959
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:50,844
and it was just a really
ambitious, huge makeup.

960
00:39:50,911 --> 00:39:53,213
A lot of application and clearly a lot of

961
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,647
passion to bring that concept to life.

962
00:39:57,017 --> 00:39:58,852
Conor, a stellar performance,

963
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,721
technically very, very beautiful makeup.

964
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:02,726
The application was tight,

965
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:04,457
the painting was tight,
the sculpture was tight.

966
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:07,193
Thank you.

967
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:10,396
Sam, huge concept and some really
interesting color choices.

968
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,902
And Gage, huge leap forward for you.

969
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,005
Just an intricate and
well-executed concept.

970
00:40:19,073 --> 00:40:21,507
I really feel like you achieved
what you set out to do.

971
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:22,809
Thank you.

972
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,679
Well, we still have four of you

973
00:40:26,747 --> 00:40:28,047
and only one can win.

974
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:30,850
Glenn.

975
00:40:30,918 --> 00:40:33,186
The first person to be
eliminated tonight is...

976
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:40,793
Sam.

977
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:43,496
Sam, you've done so much
progress from the beginning.

978
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:45,231
Look where you are tonight.

979
00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:46,099
We're very, very proud of you.

980
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:47,033
Thanks.

981
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:52,205
Sam, if you would please,
step next to the others.

982
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:55,441
I'm really proud of how much
I've progressed on the show,

983
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:56,671
but I wish I could have

984
00:40:56,672 --> 00:40:58,945
represented the ladies
with a stronger piece.

985
00:40:59,013 --> 00:41:01,114
All that included, I'm pretty
proud of being where I am.

986
00:41:05,452 --> 00:41:08,554
All right, leaves us with the three of you.

987
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:10,456
One of you is our champion.

988
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:18,068
So, Glenn, who is the winner of "face off?"

989
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:24,103
The winner of "Face Off" is...

990
00:41:38,101 --> 00:41:40,460
One of you is our champion.

991
00:41:41,238 --> 00:41:44,773
Once Sam was eliminated, it got very real.

992
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:48,511
Tate couldn't stop swaying,
so now I'm nervous.

993
00:41:48,578 --> 00:41:49,411
This is it.

994
00:41:51,148 --> 00:41:53,449
So, Glenn, who is the winner of "fe off"?

995
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:56,685
Before we make that announcement,

996
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:58,654
I just want to say something to you guys.

997
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:01,557
You all succeeded this evening.

998
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,259
You've really made this hard on us

999
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:05,917
because we loved all three makeups.

1000
00:42:11,201 --> 00:42:14,136
The winner of "Face Off" is...

1001
00:42:20,977 --> 00:42:21,844
Conor.

1002
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,723
It feels fantastic.

1003
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,926
I can't be any happier than I am right now.

1004
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:38,294
Oh, my God.

1005
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:44,466
I am extremely happy for Conor...

1006
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:48,003
for him, for Gage, for
Sam, proud of myself.

1007
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:50,406
I... I feel like I've gained
the respect of the judges.

1008
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:52,441
It's been an amazing experience.

1009
00:42:54,678 --> 00:42:56,111
I feel really good about my placement,

1010
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:58,047
and I feel really good about
what's to come from it,

1011
00:42:58,114 --> 00:42:59,882
because it's just the beginning
of something greater,

1012
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:03,719
so I don't know what will
happen, but I'm excited for it.

1013
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:04,620
I think it's awesome.

1014
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:08,924
Oh.

1015
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:10,893
This experience has meant a lot of things.

1016
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:14,463
It's meant validation, it's meant exposure,

1017
00:43:14,531 --> 00:43:18,767
and also, personally, it's
forced me to look within myself

1018
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:21,237
and develop creativity.

1019
00:43:21,304 --> 00:43:22,771
I'm proud of what I've accomplished.
