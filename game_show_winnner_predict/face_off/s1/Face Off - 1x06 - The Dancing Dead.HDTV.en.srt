1
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,550
Megan's like Conor's little maid.

2
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:19,951
Megan, you are our winner.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,889
The person going home is Jo.

4
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,459
Now, only seven remain.

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,027
And tonight on "Face Off"...

6
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,329
This challenge is vile.

7
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:33,799
I love it.

8
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:37,169
Your next Spotlight Challenge... zombies.

9
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:38,303
But there's something that you should know.

10
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,373
Are you kidding me?

11
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,442
Once I saw the wrinkles come to life,

12
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,076
I was, like, "This is cool."

13
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:47,646
The blood is just so heavy on the face.

14
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:48,647
It's a stunning makeup.

15
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,052
To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,821
our award-winning panel of judges

17
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:58,123
Ve Neill, legendary makeup artist,

18
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,026
whose work includes
"Edward Scissorhands",

19
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:04,296
"Beetlejuice", and the
"Pirates Of The Caribbean"films.

20
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,699
Glenn Hetrick, cutting-edge 
makeup effects artist on"Heroes",

21
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,035
"Legion", and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer".

22
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:13,071
And Patrick Tatopoulus,
visionary creature designer

23
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,106
for "Independence day", "Godzilla",

24
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:18,143
and director of
" Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans".

25
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,445
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic

26
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,280
and earn $100,000 dollars

27
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,016
and a year's worth of
makeup from Alcone?

28
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,953
Get ready for "Face Off".

29
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:34,078
<font color="#FFA215">Sync by YYeTs</font>
<font color="#FFA215">Corrected by ThreeSixes</font>
<font color="#FFA215">www.addic7ed.com</font>

30
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,797
What's up, guys?

31
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,332
Want some breakfast?

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,202
The loft is super empty without Jo.

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,537
I miss her.

34
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:22,040
But ever since Jo left,
we've created a truce.

35
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:23,742
So what do you guys feel?

36
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:26,978
There's more positivity
between the two lofts?

37
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,014
Honestly, I feel like a
weight's been lifted.

38
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,495
So I walk into the lab,

39
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,063
and as soon as I round the corner

40
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,565
I see there's a piece of glass, a t-shirt,

41
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:47,999
a bucket and a brush,

44
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:52,304
or some kind of weird challenge.

45
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,074
Welcome to your next
Foundation Challenge.

46
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,318
As you know, the winner of

47
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,444
the Foundation Challenge
will earn an advantage

48
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,646
going into the Spotlight Challenge.

49
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,683
Today, you are at the scene of a crime.

50
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,719
The only thing missing is the blood.

51
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,589
One of the first things that
we do as makeup artists,

52
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,624
you learn how to get blood right.

53
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,392
You will have exactly one hour

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,896
to create a gallon of blood
using the various supplies

55
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,431
that we have provided you with,

56
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,067
such as chocolate syrup, chicken guts,

57
00:03:22,134 --> 00:03:24,202
ultra slime, laundry detergent,

58
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,938
tomato soup, acrylic paints, food coloring,

59
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,140
and hand sanitizer.

60
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,509
Every effects artist I know
has a recipe for blood.

61
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,913
Every effects artist I know
doesn't share that recipe.

62
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,215
So let me introduce you to
your guest judge for the day.

63
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,217
He's a former LAPD detective,

64
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,553
where he worked everything
from Homicide to Vice,

65
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,154
and now he's a private investigator.

66
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:45,824
Please welcome Bob Jakucs.

67
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,462
Hey, Bob. How are you?

68
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,730
Hello, McKenzie. How are you?

69
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,498
Good. Thank you so much for being here.

70
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,499
Thanks for having me.

71
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,967
After your hour is up,

72
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,736
you will each participate
in a blood splatter test.

73
00:03:57,803 --> 00:04:00,405
So, Bob, what will you
be looking for today?

74
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,875
The color, the texture,
and especially the quantity.

75
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,410
Was it blunt force trauma?

76
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,512
Are they thinking it's
a gunshot wound?

77
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,581
My grandfather was a cop for 37 years.

78
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,349
And I know those guys are always saying,

79
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,252
"Oh, that's movie blood.
That's not real."

80
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,255
That makes this a tough competition.

81
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,190
Your clock starts now.

82
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,029
Now we look like psychotic scientists.

83
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,935
I start grabbing the chicken guts

84
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,872
because I love the splat
sound that it makes.

85
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,542
This challenge is gross,
disgusting, vile.

86
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,510
I love it.

87
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,947
Real chicken guts? I don't like it.

88
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,717
I certainly wouldn't use it on a film set.

89
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,254
When I make blood,
I like it to be edible and safe.

90
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,026
I use corn starch to add opacity,

91
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,028
corn syrup for some thickening,

92
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,130
and I went for the laundry detergent

93
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,232
because laundry detergent
can keep from beading up

94
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,434
on your skin and looking fake.

95
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,242
All I kept thinking was my grandfather

96
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,244
would have to believe this is real blood.

97
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:14,666
What I'm doing here is

98
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,315
making sure it doesn't get too translucent.

99
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,850
If it starts to look see-through,

100
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,952
and then it looks like
syrup, not like blood.

101
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,120
It's kind of cool.

102
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,424
It stinks over here.

103
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,760
I think it's Meg.

104
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,929
Megan breaks out the blender

105
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,898
and starts pureeing chicken guts.

106
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,502
I swear to God,

107
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,803
it smelled like it was
Elizabeth, New Jersey,

108
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:39,738
it was so bad.

109
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,875
It is your 10-minute warning.

110
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:49,981
Aah!

111
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:57,756
Time is up. Grab your blood and
please come over to the walls.

112
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:00,792
I want you to all fling your blood at once.

113
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,696
Go!

114
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,369
What we're supposed to do is throw
blood up against the glass,

115
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,472
the t-shirt, and the wooden panel.

116
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,309
My technique is to spatter
it on there with my fingers.

117
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,011
I know that, realistically,

118
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,546
blood does not cover the walls.

119
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,416
When he said crime scene,

120
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:26,651
I was, like, "I'm going all out."

121
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,254
Gage created blood lake.

122
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:32,891
I was half tempted to throw my
whole bucket against the wall.

123
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,928
Time is up.

124
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,431
- Hey, Tate. - Hey.

125
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:41,800
Bob, what do you think?

126
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,535
This is good here, where you've got

127
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:46,104
tissue or even brain.

128
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,940
This area is good.

129
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,276
It's a little excessive over here,

130
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:53,011
and also up on the glass.

131
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:55,346
This would be good for a gunshot wound.

132
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,483
You could have put that more
down where the wounds were.

133
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,552
These drops wouldn't be as big.

134
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,788
They would be more along these
lines here down at the bottom.

135
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:07,358
This is a 2x4 to the head, repeatedly.

136
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,260
Your spattering here is good.

137
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,728
Less is best.

138
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,897
- Wow. 
- How's it going?

139
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,332
Good. What happened?

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,670
It was a really deep gash
decapitating the head,

141
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,005
as well as a very deep stomach wound

142
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,574
basically bleeding out.

143
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,509
Bleeding out all depends on gravity.

144
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,744
So if they decapitated them

145
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,079
and the body and the head went down,

146
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,280
yeah, you would have a lot of bleeding.

147
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,282
I think it may be a little more excessive

148
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,384
than we needed to do.

149
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,107
I figured that if a bullet

150
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:37,655
is going straight through someone's head

151
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,258
that the back is going to burst open.

152
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,594
Megan, your puddling is good.

153
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,729
I like that.

154
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,166
As we move up, blood really
wouldn't look as watery as yours.

155
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,368
There would be more of a
thicker element to it.

156
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,973
So, Bob, who do you think nailed it?

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,409
Tate, your creative use
of tissue was very good...

158
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,512
the aspect of skin or brain

159
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,681
in a really traumatic
injury was really good

160
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,549
in the way you up it up there.

161
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,817
All right, thank you.

162
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,520
Tom, the spray portion,
the spatter portion,

163
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,755
looked very, very good.

164
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,490
Who's the winner of this challenge?

165
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,626
The winner is...

166
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,662
Tom.

167
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,200
I'm super happy to get the win,

168
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,868
because I did take this challenge

169
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:25,136
thinking that this is a cop,

170
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,337
I know what he wants to see.

171
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,706
The reason I chose Tom

172
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,376
was that less in this situation was better.

173
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,099
Best spatter pattern that you

174
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,613
would normally see in a
situation like this.

175
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,948
Tom.

176
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,982
Thank you.

177
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,017
You have won an advantage

178
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:40,451
going into the Spotlight Challenge.

179
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,654
Sweet.

180
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:43,788
All right, Bob, it was great
having you here with us today.

181
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,756
Thank you so much.

182
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:47,392
Thank you, McKenzie.

183
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,695
All right, guys, let's talk about
your next Spotlight Challenge.

184
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,464
This one is an all-time classic makeup.

185
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,601
Zombies.

186
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,202
Yes!

187
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,639
McKenzie announces zombies.

188
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,342
All of us collectively were, like, "Yes!"

189
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,899
For this challenge, you

190
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,813
will need to create your
own original zombie.

191
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,616
And the stakes are higher than ever

192
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,953
because this week two of
you will be eliminated.

193
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:18,356
When McKenzie dropped the bomb

194
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,191
that two of us would be going home,

195
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,962
I could feel everyone really
get intense about it.

196
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,098
So, Tom, as the winner of
the Foundation Challenge,

197
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,133
you get to pick your model first.

198
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,161
The rest of you will

199
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:32,370
choose your models in
randomly selected order.

200
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,638
I have an idea,

201
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,139
so I pick my model based on the fact

202
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,908
that he has a super-chiseled jaw.

203
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,014
All right, guys, your time starts now.

204
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,522
I want to do kind of a
classic '80s style zombie

205
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,291
who is now just a dried-out husk,

206
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,493
kind of falling apart, all leathery.

207
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,398
My concept is a shark
attack zombie in a wetsuit,

208
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,333
big shark bites on his torso.

209
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,402
He's blue in the face.

210
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,973
Right away, I just started
jumping into the sculpture.

211
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:13,244
I'm going to sculpt the face out
of clay on top of the lifecast,

212
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,314
and then I'll use my
sculpture to make a mold.

213
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,349
I'm making a zombie hooker.

214
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:19,984
I'm sure there's been a
zombie hooker somewhere

215
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,586
in one movie somewhere along the line,

216
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,454
but not as cool as this.

217
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,823
The title of it would
be called "I love L.A".

218
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,326
This woman's going to have a lot
of botched plastic surgery.

219
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,428
She didn't pay her bills on time.

220
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,196
It's a home invasion zombie.

221
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,499
Its guts spill everywhere,

222
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:36,801
and it's a freshly torn open human being.

223
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:37,869
So there has to be blood everywhere.

224
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,170
What's yours, Gage?

225
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,006
A World War II veteran who was killed.

226
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,841
I want to put shrapnel in him

227
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,343
and I want him to be really messed up.

228
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,445
He's going to be maybe three days dead.

229
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,113
Most of the classic zombies

230
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,949
are thin people that they
try to make look thinner.

231
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,518
So I thought, "You know what?

232
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:57,321
"Let's build up in order to subtract."

233
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:01,592
Two hours into everybody's designs

234
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,195
people are sculpting like
mad and full-steam ahead,

235
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,431
because, finally, zombies.

236
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:19,210
Hey, guys, if I could have
you please gather around?

237
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:25,149
I'm thinking McKenzie's just
coming around to say hi.

238
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,586
No. No, she just doesn't
pop in just to say hi.

239
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,588
There's something that you should know.

240
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,757
Sometimes in the real world,

241
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,167
a director will change a
scene at the last minute.

242
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,036
This is one of those cases.

243
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,845
sometimes in the real world,

244
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:52,582
a director will change a
scene at the last minute.

245
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,450
This is one of those cases.

246
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:56,552
What do you know?
There's going to be a twist.

247
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,287
I'm thinking "They're
going to pull our models."

248
00:11:58,355 --> 00:11:59,755
"I sculpted boobs on this".

249
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:01,624
"If they give me a guy, I'm screwed."

250
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:06,162
This week, your models are all...

251
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,731
Dancers.

252
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,167
And your zombies will now be performing

253
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:14,303
a choreographed dance
routine on the reveal stage

254
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:16,505
in front of the judges.

255
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:19,275
So, that means the judges are
going to be looking very closely

256
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:21,677
to make sure that your makeup holds up.

257
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:25,548
So please rethink your
makeups accordingly, okay?

258
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:27,717
- Good luck. 
- You got it.

259
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:29,752
I was like, "Are you kidding me?"

260
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,855
- All right. 
- That's awesome.

261
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:34,557
What's your character?

262
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,192
It's a zombie.

263
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,128
McKenzie tells us the zombies
are going to be dancing now.

264
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:43,099
Well, it kind of helped make up my...

265
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,767
it threw...

266
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:46,869
I'm...

267
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:48,304
The thing is, I was going to do

268
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:50,273
this shark attack zombie in a wetsuit,

269
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,374
and I've worn a wetsuit.

270
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:53,009
They're not maneuverable.

271
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,645
So I'm trying to think of a different idea

272
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:56,646
other than a wetsuit right now.

273
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:59,715
No intestines hanging out?

274
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:01,317
I think they might trip now.

275
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:04,253
I had planned originally for
this really cinematic entrance.

276
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:08,157
I wanted 10-15 feet of
intestines dangling out of her,

277
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:09,759
dragging on the floor behind her.

278
00:13:09,826 --> 00:13:11,327
It was going to be gross.

279
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,397
I need a wardrobe change.

280
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:15,998
I just crapped my pants.

281
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,568
I have to change my medium.

282
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:21,504
I was going to cast originally in silicone.

283
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:22,738
Oh, no.

284
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,907
But not if they're going to be moving.

285
00:13:24,975 --> 00:13:25,977
The whole dance twist

286
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:28,077
hasn't really changed
any part of my design,

287
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:30,579
except, forget silicone.
I'm running on foam.

288
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,615
Definitely no silicone or gelatin.

289
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:34,050
They're going to be
sweating their asses off.

290
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,551
I was considering it... full foam.

291
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:37,153
I'm going foam with this.

292
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,621
Yeah, this is all foam now.

293
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:41,123
Gelatin breaks down with sweat huge.

294
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:42,258
It will melt right off of you.

295
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:44,226
Silicone would be way too heavy.

296
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:47,430
So a lot of people have had
to resort to foam latex,

297
00:13:47,497 --> 00:13:49,966
which to me is appropriate
for zombie work anyway

298
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,767
because they can be more opaque.

299
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:53,436
If you make zombies look too translucent,

300
00:13:53,503 --> 00:13:54,937
they look fake.

301
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:57,006
Tate's doing this insane...

302
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:58,441
he's doing a Tate piece.

303
00:13:58,508 --> 00:14:01,444
Dude, that is one sick-looking face!

304
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:04,080
Me!

305
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,282
Yeah, I'm going the ground hamburger route.

306
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,883
Man, you.

307
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:12,588
Are you done with your sculpt already?

308
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:13,622
The body, yeah.

309
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,857
No ? Wow.

310
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:16,258
I went with zombie prostitute

311
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:19,395
because prostitutes are
scary enough as it is.

312
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:21,330
I think what the judges are
definitely going to be looking for

313
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:24,266
is pieces falling off.

314
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,669
That is not happening to me.

315
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:28,104
Now that they're dancing...

316
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:29,438
kind of threw some people for a loop.

317
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:30,840
Some other people just went with it.

318
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,641
It didn't slow me down at all.

319
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:33,943
That looks awesome.

320
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,711
It's supposed to be plastic surgery.

321
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,313
I'm going to have saline
underneath, like, fake water.

322
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:38,381
I dig it.

323
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:39,615
My plan of attack today

324
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:40,850
is to sculpt and mold the breasts,

325
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,084
add detail,

326
00:14:42,152 --> 00:14:44,120
and then focus on the face tomorrow,

327
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:47,256
because to me the face is
the most important thing.

328
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:49,725
- How's it going, Tom? 
- It's going.

329
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:52,228
I love the fact that you do
anything you want to a zombie

330
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:55,164
but it won't die unless you
take off its head or burn them.

331
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:57,800
This is going to be a zombie
that has been run over.

332
00:14:57,868 --> 00:15:00,503
So he's going to have a squished stomach

333
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,972
with a huge tire mark across it.

334
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,407
Delicious.

335
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:05,741
I'm really going to try to create

336
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,643
the optical illusion that he's missing

337
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,045
a good chunk of his stomach.

338
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:10,413
If I can pull that off,

339
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,914
I think this is going to look really cool.

340
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:14,116
Do you like it?

341
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:15,117
Are you just saying that?

342
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:16,585
No.

343
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,187
I'm doing face, neck, arms, and hands

344
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,922
because I don't want to deliver something

345
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,124
that's going to be similar
in style or fashion

346
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,292
to what someone else is doing.

347
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,728
After five hours of sculpting,

348
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,363
looking at the chest, looking at the face,

349
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:29,498
I feel like they really go together nicely.

350
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,000
I really like this belly.

351
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,668
I like how you blended
it out on the hip bone.

352
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,236
That's going to look really good.

353
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:37,073
Conor's design looks typical,

354
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,575
which isn't going to give
him the creative points.

355
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:42,578
Of course, Conor looks amazing, as usual.

356
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:46,248
I... his... his work looks amazing.

357
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:52,621
That's it everybody.
Tools down. Let's go home.

358
00:16:04,434 --> 00:16:06,936
So day two in the shop. I'm really excited.

359
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:08,704
My goal for the end of the day

360
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,639
is to mold my face sculpture.

361
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,842
Then I'm going to sculpt both
ears and start the chest.

362
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,711
Are you going big on the face?

363
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,746
Are you going to do, like, the zombie brow?

364
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,381
I'm leaving her mouth,

365
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,217
but everything's kind of torn away

366
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,119
kind of like in the middle
of getting a facelift.

367
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:24,320
My goal for today

368
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:27,389
is to sculpt the muscle
underneath the skin.

369
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:30,392
So I break out the 
"Gray's Anatomy" book

370
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,295
and I am seeing all the
muscles and everything.

371
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:36,398
Once my sculpture is finished,

372
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:39,235
I'll cover it in a
substance like wet cement

373
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,904
that hardens around it to make a mold.

374
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:44,406
When my mold is ready, I'll clean it out

375
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:46,709
and then I'll fill it with foam latex.

376
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:50,579
Just doing some more pieces.

377
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:51,780
Nice.

378
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:53,182
So, like he was all chomped on and stuff.

379
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,251
Then I'm going to make some sharp metal.

380
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,686
I'm really taking the
ball and running with it.

381
00:16:57,754 --> 00:17:00,623
I'm seeing the whole picture and loving it

382
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,758
because as an artist if you
can see that whole picture,

383
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:04,593
you can go for it.

384
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,531
Hey, guys.

385
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,633
- Hello. 
- How are y'all doing?

386
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,969
Patrick and I are here to
take a look at your works.

387
00:17:14,037 --> 00:17:15,371
How are you doing here?

388
00:17:15,438 --> 00:17:17,072
Unfortunately, I have
very little to show you.

389
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,109
It's almost an '80s-style zombie.

390
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:21,377
Got you.

391
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:22,978
I decided to go with zombie prostitute.

392
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:23,946
Cool concept.

393
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,581
What I'm trying to incorporate

394
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,050
is the anatomy underneath the skin.

395
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:30,553
I want the skin to look
like it's been peeled away

396
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,621
to look like it's been in
the middle of surgery.

397
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,123
Mm-hmm.

398
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:37,059
Having McKenzie and
Patrick look at our work,

399
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:40,229
it kind of makes you question
your whole artistic skills

400
00:17:40,297 --> 00:17:42,865
and whether you're going
to impress them or not.

401
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:45,634
Did the dancing challenge change anything?

402
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:48,170
My only concern was the arm appliances.

403
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:50,673
I didn't want to do silicone
because it's too heavy.

404
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,208
I decided to go with foam on those.

405
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:53,242
- Excellent. 
- Good work.

406
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,276
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

407
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,412
Well, interesting.

408
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,448
Some of them are actually quite
traditional in their designs.

409
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:02,184
And you got some very
original ideas as well.

410
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:04,019
Megan, for example, has a
very interesting concept.

411
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:09,525
What do you think about Tom's?

412
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:10,392
I think he went for something

413
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,527
more detailed in the sculpt.

414
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:12,795
He wanted to show maybe more

415
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:14,396
that he can actually deliver the goods.

416
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:15,698
When it comes to Anthony,

417
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,366
I'm a little worried that he decided

418
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:19,201
to paint on some of the internal organs

419
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:21,870
rather than sculpt them
into the prosthetics.

420
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:22,938
We'll see how it turns out.

421
00:18:23,006 --> 00:18:25,341
Good old Tate is going crazy.

422
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,343
He used wet clay, 
which was clever.

423
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,877
With a prosthetic that big,

424
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:31,714
it allowed him to sculpt a
lot of detail very fast.

425
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:32,881
All right, Patrick. Thank you.

426
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,149
My pleasure.

427
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:36,385
All right, everybody,
keep up the good work.

428
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:37,419
- Thank you, guys. 
- Thank you.

429
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:39,555
Bye. Take care.

430
00:18:43,793 --> 00:18:45,494
Five minutes, y'all!

431
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:47,062
The character's developing
right before my eyes.

432
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,465
I have the wig, I got the outfit.

433
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm not worried about my zombie at all.

434
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,339
In this challenge,

435
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,475
there are some that are
stronger than others.

436
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:03,279
From what I can see, Megan's is
weaker than everyone else's.

437
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:07,516
Everybody's looks awesome.

438
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:11,287
I didn't expect my stuff to be
as amazing as Conor's or Tate's,

439
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:15,524
but I'm actually getting pretty worried.

440
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:17,293
I'm wondering now, "Well, shoot,

441
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,862
does a zombie mean a tribute
to "Dawn Of The Dead?"

442
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,397
"Or anything else we've seen?"

443
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:25,934
Because mine is kind of
like "Hellraiser"looking.

444
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:28,704
"Two people going home" keeps
repeating over and over,

445
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,439
and I feel like my time is ending.

446
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm really scared.

447
00:19:43,581 --> 00:19:45,782
Today is application day.

448
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,851
Now that the prosthetic is set up,

449
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,453
it can be removed from the mold

450
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,355
and then applied to the
model's face and painted.

451
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:53,824
- How'd your pieces come out? 
- Very nice.

452
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,259
The Application Day

453
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,894
is when people's characters
start coming together.

454
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,262
That's when I start 
to get a little scared.

455
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:00,163
I start to second-guess myself

456
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,966
or I start to give myself false confidence.

457
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:04,635
This fits you like a glove.

458
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:09,506
This is going to be completely disgusting.

459
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:11,675
I will continue to choose
Deb whenever I can,

460
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,176
because she is like one of the dudes.

461
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,045
You're going to owe me a drink after this.

462
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,113
Yeah, right.

463
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,514
Joy is a good sport.

464
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,850
I think she has one concern
about the fat suit,

465
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,685
and that is limiting her motion.

466
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,421
Otherwise, she's in it to win it.

467
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,923
Slide on in.

468
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,924
Hello.

469
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:27,925
Diana comes over.

470
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:29,192
She's actually really excited

471
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,361
because the last time we worked together

472
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:34,131
it was the alien challenge, which I won.

473
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:35,799
This is all going to be kind of torn open

474
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:36,967
so we can see all the carnage.

475
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,303
Oh, amazing. Okay. I'm excited.

476
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,840
I... I... that's a really nice breast.

477
00:20:48,212 --> 00:20:49,279
Oh, wow.

478
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,081
Today two people have to go home.

479
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,816
- Oh. Really? 
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

480
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:57,854
Every competition, the judges
have criticized my paint job,

481
00:20:57,922 --> 00:21:00,157
because I never have enough time
to paint it the way I want it.

482
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,825
I'm not going to let that happen this time.

483
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,226
Painting is one of my strongest points

484
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,628
and I need them to know that.

485
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,034
I'm in trouble because of time management.

486
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:13,403
I got so caught up in the paint

487
00:21:13,471 --> 00:21:15,272
that I didn't get a chance to
do everything I wanted to do.

488
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,040
Tom what's that clock say?

489
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:19,109
- 30 minutes. - Thank you.

490
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,345
Once I put the first coat of the wash

491
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:23,246
and I saw the wrinkles come to life,

492
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,015
I was, like, "Holy crap".

493
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,717
"I've got something good here."

494
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,385
Gage's is looking pretty cool.

495
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,920
Tate's looks incredible.

496
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,755
- Conor.
- Lift your head up, please.

497
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,124
He is a talented, trained artist.

498
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,259
There's some not so impressive stuff.

499
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:39,830
Anthony is body-painting
organs, which could hurt him.

500
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:43,100
I mean, we're going in
front of zombie experts.

501
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,535
I did glance over at
Megan's a couple times.

502
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,504
Little concerned about what
she's got going on in the face.

503
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,206
It's very bloody.

504
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,942
There is this fine line
between utilizing blood

505
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,011
and using blood to cover things up.

506
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,279
Tom's is a pretty cool idea,

507
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,715
but he isn't going in the right
direction with his wrinkle lines.

508
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:01,718
We're just freaking out

509
00:22:01,786 --> 00:22:04,655
because we all know a group
elimination is coming.

510
00:22:04,722 --> 00:22:06,089
It definitely raised the bar.

511
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,905
So we're backstage and its last looks time.

512
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,809
I think the majority of worry
that I have is about Joy's arm

513
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,812
because there's a distinct line
between prosthetic and hand

514
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,647
and that's really bothering me.

515
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:33,016
You look disgusting.

516
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:35,619
I'm worried a little bit about the tongue.

517
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,488
If she does the caterpillar or something,

518
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:41,425
it could bend straight
up and be in her face.

519
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:42,893
- Time, please! 
- 12 minutes.

520
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:47,998
I wanted mine to look bloody,

521
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,866
but not actually be bloody.

522
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:52,269
Because if they are bloody and
they're rolling on the floor

523
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:54,004
and jumping up and down, they're
going to fling blood everywhere

524
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,206
and stick to everything.

525
00:22:56,274 --> 00:23:00,043
I'm really worried because I think
I overdid it with the blood.

526
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,079
You cover stuff with blood,
you usually get ridiculed.

527
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:03,914
I mean, the lights...

528
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,249
that's just going to shine
out red like a candy apple.

529
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:21,064
Welcome to the "Face Off" reveal stage.

530
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,801
Tonight, two of you will be eliminated.

531
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:28,972
Say, hello to your judges.

532
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,842
Owner of Optic Nerve Makeup
Effects Studio Glenn Hetrick.

533
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,577
Good evening, guys.

534
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,512
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

535
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,680
Hi, everybody.

536
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,348
Creature designer and director

537
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,616
Patrick Tatopoulos.

538
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,718
- Hello, everyone. 
- Hi, Patrick.

539
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:45,222
And your guest judge this week
is a special effects legend

540
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:47,824
who's worked on everything
from "Transformers",

541
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:49,926
to "Sin City", to "The
Chronicles Of Narnia",

542
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:52,062
and "The Walking Dead".

543
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,165
Please welcome two-time Emmy
Award-winner Greg Nicotero.

544
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,334
- Hey, guys. 
- Hi, Greg.

545
00:23:57,401 --> 00:24:01,772
Our judge this week
is Greg Nicotero.

546
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,143
He's such a legend in the effects
community and well-respected.

547
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,478
I'm so nervous right now.

548
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:09,913
So this week your Spotlight Challenge

549
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,048
was to create an original zombie makeup.

550
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:14,184
Then we threw a twist at you.

551
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,486
Not only does your zombie
need to look amazing,

552
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:20,023
but they must also survive
a full-on dance routine.

553
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,591
Now before we see the performance,

554
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:22,959
let's check out your zombies.

555
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:35,438
I'm really happy with
everything that I created

556
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:37,607
concerning my character,
right down the background.

557
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:39,242
Because it's really important.

558
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,211
These judges, they want to
see a complete package.

559
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,313
I feel like I've delivered that very well.

560
00:24:58,229 --> 00:24:59,996
I'm feeling pretty good.

561
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:03,266
I think she looks very
stylish and very cool.

562
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,202
It's pretty much what I envisioned.

563
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,511
I had a zombie hooker...

564
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,147
face falling off, sliding
all over the place.

565
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,516
I had a whole character behind my zombie.

566
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:23,985
The big difference with this

567
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:26,389
Spotlight Challenge is
that two people go home.

568
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:27,557
So I'm starting to get a little scared.

569
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:37,234
I love my zombie. He's cool.

570
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:40,403
The paint came out exactly
how I wanted it to.

571
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:42,639
He looks like shoe leather.

572
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:53,850
Joy's outfit is hilarious.

573
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:57,787
In a roomful of drab zombies,
she really does stand out.

574
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,522
But it's the arms that I'm worried about.

575
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,591
Didn't have the coloration that I wanted.

576
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:02,993
It was just rushed.

577
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:21,845
I feel that I covered too much
of my sculpture with blood.

578
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:40,330
Deb's a nutjob.

579
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,766
Deb takes the ball that I hand her

580
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,769
and then she just runs downfield with it.

581
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:47,504
The piece fits her perfectly.

582
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:49,539
She has sold every makeup I've put on her.

583
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,640
I couldn't be happier.

584
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:57,847
So now let's see if they can stay intact.

585
00:26:57,915 --> 00:26:59,253
This dance was choreographed

586
00:26:59,254 --> 00:27:01,117
by the hot young duo Craig and Lindsay,

587
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:03,420
fittingly put to the song "Zombie"

588
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:06,156
by recording artist Natalia Kills.

589
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:07,524
Let's bring on the zombies.

590
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,598
The lights drop and all of
the zombies fall into place

591
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,234
and I'm terrified that that
tongue is going to hit the floor

592
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:21,571
and bend some odd direction.

593
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,073
Coming up...

594
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,841
You see the undead come
to life and then boogie.

595
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,076
It's the coolest thing.

596
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,178
I would shoot that tomorrow.

597
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:29,479
Great.

598
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,780
Don't put things over their mouth.

599
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:32,782
It's a stunning makeup.

600
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:39,784
Everything needs to hold
up to this dance routine,

601
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:41,212
that is the challenge.

602
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:42,981
So my fingers are crossed.

603
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,559
That was great.

604
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:36,861
I'm looking, everything
seems to be in place,

605
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:38,162
the tongue is intact,

606
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,199
guts are still all held in with that sack.

607
00:29:41,266 --> 00:29:44,235
There was not one drop of
blood, not one smear of goo.

608
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,603
Nothing on the floor.

609
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:47,405
We all seemed to pull it together

610
00:29:47,473 --> 00:29:49,674
and do a pretty good Job.

611
00:29:49,742 --> 00:29:51,643
To see the undead come
to life and then boogie,

612
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,611
it's the coolest thing.

613
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:05,857
Judges, why don't you take a closer look?

614
00:30:11,864 --> 00:30:13,564
That feels like a tendon.

615
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:14,799
Eww. Eww.

616
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,100
For whatever reason,

617
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:20,338
they spend 10 million years on my zombie.

618
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:23,241
And I was, like, "Oh, my God,
oh, my God," like, insanity.

619
00:30:23,308 --> 00:30:26,744
There's a, kind of a
creepiness to the sculpture.

620
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:29,747
It feels really leathery,
which I think is fantastic.

621
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,015
I'm not sure what this spike sticking out,

622
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,483
I don't know if that's supposed to be...

623
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,252
I think it's supposed to be a tooth.

624
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,288
- Tooth or a... 
- Couple of teeth in here, too.

625
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:39,257
This is Tom, yeah?

626
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:41,859
I've given up trying to
read their expressions

627
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:44,228
or their lips when they
take the closer look.

628
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:45,797
Tire tread.

629
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:48,299
I do notice that Ve notices

630
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:51,869
my tire tread mark and
I'm feelin' pretty good.

631
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:54,205
This way.

632
00:30:54,273 --> 00:30:55,406
I'm a little nervous

633
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:56,808
about the two people being sent home.

634
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,277
If the judges really just
look at the face piece,

635
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:00,845
I'll be okay.

636
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:02,346
This is an appliance here, too.

637
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:04,582
But it's the arms that I'm worried about.

638
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,751
There's a distinct line
between prosthetic and hand

639
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:10,521
and that's really bothering me.

640
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:12,390
There's some organs there,
there's a sternum.

641
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,524
Oh, dear, she's stuck.

642
00:31:13,592 --> 00:31:14,992
There's so much blood,

643
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,995
it's really hard to see exactly
what that sculpt looks like.

644
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:20,965
Okay.

645
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:26,504
The judges would like to
speak with each of you

646
00:31:26,572 --> 00:31:28,339
to learn more about your work.

647
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:30,308
So, Tom, if you'd please step forward.

648
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:38,783
Glenn, let's start with you.

649
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:41,352
Although I do love the asymmetry
and I think that you really

650
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,396
tried to get in there

651
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:44,489
with the limited time
that you had to sculpt,

652
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:47,492
I have some big problems
with the weight of the skin

653
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:49,293
and physically how the skin decays

654
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:51,195
and the patterns of the wrinkles.

655
00:31:51,263 --> 00:31:52,964
If you would have gotten in
there and done some, like,

656
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:55,900
tight veining or modeling,
that might have helped, also,

657
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:57,168
with the sculpt.

658
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:58,436
Totally understand what you're saying,

659
00:31:58,504 --> 00:32:00,171
but I feel that my zombie

660
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:02,440
is a little beyond vein work

661
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:03,808
because he's pretty leather.

662
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:07,245
I love the idea of the tire tracks

663
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:08,212
and all that whole scenario.

664
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,547
Thank you.

665
00:32:09,615 --> 00:32:12,350
But the overall concept was kind of boring.

666
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:15,019
I do have to agree with Glenn
that some of the texturing

667
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:17,588
in the sculpture was a little
bit distracting for me.

668
00:32:17,656 --> 00:32:19,791
I felt the brow was maybe
a little bit heavy

669
00:32:19,858 --> 00:32:22,059
and the wrinkles across the
forehead looked a little carved.

670
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:25,363
Thank you very much. You can step back.

671
00:32:29,735 --> 00:32:31,169
Tate. If you would please step forward.

672
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,339
How you doin', girl?

673
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:40,511
Hi, guys.

674
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:42,079
There's some things that you know are

675
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:44,048
in diametrical opposition
to things that I've said.

676
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:47,485
Don't put things over their mouth

677
00:32:47,553 --> 00:32:48,753
so that they can't articulate

678
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:50,154
and they couldn't perform,

679
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:52,056
but you decided to go ahead and do that.

680
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:55,193
Glenn seems to be the hardest
of the judges to impress.

681
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,694
He looks me in the eye and, you know,

682
00:32:56,762 --> 00:32:58,329
"You chose to do a static mouth.

683
00:32:58,397 --> 00:32:59,530
"I know you didn't forget."

684
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:01,966
And I was like, 
"Crap, I'm going home."

685
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:07,574
There's some things that you know are

686
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:09,642
in diametrical opposition
to things that I've said.

687
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:13,613
Don't put things over their mouths

688
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:15,748
so that they can't articulate
and they couldn't perform

689
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:17,283
and clearly you knew you were doing that

690
00:33:17,351 --> 00:33:18,918
when you designed this make-up

691
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:20,353
but you decided to go ahead and do that.

692
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,191
I respect that decision and it paid off.

693
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:27,160
Thank you.

694
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:28,761
It's the success of a zombie makeup

695
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:29,996
and I'm really happy with it.

696
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:32,232
Thank you very much.

697
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:36,102
Well, I gotta say she was most
effective when she walked out.

698
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,605
I love the whole broken
back routine and the walk.

699
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:40,273
You did a great job.

700
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:41,741
Thank you very much.

701
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:44,077
What are those slashing on the...

702
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:48,548
what I basically saw, a grab
from behind and tear open.

703
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:50,783
Opening. Okay. Very cool.

704
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:53,119
I wanted to emphasize the fingernail trails

705
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:54,854
as they ripped her flesh open.

706
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:01,027
Sorry, I think about these things.

707
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:02,795
Well, you should think about those things.

708
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:05,098
That's part of our job.

709
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:06,266
I thought it's great.

710
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,600
I really appreciate that.

711
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:08,501
Thank you, Deb.

712
00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:10,670
Let's talk to Sam.

713
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:18,511
Sam, tell me about your back story.

714
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,947
I wanted her to look a lot different from

715
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,882
the other female zombies that
were gonna be out here today.

716
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:25,251
A lot of them were gonna
be on the skeletal side,

717
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,820
and so I thought bigger
is better in this case,

718
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:29,022
she'll stand out a little bit more.

719
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,357
I think that's very, very successful.

720
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,526
Since you were going with
kind of a fat makeup,

721
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:34,519
it would have been nice

722
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,329
to maybe build the neck
out a little bit more

723
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:40,500
so that it didn't just look like
she had kind of chubby cheeks.

724
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:42,368
Did she have appliances on her arms?

725
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:44,003
She does. Yeah.

726
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:45,972
Is that what I'm seeing is
the end of the appliance?

727
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,973
Yeah.

728
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,541
Not so good, huh?

729
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:49,676
But, all in all,

730
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:51,844
I think you did a very effective makeup.

731
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:52,745
Thank you.

732
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:56,282
Gage, please step forward.

733
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:04,223
The shrapnel ticking out...

734
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,825
That's good.

735
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:08,027
If you're talking about a guy
who was in a plane crash

736
00:35:08,095 --> 00:35:11,331
had this horrible explosion and
there's shrapnel in his face,

737
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:15,101
the hat would probably be either
burned off or fused to his head.

738
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:16,436
Absolutely.

739
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,604
I think the left hand is highly successful

740
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:21,407
in showing anatomy underneath there.

741
00:35:21,475 --> 00:35:23,309
My big concern is the color.

742
00:35:23,377 --> 00:35:25,979
You used a lot of warm colors.

743
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,447
Was that a creative decision

744
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:29,549
or did the makeup kind
of go in that direction?

745
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:31,317
Originally, I was trying to do

746
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:34,854
a lot more blues and
purples towards the wound.

747
00:35:34,922 --> 00:35:36,556
As I did that, though,

748
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:38,057
he started to lose a lot of
the depth and a lot of that,

749
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,994
so I stopped doing that and
it went in this direction.

750
00:35:41,061 --> 00:35:44,464
But the pinkish overall
tone is a problem for me.

751
00:35:44,531 --> 00:35:45,765
Other than that, I think it's really cool.

752
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,300
Thank you.

753
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:49,836
I love that look, I think
it's very powerful.

754
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:52,905
It's like creating a
strong, bold direction.

755
00:35:52,973 --> 00:35:54,640
Thank you, guys.

756
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,176
Gage, thank you very much.

757
00:35:57,244 --> 00:35:59,579
Megan, you are next, please.

758
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,651
Can you tell us the story of ts character?

759
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:09,489
A lot of people tend to get
plastic surgery living in L.A.

760
00:36:09,556 --> 00:36:13,893
And I figured that they would
go and cut her face off

761
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:15,928
and everything that they fixed on her.

762
00:36:15,996 --> 00:36:19,599
This idea of exposing
the silicone underneath

763
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,467
is a great one.

764
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:24,103
On the face, sculpturally,
it seems like you got there

765
00:36:24,171 --> 00:36:26,172
but it's just so heavy on the blood gel.

766
00:36:28,175 --> 00:36:29,609
The whole face being peeled off,

767
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,110
it's a really cute idea.

768
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:35,548
I think you went a little
heavy-handed with the blood.

769
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:37,850
Megan, I want to give you
a 10 for the concept.

770
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:39,986
I think it's the best concept tonight.

771
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:41,854
I think everybody agrees
with that, that this,

772
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:43,222
conceptually speaking,
that was a great idea.

773
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,893
Great sculpture drives a lot
of the power of the makeup

774
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,161
and sometimes you have to make sure

775
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:49,128
that you don't cover it too much.

776
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:54,734
Anthony, please step forward.

777
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:04,010
I think you kind of failed a little bit

778
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:05,344
on the sculpture on her face.

779
00:37:05,412 --> 00:37:07,547
It doesn't really have
a lot of detail in it.

780
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:09,115
It looks a little lopsided

781
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:11,451
and not really well thought out to me.

782
00:37:12,886 --> 00:37:14,620
I'm kind of bummed out.

783
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:17,557
My biggest thing is, actually,

784
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:19,892
is that everything sort of
becomes one blob in the top.

785
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,961
But it's one of the concepts
I thought were interesting

786
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,196
so I've got to give you that.

787
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:24,630
Thank you.

788
00:37:24,698 --> 00:37:26,466
I don't know where the clothing ends

789
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:29,702
and where the chest appliance
begins and where the bra is

790
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,171
because the color of her wardrobe

791
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,273
and the color of some of the painting.

792
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:36,242
It's hard for me to really
see where one starts

793
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,743
and the other one ends.

794
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:38,945
I can definitely see what you're saying.

795
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:49,921
Conor, if you would please step forward.

796
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:58,764
I would shoot that tomorrow
on any zombie movie.

797
00:37:58,832 --> 00:37:59,799
I think it's amazing.

798
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,601
Appreciate it.

799
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:04,770
You got every detail 
absolutely perfect,

800
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:08,474
right down to her arms, her fingernails.

801
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,610
You even aged her hair to the right color.

802
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:12,545
It's-it's a stunning makeup.

803
00:38:12,613 --> 00:38:13,679
Thank you.

804
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:15,148
The only thing I was not impressed with

805
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:16,315
was your concept.

806
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:19,018
I felt it was not something very original.

807
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:26,826
Glenn, why don't you tell
us about the top looks.

808
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:30,830
This week, our top two looks are...

809
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:34,100
Conor, for excelling in both
sculpting and painting.

810
00:38:34,168 --> 00:38:35,368
Thank you.

811
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:37,270
And Tate...

812
00:38:37,337 --> 00:38:41,073
For really strong concept,
creative, bold decisions.

813
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:42,008
So who's the winner?

814
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:46,412
This week's winner is...

815
00:38:51,718 --> 00:38:53,019
Tate.

816
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:55,721
Oh . Whoo!

817
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:57,623
Come on, now.

818
00:38:57,691 --> 00:38:59,091
That's what I'm talkin' about.

819
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,560
Thank you, guys.

820
00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:01,594
Thank you so much.

821
00:39:03,797 --> 00:39:06,599
McKenzie. High five.

822
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:09,835
I've been busting my ass
off to get them to notice

823
00:39:09,903 --> 00:39:12,905
that I'm here for a reason, so I'm psyched.

824
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:13,839
Whoo, okay.

825
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:17,510
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you.

826
00:39:17,578 --> 00:39:19,145
You have earned the right
to advise the judges

827
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:22,348
on which two contestants you
feel should be eliminated.

828
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:24,584
The rest of you can head
back to the makeup room

829
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:27,053
until the judges have
reached their decision.

830
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,087
Thank you.

831
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:37,797
Well, congratulations, Tate.

832
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:38,831
Thank you.

833
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:40,433
Who do you think did the worst job

834
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,703
this week on this challenge and why?

835
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,171
This isn't easy.

836
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:51,077
I would have to nominate, possibly, Megan.

837
00:39:51,144 --> 00:39:55,448
I have yet to see something that
kind of creatively defines her.

838
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:59,085
I would prefer not to... to do a second.

839
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:00,453
Thanks, Tate.

840
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,655
- Thank you, Tate.
- Thank you very much, guys.

841
00:40:02,723 --> 00:40:04,624
Good Job, Tate.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

842
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:06,392
All right, judges.
Let's talk about Anthony.

843
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,526
What are your thoughts?

844
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:09,195
That was a bit of a mess.

845
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:11,897
I think he had a great idea in his head

846
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:13,699
but I just don't think he
ever really got it there.

847
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:16,402
It's just at this point,
he's out of his depth

848
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,838
with what's left here as far
as the competition goes.

849
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,339
Let's move on to Megan.

850
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:21,707
Conceptually,

851
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:24,644
it was more interesting than
some of the other makeups.

852
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:25,911
The idea was great.

853
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:27,947
I just don't think that the execution

854
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:31,083
quite fulfilled the idea.

855
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:33,519
That makeup could have
been done in 45 minutes

856
00:40:33,587 --> 00:40:35,855
out of construction makeup out of the kit.

857
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:37,056
And what do you think about Tom?

858
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:40,126
Tom, that is one traditional,

859
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:43,562
plain zombie with not too much to...

860
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,064
Create something unique and special.

861
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:48,134
Bottom line, it really could
have been a pullover mask.

862
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:51,237
I think that maybe tom's
makeup was stronger.

863
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:54,640
- Yeah.
- But that Megan's concept was stronger.

864
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,175
It's a tough one.

865
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:58,411
So, judges, have you reached your decision?

866
00:40:58,478 --> 00:41:01,447
- Yeah. 
- We have.

867
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:04,150
Glenn, why don't you tell
us about the bottom looks?

868
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:05,418
Anthony,

869
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,653
you had significant sculptural mistakes

870
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:09,855
and critical flaws in your color.

871
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:15,528
Tom, tonight's challenge had
creativity and originality

872
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:17,463
in the overall concept

873
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:21,600
and I think that's where
you fell down this week.

874
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:25,237
Megan, I-I see what you're trying to do,

875
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:29,275
but for me, the blood's obscuring it.

876
00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:32,344
Glenn, who is the first
person going home tonight?

877
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,681
The first person going home tonight is...

878
00:41:41,688 --> 00:41:42,555
Anthony.

879
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:48,961
If you would please head
back to the makeup room

880
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,163
and pack up your kit.

881
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:53,433
Again, judges, thank you so much.
It's been a pleasure.

882
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:55,868
Bye, guys. Thank you.

883
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:01,440
I'm going home.

884
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:04,777
You did good, man.

885
00:42:13,954 --> 00:42:15,721
One more of you is going home tonight.

886
00:42:17,758 --> 00:42:20,626
So, Glenn, who else has been eliminated?

887
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:23,028
The second person going home tonight is...

888
00:42:28,694 --> 00:42:31,552
So, Glenn, who else is
going to be eliminated?

889
00:42:32,798 --> 00:42:35,333
The second person going home tonight is...

890
00:42:40,005 --> 00:42:40,838
Tom.

891
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:49,681
Tom, I'm sorry, but you
have been eliminated.

892
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:50,915
That's cool.

893
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:52,517
Guys, once again, thank you.

894
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:54,786
And I'll be seeing you again, I'm sure.

895
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:57,288
- Good luck, Tom. 
- Good luck.

896
00:43:03,362 --> 00:43:05,530
- I'm going home, guys. 
- What?

897
00:43:05,598 --> 00:43:08,166
- Yes, sir. 
- Get the... out of here.

898
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:10,702
What they were looking for
wasn't what I gave them.

899
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:11,703
So...

900
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,972
Wow.

901
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:16,407
There has been some amazing
moments on this show,

902
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:19,110
and a lot of moments that
I'm super proud of...

903
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:20,778
images that I never want to forget.

904
00:43:22,181 --> 00:43:23,581
Being a part of this show,

905
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:27,352
being able to showcase my
makeup to the whole world,

906
00:43:27,419 --> 00:43:28,319
I had fun.

907
00:43:29,822 --> 00:43:31,730
And that's all life is about.
