is challenge is all about
nude body painting.

6

Serge's model's still just
standing there nude. I'm, like...

7
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,122
Frank is just done.

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,592
He slept through the [beep] bar challenge,
he slept through the tattoo challenge.

00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,694

McKenzie: Who is going home tonight?

12
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,365
Glenn: Sergio.

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,302
<i>And tonight on "Face Off"...</i>

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,339
I have a very special guest,
my dad Mike Westmore.

15
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,907
Holy crap, we're gonna do aliens.

16
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,574
What are you doing
and what am I doing?

17
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,278
Tate: That's dope.
That's so good.

18
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,014
It will literally be
down to the second.

19
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,150
You both had your heads
up your asses.

20
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,252
What in the hell were you thinking?

21
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,154
- You've done a really nice job here.
- Oh, thank you.

What up, y'all?

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,668
Yesterday, I thought for sure

38
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,604
Frank would've ended up
on the chopping block.

39
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:21,040
I was unbelievably shocked
that Frank walked out safe.

40
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,475
- Yeah.
- No way.

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,676
Conor: Yeah.

44
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,483
Anthony:
If we do team challenges today,

45
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,852
I pray to God that
I don't get Frank.

46
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,119
[laughs]

47
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,992
What's up?

48
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,960
Megan: Me and Conor click very well,

49
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,731
and I haven't gotten, uh,
to click with somebody

50
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,066
like this in, I don't think, ever.

51
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,169
You're sculpture looked...
Or your statue looked amazing.

52
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,971
There was a little bit
of a tongue in cheek joke,

53
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,607
like, with the bird poop
and the feathers.

54
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,342
I thought that was awesome.

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,511
I actually thought... I was,
like, "Hey, I'm being creative."

56
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,613
It's fun. It's nice.
We have a lot in common.

57
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,317
And he's very, uh, nice.
[laughs]

58
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,885
I'm glad you stayed.

59
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,486
Thank you.

60
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,102
Gage: I don't know, this is crazy.

61
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,104
When we came up to this location,

62
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:28,608
I recognized it immediately from
"Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey".

63
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,877
I was, all, "Hey."
And Star Trek, of course.

64
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,179
Frank: I've never been up here,
so it was really exciting

65
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,315
to actually get to walk around a little
bit, and get to see these big rocks

66
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,883
and these cool formations.
It's awesome.

67
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,956
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

68
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,559
Welcome to one of
the most iconic locations

69
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,263
in motion picture history...
Vasquez Rocks.

70
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,599
Countless Hollywood movies,
including some of the most famous

71
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,470
science fiction projects, like
"Star Trek", have come to life here.

72
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,807
I have a very special
guest with us here today.

73
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,209
He's most well-known
for his 18 years

74
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,711
with the "Star Trek" franchise.

75
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,647
He has won nine Emmys, an Oscar,

76
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,216
and he's also my dad.

77
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,786
Please welcome Mike Westmore.

78
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,688
Anthony: I was really excited
about meeting Michael Westmore.

79
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,591
The guy's created countless aliens.
He's a legend.

80
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,360
All right, guys, this is your chance

81
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,062
to do something
literally out of this world.

82
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,264
Your spotlight challenge
is based on a recent

83
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,266
scientific discovery
of a new planet.

84
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,837
You will work in teams of two,
and create an alien species

85
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,639
that might actually exist
on what appears to be

86
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:37,510
the first planet besides Earth
capable ofustaining life...

87
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,777
Gliese 581 g.

88
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,348
Holy crap, we're gonna do aliens.

89
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,718
So, Dad, you have
created more aliens

90
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,688
than just about anybody I know,
at least on this planet.

91
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,491
Can you please tell them what it
takes to make a convincing alien?

92
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,127
The idea is to keep it away
from being a humanoid.

93
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,663
We're doing an alien. That is
restructuring the bone structure.

94
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,299
The texture of the skin
that you finally put on it

95
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,201
is important, to kind of
change that a bit,

96
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,303
and coloring, getting away
from the beiges and the pinks.

97
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,506
And then there's
all the little extras

98
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,342
you can throw onto it,
fingernails and teeth.

99
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,211
The one thing
is to keep the eyes open.

100
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:13,613
This is the windows of the soul.

101
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,482
So get in there
and have fun with it.

102
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,720
You've been placed into
teams of two randomly.

103
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,357
Team number one is...

104
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,060
Frank and Anthony.

105
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:30,296
There is no justice in the world

106
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,398
when they partnered me with Frank.

107
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,668
Team two, Conor and Jo.

108
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,204
Jo: I couldn't be happier
to be teamed up with Conor.

109
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,640
I think we're gonna do
really well on this challenge.

110
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,176
Team three is Megan and Tom.

111
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,745
- We got this.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,815
Team four, Marcel and Gage.

113
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,184
All right.
You know.

114
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,885
Team five, Tate and Sam.

115
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,090
When you get back to the workshop,

116
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:00,126
I've also set up this
very brief video there for you

117
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,696
so you can learn more
about Gliese 581 g.

118
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,498
It's very important
that you pay attention

119
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,934
because you're gonna wanna
use these details

120
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,236
in the creation of your alien.
Good luck.

121
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,505
Thank you.

122
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,207
I don't know how to
wow Mike Westmore.

123
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,110
He's the guy that invented
every alien you've ever seen on camera,

124
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,578
so if we can accomplish this,

125
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,512
then I'm gonna feel like
king of the hill.

126
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,285
Anthony: After you, sir.

127
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,026
<i>Video: Welcome, competitors,
to Gliese 581 g.</i>

128
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,864
<i>Located in the constellation
Libra 20 light years from Earth,</i>

129
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,100
<i>Gliese 581 g is
the most Earth-like planet</i>

130
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,003
<i>found outside of the solar system.</i>

131
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,606
Tate: I was really excited
because I knew about Gliese 581.

132
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,708
I'm a weirdo with outer space.
I love that stuff.

133
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,644
<i>Video: Favorable atmospheric
conditions could permit</i>

134
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,047
<i>the presence of liquid water,
a necessity of all known life.</i>

135
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,416
It's aquatic.

136
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,154
<i>Active plate tectonics have
disrupted the planet's surface,</i>

137
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,556
<i>resulting in significant
volcanic activity.</i>

138
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,892
No seasons, no tilt.

139
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,195
<i>Gliese 581 g's fixed
orientation towards it's star</i>

140
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,331
<i>leaves it permanently
light on one half,</i>

141
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,033
<i>and permanently dark on the other.</i>

142
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,602
But even the light
is not a lot of light.

143
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,738
Which means it'll be very pale.

144
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,273
<i>We hope you enjoy your stay.</i>

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,974
As soon as we watched the video,

146
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,743
that was when everything
started really coming together.

147
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,511
Stefan looks cool.

148
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,812
Come with us, Rob.

149
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:35,354
So we're having a creature that's
squatting because of the gravity.

150
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,890
Sam and I have already just kind of

151
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,393
telepathically agreed on a look.

152
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,628
We've got creature pushed down.

153
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,564
- A kind of crab walk.
- Right.

154
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,567
It's a mammal, so they
would do live birth.

155
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,268
Then we could have multiple, like,

156
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,604
mammary available
in case they have...

157
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,439
Like pups, you know what I mean?

158
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,842
We have the womb,
which is closer to the ground...

159
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,212
- So this is able to form up.
- Exactly.

160
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,548
They could actually be spending
the majority of the time submerged.

161
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,951
They're an evolution
of aquatic mammal.

162
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,921
Tate really wants to
have him on his back.

163
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,591
I'm nervous about it,
but I came on to this competition

164
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,193
to take some risks,
and so I'm thinking I'm gonna go for it.

165
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,096
That's dope.
That's so good.

166
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,365
- So, I'm just kind of sketching out...
- I love it.

167
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,067
Megan: We want our creature to live

168
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,102
on the dark side of the planet,

169
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,738
and that, with
the temperature being cold,

170
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:30,643
he's going to have to dig close
to the volcano to keep warm.

171
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,846
So therefore, he has claws.

172
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,948
He's got a great shape to him.

173
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,917
I totally want to do a chest piece.

174
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,986
Tom: The face, chest, and arms

175
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,954
we plan on making out of foam latex.

176
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,123
The reason being is that
it moves real well,

177
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,158
we'll be able to paint it
beautifully with an airbrush,

178
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,994
and I'm excited
to see it come to life.

179
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,430
I reminds me of the movies
I grew up on, and I love it.

180
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,233
- I'm gonna start getting
some of our materials, okay? - Cool.

181
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,403
This is a couple different designs that,
you know, I'm playing with here.

182
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,705
This would be, like,
soft, wrinkly tissue

183
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,507
that emanates out from an ear hole,

184
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,409
and it would be, like,
really gelatinous. - Okay.

185
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,346
Conor: I picture going with kind
of a pseudo-amphibious look.

186
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,916
She's female, but kind of
decadent, aging, intelligent.

187
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,653
You know, kind of like a heavy
undercarriage brain thing.

188
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,355
This is obviously very dramatic.

189
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:19,925
Conor's been doing special effects
longer than I've been alive.

190
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,261
If we did nails on her,
it would only show her finger.

191
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,863
Well, I don't know.

192
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,198
I'm hoping that he gives me
a little bit more leeway,

193
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,100
and gives me a little
bit more respect

194
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,337
than I think he has for me.

195
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,039
Okay, so do you wanna
get started on the face

196
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,741
and I'll get started on the back?

197
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,144
Gage: Our creature,
it's aquatic and land-dwelling,

198
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,448
but it exists in the darker half of
the hemisphere, so it was gonna be pale,

199
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,483
and kind of have
a transparency to its skin.

200
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,619
It should have these quills
that go down the back

201
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,255
because if it's in the wild,
like a porcupine,

202
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,790
they need to be able to
have some defense mechanism.

203
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,457
Cool.

204
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,897
Frank: So I was thinking maybe,
to get away from having to do

205
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,132
a lot a lot of stuff,
maybe they have technology,

206
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,001
maybe they're
more developed than us.

207
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,771
We can give them some sort of clothing,
like, retro kind of style.

208
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,907
Frank was, like,
we're gonna do an astronaut,

209
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,509
jet pack, ray gun,
rubber mask, it'll be quick,

210
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,044
and I was just not feeling it.

211
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,847
I feel that any
human-esque type fabric

212
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,251
automatically makes it more of
a Buck Rogers or Star Treky thing.

213
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:22,988
But I kind of like, like,
old school sci-fi kind of stuff.

214
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,390
Anthony just isn't feeling my idea.

215
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,492
I don't think
the judges are gonna dig

216
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,128
a Halloween costume,
like, a slip-over mask.

217
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,863
I'm, like, you gotta be
[bleep] kidding me.

218
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,665
You're just, like,
stacking stuff up.

219
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,333
I mean, like, that's
a lot of [bleep] to build.

220
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,069
You got a big back piece,
all these texture things.

221
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,605
I'm not going home for some retro alien.
I'm not doing it.

222
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:49,195
It is day one, and we just have a ton
of stuff to do. This is a huge project.

223
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:51,564
In two days, we're doing a face,

224
00:10:51,731 --> 00:10:53,600
a chest, two arms, two legs.

225
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:55,735
First thing, we have
to finish our sculptures,

226
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,404
because then we'll use those
sculptures to make our molds.

227
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,640
Okay, time starts now.

228
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:07,947
I want to at least get
the bulk of the sculpt done,

229
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,917
and at least maybe get
some start on the molds.

230
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:14,053
Frank and I finally
came to terms with an idea,

231
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,556
but we never came to
a complete sketch.

232
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:18,825
I go ahead and start sculpting.

233
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:20,226
We're going with
an aquatic type creature,

234
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:23,363
since the planet is mainly water.

235
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,999
I've really let Anthony kind
of take the reins on this.

236
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,502
My idea was an homage
to 50s sci-fi flicks,

237
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,137
but he shot that down.

238
00:11:31,304 --> 00:11:33,872
Anthony always acts like
he's got something to prove.

239
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,845
I'll start on the back,
fluffing the back out. How about that?

240
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,180
Jo: First day,
we have four hours in the shop.

241
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:43,016
Conor and I have a lot to get done.

242
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:47,720
We are doing a full head and a face
prosthetic, both out of silicone.

243
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:51,124
You know what I was thinking about,
too, is making a side piece.

244
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,394
Before we get into that, we may not
have as much silicone as we want.

245
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:57,363
I'm still trying to get a bead
on what Jo's talents are.

246
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,432
I haven't seen her sculpt yet.

247
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm still waiting to see
what she has to offer.

248
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,039
Sam: We're working with wet clay

249
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,041
because it's fast,
easy to sculpt with.

250
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:11,177
And this is a great place
to add in some asymmetry.

251
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:12,412
We've got six ground rockets.

252
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:13,913
[both laugh]

253
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,616
Tate: We're actually really
far on the sculpture.

254
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,985
Our goal is to have it done
by the end of the day.

255
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:21,487
So, rumor on the street
is that a lot of people

256
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:23,823
will be doing, like, aquatic stuff.

257
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,359
The concept behind
our alien is he sometimes

258
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,661
travels out to hunt,
hence the quills.

259
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,097
He needs a defense mechanism
because he's not a fast alien.

260
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:35,067
Once I get the back sculpt done,
we'll make those quills.

261
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:40,807
Anthony: Frank! Frank,
what the hell are you doing over there?

262
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,142
Before the day's out, there's
definitely gonna be punches flying.

263
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:44,911
[chuckles]

264
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:48,715
Frank goes out and
gets a cup of coffee.

265
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:49,949
Then he goes to get
another cup of coffee,

266
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,284
then he starts walking around.

267
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:53,619
- What's up, Franky?
- Just checking it out.

268
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,621
I'm working, I'm sweating,
I'm getting into it,

269
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,891
and all Frank can say is,
"No, no, no, I'm really fast."

270
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,227
Great, just [bleep] great.

271
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:03,162
[humming]

272
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,166
- You wanna come put this away with me?
- Yes.

273
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,835
Megan: Jo is, like,
not doing anything,

274
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:11,136
and this is just outrageous.

275
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,983
I think Megan's
incredibly jealous of Jo.

276
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,652
All she cares about is
"What's Jo doing over there?

277
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,756
"How come Jo's not
helping Conor? Where's Jo?

278
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,892
"Jo, Jo, Jo." I'm, like, what does
Jo have to do with our project?

279
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,562
There's much more than this
and this that meets the eye.

280
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,870
Getting the hard stares
when people walk by.

281
00:13:44,037 --> 00:13:45,772
Sam: Looking around
at everybody else's,

282
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,807
I realized that a lot of people
were playing it really safe,

283
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:50,009
completely the opposite
of what we were doing.

284
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:52,678
Sometimes you just
gotta have big balls.

285
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,552
Tom: I look over my shoulder,

286
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:02,055
and Megan's raking the sculpture down.
I'm losing it.

287
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,924
We got 10 minutes, Megan.
You're re-sculpting the whole face?

288
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,460
- I'm not resculpting. It's lopsided.
- Okay.

289
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,563
I was just, like, one step away
from done, and now we're back...

290
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,266
Mm-hmm, but it's just, it was...

291
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:14,933
Yeah.

292
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:21,874
All right, guys, that's it.
Clean up. Tools down.

293
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,409
Let's get out of here.

294
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,845
- Come on, Tate!
- Coming!

295
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,612
Tom: We got a lot of
work to do tomorrow.

296
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,520
Conor: It's Megan's birthday today.

297
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:38,391
We did a little celebration
before our workday started.

298
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,693
Make a wish, girl.
Find the courage.

299
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,062
Oh, I hope I win a challenge.

300
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:45,364
Visualize.

301
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,066
Yay, all right!

302
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:49,368
It's Megan's birthday.
Yay.

303
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:52,472
- How's the festivities next door?
- They made her a cake.

304
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,807
"We should make her a cake."
I don't think so, no.

305
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,675
She doesn't... No.
I don't think so.

306
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:01,247
Hey, Meg.
I know Anthony made you a cake.

307
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:04,951
I wanted to get you like
an ice cream cake or something,

308
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:07,420
but I couldn't
'cause we're stuck here.

309
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:09,355
Megan: I want to get
to know Conor more.

310
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:11,090
Conor's a sweetheart.

311
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,025
[giggles]

312
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,795
Yeah, I like Conor.

313
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:18,097
- Thank you.
- No problem.

314
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:21,000
Jo: I think Megan's holding
on to Conor's coattails.

315
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:24,737
I think she's just trying
to win him over with her...

316
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,305
"charm"?

317
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,715
Good morning.

318
00:15:35,882 --> 00:15:38,151
Second day in the lab,
we're looking at the sculpt,

319
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:40,153
and it's just not quite there yet.

320
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,954
Tate: Do you wanna start doing
some detail on the front?

321
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:44,824
- Should I?
- Get on at it.

322
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,293
We have a pretty long
day here, nine hours.

323
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,796
We need to get everything into mold
and start casting the prosthetics.

324
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,601
I'm doing my thing,
creating textures and creating stuff,

325
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:59,105
but Frank's not incorporating
those design's into the face.

326
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,540
There's no flow between
the face and the back.

327
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,377
Then I look over at McKenzie,

328
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:06,445
and Patrick Tatopoulus walked in.

329
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,014
I'm thinking, like,
"Oh, my God, they're gonna see

330
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:10,831
we don't know what's
going on between us."

331
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,688
I don't know that it was
always in the water.

332
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:16,956
I thought it would kind of be both.

333
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,158
So you guys need
to discuss about that?

334
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,227
Frank: At that point,
it just dawns on me

335
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:22,828
that we have no idea
what the hell we're doing.

336
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:26,532
The outfit is actually gonna
be an iridescent pearl spandex,

337
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,634
so it gives it, like,
that underbelly of a fish.

338
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:30,169
- What have you got going on?
- Yeah, what's in there?

339
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,638
Jo: When Patrick
and McKenzie come in,

340
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,974
everyone starts
second guessing themselves,

341
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:36,876
and with them over your shoulder,

342
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:40,178
you can completely think that you're
going in the wrong direction.

343
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,656
We've got very large
eye holes in the back

344
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:52,825
so the actor can positively see.

345
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,461
We've got nose and mouth
vents so that straws

346
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,230
and what have you can
get in there with ease.

347
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:59,265
Yeah, we didn't lock him
inside a blind helmet.

348
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,032
Thank you.

349
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:05,004
Anthony and Frank,
I didn't feel like

350
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,472
they were really on the same page.

351
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,307
Patrick: That's true.

352
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:10,610
Anthony and Frank don't
seem to be working together.

353
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:12,979
One of them is doing
a water creature,

354
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,747
the other is doing an amphibian.

355
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,617
Unless they start communicating,
their design won't work.

356
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:19,685
Some of them are
putting so much into it,

357
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,420
with, really, so little time.

358
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,389
You talk about an alien creature,

359
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:24,557
you need to bring
something to the table.

360
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:26,993
Gage and Marcel, and Megan and Tom,

361
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,663
both planning on an albino paint scheme,
which is tricky.

362
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,398
To make a creature look translucent,

363
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:34,433
they'll have to rely on
the intricacies of their paint job,

364
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,636
and subtle techniques
like veining to bring

365
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:39,205
the texture and skin
of their aliens to life.

366
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:42,141
Are you worried about any of
the teams or anything you saw today?

367
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:44,343
Patrick:
Conor and Jo, it's interesting.

368
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,646
I'm concerned that they're doing
such a large head prosthetic

369
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:49,081
out of silicone
since it's very heavy,

370
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:51,784
but silicone has such
a wonderful translucency

371
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:54,754
that their alien could really
come to life in the paint job.

372
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:58,491
Sam and Tate seem very ambitious.

373
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:00,526
It's a lot of pieces,
a lot of things to do.

374
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,928
Sam and Tate have a huge prosthetic,

375
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:05,564
so I'm glad they're
planning on using foam latex

376
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:08,200
since it's very light,
and will be easier on their model.

377
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,169
That said, they're taking a big risk

378
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,571
by having their model walk
backwards and covering his eyes.

379
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:15,173
I hope they can pull it off.

380
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:21,881
Megan: We're all super-busy
making our molds today.

381
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:26,185
When you're making a mold, you want to
cover your sculpture with wet cement.

382
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:28,387
After you clean up
the mold, now you have

383
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,256
this negative of your sculpture.

384
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:33,325
This will be used
to make a prosthetic.

385
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,700
Our mold is still wet,
and Tom wants to pull it out.

386
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:44,737
I see Tom put the mold onto a cart,

387
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,573
and lead it outside, and then trying

388
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,642
to pull the sculpture
out of this wet mold.

389
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:50,943
It's starting to crack.

390
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,411
[sighs]

391
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:54,213
You gotta think, the cracks,

392
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,617
we can integrate it
into our texture.

393
00:18:58,784 --> 00:19:01,754
You can not use a crack and say,

394
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,889
"Oh, it's gonna
be part of the alien."

395
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:07,360
It's not gonna be part of the alien,
okay? It's a disaster.

396
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:08,761
It's definitely not set.

397
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:09,995
Tom: We had three hours left.

398
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,198
We had two legs, two arms,

399
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:13,966
and a bunch of costuming to do.

400
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,402
I'm trying
to make this project work,

401
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:20,139
and I'm getting met with
complete passive aggressiveness.

402
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:23,109
There's nothing we can do about it.
Just work.

403
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:24,944
Jo: Working with Conor makes me feel

404
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,179
like I've been babysat
the entire time.

405
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:29,648
- You have silicone in the mold already?
- No.

406
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:30,850
I'm not gonna [bleep] up.

407
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:32,184
So let's talk about this,

408
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,286
painting the silicone
and putting the silicone in.

409
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:37,823
What are you doing
and what am I doing?

410
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:47,600
I'm done. This is gonna be a horrible,
horrible collaboration.

411
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,969
Jo: The second day,
I'm working with Conor,

412
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:53,806
I felt like I'd been
babysat the entire time,

413
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:55,775
and the only way
to get across to someone

414
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:58,077
so that they know how the other
feels is to say something.

415
00:19:58,244 --> 00:20:00,744
What are you doing
and what am I doing?

416
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:05,017
I have 20 years on Jo.

417
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:06,752
She hasn't cast silicone appliances.

418
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,954
I would like to paint.

419
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:12,391
Conor: I thought, "Okay,
well she's got an eye for detail

420
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,658
and for colors, we can make
something happen here."

421
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,998
- Cool.
- That's all I wanted.

422
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,132
- Okay.
- I just want to know where we're at.

423
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,201
I respect him for understanding,

424
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:25,718
and I'm glad that I said
something to him at this point.

425
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,040
Getting there, getting there.

426
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:29,275
Getting there, getting there.

427
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,910
How do you want to de-mold it?

428
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:33,279
Do you want to set it upright that way?
Try to pry this out now.

429
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:35,681
The clock is ticking down,
and I don't know

430
00:20:35,848 --> 00:20:37,583
if the mold's gonna dry in
time to pour the foam latex.

431
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,753
It's still so chalky.

432
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,922
I'm just worried about time here.

433
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:46,125
Okay, I understand
you're worried about time.

434
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,294
Megan: Now we don't have
time to run foam latex.

435
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:51,096
It's a whole long process
that will take a couple hours to do.

436
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,398
We don't have a couple hours.

437
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:55,067
I really don't think
we're gonna get this done,

438
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,303
at least the way
that I want it done.

439
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,405
Tom: Megan is not a problem solver.

440
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:03,509
When the speed bump comes, she panics
instead of thinks on her feet.

441
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:04,944
Whatever it takes, I'm gonna get

442
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:07,446
the prosthetic pieces
made for this creature.

443
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:11,383
My idea is to use gelatin
because gelatin sets real fast.

444
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,553
I understand you're nervous about this,
but you know what?

445
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,356
We've got our faces done,
they look great.

446
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:21,460
Are you blind? This is awful.
This is all awful.

447
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:23,496
I just don't think
it's time to panic.

448
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,698
I would move on to the costuming.

449
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:28,534
Fine. All right,
I'll stick to costuming.

450
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:31,603
That's what I do, I stitch and bitch.
Whatever, I'm just an idiot.

451
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:38,677
Frank's not talking to me. I extended
the olive branch more than enough times.

452
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,179
What do you think
we should name her?

453
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,216
Something Latin, scientific-wise?

454
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,689
The Frankonian Mantonious?

455
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,661
No reaction.

456
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:58,864
Never mind.
Just talking to the wind.

457
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:01,433
I knew right then and there
the team thing was right out the window.

458
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,002
I have no idea what he's doing.

459
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:04,737
I'm starting to freak out a little

460
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:05,905
because now I'm thinking, like,

461
00:22:06,072 --> 00:22:08,306
I'm not gonna go home
because of this guy.

462
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:13,112
Conor: You know what
I'm thinking, Jo?

463
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,547
What's that?

464
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:16,415
The whole time being
in the lab, I've noticed

465
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:18,217
Megan constantly looking over,

466
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,885
and I know that she's feeling uneasy

467
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,754
that I'm working
with Conor and she's not.

468
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:23,322
... and then work together
to get this side done.

469
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,925
- Yeah.
- Word.

470
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:27,760
Jo: You know?

471
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:30,362
I'm not jealous that I didn't
get to be on that team.

472
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,064
Can I get a what, what?

473
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,933
Wikka-wikka.

474
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,350
But I did want to be on that team.

475
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,707
We gotta start booking on this mold.

476
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,375
Let's set it on the floor.

477
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,178
I'm gonna try and crack the top.

478
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,247
It's not ready.

479
00:22:48,414 --> 00:22:50,816
[bleep] It's not gonna pry up there.

480
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:52,251
It's really kind of scary.

481
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:54,787
This gigantic mold
might be the death of me.

482
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:56,855
Aw, [bleep].

483
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:03,596
We're gonna be making
quills as we go as well, so...

484
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,431
Just want to make
as many quills as I can.

485
00:23:05,598 --> 00:23:08,000
Even though it was
a very simple thing,

486
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:10,069
it was super-important
for our makeup.

487
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:12,371
Really get that point.

488
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:13,672
Oh, I dig what you're saying.

489
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,040
When I made his quills,
I thought it would be best

490
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:16,976
to make them out of
friendly plastic.

491
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:19,912
They're plastic beads,
you melt them down in hot water,

492
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,382
and you pull them out,
and they become clear, like a clear goo.

493
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:24,550
They're very pliable and moldable.

494
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:27,386
As they start to solidify,
they turn white.

495
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:29,687
So I know it was going
to be the best bet.

496
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:34,660
I still think it's hilarious how you
have managed to pull [bleep] together.

497
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:37,062
Well, it has to be done.

498
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:40,866
But that's where we're clashing
because... I don't know, man.

499
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:43,669
I sculpted, I molded,
and now I'm making everything?

500
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,904
- What is she doing then?
- Texture.

501
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,573
But what's she doing right now?

502
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,241
She's working on wardrobe.

503
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:50,809
So I feel like I'm being made out

504
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:53,912
to be the bad guy here,
but I'm doing it.

505
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,280
Hmm.

506
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,618
We're all slightly on edge.

507
00:23:59,785 --> 00:24:02,121
Sam: Our mold is still
not yet ready to crack,

508
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:04,223
and it's taking longer
than I want it to.

509
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,724
Ah, there it is.
Sweet.

510
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:08,227
All right, get to cleaning.
I'll pull this guy out.

511
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:09,461
All right.

512
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:11,797
Sam: Our models will
be here tomorrow,

513
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:14,533
and I'm worried that we're not gonna
have a prosthetic to put on them.

514
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,235
Fastest clean ever.

515
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:18,771
It will literally
be down to the second.

516
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:22,841
We're realizing that we have
to clean an enormous mold,

517
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,010
and it still
had chunks of clay in it.

518
00:24:25,177 --> 00:24:26,545
We're not gonna be able
to get it done.

519
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,380
Somebody see how many
minutes we have left?

520
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:32,684
<i>- Coming up...
- This is insane.</i>

521
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,654
This is piss-poor collaboration.

522
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,123
You both had your heads
up your asses.

523
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,992
It's such a stunning piece of work.

524
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,926
What the hell were you thinking?

525
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:49,268
Can somebody see how many
minutes we have left?

526
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:53,238
Sam: We have 10 minutes
to clean an enormous mold,

527
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:54,840
and we're not gonna
be able to get it done.

528
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:56,642
Tate: Ow. We're screwed.

529
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:59,411
- Frank: Tate, what can I help you with?
- We just need to clean out.

530
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:03,682
All of a sudden, I just start seeing
shadows coming, and everyone swoops down.

531
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:05,050
They're, like, "What do you
want me to do? How can I help?"

532
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:06,185
- Here, move.
- Yeah.

533
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:08,153
Conor and I were pouring soap

534
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,288
because that's no way
for them to lose.

535
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:13,024
Of course, man.

536
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,195
Thank you, guys.

537
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:18,330
Tate: Everyone helping
me like this was awesome.

538
00:25:18,497 --> 00:25:20,231
It was a crazy day.

539
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,074
Gage: Today is a big day.

540
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:31,877
We were all trying to
pull off our crazy ideas.

541
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:35,614
We've gone through
the steps, A, B, C...

542
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:37,481
and D.

543
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:43,655
So today, we need to apply the makeup
and focus on the paint job.

544
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:48,092
Now, all this has to line together
perfectly to create the overall image.

545
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,903
Yeah, you're a she.
This creature is back-jointed.

546
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,507
The crab walk was my idea,
and I know it's gonna be a risk.

547
00:26:01,674 --> 00:26:03,308
So you've, like, got cricket legs.

548
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:07,445
Yeah, so literally...
Yeah.

549
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:12,416
That's a little crooked.

550
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:17,656
- It's heavy.
- Do you want me to apply it?

551
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,958
This is gonna flop off.

552
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:21,293
- Not with Telesis 5.
- Especially if we can't...

553
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,128
You put an "X" across
with Telesis 5,

554
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:25,364
that will stay on 'til no end.

555
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:28,667
I can't put it on his chest hair.
It's gonna hurt him.

556
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:31,370
Go for it, do what you want.

557
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:33,505
I'm a team player,
and if you're gonna fight me...

558
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:35,972
whatever.

559
00:26:36,408 --> 00:26:39,844
My arms look amazing. Her chest has
seams on it bigger than the Grand Canyon.

560
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:44,282
Follow me with your new face.

561
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:52,991
Dude, I really need you to start
putting those prosthetics on her arms.

562
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:55,093
- Then just skip 'em, dude.
- I'm not gonna skip 'em.

563
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,495
Then you [bleep] do 'em.

564
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,597
So you're gonna [bleep]
around with the face?

565
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:00,432
[bleep] around, dude? If I don't get
the rest of this [bleep] painted...

566
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,733
Fine, fine.
Whatever, man, whatever.

567
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,670
We don't have that many
prosthetics to begin with,

568
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:06,638
and now you wanna cut
four of them out of the mix?

569
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,841
Look what's going on
across the room.

570
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:12,911
Tate and Sam have something
that I've never even seen before.

571
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,314
You wanna [bleep] do details,
do details. Fine.

572
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,282
Yeah, I'm not gonna try
and resurrect your shortcomings.

573
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:20,385
Oh, it's my shortcomings?
[bleep] you.

574
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:22,554
Like, you know what, man?
[bleep] you.

575
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:27,325
Frank's mentality was "I did my job.
He didn't do his"

576
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:30,062
- Got it.
- Awesome.

577
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:31,330
I get the piece out of the mold.

578
00:27:31,497 --> 00:27:33,665
It needs to be trimmed,
it needs to be patched.

579
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:37,068
It doesn't have any paint.
We may not be done in time.

580
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:42,608
We should probably have him
go get in his wardrobe.

581
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:43,842
Uh, yeah, I'm working on it.

582
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,643
This is insane.

583
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,215
Your veins look good, dude.
They're solid.

584
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:56,355
That's time!

585
00:27:56,522 --> 00:27:58,557
Gage: Now we have to
relocate to the stage

586
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:00,792
with our models for
our hour of touch up time.

587
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:08,266
We have one hour of touch up.
It's close.

588
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:15,173
Oh, my God, your mouth ripped.
Okay, I'll glue it down. Don't worry.

589
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:21,594
You can still tell it's a baby.
It's cool.

590
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,217
Center.
We're gonna fix this.

591
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:28,353
It was just panic mode.
Like, I start working on all the quills,

592
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,289
while Marcel's spackling
over his feet.

593
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:33,091
Five minutes, everybody.
Five minutes left.

594
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:36,228
Frank: I'm pretty confident
about being able to get it done.

595
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:39,197
It's not my best work by any stretch,
but it's gonna be finished,

596
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:42,868
and that's really all I'm
hoping for at this point.

597
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:44,602
Conor: That's it!

598
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,116
Welcome to the "Face Off"
Reveal Stage.

599
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:00,185
Tonight, one of you
will be eliminated.

600
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,387
But first, let's say
hello to our judges.

601
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:04,923
Owner of Optic Nerve
makeup effects studio,

602
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,291
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hello, guys.

603
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:08,360
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

604
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:09,995
Good luck, everybody.

605
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:12,931
Creature designer and director
Patrick Tatopoulus.

606
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,399
Good seeing you again.

607
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:18,036
And of course,
our very special guest judge this week,

608
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:21,006
Emmy and Oscar-winning makeup
artist Michael Westmore.

609
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,108
It's a pleasure.

610
00:29:23,275 --> 00:29:25,143
This week, your spotlight challenge

611
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,079
was to create an alien
that might actually exist

612
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:30,782
on the newly discovered
planet Gliese 581 g.

613
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:33,449
Let's see what
you've all come up with.

614
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,265
Anthony: Joy walks out,
automatically I see the seam lines.

615
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:50,802
I look straight at Ve,
and she's sad.

616
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:53,772
I know what she was thinking.
"How in the hell did you do

617
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,008
"such an amazing body
paint in round two,

618
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:59,343
"come back for round three,
and dare to show me this?"

619
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,500
I wanted the judges to see that,
you know,

620
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:15,700
there's been some real attention
to detail here.

621
00:30:32,678 --> 00:30:34,479
Tate: I knew it was gonna be a risk,

622
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:36,248
but you win big and you lose big.

623
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:38,517
I'm really proud of my makeup.

624
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:41,219
I hope that the judges
appreciate what I tried to do.

625
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,069
Gage: We did our best,
and if the judges like it,

626
00:30:57,236 --> 00:30:58,970
then they do,
and if they don't, fine.

627
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,439
We're happy with it.
We'll see what happens.

628
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,023
Megan: When my makeup
walks out on stage,

629
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,692
it is the most disgusting,

630
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:23,261
awful piece of work I've ever seen.

631
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:26,364
It's awful, it's completely awful.

632
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,646
All right, judges,
why don't you all take a closer look?

633
00:31:47,953 --> 00:31:51,123
- What is that down there?
- It's a fetus.

634
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,858
Tate: The womb is starting to
separate from the appliance

635
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,826
right in front of the judges.

636
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,161
It could completely be
a nail in the coffin.

637
00:32:01,817 --> 00:32:03,952
- What is that down there?
- It's a fetus.

638
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,654
Tate: The womb is
starting to separate

639
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:07,423
from the appliance right
in front of the judges.

640
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,590
Interesting.

641
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:13,162
Tate: I'm hoping
that they award us for trying.

642
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:16,265
Could you step closer to us?

643
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:19,134
- It's a lot of silicone for one day.
- Oh, yeah.

644
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:22,838
It's kind of an interesting
color decision, isn't it?

645
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,206
To go from these grays
up here to like a solid white.

646
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,610
Let's see the pieces on the arms?

647
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:35,650
Could you turn for us
so we can see your back?

648
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,566
Can you move your head
and neck a little bit?

649
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:52,833
Just give us some motion, yeah.

650
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,507
Gage: I'm preparing for the worst

651
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:01,524
because I don't know
what they're gonna think.

652
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:04,546
I told Marcel whatever happens,
I'm happy that we did this

653
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:06,080
because I love that makeup.

654
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:10,352
Come into the light.

655
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,488
Those are some gnarly looking feet.

656
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:14,456
It's a shame that
they went and covered up

657
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:17,392
the luminosity of it with the paint.

658
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,330
I don't pride myself
in putting a piece of crap

659
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:23,031
in front of those esteemed judges.

660
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:32,607
The judges have
scored your creations.

661
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:37,843
Sam and Tate...

662
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,949
Congratulations because
you are safe this week.

663
00:33:41,116 --> 00:33:42,484
Please head back to the makeup room.

664
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:44,601
- Thank you, guys.
- Thanks.

665
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:56,298
The rest of you were the best
and the worst of this week.

666
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:59,134
The judges would like to take
a moment to speak with each of you

667
00:33:59,301 --> 00:34:01,303
to learn more about
your alien creations.

668
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,238
Conor and Jo, please step up.

669
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:10,846
First thing I want to ask is...

670
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:13,716
what the hell were you thinking,
trying to do that level

671
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:17,119
of quality in the time that you had?

672
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:21,056
I cannot believe that silicone
looks as good as it does

673
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:23,859
in the time that you had to build it.
I really can't.

674
00:34:24,026 --> 00:34:26,028
[laughing]

675
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:29,865
Fortune favors the bold,
obviously, because I'm blown away.

676
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:32,868
I'm most impressed
with the silicone work.

677
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:36,438
There's translucency in
that paint, and I like that.

678
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:39,475
I was especially impressed
with the detail you have,

679
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,945
the wonderful time and effort
that you put in to all those

680
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:45,981
little wrinkles and lines
that are in the face.

681
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:47,249
Patrick:
It's such a stunning piece of work,

682
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,684
I was wondering, who did what?

683
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,352
Jo: I blocked out the back half,

684
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:53,889
Conor blocked out the front half,
and did the paint job on it,

685
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:57,326
whereas I did the paint on her arms.
I did the nails.

686
00:34:57,493 --> 00:34:59,561
I'm into fingernails
so I love the fact

687
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:01,630
that you actually
gave her fingernails,

688
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:05,367
and went so far as to make them
different than human fingernails.

689
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,835
That's a really nice little touch.

690
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:09,271
You did a beautiful job.

691
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:12,238
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

692
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:15,410
Oh, man.

693
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:19,447
Frank and Anthony, you're next.

694
00:35:23,052 --> 00:35:24,453
Ve: I don't know
what went wrong here,

695
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,721
but I'm very disappointed
in both of you this week.

696
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:31,226
- Who sculpted the back piece?
- I did.

697
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:32,995
I think that should have
been on her face.

698
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:36,365
The back piece is quite beautiful.

699
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:40,202
It's completely lost on this
concept you have going here.

700
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:43,705
The eyelashes are totally goofy.

701
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:46,074
Who's idea was it
for the Spandex suit?

702
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,243
Was that a time saving thing?

703
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,178
Yeah, a little time saving.

704
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:50,946
Uh-huh.

705
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:53,081
From a distance, it reads
differently than up close.

706
00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:56,552
Up close, I don't think the
sculpting is really creative.

707
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,421
The nose is too human,
the lips read too human,

708
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:01,123
the hair doesn't go with it at all.

709
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,992
Overall, it's a
little disappointing.

710
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,260
Who did what?

711
00:36:05,427 --> 00:36:07,629
Well, I sculpted
a five-piece appliance

712
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:09,932
between two life casts
and Anthony was only

713
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,435
working on pretty much the backpack.

714
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:15,504
Anthony: And Frank just decides

715
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,573
to throw me under
the cross-town bus.

716
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,675
If you were painting everything
and applied the whole makeup,

717
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:21,343
what did you do during
the application process?

718
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,546
I was having trouble getting
the backpack to go with the Spandex.

719
00:36:24,713 --> 00:36:26,915
It would have been the same problem
with skin. Spandex or skin, it didn't...

720
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:29,885
Well, I mean, I didn't spend two
hours yesterday walking around.

721
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:31,420
My parts were done.

722
00:36:31,587 --> 00:36:34,022
He walks away from me
and leaves me to just keep going.

723
00:36:34,189 --> 00:36:36,291
You were working on one piece, there
wasn't anything else for me to work on.

724
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,860
There was other things
that could have been done.

725
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:39,261
I did ask you and you were...

726
00:36:39,428 --> 00:36:41,696
Yeah, the last 10 minutes,
but anyway...

727
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,299
I wish there was a better connection

728
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:47,716
and the result would have
been better for that reason.

729
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:54,208
McKenzie:
Let's talk to Marcel and Gage.

730
00:36:59,882 --> 00:37:01,049
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

731
00:37:01,216 --> 00:37:03,518
I like this makeup.

732
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:06,255
It's very creative. I haven't
seen something like that before.

733
00:37:06,422 --> 00:37:07,923
Who did what on the job?

734
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,825
Gage made a bald cap,

735
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:12,895
I sculpted the face,
Gage sculpted the back,

736
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,429
and then we both
worked on the chest,

737
00:37:14,596 --> 00:37:17,633
and I did the crotch
piece and the tail.

738
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,201
I think you've done
a really nice job here.

739
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:21,436
The airbrushing of
the veins on the body,

740
00:37:21,603 --> 00:37:23,137
I mean, that takes the time to do.

741
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,409
The albino thing, really well done.

742
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:29,311
I appreciate the economy of labor.

743
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:31,580
Obviously, you've got
a model with a great physique

744
00:37:31,747 --> 00:37:33,248
and instead of trying
to cover it all up,

745
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:35,250
you worked with what it is you had.

746
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:37,852
- Good job, guys.
- Thank you.

747
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,240
Megan and Tom, please
take a step forward.

748
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,733
First, if you could, explain it,

749
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,770
because there's a lot
of color going on here.

750
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:56,505
First of all,
I would just like to say,

751
00:37:56,672 --> 00:38:00,575
this is a perfect example
of piss-poor collaboration.

752
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:02,978
She just plowed apart
the sculpture on my face.

753
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:04,680
Megan, why did you change the face?

754
00:38:04,847 --> 00:38:06,848
There was no texture.
It looked like a Halloween mask.

755
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:10,085
As for the paint job,
making things translucent

756
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:12,220
just wasn't going to happen
and I want to discuss...

757
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:14,990
Gage made an entire
person look translucent

758
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:16,458
with an airbrush and some paint.

759
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,460
And the reason why
the helmet's warped,

760
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:20,762
is 'cause Tom put it
on his head to fit it

761
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:22,764
and it was still warm,
and it warped.

762
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:26,902
- I had to fix it.
- That's 100% not true or possible.

763
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,504
You can see that you
weren't pulling together.

764
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:32,741
Probably one of the worst
things that can happen

765
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:35,811
as makeup artists because
you have to work as teams.

766
00:38:35,978 --> 00:38:37,913
I gotta say, guys,
you both had your heads,

767
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,349
you know, up your asses, as it were.

768
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:42,884
There's so many really easy
things that you could have done

769
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:44,586
to make this thing look really cool,

770
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:47,089
like glued moss on him,
glued dirt things, you know,

771
00:38:47,256 --> 00:38:49,257
to make him look like an
earthen type character,

772
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:52,627
and you were too busy being pissed
off at each other to make it work.

773
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:01,303
Glenn, why don't you tell
us about the top picks.

774
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,906
Our top two teams are Conor and Jo

775
00:39:05,073 --> 00:39:07,509
for their illustration
of technical prowess

776
00:39:07,676 --> 00:39:09,478
and well executed makeup.

777
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:12,981
And Gage and Marcel

778
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:15,117
for really unorthodox
but cohesive makeup,

779
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:17,051
and good team work.

780
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:21,690
Our top team tonight...

781
00:39:21,857 --> 00:39:23,791
Conor and Jo.

782
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,098
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

783
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:31,833
But there can only be one winner,

784
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,234
and the winner is...

785
00:39:34,836 --> 00:39:36,536
Conor.

786
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,307
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

787
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:42,376
Rock on, man.
Rock on.

788
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:46,081
Congratulations, Conor.

789
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:48,350
You have earned the opportunity
to consult with the judges

790
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:51,319
as to who you think should
be eliminated tonight.

791
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:53,822
As for the rest of you, if you would,
please head back to the makeup room.

792
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:55,256
Thank you.

793
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:03,165
A whole lot of truth
just came out on stage.

794
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:05,067
The judges didn't have
to bash you guys,

795
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:07,484
you took care of that on your own.

796
00:40:09,972 --> 00:40:13,175
Conor, who do you think
did the worst job this week?

797
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:17,212
I did get a chance to hear
and see what Tom was doing,

798
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:21,483
couple that with the way he wasted no
time throwing his partner under the bus.

799
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,586
I think Tom is the
one who should go.

800
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:27,255
Thank you. If you would,
please head back to the makeup room.

801
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:34,496
All right, judges,
what are your thoughts on Tom and Megan?

802
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:36,598
Tom and Megan's
actually had potential

803
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:38,867
Ve: Yeah, all they had to do
was agree on one thing so...

804
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:40,602
- They actually failed on all
three levels... - Yeah, they did.

805
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:42,771
Because they both touched
the sculpture, they both touched...

806
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:45,307
- They touched everything.
- So, like, everything was bad.

807
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:48,076
You can always save a crappy
piece with a good paint job,

808
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:49,778
and they didn't even
bother to try to do that.

809
00:40:49,945 --> 00:40:51,379
Frank and Anthony.

810
00:40:51,546 --> 00:40:53,782
It was basically a humanoid

811
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:56,351
that they put together,
and it didn't really

812
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:58,153
address the challenge
that was given to them.

813
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,590
It seems like Frank's attitude
sort of steamrolled Anthony.

814
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:03,959
That's okay if that
would have succeeded,

815
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:05,760
then Frank would have
been in the clear,

816
00:41:05,927 --> 00:41:08,930
but when you take over like that and
then it sucks, you're in trouble.

817
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:11,766
It feels like at one point,
Anthony gave up this time.

818
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:16,004
Neither are good qualities, giving up
too soon, and being too overbearing

819
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:20,442
and not knowing what you're doing are
equally disastrous. It's a tough one.

820
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:22,944
All right, judges.
Have you come to a decision?

821
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,111
Indeed.

822
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:35,856
All right.
Who is going home tonight?

823
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,609
Who is going home tonight?

824
00:41:57,312 --> 00:41:59,648
Glenn: Tom and Megan,
I feel that you spent

825
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:02,784
more time arguing than
you did creating this week,

826
00:42:02,951 --> 00:42:04,719
and that's a huge problem.

827
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:09,457
Frank and Anthony,

828
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:12,327
you obviously had an
inequitable relationship,

829
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:14,261
and that resulted
in an absolute disaster.

830
00:42:21,436 --> 00:42:23,304
The person going home tonight is...

831
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,044
- Frank.
- Yes.

832
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:34,649
Why'd you have that reaction?

833
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:37,052
This is a crazy train ride.

834
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:38,853
I've been having fun,
but I feel like

835
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,489
I've been taking
crazy pills the past week.

836
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:44,125
From the little bit of
time that I've seen you,

837
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:48,196
I think you really have to
take stock of your personality.

838
00:42:48,363 --> 00:42:50,398
You have to learn
to work with everybody,

839
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:53,535
or you need to go find
something else to do.

840
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:55,870
Nobody does anything
alone in this business.

841
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:58,139
I mean, you're only
as good as your help,

842
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:00,842
so a really good lesson should
have been learned today.

843
00:43:01,009 --> 00:43:04,178
Well, Frank, if you would, please head back
to the makeup room and pack up your kit.

844
00:43:10,585 --> 00:43:11,686
I'm out, bitches, I'm out!

845
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:14,456
- Are you?
- [bleep] yeah, dude. Yeah.

846
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:16,524
- Serious?
- Yeah.

847
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:17,792
Frank, we don't know
if you're serious.

848
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,961
No, I'm out.

849
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:22,130
Frank: The one thing that I'm gonna
take from this that's positive

850
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:23,932
is kind of something
that I always knew.

851
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:25,967
I've always kind of
struggled with my attitude

852
00:43:26,134 --> 00:43:27,836
and with my mouth.

853
00:43:28,003 --> 00:43:31,238
Gotta, you know, kind of
buck up and clean up my act.
