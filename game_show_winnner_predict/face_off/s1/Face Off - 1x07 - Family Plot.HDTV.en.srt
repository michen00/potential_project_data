00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:04,517
Previously on "Face Off"

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:07,453
12 talented special effects makeup artists

3
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:11,123
came to Los Angeles to compete
to join the world's elite.

4
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,859
Your Spotlight Challenge is...

5
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:15,294
Zombies. 
- Yes.

6
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:17,196
And the stakes are higher than ever,

7
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:19,599
because two people will be eliminated.

8
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,400
I need a wardrobe change.
I just crapped my pants.

9
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:25,805
This week's winner is...

10
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:27,506
Tate.

11
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,175
That's what I'm talkin' about.

12
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:31,110
Glenn, who is going home tonight?

13
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:32,845
Anthony.

14
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:35,815
The second person going home tonight is...

15
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:37,049
Tom.

16
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:39,752
And tonight on "Face Off"...

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,855
You will be disguising yourselves.

18
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:45,992
And your disguises will be put
to the test in the real world.

19
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,427
A special guest is going to be sent in,

20
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:50,363
and you are going to have to fool them.

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,932
Oh, oh!

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,333
It's such an overwhelming challenge.

23
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,334
I'm sweatin' it.

24
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:56,769
Oh, my God.

25
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,337
Phenomenal, very realistic.

26
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:00,406
I am thoroughly disappointed.

27
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:01,807
The judges aren't happy.

28
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,342
It's an insult to everybody else

29
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,977
that's worked so hard in this competition.

30
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:07,980
To make it to the top,

31
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:10,716
they'll have to impress our
award-winning panel of judges.

32
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:13,653
Ve Neill, legendary makeup
artist, who's work includes

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,820
"Edward Scissorhands",

34
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,322
"Beetlejuice",

35
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,124
and "The Pirates Of The Caribbean" films.

36
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:19,692
Glenn Hetrick,

37
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,727
cutting edge makeup effects
artist on "Heroes",

38
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:22,962
"Legion",

39
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,230
and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer".

40
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:25,831
And Patrick Tatopoulos,

41
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:27,433
visionary creature designer
for "Independence Day",

44
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,707
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic

45
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:39,345
and earn $100,000 and a year's
worth of makeup from Alcone?

46
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:42,014
Get ready for "Face Off".

48
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,095
We are down to two people in this loft

49
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,463
and it's getting a little empty.

50
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,664
down to five people all together.

51
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:32,665
That's pretty crazy.

52
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,967
So we're all gonna condense

53
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:38,004
and see how it is to all live together.

54
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,806
What's up, y'all? 
- Hey, roomie.

55
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:44,410
We all just kind of look at
each other and it's like, wow.

56
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:47,680
The reality of the situation
is weighing now, you know.

57
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:49,048
It's insanity. 
Cray-cray bananas.

58
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,486
Well, now there's only five
people left in the loft.

59
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:57,456
I worry because it's just...
it's too unpredictable.

60
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:59,959
We're all going home soon.

61
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:01,594
It's just a matter of who goes first.

62
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:13,839
We walk in and McKenzie's waiting for us

63
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:15,741
and she has these black envelopes.

64
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:16,742
It's like, oh, God.

65
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,711
What is this now?

66
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:19,845
Hey, guys.

67
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:20,780
- Hi. 
- Hello.

68
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:21,847
Welcome back to the lab.

69
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,152
Makeup artists can be masters of disguise

70
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,354
and your next Spotlight Challenge

71
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:30,556
is gonna take this to a whole other level.

72
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:34,693
However, you will not be disguising

73
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,196
your models this time.

74
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:40,124
You will be disguising yourselves.

75
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,937
For the next two days,

76
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:47,306
you will have to create and apply a look

77
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,708
that will completely alter your appearance.

78
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,912
Think of this as your very
own "Mission Impossible."

79
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:55,081
Instantly, I start thinking
about character disguise.

80
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,516
I'm like, oh, this could
be cool, this could be cool,

81
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:58,818
but what the hell's in this envelope.

82
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:00,719
After you create and apply your makeups,

83
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:04,530
you're gonna have to play the
part of a wig shop employee.

84
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:08,396
I'm thinking, should I change my ethnicity,

85
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,364
I'm thinking, should I change my age.

86
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm really worried about how
do we change our appearance?

87
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,682
One at a time, a special
guest is going to be

88
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,450
sent in to see you,

89
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,886
and you are gonna have to fool them.

90
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:25,828
Now, inside these envelopes
is a picture of your target.

91
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:32,498
I go and I open it and
there's blond, there's blue.

92
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,633
Oh, oh!

93
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,068
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,676
Oh, my God, it's my mom,
and I start freaking out.

95
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:45,744
It's my mom.

96
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:46,979
As you can see,

97
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:49,315
we have brought in 
one of your loved ones

98
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,550
who has no idea what this
challenge is really about.

99
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:55,387
Why don't you show us who you have?

100
00:04:55,455 --> 00:04:57,423
This is Brian. This is my husband.

101
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,725
This is Matt and he's my boyfriend.

102
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:01,594
This is my mom.

103
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,962
Her name is Donna.

104
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,697
This is my girlfriend, Holly.

105
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:06,298
This is my sister, Colleen.

106
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,467
They actually think that
they're buying you materials

107
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,903
for your next challenge,
and what they don't know

108
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:14,473
is that they're gonna have
to buy them from you.

109
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,209
You will be required to interact
directly with your target

110
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:19,645
and the judges will view
footage from you mission.

111
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:22,548
So they will be looking not
only at your makeup technique

112
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,450
but also at how much you interact

113
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:26,752
and whether or not you fool your target.

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,121
The only thing left is to start that clock.

115
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,290
Your time starts now.

116
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,594
We have our lifecasts,

117
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:37,529
which are stone replicas of our own faces,

118
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:38,831
and on top of those,

119
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,499
we'll sculpt new features out of clay.

120
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,636
I'm gonna have to round out my face a lot.

121
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:45,237
It's such an overwhelming challenge

122
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:48,073
because we haven't seen our
loved ones in so long,

123
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,244
yet I have to convince my

124
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:51,276
boyfriend that I'm a
totally different person.

125
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:53,979
So I don't know why, but
there's something inside me

126
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,516
that wants to bust out and turn myself into

127
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,652
an overweight black woman.

128
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:02,421
It's like, it's gotta be done.

129
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:05,257
My sister has some
knowledge of prosthetics,

130
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:09,428
enough that I would expect her
to see through a disguise

131
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,830
if there's a lot of latex on my face.

132
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:14,733
So I went into this half
seen portion of my face,

133
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:16,201
I'll make a smaller mold

134
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:18,671
and I immediately cast my teeth

135
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:21,440
and poured dental acrylic into the mold.

136
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:22,875
I was definitely gonna utilize those.

137
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:29,982
I am doing a pregnant, bitchy woman,

138
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,352
because my mom, she hates bitches,

139
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,489
but if I'm pregnant, she's not
gonna know how to conduct herself.

140
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:39,725
Now, see, I think that's
the biggest part of this

141
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:42,995
is knowing who you're dealing
with and fooling them.

142
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:44,630
Yeah, I'm totally gonna be disgusting.

143
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:48,767
I'm gonna, like, snort and
snot and ask for her number.

144
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,403
The advantage of being with
my girlfriend of six years

145
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:55,207
is that I know the things
that drive her crazy.

146
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:59,311
And she really has a problem
with fat, pasty goth kids.

147
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,516
So I'm gonna sculpt a double chin,

148
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:04,283
obviously, a brow piece
to cover up my brow.

149
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,153
My goal is to have the sculpture
done by the end of the day.

150
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:10,856
This is gonna be so awesome.

151
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,791
I hope my mom doesn't make me laugh

152
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:14,393
'cause she knows my laugh.

153
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,095
We all know your laugh.

154
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,167
Can't even tell you how
excited I am to see Brian,

155
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:24,803
I'm just gonna want to run up and kiss him.

156
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:28,874
This is the hardest challenge
that I can conceivably think of.

157
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:32,678
Every single last one of
us is just fretting over

158
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,313
how do we pull this off?

159
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,516
Unless I decide to make myself male.

160
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:40,652
I finally came down to the
realization that changing gender

161
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,255
had the most impact and it
seemed to make the most sense

162
00:07:43,323 --> 00:07:45,090
with my particular facial structure.

163
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,960
I'm going to increase the size
of my brow just slightly.

164
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:49,995
And, of course, the Adam's Apple.

165
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,334
Big old fat gelatin belly,

166
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,703
a little paunched happy
trail and a belly ring.

167
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,638
Ugh. Come on.

168
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,106
I'm definitely gonna go with gelatin

169
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:03,308
'cause gelatin's usually
really easy to work with.

170
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:05,244
It is a risk due to its weight

171
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:06,879
and I'm gonna be in it all day,

172
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:09,882
but it will look beautiful
if I can pull it off.

173
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,050
I'm really nervous about
fooling my boyfriend

174
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,219
because he knows me,

175
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,788
which is why I'm going all out.

176
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:18,090
I'm changing my skin tone,
I'm covering my tattoos,

177
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:19,591
I'm taking all my piercings out,

178
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm doing full prosthetics,

179
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:24,229
I'm doing the wig, 'cause
I want it to be real.

180
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:27,132
I want it to be believable
and I'm just gonna go there.

181
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:32,137
I'm worried about Gage's makeup

182
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:35,374
because I truly believe that less is more.

183
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:39,077
Transforming a lanky, tall white boy

184
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:42,247
into a heavy-set black woman

185
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:43,649
isn't gonna be easy.

186
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:44,471
I'm sweatin' it.

187
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:47,535
Like it's... I'm really a
bundle of nerves now.

188
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:59,326
The challenge that we received yesterday

189
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:01,495
was to create a costume disguise

190
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:04,598
so that when somebody who is
very close to us shows up,

191
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,567
they are unable to recognize us.

192
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:07,801
It's good.

193
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:10,204
It's going to be really
hard to fool somebody

194
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:12,873
who has been staring at
you for three years.

195
00:09:16,611 --> 00:09:18,612
When the sculpture is finished,
it's time to make a mold.

196
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,704
You do this by putting a

197
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,582
cement like substance
on top of a sculpture.

198
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,650
So once it hardens, 
you clean out the clay,

199
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:25,219
and fill it with foam or silicone,

200
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:27,187
which eventually becomes a prosthetic.

201
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:29,189
So I'm doing prosthetic ears.

202
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:32,326
I just molded them to
cover up my piercings.

203
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:37,364
Yesterday, I made teeth.

204
00:09:37,432 --> 00:09:40,000
I just kind of had to improvise,

205
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:41,535
put a little bit of copper wire in there

206
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:43,670
to make it look like a gold cap.

207
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:46,640
Teeth are a really great way
to create a quick change

208
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,475
to someone's appearance.

209
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,445
I decided to grab a mannequin,
start sculpting this fat belly.

210
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:54,548
I'm gonna cast the belly in
gelatin, so... I can't wait.

211
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:56,216
It's gonna have a little bounce.

212
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:58,218
I'm tryin' to get my voice down.

213
00:09:58,286 --> 00:09:59,419
Huh.

214
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,021
Oh, my God.

215
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,789
I started toying with my voice and stuff.

216
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:05,159
And then Glenn walks out with McKenzie.

217
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,660
Hey, Megan. 
- Hi.

218
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,795
How are you doing? 
- Good.

219
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:10,330
So is this your inspiration
for your altering?

220
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:11,765
Yes.

221
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,233
I mean, ever since day one,

222
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,669
I love her structure in her face.

223
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:16,537
Yeah, she has a great look.

224
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:18,505
She's absolutely gorgeous.

225
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:21,341
It's funny because Megan,
for her inspiration,

226
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:23,911
she chose Diana, which
was Conor's last model,

227
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:25,746
and model before,

228
00:10:25,813 --> 00:10:28,615
and she's sculpting her
exact face on top of hers.

229
00:10:28,683 --> 00:10:30,450
It's an odd approach.

230
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:32,920
So the entire makeup is just this piece.

231
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,821
That's the only prosthetic.

232
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:36,857
I really think subtlety is the key here

233
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:39,126
'cause I think if my face
is covered in rubber,

234
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:41,028
she's gonna notice.

235
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,829
Tell me about the materials
for both pieces.

236
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,264
What I think I'm gonna do with the stomach

237
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:45,766
because I don't want to
deal with too much weight,

238
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,402
I'm gonna do a decently thick gelatin skin

239
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,537
and then I'm gonna push
foam into the back of it.

240
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,239
What material do you plan on using?

241
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:53,807
Probably gelatin.

242
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:57,177
I'm using gelatin because it
takes just minutes to do,

243
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,745
but gelatin is a funny substance.

244
00:10:58,813 --> 00:11:01,181
It can mimic flesh in a beautiful way.

245
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,850
But it also is heat reactive

246
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:06,286
and it can actually melt
right off of the actor.

247
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:07,521
I look forward to it. 
- Yeah, good luck.

248
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:08,789
Thanks, guys.

249
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:09,690
Thank you.

250
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,293
How do you feel about, individually,

251
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,494
what they're doing?

252
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,863
How they're gonna alter themselves?

253
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:19,233
With Conor, it's the most minimal.

254
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,400
I really am interested

255
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:23,303
in seeing where he goes with that idea.

256
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:24,738
It seems like it would be easier,

257
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,073
but it's more difficult.

258
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,209
It stands in stark contrast
to what gage is doing.

259
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:33,480
I kind of think that those two
polar opposites probably have,

260
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:35,082
in my mind, the best chances of succeeding.

261
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:37,017
What do you think about Tate's?

262
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:39,386
I'm a little worried about
the weight of the gelatin.

263
00:11:39,454 --> 00:11:40,554
When you have that much weight,

264
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:42,856
just getting it on is a challenge.

265
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:44,024
Going on to Megan, then.

266
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:45,492
I'm looking at the size of it

267
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,629
and just thinking gelatin
is gonna be really heavy.

268
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,832
If she goes with just straight silicone,

269
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,767
I think it could come to life for her,

270
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:55,535
but it's gonna be all about the color.

271
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:56,970
And then last, Sam.

272
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:59,640
I think that the head
sculpture's a bit blocky.

273
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,776
Sort of half and half, where
some of it's masculine,

274
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:04,144
some of it's feminine.

275
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:05,779
It may come out just looking like

276
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:08,181
this sort of weird, androgynous makeup.

277
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:11,084
Bye, guys.

278
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:12,486
Bye. 
- Good luck.

279
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:17,591
Do you have the teeth in?

280
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:22,796
All right, guys, that's it.

281
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:23,697
Get out of here.

282
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:38,712
I'm working on the fly.

283
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,148
I am not making decisions
until they have to be made,

284
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:45,886
and I am a bit freaked
about this whole deal.

285
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:48,789
It's all fine and good up until
my boyfriend comes into play.

286
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,490
Walks in the door.

287
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,392
I am tensing up at the thought of it.

288
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:55,595
Tate, let's go shave.

289
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:56,897
Tate needs to shave his face,

290
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:58,031
I need to shave mine.

291
00:12:58,099 --> 00:12:59,399
Neither one of us want to do it.

292
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,201
But we have to for the makeup.

293
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:02,636
We're suffering for our art.

294
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:04,471
I'll be 12-years-old when I get back.

295
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,306
It's not gonna be pretty.

296
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,808
All right. 
- Oh.

297
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,142
I haven't... dude.

298
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,277
I know.

299
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:11,378
I'm right there with you, dude.

300
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:17,250
It's okay.

301
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,919
She'll still love you.

302
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:20,387
You know guys that walk on their toes

303
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:21,888
and they kind of fall forward all the time?

304
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,890
They just kind of...

305
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,926
everybody seems a bit anxious at the house.

306
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:28,462
Practicing our walking,
practicing our talking.

307
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,230
Just going over our mannerisms.

308
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,132
I've got a gut, there's some love handles.

309
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,701
So I just kind of revert back to slouching

310
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,304
and walking with kind of
my feet pointed out and...

311
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,772
well, plus, you're older
so your bowlegging it.

312
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,907
Yes, I'm an old man so...

313
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:44,277
did you notice Meg's reference today?

314
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:45,879
Yeah. The model?

315
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:46,980
Yeah.

316
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:48,014
Yeah, that's weird.

317
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:49,015
I know.

318
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,450
It's only weird because

319
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:52,518
is she turning herself into that model?

320
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:58,925
It's possible.

321
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:01,328
I wouldn't put anything
past her at this point.

322
00:14:07,802 --> 00:14:09,803
Today is application day.

323
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,438
Once the prosthetic has set up,

324
00:14:11,506 --> 00:14:13,507
it can be removed from the mold,

325
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,809
applied to the model's face and painted.

326
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:19,713
And we get assistants for about two hours.

327
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:25,051
When our helpers come in,

328
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:27,320
we immediately get down to applying.

329
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,823
They're there to assist us in
putting on our prosthetics

330
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:31,792
and covering up the back areas

331
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,859
where we wouldn't be able to get to.

332
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:41,635
I think the one bad thing
about thin gelatin...

333
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:43,170
Little tiny air bubbles.

334
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,240
It's a hard challenge

335
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:49,009
and I don't know if it's gonna work.

336
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,445
I'm doing things with types of materials

337
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,213
that I haven't really used before

338
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:55,582
so I'm coming at this like,

339
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,150
"I'll tell you when I get there."

340
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,425
It already looks disgusting.

341
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:06,993
I can't wait to get into costume.

342
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:10,730
On a black person you use

343
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,299
a lot of reds and a lot of browns.

344
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,900
You need to layer it, you need to build it.

345
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,769
And aside from applying the face,

346
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:19,172
I still have to do my
arms from the elbows down

347
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,874
and my legs from the knee down.

348
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:26,313
I'm so paranoid that my sister's
gonna see through the disguise.

349
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,315
My main focus today is

350
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:31,451
getting the prosthetic glued
down and getting it blended,

351
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,787
and doing just good hair work

352
00:15:33,855 --> 00:15:36,256
that's gonna be convincing,

353
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:38,625
yet changing it up enough so that it's

354
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:40,527
not gonna be recognizable as me.

355
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:41,895
Lookin' good, Conor.

356
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,599
Your ass is so big.

357
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,200
Oh, my God, how dare you.

358
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:54,407
This just looks awful. I mean...

359
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:55,609
no, it really does.

360
00:15:55,676 --> 00:15:57,878
This is not gonna pass for anything.

361
00:15:57,945 --> 00:16:00,780
I'm realizing as we're putting it on,

362
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,016
things are not working out.

363
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:07,053
I'm like, "There's no way
that I'm gonna fool my mother

364
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:09,122
with all these freakin' buckling edges."

365
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,091
I could definitely see

366
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:12,659
what Megan was so concerned about.

367
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:16,129
She did have this problem
with folds being created

368
00:16:16,197 --> 00:16:17,998
in the piece whenever she moved,

369
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,966
but I actually thought she
did a really good job.

370
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:22,135
Had she walked past me on the street,

371
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:23,069
I wouldn't have even looked twice.

372
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,875
First I peel off the neck,
then I peel off the cheeks.

373
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,678
Maybe I can save the
jawbone and the nose.

374
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:33,346
And then I look at the profile,

375
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:36,750
and I said, "Oh, no. 
This all has to go."

376
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:47,160
I just know that this appliance on my face

377
00:16:47,228 --> 00:16:48,061
is not gonna work.

378
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:57,153
I see Megan and she's
struggling with her piece.

379
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,055
Really, really, really struggling.

380
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:01,458
And she eventually starts ripping it off.

381
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,961
I'm not feeling this makeup at all.

382
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:04,895
It's not working.

383
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:06,229
And if it's not working,

384
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:08,165
I'm not gonna continue
going down that path.

385
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:15,439
What?

386
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,117
My biggest fear was time,

387
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:28,819
and she didn't have good edges

388
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,454
and she wasn't convinced by the prosthetic.

389
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:32,656
She's thinking at this point it's a fail.

390
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:34,624
She knows that she's in trouble.

391
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,004
We were given two hours with an assistant,

392
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,605
but that time is up.

393
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,941
I would not have been able
to get this on without you.

394
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,175
I want to hug you but...

395
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:53,643
nice meeting you, yeah. 
- You, too.

396
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:54,778
- Bye, Gage. 
- Bye.

397
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:56,246
Bye-bye.

398
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:58,315
My plan b is to do

399
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:02,052
an awesome foundation
beauty makeup on myself.

400
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,654
I am going to change my
skin tone three shades,

401
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:07,190
I have my wig down, I
got the green contacts.

402
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:08,859
I want to make this thing come together.

403
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:24,007
Damn.

404
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:43,693
My biggest concern is that

405
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,829
this makeup's gonna last all day.

406
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:47,998
This isn't like doing an application,

407
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:50,834
walking it in front of the
judges, and that's it.

408
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:04,281
Everybody seems a bit anxious.

409
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:07,818
When it comes down to trying
to fool somebody in person,

410
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,886
the smallest of details can make it real,

411
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:11,421
or it can make it a disaster.

412
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:33,877
There's a lot of anticipation now because

413
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:35,479
the hard part with the makeup's over,

414
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:36,680
now we gotta perform,

415
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:39,716
and we have to fool our loved ones.

416
00:19:45,156 --> 00:19:46,523
So you guys excited?

417
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:47,691
I'm actually terrified.

418
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:49,059
Why?

419
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,394
I'm gonna try and be as
offensive as possible.

420
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:53,029
We should practice our voices.

421
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:54,764
So if you have to handle the wig and cap.

422
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,500
Here you go.

423
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,001
We have an amazing model

424
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,569
that we've worked with before named Deb.

425
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:02,038
She's there posing as the other co-worker.

426
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:05,008
Deb's gonna be signaling
us and calling upon us

427
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:07,344
to do certain tasks in the store.

428
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:09,479
Here, honey.

429
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:10,514
That's it. That was it.

430
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:11,748
Here, honey.

431
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:12,782
That's it.

432
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,783
Here, girl.

433
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:15,785
No. I don't know.

434
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:17,320
"He-ah."

435
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:18,355
I'll figure it out out there.

436
00:20:19,624 --> 00:20:21,024
My sister goes into this

437
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:24,861
thinking that she's helping
me out with a challenge

438
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,863
where she needs to pick up a couple wigs.

439
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:29,799
So she knows that the cameras are on her.

440
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,234
- Hello, there. 
- Hi.

441
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:32,302
Welcome to Wilshire Wigs.

442
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,537
Is there anything in particular

443
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:35,038
you're looking for today?

444
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:37,774
- I'd kind of like to look around a bit.
- Okay.

445
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:40,010
Sort of maybe grab something
that catches my eye.

446
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:41,077
All right.

447
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:43,980
I'm a little paranoid, of course,

448
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:45,482
'cause I have no idea if she's gonna

449
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,517
notice anything wrong.

450
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:48,785
I like that one.

451
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,854
Could you bring us a wig cap?

452
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,255
Oh, yes.

453
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:53,690
There's a number of parameters

454
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:55,559
we need to follow going into this.

455
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:58,161
I have to hand her a wig cap.

456
00:20:58,229 --> 00:20:59,763
Here. You need wig cap.

457
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,897
Okay.

458
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,732
And, yes, I have to speak to her.

459
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,900
No. That's okay.

460
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:04,801
It won't be my color.

461
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,839
And ultimately, I have to ring up the sale.

462
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:11,942
- It's going to be $160. 
- Okay.

463
00:21:13,911 --> 00:21:15,545
- And here you go. 
- Great. Thank you.

464
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:16,479
You're welcome.

465
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,417
How about a hug for your brother?

466
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:21,651
Oh, my God.

467
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,430
That was awesome.

468
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:34,464
Did you have any idea?

469
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:36,399
No.

470
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:39,035
Well, mission accomplished, then.

471
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:40,237
Let's get out of here.

472
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,674
By the time it was time for me to go out,

473
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:46,676
I'm like, okay, "Let's just do it.
Let's just do it."

474
00:21:46,744 --> 00:21:48,311
The long ones tend to be around the top

475
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:49,679
and the short ones are
dotted all over the place.

476
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:51,014
Okay. 
- Take a gander,

477
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:52,182
and then bring 'em and we'll try 'em on.

478
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,650
Cool.

479
00:21:53,718 --> 00:21:55,952
No matter what you do makeup-wise,

480
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,921
there's just an uncanny feeling
that they're gonna know.

481
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:02,959
I mean, what's that gonna
look like if he's like,

482
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:04,094
"Oh, my God. Gage!"

483
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:11,167
So I decide to make Monique,
my character, more withdrawn,

484
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:12,702
a little bit more soft spoken,

485
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,005
because it's so polar opposite of who I am.

486
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,139
So you want...

487
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:17,307
yes. - 
Go with this one?

488
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,175
Yeah. 
- I think so.

489
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:21,611
And then, of course, one of my
main challenges is to ring him up.

490
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:24,347
Perfect.

491
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:25,248
$180.

492
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:27,851
Out of $200.

493
00:22:29,253 --> 00:22:30,153
Thank you very much.

494
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:32,289
You're welcome.

495
00:22:32,356 --> 00:22:33,790
Thanks.

496
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:36,059
He still didn't know.
He didn't know at all.

497
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:39,262
He goes, "Oh, okay, thanks,
and turned to walk out".

498
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,197
Hon, it's me. 
- Oh, my God.

499
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:42,499
Oh, my God.

500
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,301
I'm a black woman, hon. 
- Hey. My God.

501
00:22:44,368 --> 00:22:45,568
I did get him,

502
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:46,770
because he still didn't recognize me

503
00:22:46,837 --> 00:22:48,438
even after I revealed myself,

504
00:22:48,506 --> 00:22:49,739
so that's pretty good.

505
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,574
I think that's pretty good.

506
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:52,709
Oh, my God.

507
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:53,843
Did you know it was me?

508
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:55,779
I had no idea. I had no idea.

509
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:57,414
I was all, "Here you go."

510
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:59,115
I had no idea.

511
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:01,384
Oh, my God.

512
00:23:01,452 --> 00:23:02,852
The funny thing about holly is

513
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,255
she's also a special effects artist.

514
00:23:05,323 --> 00:23:07,123
Not only do I have to fool this person

515
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:09,793
that has seen me for six years daily,

516
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,164
I have to fool her with the same
thing that she does that I do.

517
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:17,734
I don't know that I even have a shot.

518
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:18,802
Welcome to Wilshire Wigs,

519
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:20,136
I'm Deborah. 
- Oh, hi.

520
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:22,205
I have my back to the door,

521
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:24,741
and I hear Holly come in,
and I go full Gavin.

522
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:25,775
Dark brown, black.

523
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:27,110
I start mouth breathing

524
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:29,679
and I start waddling around the room,

525
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:32,015
and then I turn and I make eye contact.

526
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:36,853
She looked directly into my eye,

527
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:39,189
and then she looked away.

528
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:42,425
And I was like, "Yes! 
My strategy worked."

529
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,027
I think I want something
probably a little darker.

530
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:45,028
Deb.

531
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,029
Yes, Gavin.

532
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:47,764
It's a blue wig.

533
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:50,300
Okay, well, this is a blue
wig from Gavin there.

534
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:52,535
Yeah, that's a little crazy.

535
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:53,670
Could you get us a wig cap
to try one of these on?

536
00:23:53,738 --> 00:23:55,939
Deb, what color?

537
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:58,341
I want to go with a dark wig cap. 
- Okay.

538
00:23:58,409 --> 00:23:59,542
And Holly is just doing

539
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,811
everything she can to not look at me.

540
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:07,984
This is just pretty like you.

541
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:10,487
I even smelled her hair

542
00:24:10,554 --> 00:24:12,155
and she didn't move, she was frozen.

543
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,062
Gavin, would you mind
ringing her up for me?

544
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,730
Oh.

545
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:22,732
Okay.
- Come on, now, you remember how to do it.

546
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,441
Deb.

547
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:33,109
You've got it. You're fine.

548
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:35,078
Okay.

549
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:37,213
Sorry. 
- That's no problem at all.

550
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,114
Thank you. - Have a good night.

551
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:40,583
Thank you very much.

552
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:42,485
Uh, Miss Martinez.

553
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:44,354
Yes?

554
00:24:44,422 --> 00:24:46,156
How you doin'?

555
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:47,690
Oh, my God.

556
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,765
Did you know it was me at any point?

557
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:57,834
- What did you...
- I was trying to not pay attention.

558
00:24:57,902 --> 00:24:58,768
Let's get out of here.

559
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:01,871
Fooling my mom is gonna be

560
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:04,841
harder than maybe anybody else's

561
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:07,710
'cause, you know, she's
known me since day one.

562
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,615
I thinking that it looks
like Megan with a spray tan.

563
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:16,619
How can you fool your own
mom without a prosthetic?

564
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,254
Hello, there. 
- Hi.

565
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:20,256
Welcome to Wilshire Wigs.
I'm Deborah, nice to meet you.

566
00:25:20,324 --> 00:25:21,357
I'm Donna.

567
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:23,359
Oh, my God.

568
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:28,298
I hear my mom's voice.
I don't know what to do.

569
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:29,966
I just don't think this is gonna work.

570
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:32,802
-
- Coming up...

571
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,737
He's just across the cash register,

572
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:36,372
I'm going to be found out.

573
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,407
There's still so much of you

574
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:38,942
coming through that makeup.

575
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,445
All that's incredible, so fantastic work.

576
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:45,548
I think you were pretty darn
successful, and congratulations.

577
00:25:52,078 --> 00:25:53,612
Fooling my mom is gonna be

578
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,782
harder than maybe anybody else's,

579
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,785
'cause, you know, she's
known me since day one.

580
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:02,521
Hello there. 
- Hi.

581
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:07,293
Megan had problems with her prosthetics

582
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,527
so she didn't use any.

583
00:26:08,595 --> 00:26:10,463
But moms have this weird voodoo

584
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,598
that they know their kids, you know?

585
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,800
So I have no idea how she thinks
she's gonna make it work.

586
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,206
At first, I start hiding
my face a little bit,

587
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:23,509
I'm just like going around
like this, like, "mm-hmm."

588
00:26:23,577 --> 00:26:25,845
But we're supposed to
interact with our loved ones,

589
00:26:25,912 --> 00:26:27,480
we're supposed to help them out,

590
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:32,451
so I start playing off of the
other people in the shop.

591
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,453
I start to test out my voice on them.

592
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:36,856
You okay here?

593
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:38,924
And I'm like, okay, okay, I can do this.

594
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,526
How you doin' over here?

595
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:41,927
You good? Great.

596
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:44,296
This one's nice natural.

597
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:45,331
This one right here.

598
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:46,332
It's a bit lighter.

599
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:47,933
Then comes the moment of truth.

600
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:51,337
Nancy, would you mind ringing
her up with these two?

601
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:54,807
Did you find everything
you were looking for?

602
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,342
Uh, yeah.

603
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:57,877
Uh. Oh, van-damnit.

604
00:26:57,944 --> 00:26:59,111
I'm going through this like,

605
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:01,213
"Please don't recognize me,

606
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:05,050
'cause if you do, then that
just might show the judges

607
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:06,886
you're not that good 
with beauty makeup."

608
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:08,287
You did need a prosthetic.

609
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:12,057
Here you go.

610
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:12,958
Thank you very much.

611
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:17,396
Mom, it's me.

612
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:19,231
It's Megan. It's Megan. 
- Oh, my God.

613
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:24,803
Oh, my God, you look so cute pregnant.

614
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:27,740
No. No, no, no, no.

615
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:28,707
Oh, did you know it was me?

616
00:27:28,775 --> 00:27:29,608
No!

617
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:34,780
My husband and I have been
together for three years.

618
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:38,083
He studies people's faces and
postures and walking patterns.

619
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:40,052
He's really observant.

620
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,520
It seems impossible.

621
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:45,291
Hello. 
- Hello.

622
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:46,392
How are you today?

623
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:47,993
I'm good, how are you doing?

624
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:50,896
I hear his voice, and I
look like myself still.

625
00:27:50,964 --> 00:27:53,132
I... there's no way that he
cannot know that it's me.

626
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:57,803
So I'm trying to just show my profile

627
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:00,472
because it looks least like me.

628
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,640
Oh, wow.

629
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:02,775
Would you like to try this one on?

630
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:05,878
Give it a shot. See what it looks like.

631
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:09,148
Mark, could you get a wig cap for us?

632
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:10,449
Put this on.

633
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:12,351
Okay.

634
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,520
Every time Deb gives me an instruction...

635
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:16,589
Mark, could you... oh, perfect.
You read my mind.

636
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:18,324
Could you bring that one over here?

637
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:21,527
Go and give him a wig cap.
Go and pick out this wig.

638
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:22,795
Suggest that you like it.

639
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:25,798
It's kind of hard to resist, yeah.

640
00:28:28,602 --> 00:28:29,568
Take a look at that.

641
00:28:31,605 --> 00:28:35,107
I'm terrified all over again
that I'm gonna be found out.

642
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:36,709
Mark, could you ring him
up for these two, please,

643
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:38,510
and I'll start putting these back.

644
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:40,980
And then the very end,
this was the part that was

645
00:28:41,047 --> 00:28:42,815
the most nerve-wracking
to me because, I mean,

646
00:28:42,882 --> 00:28:44,516
he's just across the cash register.

647
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:48,954
The lighting is not
normal effects lighting.

648
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:51,590
Every part about it is
just like, "Oh, of course,

649
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:53,525
this is the time I'm
going to be found out."

650
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:00,432
Thank you very much.

651
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,433
Thank you, sugar.

652
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:02,401
Have a good one.

653
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:04,737
Brian. 
- Oh!

654
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:09,575
Oh, wow.

655
00:29:09,643 --> 00:29:11,276
I can't believe you did this.

656
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:13,045
How are you? 
- Ohh.

657
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:14,947
Wow.

658
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:19,118
Yeah.

659
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:31,230
Going back to the loft,

660
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:34,033
we all got to, you know,
just meet and mingle.

661
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,502
It was cool, I mean, challenges aside,

662
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:38,092
that is hands down the

663
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:41,140
most levity we've had
since we started this.

664
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:42,675
Woo-hoo!

665
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:45,344
Hey, it's nice to meet you finally.

666
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:47,680
We were shut off from our
loved ones for so long,

667
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:49,615
to have them come into
this world and have...

668
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:50,949
just be able to be like,

669
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:53,085
"Oh, now you see what
I've been dealing with

670
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:55,954
and you're part of this
one section in our life

671
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:57,589
that will never happen again."

672
00:29:57,657 --> 00:30:00,459
We're gonna do a really big
toast to everyone who's here,

673
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:01,940
who made it this far and who

674
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:04,263
trekked across the country
to be here tonight.

675
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,198
Thank you. You're amazing.

676
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:07,766
Cheers.

677
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:13,639
It's time to go.

678
00:30:13,707 --> 00:30:16,442
Once our loved ones had left for the night,

679
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:19,211
I think we were all infused
with a new sense of motivation,

680
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,512
and a new sense to keep going.

681
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,236
Welcome to the "Face Off" 
reveal stage.

682
00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:47,139
Tonight, one of you will be eliminated.

683
00:30:49,642 --> 00:30:51,410
Say hello to your judges.

684
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:53,545
Owner of Optic Nerve
Makeup Effects Studio,

685
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:54,580
Glenn Hetrick.

686
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:55,881
Good evening, guys.

687
00:30:55,949 --> 00:30:57,249
Three-time Oscar winning makeup artist,

688
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:58,650
Ve Neill.

689
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,152
Welcome back, everybody.

690
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,553
And creature designer and director,

691
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:02,554
Patrick Tatopoulos.

692
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:03,555
Hello, everyone.

693
00:31:03,623 --> 00:31:04,757
Hi, Patrick.

694
00:31:04,824 --> 00:31:06,925
This week, your Spotlight Challenge

695
00:31:06,993 --> 00:31:08,427
was to disguise yourself

696
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:09,828
and fool those closest to you

697
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:12,431
by posing as a wig store employee.

698
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,432
Let's check out some of your videos

699
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,666
and see how you did.

700
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:25,444
My video comes on and it's just so

701
00:31:25,512 --> 00:31:26,712
awkward to watch.

702
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,514
You're gigantic.

703
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:31,150
I knew that he had no clue who I was,

704
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:33,485
but what the judges are
gonna see of my makeup,

705
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:34,753
I have no idea.

706
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,522
It's very nerve-wracking.

707
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:38,323
Hon, it's me. 
- Oh, my God.

708
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:45,531
As soon as my video starts playing,

709
00:31:45,598 --> 00:31:48,167
I'm pretty excited about it.

710
00:31:48,234 --> 00:31:50,369
Let me try both...

711
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:52,871
Of these, I guess.

712
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:56,141
I loved my makeup and I liked my acting.

713
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:58,277
Oh, van-damnit.

714
00:31:58,344 --> 00:31:59,845
Oh.

715
00:31:59,913 --> 00:32:02,948
I did get the vibe that her mom knew,

716
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:05,617
'cause it'd be really
hard not to have known.

717
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,386
Mom, it's me, it's Megan. 
- Oh.

718
00:32:07,453 --> 00:32:08,387
Oh, did you know it was me?

719
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:09,388
No!

720
00:32:09,455 --> 00:32:10,789
Oh. 
- No. My God.

721
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:17,928
I definitely don't like this color
- I like this one.

722
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:22,401
You know, I feel great that
I pulled off the challenge.

723
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:24,436
It's going to be $160.

724
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:25,804
But now it's like,

725
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:27,872
how are the judges gonna rate this?

726
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:30,142
How about a hug for your brother?

727
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,043
Oh, my God.

728
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,681
Actually, you do kinda
look a little like that.

729
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:45,090
Put this on.

730
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,158
Okay.

731
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:47,893
It's pretty cool to see

732
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:50,028
more of my husband's reaction.

733
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:52,931
I felt nervous all over
again, sort of like,

734
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:54,499
"Oh, is he gonna recognize me?"

735
00:32:56,302 --> 00:32:58,437
I have the hardest time
reading the judges' faces,

736
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,405
so watching them,

737
00:33:00,473 --> 00:33:02,140
I can't really tell what they're thinking.

738
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,710
Brian. 
- Oh!

739
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:07,112
Oh, wow.

740
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,047
I take it back, I don't
want to see mine now.

741
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:17,289
I completely changed everything about me,

742
00:33:17,357 --> 00:33:19,524
I changed my jaw line, my nose, my walk,

743
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,893
my breathing,

744
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,896
so I don't know that I will be in the top,

745
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,098
but I don't feel like I'm going home.

746
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:32,704
All right, well, the judges would

747
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:34,172
like to speak with each of you.

748
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,908
Sam, you're up first.

749
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:39,378
I really hope I get a win this time.

750
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:43,415
I've been in the middle
the entire competition.

751
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:46,184
I think that this ended up...

752
00:33:46,252 --> 00:33:47,085
Terrible.

753
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,987
All right, well, the judges would

754
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:54,355
like to speak with each of you.

755
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:55,990
Sam, you're up first.

756
00:34:01,096 --> 00:34:03,264
When I came in and I sort of
looked at your sculpture,

757
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,999
I thought that we were

758
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:07,168
in some trouble as to where it was going.

759
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:09,304
We've talked about not having

760
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:11,606
a completely solid idea

761
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,840
before you take the next step

762
00:34:12,908 --> 00:34:14,242
and start turning it into makeup.

763
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,146
And here, I think that this ended up...

764
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,213
Terrible.

765
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,750
Terribly successful.

766
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:25,320
I... I'm blown away by the fact that

767
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:28,656
it came from where you were
in clay to that. And...

768
00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:31,059
but I wanted so badly to do the multi-piece

769
00:34:31,126 --> 00:34:32,794
because I know you were
stressing it before,

770
00:34:32,861 --> 00:34:35,396
so I decided to leave the edges unsculpted

771
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:38,166
so that I could at least adjust
and pull in various places.

772
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:41,769
That was an absolutely brilliant
decision to leave this open

773
00:34:41,837 --> 00:34:42,737
so that you could move it around

774
00:34:42,805 --> 00:34:43,971
on your face and manipulate it

775
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:45,506
during the application,

776
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:47,075
especially when you're
wrestling a gelatin piece,

777
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:48,743
putting it on yourself.

778
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:51,479
I was blown away by the color that
you achieved in your gelatin,

779
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,847
especially for someone who doesn't do it.

780
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:53,848
Well done.

781
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,216
Thank you.

782
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:56,217
And you know what?

783
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:57,352
You did a couple of things there

784
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:58,720
that are very impressive to me.

785
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:01,055
It looks like a masculine face.

786
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:03,725
It doesn't look like a woman
wearing a masculine makeup.

787
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:06,327
All that is incredible, very realistic.

788
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,895
It's a male figure that I'm looking at

789
00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:08,863
and I buy it.

790
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:10,898
So fantastic work, Sam.

791
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,133
Thank you.

792
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:13,434
I'm really proud of you, Sam.

793
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:14,736
This is amazing.

794
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:17,372
You have progressed leaps and bounds.

795
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:19,807
He looks kind of like one
of these kind of weaslly,

796
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:24,312
sickie type guys with dirty hair and...

797
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,446
I wouldn't have thought twice

798
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,681
to look at him again,

799
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,182
that it was like some weird makeup job.

800
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,517
You did a great job.

801
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,418
Thank you so much.

802
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:35,156
Good job, girl.

803
00:35:35,224 --> 00:35:36,491
That's awesome.

804
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:38,159
Tate. You're up next.

805
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:39,093
All right.

806
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:46,868
In a case like this,

807
00:35:46,935 --> 00:35:49,303
I felt the idea would have been
to be a bit more discreet,

808
00:35:49,371 --> 00:35:51,105
and make something more casual.

809
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:52,673
But no, you went beyond that

810
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:55,176
and you just created a character again.

811
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:57,044
I'm a big fan of that side
of your work, man, so...

812
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:59,380
thank you so much. - I'm on board.

813
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,249
How successful do you feel you were

814
00:36:01,316 --> 00:36:03,017
with the technical
execution of this makeup?

815
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:05,620
You know, I'd have to say about a six.

816
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:07,088
I liked the character.

817
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:09,023
I could have, obviously,
done better with more time.

818
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:10,258
I like it.

819
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:11,893
I think that it was pretty successful.

820
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,962
The performance and the wig,
I think, were the two things

821
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,298
that had the greatest
chance of giving you away

822
00:36:17,366 --> 00:36:19,400
because it was over the top and the...

823
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:23,237
the mutant level mouth breathing

824
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,305
that you were doing was,

825
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:25,706
although hilarious,

826
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:28,376
I think it was almost endangering you

827
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:29,544
of giving yourself away

828
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:31,045
because it was so over the top,

829
00:36:31,113 --> 00:36:32,947
but it has nothing to do with your makeup.

830
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:34,215
I think that it was very successful.

831
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:35,917
Thank you very much.

832
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:36,784
You know what?
I didn't even want to look at you.

833
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:38,019
So, I mean,

834
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:39,487
I think you were pretty darn successful

835
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:41,155
and congratulations.

836
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:42,190
He was nasty.

837
00:36:42,257 --> 00:36:43,524
Wow. Thank you very much.

838
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:47,628
Gage. You are next.

839
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:48,763
Okay.

840
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:55,002
Upon initially visiting you in the studio,

841
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:57,472
my feelings towards your makeup were

842
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,307
grave amount of trepidation

843
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:01,042
because of what you were trying to do.

844
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:03,845
It's just so much stuff.

845
00:37:03,912 --> 00:37:06,547
But after seeing it on,

846
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,916
I think that you did a really good job.

847
00:37:08,984 --> 00:37:11,619
I think that it was very bold to try to

848
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,521
incorporate this many different aspects.

849
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:15,356
I was a little scared of the
voices that you were making

850
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:17,825
when we were at the studio,

851
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:19,093
as I think everyone was.

852
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:20,294
Yeah.

853
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:22,196
I'm glad you decided to
pull that back a bit.

854
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:23,498
Yeah. Absolutely.

855
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:25,733
This was a really brave move on your part

856
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:29,103
to do the gender swap and ethnicity.

857
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:30,771
Just because I find it so interesting

858
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,240
that you did Monique,

859
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:34,208
how come you didn't put
any beauty makeup on her?

860
00:37:34,276 --> 00:37:36,878
I tried to and it just started
looking really cartoony.

861
00:37:36,945 --> 00:37:38,379
I find some aspect of the
appliance on the face

862
00:37:38,447 --> 00:37:40,314
a little patchy color-wise,

863
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:42,450
but you really sold the character.

864
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:44,619
She's very much believable.

865
00:37:44,686 --> 00:37:45,920
Thank you. Thank you so much, you guys.

866
00:37:45,988 --> 00:37:46,821
Thank you.

867
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:51,092
Oh, my God.

868
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,760
Conor. You are next.

869
00:37:52,828 --> 00:37:53,661
Please step forward.

870
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:06,374
Hey, Conor, another really
beautiful makeup job.

871
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,608
Thank you.

872
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:09,810
Unfortunately, he looks just like you.

873
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:15,449
I mean, it looks like a
terrorist version of you.

874
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:17,618
I can't disagree. I mean, I didn't know

875
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,986
exactly how it was all gonna look.

876
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:20,421
He's your ugly cousin, dude.

877
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:22,523
Yeah. No, I don't disagree.

878
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,492
I... I see myself in there as well.

879
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,795
It was just a little too on the safe side.

880
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:29,964
I wish you pushed a little bit more

881
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:31,566
the aspect of the sculpt.

882
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,834
And you could have twisted
yourself a little more

883
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:35,269
and still be quite realistic,

884
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:37,471
so it's just right there.

885
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:39,073
Unfortunately, I agree

886
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:42,209
that there's still so much of
you coming through that makeup

887
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:45,079
and this week was all about
disguising yourself.

888
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:48,916
Conor, thank you very much.

889
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:53,588
Megan, you are up next.

890
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,224
I had full intent of using prosthetics

891
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,426
and when that didn't come out,

892
00:38:58,493 --> 00:39:00,194
I went with plan b.

893
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:03,698
Hopefully, the judges take
that into consideration,

894
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:05,766
but who knows?

895
00:39:11,457 --> 00:39:13,058
Megan, you are up next.

896
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,269
Megan, I am thoroughly
disappointed in this makeup.

897
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:28,707
You probably had some technical problems

898
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:30,141
with the time that you had.

899
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:31,743
I get all of that.

900
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:33,245
That said,

901
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:36,514
when the competition is to
create a makeup effect,

902
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,618
and you've been here in
front of us several times,

903
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:41,820
and we keep saying we
want to see what it is

904
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:43,188
that you have to offer us,

905
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,490
presenting us with what
you were trying to do

906
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:48,026
would, in my opinion, have
been a better approach

907
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,894
than doing a beauty makeup.

908
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:52,030
So that's all I have to say about this.

909
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,969
Last week you just barely skated by,

910
00:39:58,037 --> 00:39:59,771
you were on the fence and I think you have

911
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,708
totally fallen off the fence this time.

912
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,003
And to think that you're gonna,

913
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:06,745
like, hide your face and
get away with that,

914
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:08,813
I mean, you had your back to
the camera most of the time.

915
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:12,317
You were hiding behind wigs and
your hair and whatever you could.

916
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:13,256
I mean, I don't think you

917
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:14,686
fooled your mother at all, quite frankly.

918
00:40:14,754 --> 00:40:17,355
She's just smart enough
not to say anything.

919
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:19,057
You know, all the people
that have been dismissed

920
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,527
from this competition,
and then you do this?

921
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:24,562
Megan, it's hard for me
to add anything else.

922
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,690
I mean, there's no point

923
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,899
telling you more than what
you just heard already.

924
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,969
I... I have to say, I'm
extremely exhausted.

925
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:34,939
And I'm tired.

926
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,877
I'm tired.

927
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:39,778
All right, Megan.

928
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,658
Judges, have you reached a decision?

929
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:55,660
Yeah. 
- All right.

930
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:56,786
I'd like to remind you all

931
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,496
that the winner of 
the Spotlight Challenge

932
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:00,265
will have the chance to advise the judges

933
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,367
on who they feel should be eliminated.

934
00:41:02,435 --> 00:41:04,369
Glenn, why don't you tell
us about the top looks?

935
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:05,837
This week's top two looks are...

936
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:09,974
Sam.

937
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:12,377
You were the most
unrecognizable of the group.

938
00:41:12,445 --> 00:41:13,878
And Gage,

939
00:41:13,946 --> 00:41:17,148
for really going for it and
swinging for the fences.

940
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:18,950
A massive amount of work.

941
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,220
And you also succeeded in burying
yourself in your character.

942
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:23,755
Very tough decision.

943
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:25,623
A lot of good makeups this week.

944
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,025
So, then, who is the winner?

945
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,259
Our winner this week is...

946
00:41:30,996 --> 00:41:32,831
Sam.

947
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:34,032
Yay.

948
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,400
Congratulations.

949
00:41:35,468 --> 00:41:37,302
Finally.

950
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,837
I'm thrilled.

951
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:42,107
I mean, I'm so glad to have
this chance to finally say,

952
00:41:42,174 --> 00:41:45,176
"Okay, this is something that
I'm really, truly proud of."

953
00:41:45,244 --> 00:41:47,912
Sam, you have earned the
right to advise the judges

954
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,348
on who you feel should
be eliminated tonight.

955
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,317
Actually...

956
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,818
That's not gonna be necessary this evening.

957
00:41:55,621 --> 00:41:56,654
There's a singular clarity

958
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,256
to our decision process this evening.

959
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:01,726
The person going home tonight is...

960
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:04,963
Megan.

961
00:42:08,701 --> 00:42:12,871
Megan, being tired and being
worn out is not an excuse.

962
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:15,507
It takes a tenacity to
succeed at what we do.

963
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,710
I hate to send the women home.

964
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:20,512
That's heartbreaking.

965
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,714
There's so few of us that can stick to it,

966
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:24,616
it bums me out to have to send you home,

967
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:27,085
especially with such a huge failure.

968
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:30,755
Megan, if you would please head back to

969
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:33,158
the makeup room and pack up your kit.

970
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,058
Thank you.

971
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,437
Congratulations.

972
00:42:45,504 --> 00:42:49,307
You are our final four.

973
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,910
Next week, one of you will
be crowned the winner.

974
00:42:51,977 --> 00:42:53,378
Congratulations.
- Congratulations, everybody.

975
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:56,915
Good work. 
- Thank you.

976
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:58,650
I'm ready for that final challenge.

977
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:00,618
I'm ready to win this $100,000.

978
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:02,320
I'm ready to show why I'm here.

979
00:43:05,524 --> 00:43:07,258
Sam, congratulations.

980
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:08,726
Great job. - Thank you, lady.

981
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,594
I don't want to go home right now.

982
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:11,129
I have a lot to do, still,

983
00:43:11,197 --> 00:43:13,531
and I still want to spend
more time with Conor.

984
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,066
I'll miss you most of all.

985
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,134
You were a great partner.

986
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:18,002
Thank you.

987
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,938
I know I totally screwed up.

988
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:21,840
I don't feel like a failure, though,

989
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:24,375
because I've been
through so much

990
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:28,413
and nothing's gonna stop me
from being in this industry

991
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,014
and giving my all.
