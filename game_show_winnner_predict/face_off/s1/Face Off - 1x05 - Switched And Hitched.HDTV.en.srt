1
00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:04,517
Previously on "Face Off"...

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:07,453
12 talented special effects makeup artists

3
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:11,123
came to Los Angeles to compete
to join the world's elite.

4
00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:15,924
Your challenge is to create
your very own movie villain.

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,641
Anthony is just really
taking the safe route.

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,241
-Did you Vaseline your stone?
- Uh-oh.

7
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:23,775
I'm screwed. I basically lost everything.

8
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:26,639
This week's winner is... Tom.

9
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:29,580
Who is going home tonight?

10
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:30,951
Marcel.

11
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:32,352
Now only eight remain.

12
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:34,057
And tonight, on "Face Off"...

13
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:36,966
You're gonna need to turn
the bride into the groom,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,769
and the groom into the bride.

15
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:42,007
This can't be happening.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,146
And we have set the stage,
and invited their friends

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,648
and family to witness this all.

18
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:48,953
What the heck were you thinking?

19
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:50,354
I was very impressed with this.

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,458
To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress

21
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:56,226
our award-winning panel of judges...

22
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,594
Ve Neill, legendary makeup artist,

23
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,663
whose work includes "Edward Scissorhands",

24
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,932
"Beetlejuice", and the "Pirates
of the Caribbean" films;

25
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:07,468
Glenn Hetrick, cutting-edge makeup

26
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:09,804
"Legion", and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer";

27
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:12,908
and Patrick Tatopoulus,
visionary creature designer

28
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,877
for "Independence Day", "Godzilla",

29
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:17,780
and director of "Underworld:
Rise of the Lycans".

30
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:20,351
Who will be the next great
name in movie magic

31
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:22,119
and earn $100,000 dollars

32
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:24,924
and a year's worth of makeup from Alcone?

33
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,027
Get ready for "Face Off".

34
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:34,527
Face Off 1x05 - Switched And Hitched
Original air date February 23, 2011

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,978
Last night's elimination bummed me out bad.

37
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:14,047
Marcel was, like...

38
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:15,983
Well, yeah, you guys were,
like, best friends.

39
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:17,284
Yeah.

40
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,254
I think the competition's
gonna change a lot now

41
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,290
now that Marcel's gone.

44
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:29,733
We're not here to, like, find boyfriends.

45
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:31,268
This isn't Melrose Place.

46
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:33,838
He's completely lost his
focus as to why he's here.

47
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:38,344
This freaking guy wants to see
me gone in the worst way.

48
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:41,147
And it sucks, 'cause, you know,
he came in here all Zen.

49
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:43,016
He let that girl get in his head, man.

50
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,851
That's why superheroes
don't have girlfriends.

51
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:46,653
We're all in a strict competition.

52
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:50,190
I don't want to lose to the
guy who's trying to get laid.

53
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:03,303
- Good morning, guys.
- Hi.

54
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:05,338
This is a Foundation Challenge.

55
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,273
The winner of the Foundation Challenge

56
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:08,908
gains some sort of perk or advantage

57
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,543
going in to the Spotlight Challenge.

58
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:14,014
This challenge is based on
a very specialized skill...

59
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,685
hand-laying facial hair.

60
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,587
Now, I know how to do beards.

61
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:22,491
I know how to do hair work.
I've been doing it for years.

62
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,260
This is my second chance, I'm reborn.
I'm the phoenix rising.

63
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:27,763
Here with me, we have our guest
judge for this challenge.

64
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:31,634
He's one of the best hair-laying
specialists in the business.

65
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,003
He won an Oscar for the
movie "Beetlejuice",

66
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:35,738
was the department head on "Lost",

67
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,274
and has worked on dozens
of Hollywood blockbusters.

68
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:40,843
Makeup artist Steve Laporte.

69
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:43,879
- Good morning.
- Thanks, Steve, for being here.

70
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:46,048
So what are you going to
be looking for today?

71
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,050
I'm looking for proper blending of hair,

72
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:50,486
application, the right
amount of glue being used.

73
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,688
Something that can be good on camera.

74
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:54,291
I hate hair. I've got big caveman hands.

75
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,660
You know, my nickname is Yeti Finger,

76
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,596
so having a judge like Steve Laporte?

77
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:03,434
Yeah, it's a little bit more
scrutiny than I want to deal with.

78
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,602
So let's bring out your models.

79
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:07,062
Our models come out,

80
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:10,341
and they're all in almost
time period outfits.

81
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,543
I see, like, a biker guy, a pirate,

82
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:15,113
a renaissance guy, a Rastafarian.

83
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:20,018
Not only do you have to apply
a precise facial hair design,

84
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:23,889
but you're going to have to
match a certain era or style.

85
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:27,860
You'll have two hours to design
and apply your facial hair.

86
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,462
Before we get started, you
will need to pick a model.

87
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:33,165
First up...

88
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,266
Sam.

89
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,368
- Whee.
- I went towards the western

90
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:38,870
simply because I had this image in my head

91
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,339
of that big ol' bushy mustache.

92
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:43,908
- Tom.
- I'm super excited.

93
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:46,710
I love hair work, I feel I'm
really good at hair work.

94
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,478
I'm ready to win this one.

95
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,614
All right, Megan took the pirate.

96
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,983
Conor. Nice.

97
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,552
Jo.

98
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:58,190
Anthony.

99
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:04,997
Gage.

100
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,269
And Gage took the biker.

101
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:12,506
I'm not that versed with ethnic hair,

102
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,641
and it's hard for me.

103
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:18,178
All right, artists, your time starts now.

104
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:21,115
Go ahead and post up. I'll be right back.

105
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,121
There's just a variety of
different hairs at this point.

106
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:29,523
We have human hair, yak
hair, synthetic hair.

107
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:30,877
I need to go with something

108
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:33,127
coarse 'cause the Spaniards
have coarser hair,

109
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:34,328
and I'm gonna have to

110
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,831
turn this thing into a
curly, crazy mustache.

111
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,702
I have a little secret
trick that I like to use.

112
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:43,071
You take the spirit gum
and put it on cardboard,

113
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:44,974
it actually evaporates
a lot of the alcohol,

114
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:46,542
and it makes it more gummy and sticky.

115
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:48,611
I'm feeling it.
I'm feeling like I actually got this.

116
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:52,481
Did somebody say we had a hackle?

117
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:53,682
There is a hackle.

118
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:55,951
What a hackle is, it's very dangerous.

119
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,687
It's when you have two colors of hair,

120
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:00,989
you just throw them in, and it
kind of blends them together,

121
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:02,657
pulls the two colors together.

122
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:05,326
I look at his cheesy future man costume,

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,995
and I was, like, "Okay,
I'm gonna turn this guy

124
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:11,699
into a 1950s future man
that's an evil villain."

125
00:06:14,536 --> 00:06:17,305
Hand-laying facial hair
is pretty hard, actually.

126
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,506
You have to place it properly,

127
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,174
you have to make sure that you block it out

128
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,842
properly in the first place.

129
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:25,179
If not, you're gonna end up
with hair all over the place.

130
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:29,016
I need to impress the judges.

131
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:33,487
But, jeez, my pirate looked
like, you know, a samurai

132
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:35,889
more than a pirate.

133
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:39,359
I'm not 100% settled on how
I'm gonna tailor this,

134
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:41,275
but I'm thinking kind of maybe

135
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,163
a cleaner Lars Ulrich,
or something like that.

136
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,533
All right, everybody.
Here's your 30 minute warning.

137
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,908
I grabbed about three different
types of hair colors,

138
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,643
and I'm blending it together.

139
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,779
Each batch that I pull
up, I'm trying to get

140
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,714
a little bit of each one into it.

141
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:03,851
At the last minute, I decided,

142
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:05,620
long beard, I need a long hair.

143
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:07,689
And I just hurry up, threw it on his head,

144
00:07:07,723 --> 00:07:09,090
put his hat on. Done.

145
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,892
Pirate. Yar.

146
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:18,499
Everybody, your time is up.

147
00:07:20,468 --> 00:07:22,703
We all finish our beards.
I start looking around the room.

148
00:07:22,737 --> 00:07:24,738
Gage has this huge biker thing going on.

149
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:28,107
Megan's, I don't know, it was a total mess.

150
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:31,343
The more I look at everybody,
I see fake beards.

151
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,613
And I look at mine, and I'm,
like, that's totally real.

152
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,015
Anthony, how are you doing?

153
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,818
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

154
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:38,953
So, what do you think, Steve?

155
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:41,589
Oh, well, turn this way
a little bit for me.

156
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:43,791
I'd like to have seen a little more length,

157
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:46,794
considering the guy who's
got his hair this long

158
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:50,198
probably would've really let
himself go in the beard area, too.

159
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:52,466
I don't think that he was impressed.

160
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,969
He was expecting this full,
nappy Rastafarian beard.

161
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:59,339
The mustache is a little big and thick,

162
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:02,643
but certainly kept within
the realms of a style.

163
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:04,812
So it's great. Really nice.

164
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:06,847
Thank you. I appreciate it.

165
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:09,049
You could've probably used
half this amount of hair,

166
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,885
and gotten the same look,
and used the shaping

167
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,653
and the body of the beard to fill it out.

168
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,189
Fill it out? Yeah.

169
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:17,179
My first thought is that

170
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,892
I would have liked to have seen a lot more.

171
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:21,194
- Sure.
- You could've given him some beard stubble.

172
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:22,696
You could have added a lot more character.

173
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,298
Because he has a young face,
you didn't go over the top.

174
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,401
He has shorter hair, so you kept
it nice and neat and tight.

175
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,103
Very nice. Good job.

176
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:37,003
All right.

177
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,781
It's great that you blended
the hair like that,

178
00:08:39,815 --> 00:08:41,717
- 'cause I like to see that.
- Thank you.

179
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,218
Matches the costume.

180
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:44,953
Yes, that was my inspiration.

181
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:47,089
I also notice you put hair in the eyebrows.

182
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:49,325
- Yes.
- Which is a nice touch,

183
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,194
'cause a lot of people
don't think about that.

184
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,963
I was forced to mess with
hair, and by the end of it,

185
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,511
I was, like, "Wow, this actually

186
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:57,734
looks really good.
I would put this on camera."

187
00:08:57,768 --> 00:08:59,335
Let's take a look at the pirate, Steve.
What do you think?

188
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,703
Turn for me a little bit.

189
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:03,973
Is this a synthetic you
were using, or is it...

190
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:06,342
- I believe it's a synthetic.
- Synthetic?

191
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:11,013
I'd like to see a little
more broken up in here.

192
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:13,182
Steve whips out his comb, I'm, like,

193
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:16,685
"Oh, sir, no, no, no.
Put that down. Please, don't."

194
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,187
Last thing you want in a middle of a take

195
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:20,555
is a big hunk of hair falling and sticking.

196
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:23,124
Steve does a little tug on her beard,

197
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:24,959
and a whole bunch just starts coming out.

198
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:26,393
She didn't secure it properly.

199
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,932
Look up for me here.

200
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,800
It's very nice. Good job.

201
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:35,269
I don't see a lot of glue.

202
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:37,838
It would certainly be admissible I think.

203
00:09:37,873 --> 00:09:41,108
- Thank you.
- I'm feeling pretty confident, you know.

204
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:42,209
My beard looks pretty realistic.

205
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:43,578
If I saw this guy on the street,

206
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:45,046
I wouldn't second guess it.

207
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,547
Steve, what did you think
of the work today?

208
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,383
I saw some really good work,

209
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,719
and I saw some work that wasn't so good.

210
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:53,922
So, then who were some
of your favorites today?

211
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:57,292
Um, Tom, with your Amish.

212
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,727
You had dressing to the beard,

213
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:00,262
there's curl that had shape to it.

214
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,198
- It looked good.
- Thank you.

215
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,133
Tate, you did the futuristic guy.

216
00:10:04,168 --> 00:10:06,270
I think you did a great job.

217
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:09,306
You did good hair blending,
you accentuated his eyebrows,

218
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,109
which is a big part of that look.

219
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:13,677
Thank you very much.

220
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:16,580
So, who is the winner of the challenge?

221
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:21,618
The winner is...

222
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:24,387
- Tate. 
- Thank you.

223
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,690
I appreciate it. Thank you.

224
00:10:26,724 --> 00:10:28,191
Good job.

225
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,193
- Thank you.
- I never would have guessed it.

226
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,362
I'm blown away, completely.

227
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:35,032
Thank you, Steve, so much for being here.

228
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,500
- My pleasure.
- Great having you here today.

229
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:37,501
Good luck, everybody.

230
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:38,703
Thank you very much.

231
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:43,941
Let's talk about this
week's Spotlight Challenge.

232
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:45,479
You're going to be working with

233
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,712
models that you have never
worked with before.

234
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:51,448
But in order for me to
introduce you to them,

235
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:54,666
we need to head outside.
Why don't you come with me?

236
00:10:56,588 --> 00:11:00,558
McKenzie tells us "Your models
are here, come outside."

237
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,217
And we're all looking at each other,

238
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,661
like, what the hell is going on?

239
00:11:09,924 --> 00:11:13,160
McKenzie tells us our models
are here, come outside.

240
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:19,633
So we go outside, and a limo pulls up.

241
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,405
You know, we're all thinking
all these crazy things.

242
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,441
Like what horror star,
director's gonna jump out.

243
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:32,179
And then these couples start filing out.

244
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:37,317
Your Spotlight Challenge this week

245
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:38,474
is to make up these real

246
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:40,487
life engaged couples for their wedding day.

247
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:45,692
But there is a twist to this challenge.

248
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:49,829
You're gonna need to turn
the bride into the groom,

249
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:52,232
and the groom into the bride.

250
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,836
This is a gender swap challenge,

251
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,105
and your makeups will be revealed

252
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:00,307
in front of their friends and family.

253
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:02,075
You'll be working in pairs of two,

254
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,911
but you will get to pick your teams.

255
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:08,481
So why don't you go ahead and
decide who you want to work with.

256
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,084
Sam, girl.

257
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:14,186
This is the first time we get to pick

258
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,654
our own partners, which is cool.

259
00:12:15,688 --> 00:12:17,656
Me and Jo went right for each other.

260
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:19,491
We're gonna win this.

261
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,661
I have a lot of respect for
her skills in beauty makeup.

262
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,863
I know immediately that, if anyone

263
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:26,898
was gonna pull this off, it was Megan.

264
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,101
I know that she's skilled
as a beauty makeup artist.

265
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,770
So, Tate, as the winner of
the Foundation Challenge,

266
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,315
you will get to choose which

267
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:35,742
couple you would like
your team to work with.

268
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:38,878
Everyone else's couples will
be chosen randomly for them.

269
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:40,252
Why don't you discuss with

270
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:42,416
Anthony which couple you'd like to choose?

271
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,492
Turning a woman into a man is not so hard

272
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:53,827
because you're adding features,

273
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,528
cheek bones, chins, things like that.

274
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:57,163
When you're turning a man into a woman,

275
00:12:57,198 --> 00:12:58,698
you're looking for ways
to take things away.

276
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,635
So when I see this pretty Asian man,

277
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,270
I'm, like, done, I want him.

278
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,639
My and Anthony both agree,
number three is for us.

279
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:08,375
Number three, that is Peter and Kathleen.

280
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:11,278
The rest of you have each
been randomly assigned

281
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,113
to one of the remaining couples.

282
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:15,749
Why don't you all take a moment
to get to know your couples,

283
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,485
because your time starts now.

284
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,486
Hey, how's it going? I'm Gage.

285
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,088
- Hi.
- I'm Conor.

286
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:26,291
Willie has a very masculine chin,

287
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:28,560
and kind of a heavy brow.

288
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:31,262
Our first question is would
you shave your hands?

289
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:32,364
Sure.

290
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:34,366
Tom and I got quite the couple.

291
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,436
I'm really worried about
turning Dean into a female.

292
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,805
If we put prosthetics on him,

293
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,175
he's gonna look like some sort
of plastic surgery victim.

294
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,510
Would you be willing to
shave your eyebrows?

295
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,279
Not shave, but just a little pluck.

296
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:49,947
- Maybe we pull a couple out.
- Yeah, I do anyways.

297
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:50,948
Oh, okay.

298
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:52,116
We just want to get to know

299
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,118
your guys' shapes and sizes.

300
00:13:54,152 --> 00:13:56,553
Annie's face was very round.

301
00:13:56,588 --> 00:14:00,223
And to transform a very
round, very feminine face,

302
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,593
into a masculine face meant
that we had to add a lot.

303
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:07,197
It's time to say your good-byes
for now and go get started.

304
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:11,568
The first step to creating a prosthetic

305
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,604
is coming up with the design.

306
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,942
Okay, what kind of angle
can we take on this?

307
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:21,179
I mean, is everybody really
gonna just do a cross dresser?

308
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,781
Do you want to go with a period thing?

309
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,849
What if we did an Elvis wedding?

310
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:25,917
What if we did a Vegas...
we turned her into Elvis...

311
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:27,618
- Silly.
- Yeah.

312
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:29,354
- I like that.
- Sideburns.

313
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:31,689
How do we make his nose smaller?

314
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:35,093
We have to give her platform
shoes or something.

315
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:38,328
We came up with this '70s
theme that's a little goofy.

316
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:40,464
We might get castrated
for it, I don't know.

317
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:42,001
We needed something with a

318
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:44,834
ruffled shirt to hide our
actual bride's breasts.

319
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,170
The challenge here will be how simple

320
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:49,373
can you make it look, but
as realistic as possible?

321
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:51,675
I think that's gonna be
a huge challenge here.

322
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,449
We're going to attempt a
double old age makeup,

323
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:02,686
which some people will say is insane.

324
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,388
Which it is, within the
time span that we're given.

325
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:07,991
- So what's your theme?
- Theme?

326
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:09,425
Why, do you have a theme?

327
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,060
We're doing a Vegas wedding.

328
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:13,195
I figured it'd be an easy enough way

329
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:15,197
to make something out of nothing.

330
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,470
Genius. I just did a belly,
too, on another film.

331
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,772
All right, I'll whip a
belly right on to this.

332
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:27,842
About three weeks ago,
I actually did a short film

333
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,244
where I had to make a pregnant
belly out of silicone,

334
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:30,845
so I'm sculpting everything,
molding everything.

335
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,549
I was already in that same vein
of how to make one real quick.

336
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,817
We're making a belly.

337
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,688
Tate's doing, like, an Elvis Vegas wedding.

338
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:42,259
I want to stick with formal.
Let's keep it classy.

339
00:15:42,293 --> 00:15:43,694
Okay.

340
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:46,296
You want to work with people's features.

341
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,642
When it comes to the man,

342
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:49,899
what do you want to subtract from his face?

343
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:51,768
You don't always have to use prosthetics.

344
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,838
This is where shading and
highlights come into play,

345
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,573
when you're using beauty
makeup and foundations.

346
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,409
My only concern with him
is the size of his chin.

347
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:02,145
He's got a very prominent chin.

348
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:07,050
The next step to creating a prosthetic
is sculpting clay

349
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:10,253
on a cast of the model's face.

350
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:16,092
You can't place tape, they made it
really clear, on the last challenge.

351
00:16:16,093 --> 00:16:16,795
Yeah.

352
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,545
Old age makeups are one of
the hardest things to do.

353
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,348
We knew that if we were gonna pull
it off, we needed to do a lot.

354
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:24,684
We're sort of relying on the fact that

355
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,185
androgyny sets in in old age.

356
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,954
It's gonna be a full face, a bald cap,

357
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,659
a back of the neck appliance,

358
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,791
and then two hand appliances for her.

359
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,128
And the same for him, so Sam and
I got some pretty big balls.

360
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:38,097
I'm sculpting boobs.

361
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:40,266
I'm gonna sculpt them out of silicone,

362
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,830
but I'm gonna encapsulate

363
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:44,403
it so I can smooth it down into the chest,

364
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,773
because we are going with '70s feel,

365
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:48,841
so she's gonna have a '70s
hippie kind of dress,

366
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,810
so I want it to blend in really nice.

367
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:54,147
Giving 'em a nice rack.

368
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,990
I don't think either Gage
or Sam have actually

369
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,025
done an old age makeup before,

370
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,896
and now they want to pull off two
in two days. Are you guys nuts?

371
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,965
We don't know if they're
gonna like it or not.

372
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:14,534
We could be eliminated for this decision.

373
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:34,037
We went small right off the bat,

374
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:38,608
which was contrary to what everybody
else in the competition did.

375
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:42,045
Tate and Anthony decided to do
this full facial appliance.

376
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,770
I'm looking at Gage and Sam,

377
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,549
and they've decided to
do two old age makeups,

378
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,586
and then there's Tom and
Jo, sculpting boobs.

379
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,192
Boobs, do you need 'em?

380
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:58,127
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

381
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,597
Today, my goal is to get
this sculpture pushed out.

382
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:03,533
I'm hoping that tomorrow
I can get a mold done,

383
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,335
and then run the silicone the same day.

384
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:09,206
Get this done.

385
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,208
Gage and I are creating two prosthetics,

386
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:13,678
one for each of the engaged couple.

387
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:15,880
I like making my own bald caps.

388
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:18,382
That's what these red heads
are for, is making bald caps.

389
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,318
I make a bald cap because it's a female.

390
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:23,019
I'm gonna have to run her hair
out the back of the bald cap,

391
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:25,121
and down her wardrobe in the back.

392
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,621
It's a time consuming process,

393
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:28,625
that's the downside of making a bald cap.

394
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,993
Hey, guys.

395
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:32,796
Day two of the challenge, I
start molding the pieces,

396
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,332
start fabricating things,
and Ve Neill walks in.

397
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:38,701
Hey, Anthony, Tate. Who's working on what?

398
00:18:38,736 --> 00:18:43,205
Ve Neill is the perfect person
to critique the gender swap.

399
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,609
She did win an Oscar for "Mrs. Doubtfire".

400
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:49,712
For the male, we're gonna rely on makeup,

401
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:52,682
because adding more onto his
face, he's already huge.

402
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:54,483
- Even him out?
- Yeah, even him out.

403
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:56,319
Also a chest piece, obviously.

404
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:57,720
Obviously.

405
00:18:57,755 --> 00:19:00,623
We decided to age them and
make them an elderly couple.

406
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,525
That's an interesting twist.

407
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,927
- You really picked a tough one there.
- We did.

408
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,795
Now, are you gonna leave these one piece,

409
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,997
are are you cutting 'em up,
or what are you doing?

410
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,302
Well, it's a one piece,

411
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,734
also it's a neck appliance,
hand appliances.

412
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:13,801
What are you gonna make 'em out of?

413
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,570
I think we're gonna go with foam

414
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,971
because adhering silicone,
especially around the mouth area,

415
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,172
can get a little tedious.

416
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,940
- Thank you very much. Keep up the good work.
- Thank you ladies.

417
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:22,475
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

418
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:24,931
What are some of your
worries with some of them?

419
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,165
Some of the things you've seen?

420
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,067
Probably my biggest worry is the fact

421
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,002
if they can paint it to make
it look like a human being,

422
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:32,205
because that's usually where
everybody fails so miserably.

423
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,307
You know, if they don't get
that intrinsic coloring right,

424
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,909
they could have a lot of problems.

425
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:37,343
How do you feel about the old age,

426
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,045
because I know old age is so difficult.

427
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,581
You know, they probably
bit off the most to chew.

428
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,183
Gage and Sam should be spending more time

429
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:45,030
putting that into their

430
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:46,619
facial pieces as opposed
to working on hands,

431
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:47,861
because unless you really

432
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:49,889
do a close-up of hands, you never see 'em.

433
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,224
What's some of the biggest things

434
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,525
you'll be looking for
tomorrow on the challenge?

435
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,662
I always say, you can take a bad appliance,

436
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,303
and if you put a good paint job on it,

437
00:19:57,304 --> 00:19:58,531
you can get away with murder.

438
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,134
Well, it's gonna be exciting to see.

439
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:02,469
- Hey, bye, everybody.
- Bye, everybody.

440
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:04,539
- Bye.
- Good luck.

441
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:14,550
Could you start prepping some silicone?

442
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:17,553
Step by step, Conor has told Megan

443
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:20,022
exactly what they're gonna be doing,

444
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:22,091
which is more what he's gonna be doing

445
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,592
because Conor is doing all of it.

446
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:40,692
When the sculpture is finished,
it's time to make a mold.

447
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:43,612
You do that by putting
a cement-like substance

448
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:44,914
on top of the sculpture

449
00:20:44,948 --> 00:20:46,682
so once it hardens,

450
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:49,685
you clean out the clay, and fill it
with foam, or silicone,

451
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,854
which eventually becomes the prosthetics.

452
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:53,923
Silicone requires a lot of maintenance,

453
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:55,233
especially around the mouth,

454
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,193
where there's, you know, a lot of movement.

455
00:20:57,227 --> 00:20:59,528
So we decided to go with foam.

456
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:01,864
They broke the first two
rules of old age makeup.

457
00:21:01,898 --> 00:21:03,866
They did it one piece,
and they did it in foam.

458
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,136
If you're putting your ass on the
line with an old age makeup,

459
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:08,905
it better be perfect in
front of those judges.

460
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:11,540
As soon as you point a
light at something foam,

461
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:14,110
it bounces right off, and then
you can see that it's fake.

462
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:17,314
Silicone allows the light to react softer.

463
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:18,773
Silicone is the closest

464
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:21,685
thing on the planet that
looks like human skin.

465
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:25,021
It has the same flexibility.
Nothing else does.

466
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:26,957
That's why it's the weapon of choice.

467
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:30,294
I don't think many people are
using foam on this one but us.

468
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,609
This girl's gonna look

469
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,231
like Charlie Manson when
we're done with her.

470
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,832
That's awesome.

471
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,167
It's gonna look great.

472
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,837
You okay? You need help with that?

473
00:21:40,872 --> 00:21:41,938
I might have a lock.

474
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:43,273
What do you mean?

475
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:45,542
When you can't open it.
I can't pull it out.

476
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:47,911
There it goes. It's not a lock.

477
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:50,179
It's not a lock, see?
You guys, getting all worried...

478
00:21:50,214 --> 00:21:52,581
Oh, ********.

479
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,283
Look at this, man.

480
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:55,684
- Tate?
- Yo.

481
00:21:55,718 --> 00:21:57,519
The positive just snapped.

482
00:21:57,553 --> 00:21:58,620
Look at this, man.

483
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:02,291
Your positive is the stone version

484
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:05,261
of your actor's head, and
that's what you sculpt on.

485
00:22:05,295 --> 00:22:09,032
In that way, what you sculpt
fits perfectly onto your talent.

486
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:10,200
Right on the neck.

487
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,536
- Which one was...
- No, the neck one.

488
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,506
So now, we haven't even
cast a prosthetic yet.

489
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,909
We have no duplicates
of this stone positive.

490
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:21,245
It's not gonna register the same. At all.

491
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,448
At this point, I start
to get really worried.

492
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,850
Everything started breaking.

493
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:28,785
I was, like, holy ****,
this can't be happening.

494
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,520
You know, the judges, they don't
want to hear your excuses.

495
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:31,554
They want to see something great.

496
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:34,592
- Coming up...
- I don't know

497
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:36,159
that we're gonna get done in time.

498
00:22:36,193 --> 00:22:37,727
You know, it's down to the wire.

499
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:41,030
Conor's giving Megan credit
I know she doesn't deserve.

500
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:42,966
Jo, do you have something to say?
You're acting disgusted.

501
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:47,170
Who did what precisely?

502
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:52,183
- Tate!
- Yo!

503
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,284
The positive just snapped.

504
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,186
Look at this, man.

505
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,355
Our positive snaps.

506
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,757
There's only one lifecast
of each of our models.

507
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,526
So I immediately start problem-solving

508
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:02,827
and trying to get us back in the game.

509
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:05,030
Even though we have a good mold,

510
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:06,932
we can't make our prosthetic
without the lifecast,

511
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:08,366
which is now broken.

512
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,201
So I took a vaccuform,

513
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:11,127
which is a plastic version

514
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:12,536
of our actor's face that we already made,

515
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,538
and realized that I could run a prosthetic

516
00:23:14,573 --> 00:23:15,973
with that in its place as the lifecast.

517
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:17,708
- What is that?
- Sand.

518
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,543
This is what we call ghetto-rigging a mold.

519
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:21,378
By filling it with sand, we got the weight

520
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:22,880
that the lifecast would have given us

521
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:25,182
so we can make our
prosthetics out of the mold.

522
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,685
That's another thing I pride myself in.
I get it done.

523
00:23:35,427 --> 00:23:36,427
- You know?
- I know.

524
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:40,331
Megan's cleaning a lot.

525
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:42,600
She's Conor's little maid to say the least.

526
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:45,536
Conor molded everything,
he sculpted everything.

527
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,004
It will help her in this challenge,

528
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,672
and she'll probably stay one more week

529
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,542
and I'm probably going to be
that much more upset about it.

530
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:55,112
Oh, my God.

531
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,314
That's an amazing pair of boobs.

532
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:59,617
Oh, look at those.

533
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,788
Anthony's finally whole.

534
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:14,965
All right, guys, pack it up.

535
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:15,966
Let's go!

536
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,967
We did good, honeybee!

537
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:19,369
Nice work.

538
00:24:32,713 --> 00:24:34,080
It's application day,

539
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:36,817
and we are going to be
down to the wire on ours.

540
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:40,619
Once the prosthetics has set up,

541
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,021
it can be removed from the mold,

542
00:24:42,056 --> 00:24:44,557
applied to the models face and painted.

543
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:47,261
We have five hours for application

544
00:24:47,295 --> 00:24:48,562
and we have one hour of Last Looks

545
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,364
before they go onstage.

546
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:06,249
I really did try to incorporate

547
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:07,250
some of the notes I was given

548
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:08,919
from the Foundation Challenge.

549
00:25:08,953 --> 00:25:11,888
A big part of it is shaping
to make it look natural.

550
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:14,757
And as you lay it, you have
to work backwards, kind of.

551
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:17,593
Because if you put the top
of a mustache on first,

552
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:19,628
you'll never get the bottom
underneath that hair.

553
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:21,997
Doing okay?

554
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,366
- Right here?
- Yeah.

555
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,540
Doing the beauty makeup today,

556
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,141
this is where I'm going to thrive.

557
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:37,210
This needs to be extravagant,

558
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:41,581
almost like a drag queen,
but not too glamorous.

559
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,253
Is he starting to look hot?

560
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:47,554
If I blur my eyes a little bit,

561
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,890
I'm starting to get a little, like, "Ooh!"

562
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,725
- What's your name?
- What's up, girl?

563
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:57,765
All right, guys, that's 15 minutes.
15 minutes.

564
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,800
Have you seen yourself yet?

565
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:02,903
Honestly, dude, you could
pass for a chick, easy.

566
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,073
As the clock's ticking down
to the last couple seconds,

567
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,523
I'm finishing it up before

568
00:26:08,524 --> 00:26:10,811
we go to the studios to do our Last Looks.

569
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,245
It's hard to impress these judges,

570
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,781
so I'm really getting nervous.

571
00:26:20,523 --> 00:26:24,894
We're backstage, and we have
one hour to do our Last Looks.

572
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,433
We're about to go out on stage

573
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:31,234
and I'm not feeling great about it.

574
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:34,204
We lost a lot of time with the air pockets,

575
00:26:34,238 --> 00:26:37,040
so we're hoping that the judges understand.

576
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:38,609
Five minutes, everybody!

577
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:48,150
All right, guys, that's it. Tools down.

578
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:50,219
I know the judges are going
to have their critiques

579
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:52,354
and we may be on the chopping block.

580
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,690
If we're going out, we're
going out with a bang.

581
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:00,230
We walk onto the stage

582
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:02,899
and it is like the Four Seasons...

583
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:06,637
Trees, lights, and a live
audience in the studio.

584
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:09,273
Welcome to the "Face Off" Reveal stage.

585
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:12,078
Tonight, one of you will be eliminated.

586
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:15,079
So this week, your spotlight challenge

587
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:17,248
was to make up real life engaged couples

588
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:18,283
for their big wedding day,

589
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:20,251
but you had to do a gender swap...

590
00:27:20,286 --> 00:27:22,254
Turn the bride into the groom

591
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:23,522
and the groom into the bride.

592
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:25,090
And we have set the stage

593
00:27:25,124 --> 00:27:27,225
and have invited their friends
and family to witness this all.

594
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:30,262
I realize how much harder
this challenge is now.

595
00:27:30,297 --> 00:27:32,498
This is not just about
us versus the judges.

596
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:37,136
It's us versus the judges and the
couples' friends and family.

597
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,005
Let's say hello to our judges.

598
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,676
Owner of "Optic Nerve" Makeup
Effects Studio, Glenn Hetrick.

599
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,810
Good evening, guys.

600
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:46,547
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist, Ve Neill.

601
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,648
Hi, everybody.

602
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,850
And creature designer and director

603
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:50,852
Patrick Tatopoulus.

604
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:51,852
Good seeing you guys.

605
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,554
Hi, Patrick.

606
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,322
Let's get started.

607
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:59,392
First up is Conor and Megan's
couple, Willie and Cecily.

608
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:13,105
It looks like Grace Jones
and Lionel Ritchie.

609
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:16,409
It was perfect.

610
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,578
And the chin, even though Conor put it on,

611
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:21,581
I blended it in with makeup.

612
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,417
He looked gorgeous!

613
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,086
The chin didn't really make the woman.

614
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,589
To me, it still looked like I was watching

615
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:28,756
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.

616
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:29,924
You could still see the guy in there.

617
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,727
What are you laughing it? You look great!

618
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,632
Sam and Gage's couple, Greg and Annie.

619
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:52,077
Seeing my couple come down the aisle,

620
00:28:52,112 --> 00:28:53,545
I was so happy with our makeups.

621
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,880
I know they could have been better.

622
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:57,549
I know that, but for what
turned out and what they were,

623
00:28:57,584 --> 00:29:00,319
I'm really happy with it.

624
00:29:00,354 --> 00:29:01,887
Old age makeups are tough

625
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:04,490
without trying to do a gender
swap at the same time.

626
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:07,259
I can see edges all the
way around both of them.

627
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:08,660
Their makeups don't look done.

628
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:13,165
Next is Tom and Jo's
couple, Dean and Mirai.

629
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:24,077
When our models come out,

630
00:29:24,111 --> 00:29:26,747
you know, it's kind of jokey.

631
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:29,583
You know, ha-ha, they're
in a powder blue tuxedo

632
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:32,620
and this Viking man-wife.

633
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,023
It's fun.

634
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:38,792
I love this challenge.

635
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:41,928
This is so great.

636
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:45,731
I'm sorry.

637
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:48,501
And lastly we have Tate
and Anthony's couple,

638
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:50,636
Peter and Kathleen.

639
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,780
Tate and I, we are so confident now.

640
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:04,452
We have this. The room loved it...

641
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,054
Even the other contestants.

642
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,856
They start walking down the aisle,

643
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,559
and all the sudden Peter
starts having contractions.

644
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:15,596
It was genius.

645
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,131
She struts up to the judge's table,

646
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,065
takes her sunglasses down, looks at them.

647
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,400
It was awesome.

648
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:27,573
Who wants to judge?

649
00:30:37,284 --> 00:30:40,253
To the friends and the family
of the engaged couples,

650
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:42,590
I'm sure on their wedding
day, at least, I hope so,

651
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,192
they will look much more recognizable.

652
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:47,629
So with that, thank you all
so much for being here.

653
00:30:47,663 --> 00:30:50,098
Well it was great to have a
little levity for a change,

654
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:52,334
but now it's back to the competition.

655
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:53,602
"How am I doing?"

656
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:56,371
"How are the judges going to rate this?"

657
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,777
Judges, why don't you
go take a closer look?

658
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:09,283
Could you lean down for us?

659
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:11,784
I'm looking at my competitors' work

660
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:15,389
and I think Sam and Gage
are in deep trouble.

661
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,858
Is it the foam, or is it
just glued down incorrectly?

662
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:20,694
I know the judges are going
to be extremely critical,

663
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:21,962
and I'm sweating bullets.

664
00:31:21,996 --> 00:31:23,330
I'm freaking out.

665
00:31:25,587 --> 00:31:26,936
Could you lean down for us?

666
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:30,158
I'm terrified that they're
going to immediately hone in

667
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:32,160
on the spots where the applied prosthetics

668
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:35,063
have very visible folds
and wrinkles in them.

669
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:39,167
Is it the foam or is it just
glued down incorrectly?

670
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:41,669
Is it skinned? Maybe it got skinned.

671
00:31:41,704 --> 00:31:43,171
It feels this a little...

672
00:31:43,206 --> 00:31:44,372
It looks like it.

673
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,309
Mind all the little details.

674
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:49,744
The chin.

675
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:53,113
The brow cover is a pretty good idea.

676
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:56,249
Wish she would have refined
the brows a little bit more

677
00:31:56,284 --> 00:31:57,251
since she covered it.

678
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:58,686
Could have made it really feminine.

679
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,121
I have so much insecurity

680
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:01,756
based on previous competitions.

681
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,191
I'm not assuming anything.

682
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:08,530
Nose. Cheeks, too?

683
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:11,767
It's a lot of color for a flesh makeup.

684
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:13,737
They're, like, touching the eyebrows,

685
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,906
trying to figure out
what exactly I've done.

686
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,641
There aren't any prosthetics on him.

687
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:18,742
It's all just makeup.

688
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:20,578
- Is that your nose?
- Mm-hmm.

689
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,416
I think she's got a forehead on, too.

690
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:28,186
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

691
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,021
What happened here?

692
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,022
Cut himself shaving.

693
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:32,390
This is the kind of stuff I like.

694
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:34,525
As far as the people that
I think are in trouble,

695
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,861
it's not because of their execution,

696
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:40,064
it's because I feel that mine
and Anthony's are superior.

697
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:44,835
The judges have scored your couples,

698
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,717
and this week they would

699
00:32:45,718 --> 00:32:47,270
like to speak with each
and every one of you

700
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:49,005
to learn more about your work.

701
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,374
Gage and Sam, please step forward.

702
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:01,050
From far away, when they first came out,

703
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:04,721
I liked the overall idea of
the design and everything.

704
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:08,559
There's copious amounts of
color on both of their faces

705
00:33:08,594 --> 00:33:11,563
and I'm not seeing a lot
of diversity in the colors

706
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:15,233
that you picked to try to
bring the skin to life.

707
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:18,402
You guys really bit off more
than you could chew here.

708
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,338
I think that we both really wanted to try

709
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:22,139
to do something very different.

710
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:24,641
And a lot of this is fairly new to me.

711
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,477
And I think that in some cases,
it really does show.

712
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:33,283
I think this aspect of mixing the gender,

713
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:34,684
that works maybe a little bit easier

714
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:36,018
when you do old age makeup.

715
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:37,586
And I think that's maybe
very clever that way.

716
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:40,489
You pushed, you challenged yourself.

717
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,524
This is something to admire.
That's my take.

718
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:44,025
Thank you.

719
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,026
I think that you took a very bold step

720
00:33:46,061 --> 00:33:48,028
in trying to do that age makeup.

721
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:49,596
As many times as I've done them

722
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:51,197
they're very difficult for me to do.

723
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:53,666
My hat's off to you for a good try, guys.

724
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,635
Thank you very much.
If you would please step back.

725
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,704
Thank you.

726
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,273
Now let's talk to Conor and Megan.

727
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,880
The first question I want to
ask you about these makeups,

728
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:09,850
who did what, precisely,
with detail, please.

729
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:13,487
Together, we took snaps from the
vaccuforms of their lifecasts.

730
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:16,490
And we molded it all together,

731
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:17,892
got it from the gelatin.

732
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:22,663
Conor is giving Megan credit
that I know she doesn't deserve.

733
00:34:22,698 --> 00:34:24,732
There are things that he's saying she did

734
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:27,201
that she didn't do.

735
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:28,636
Once the appliances were on,

736
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,104
you handled all of the makeup from there?

737
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,239
Yes, I did.

738
00:34:31,273 --> 00:34:35,109
I also tinted the nose and chin for her.

739
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:36,610
Excellent job.

740
00:34:36,644 --> 00:34:37,845
I'm really happy with
both of these makeups.

741
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,713
Thank you.

742
00:34:39,748 --> 00:34:42,216
Really well done. The coloring is solid...

743
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,851
Jo, do you have something
to say over there?

744
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:45,752
You're acting a little bit disgusted.

745
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,254
Oh, not disgusted.

746
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,089
It's just that when it came to duties,

747
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:51,359
it did seem like Conor was taking over

748
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:52,960
the majority of what was going on.

749
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:57,598
So, Megan, what exactly did
you do on these makeups?

750
00:34:57,632 --> 00:35:01,435
On the bride I did the beauty makeup.

751
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:03,537
You didn't do any of the
sculpting of the prosthetics?

752
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:05,106
I did. I did the chin.

753
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,208
You sculpted the chin on the bride?

754
00:35:07,242 --> 00:35:09,543
- Yes.
- Okay. Nice job. Very well done.

755
00:35:09,578 --> 00:35:11,212
- Thank you.
- I love the bride.

756
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:13,214
I think she's gorgeous.

757
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,916
Can I just say that Megan was...

758
00:35:15,951 --> 00:35:18,686
I chose her as a partner
because of her skills

759
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,054
as a beauty makeup artist?

760
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:21,555
She helped me every step of the way...

761
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,157
Conor, out of curiosity,

762
00:35:23,192 --> 00:35:25,994
why did you feel the need
to defend Megan's position?

763
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:28,162
Um, because I really don't like

764
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:30,631
some of the back-biting that's
been going on in this competition.

765
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,235
And I don't understand

766
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:35,303
why our time up here had to be interrupted.

767
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:36,604
Understood.

768
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,574
Conor, Megan, you can step back.

769
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:40,975
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

770
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,745
I'm furious with Jo.

771
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:45,480
She was my teammate two challenges ago.

772
00:35:45,514 --> 00:35:49,250
I really gave her a lot of
credit in that challenge,

773
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,553
honestly, I think, moreso than I needed to.

774
00:35:52,922 --> 00:35:55,024
Tom and Jo, please come forward.

775
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:07,035
Okay, I got to ask, who
made the Keebler elf?

776
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,770
I'm responsible for Keebler elf.

777
00:36:08,804 --> 00:36:11,039
Really? What the heck were you thinking?

778
00:36:11,074 --> 00:36:13,541
He's kind of a trailer park '70s guy.

779
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:16,044
He kind of looks like he would be in

780
00:36:16,078 --> 00:36:17,645
the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

781
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,848
He does! He looks like one of
those bad animatronic critters.

782
00:36:20,882 --> 00:36:23,484
That's not a good thing, Tom.

783
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:26,153
Tom, I like that you're trying to play with

784
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:28,822
some funky little trailer trash thing...

785
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,156
'70s, it's all cool.

786
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:33,660
My biggest thing is that face
looks very feminine still.

787
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:34,827
I would have worked on the nose.

788
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:36,096
Make it maybe a little bit harsher.

789
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,999
Anything, just still
keeping that '70s look,

790
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,334
but making it more male.

791
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,036
I don't know what the
heck went wrong there,

792
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,406
but it went all the way wrong.

793
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:49,345
All right, and what did
you do to the bride?

794
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:51,013
We didn't want to add prosthetics on him.

795
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:52,815
So he has no prosthetics on.

796
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,817
No prosthetics.

797
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:54,818
- Just a lot of really gray makeup.
- Um...

798
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,920
- Is that it?
- I guess so. Yeah.

799
00:36:56,954 --> 00:36:58,488
Yeah.

800
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:02,292
I'm disappointed, guys.

801
00:37:05,396 --> 00:37:08,030
Jo, Tom, could you please take a step back?

802
00:37:08,064 --> 00:37:09,398
Thank you.

803
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:17,572
Tate and Anthony, would you
please step forward.

804
00:37:21,678 --> 00:37:24,713
I got to tell you, your idea was great.

805
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:27,116
It was definitely the crescendo
of my laugh attacks.

806
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,984
- So, um...
- Thank you.

807
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:30,820
Who did what with the makeup?

808
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:32,555
I sculpted the Adam's apple appliance,

809
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,824
the chin, cheekbones, nose, forehead.

810
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,259
I did the beauty makeup.

811
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:39,262
He was already very
androgynous, so we felt...

812
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:41,400
- Yeah, he's very pretty.
- Absolutely.

813
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:42,768
He's gorgeous.

814
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:47,605
I like the fact that he has fingernails.
That's nice.

815
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,008
I think it was a real paying of attention

816
00:37:50,042 --> 00:37:52,344
to transform a female into a male

817
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:55,781
beyond the typical beard
and things you expect.

818
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,049
Thank you.

819
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,317
I was very impressed with it.

820
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:00,252
I appreciate it. Thank you.

821
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:01,721
Thank you. If you'd please step back.

822
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:08,561
Nice work, homey.

823
00:38:10,064 --> 00:38:11,965
So, judges, have you come to a decision?

824
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:14,000
- Yep.
- We have.

825
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:15,802
I want to remind all of you

826
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:16,613
that the winner of the

827
00:38:16,614 --> 00:38:18,203
Spotlight Challenge will
have the opportunity

828
00:38:18,238 --> 00:38:19,999
to consult with the judges

829
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,642
on who they think should be eliminated.

830
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,745
Glenn, why don't you tell us
who the top team is tonight?

831
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:29,482
Tate and Anthony, you took a
huge risk and it paid off.

832
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,651
Conrad and Megan,

833
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:34,487
the execution of your
beauty makeup was flawless.

834
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,890
Our top team tonight is...

835
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:42,696
Conrad and Megan.

836
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:48,669
Good job.

837
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:53,875
So, then, who's the winner?

838
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:59,447
We feel that the most
successful transformation

839
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:02,016
was on Willie.

840
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,519
It's a beautiful beauty makeup,

841
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,354
and, Megan, you were most responsible

842
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,189
for the makeup on Willie, is that correct?

843
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:09,224
Yes, that's correct.

844
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,427
Then you are our winner.

845
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:14,729
Congratulations.

846
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:17,832
You deserve it.

847
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:19,233
Congratulations.

848
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,804
I covered my face. I almost fell over.

849
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:24,873
I was like, "Oh, my God."

850
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:26,541
Thank... thank... thank you.

851
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:28,410
Thank you! Thank you a lot.

852
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:30,078
What?

853
00:39:31,981 --> 00:39:34,383
I thought I was going to
vomit all over the stage.

854
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:35,566
That is the most disgusting

855
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,185
thing I've heard since I've been here.

856
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,221
Congratulations, Megan.

857
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:41,056
You have earned the right
to consult with the judges

858
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,392
on who you feel should be eliminated.

859
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:45,393
The rest of you can head
back to the makeup room

860
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:48,030
and wait until the judges
have reached their decision.

861
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:49,265
Thank you.

862
00:39:53,269 --> 00:39:55,971
That was insanely different
than I had imagined.

863
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:57,506
At least we know who's going home.

864
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,908
They ripped my makeup apart
worse than they ripped yours.

865
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:03,244
If they're judging this
competition in particular,

866
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,112
than I will be packing my bags.

867
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:11,084
Megan, who do you think did the
worst job on this challenge?

868
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,321
Um, the person I feel did the worst is Tom.

869
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:19,259
The eyebrows, the coloring, the beard...

870
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:23,877
Out of all the lineups, it
definitely stood out as the worst.

871
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:25,800
Megan, thank you very much.

872
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:27,035
Thank you.

873
00:40:29,973 --> 00:40:31,707
So, judges, it's pretty apparent

874
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:34,243
that you thought Tom and Joe
were the weakest team tonight.

875
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:36,145
What are your thoughts on Tom?

876
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:41,929
I think that Tom's makeup is the
stand out in terms of quality.

877
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,384
The hair work, the eyebrows...

878
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:45,219
I don't know why the nose
wasn't more masculine

879
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:46,421
if you're going to sculpt a nose.

880
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:48,389
There was no attempt to
try to make that face

881
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:50,424
less feminine and more masculine.

882
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,058
I don't know. The whole thing threw me off.

883
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:53,727
I couldn't get past the beard.

884
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:58,148
With Jo you have, basically,
a foundation makeup.

885
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:01,068
At least Tom attempted prosthetics.

886
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:04,239
Jo did a very basic beauty makeup

887
00:41:04,273 --> 00:41:06,441
with no dynamics or color of any kind.

888
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:08,943
It was completely flat.

889
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:11,079
And allowing your makeup
to go completely gray

890
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:12,714
because of poor layer choices...

891
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:15,418
even without prosthetics she
could have used stipple coats

892
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:18,921
to create a new flesh tone
that looked alive and real.

893
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:20,456
Even if that wouldn't have succeeded,

894
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,692
at least showing fundamental skills...

895
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:27,029
Today they both did something
that was really not acceptable, I think.

896
00:41:27,063 --> 00:41:30,031
Megan was saying that, you know,
Tom should go home.

897
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:32,366
I think if we gave Tom that
chance 100 times over,

898
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,867
Tom would try to send Megan home

899
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:35,602
and Megan would try to send Tom home.

900
00:41:35,637 --> 00:41:37,571
So, judges, have you reached
your decision then?

901
00:41:37,606 --> 00:41:39,440
- Yeah.
- Yes.

902
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:40,742
All right, let's bring them out, then.

903
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:46,247
So, judges, who's going home tonight?

904
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:01,276
So, judges, who's going home tonight?

905
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:08,684
Tom, your makeup tonight was an
abysmal failure on all levels...

906
00:42:08,718 --> 00:42:13,188
The eyebrows, the beard, the coloring.

907
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:16,959
Jo, you also had an unmitigated disaster

908
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,628
because it was unambitious

909
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,297
and it was a simple color makeup

910
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,099
without prosthetics underneath,

911
00:42:23,134 --> 00:42:25,102
and we failed even on that level.

912
00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:33,509
The person going home is...

913
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,014
Jo.

914
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,687
Thank you.

915
00:42:45,721 --> 00:42:47,322
Please head back to the makeup room

916
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,823
and pack up your kit.

917
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,225
Okay.

918
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,332
Oh, Jo.

919
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,469
Walking away at this
point, I've done a lot,

920
00:43:00,503 --> 00:43:02,471
and it does put that flame
in me to keep going.

921
00:43:02,505 --> 00:43:03,839
I might be right out of school,

922
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,340
but at least I know how to **** make a mold.

923
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,843
There you go. Get it out.

924
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,579
Megan, you know what you've done here.

925
00:43:10,614 --> 00:43:13,349
If you think that you can do better, do it.

926
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,602
Don't hold back or pull

927
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:16,987
on someone's coattails
to get you to the win.

928
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:20,991
- Peace out, girl.
- Bye, Jo.

929
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:22,793
Everything that I have
has gone into my work

930
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:24,962
and I think it shows.

931
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:26,296
I definitely think that I've proved

932
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:29,399
that I work hard enough, I
have a place in this industry.
