1
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:03,753
<i>Tonight, it's a competition
like no other.</i>

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,472
<i>We brought 12 talented
special effects</i>

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,041
<i>makeup artists to Los Angeles,</i>

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,644
<i>where they'll compete
to join the world's elite.</i>

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>Week after week,
they'll face surprising challenges...</i>

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,974
Drop 'em.

7
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,752
Oh, my God.
What am I going to do?

8
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>... with seemingly
impossible deadlines.</i>

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,940
[bleep] whoa!

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,491
<i>As the pressure rises...</i>

11
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:26,826
I'm having a panic attack.

12
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:27,611
You want to [bleep]
do details, do details.

13
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,030
I feel like I'm being
made out to be the bad guy here.

14
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,130
<i>... some will crumble...</i>

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,866
Whoa! You okay?

16
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,534
I basically just lost
the [bleep] competition.

17
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,994
We have no idea
what the hell we're doing.

18
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,162
This might be the end.

19
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>... while others will shine.</i>

20
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,209
- Holy [bleep].
- That's crazy.

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,961
I think we found
our challenger over here.

22
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,081
Time's up, everybody.

23
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,149
<i>To make it to the top,
they'll have to impress</i>

24
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>our award-winning panel of judges-</i>

25
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,820
<i>Ve Neill, the legendary
makeup artist,</i>

26
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,014
<i>8-time Oscar nominee

27
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,625

00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,094
<i>"Beetlejuice", "Batman Returns",

29
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>and the "Pirates

30
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,966
<i>Glenn Hetrick, cutting-edge

31
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,768

<i>"X-Files", and

33
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,865
<i>and Patrick Tatopoulus,
visionary creature designer</i>

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,942
<i>for "Independence Day", Godzilla",</i>

35
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,619
<i>"Stargate", "I, Robot"</i>

36
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,372
<i>and director of "Underworld:
Rise of the Lycans".</i>

37
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,123
I'm a very, very
big fan of your work.

38
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:22,999
I'm blown away.

39
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,351
I love this challenge.

40
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,586
<i>Who will be the next great name
in movie magic</i>

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,422
<i>and earn $100,000 dollars</i>

44
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,439
Tate: My name is Tate.

45
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,574
I'm 31 and I live
in Brooklyn, New York.

46
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,310
I've been doing special
effects for eight years.

47
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,112
I am extremely excited
to show everyone what I can do.

48
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,550
Megan: My name is Megan.

49
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,694
I'm 24, from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

50
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,655
I am ecstatic to be here.

51
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,366
Winning this
is very important to me.

52
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,952
I don't want to clean up
shop floors anymore.

53
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,163
Jo: I'm Jo Holland.

54
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,541
I'm 21, straight out of school.

55
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,585
My mother was very young
when she had me.

56
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,504
She let me be creative
and do my own thing,

57
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,407
and now I'm in
an industry that I love.

58
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,142
That's why I would love to win this

59
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,844
and I'd love to make her proud.

60
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,479
- What's your name?
- Megan.

61
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,847
- Megan, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

62
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,281
- And you?
- Anthony.

63
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,683
- How you doing, Anthony?
- Nice to meet you, too.

64
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,101
I own a makeup effects company
in New York City.

65
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,520
I've been doing this about 15 years.

66
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,148
I'm a self-proclaimed
MacGyver of makeup.

67
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,233
I will take whatever
I need to to get it right.

68
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,893
- How's it going, guys?
- How you doing?

69
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,328
My name's Tom.

70
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,263
Tom: I've been making
monsters for 11 years.

71
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:18,798
I am very dyslexic.

72
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,700
I have a real hard time
reading and writing.

73
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,035
That's kind of why I chose the arts.

74
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,703
- Tate.
- Tate!

75
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,570
- Nice to meet you.
- Tom.

76
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,772
Tom. Sergio.

77
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,273
I'm from San Antonio, Texas.

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,249
I'm 31 years old.

79
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,334
Did everybody here go to school?

80
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,794
Man: Yeah.

81
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,779
Sergio: I've never really
had formal training,

82
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,716
so it's a little scary because
it made me think about my shortcomings.

83
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,885
Keep it going.

84
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,786
It's a party.

85
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,556
Gage: My name's Gage Hubbard.

86
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
I've been in the business
for six years.

87
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,562
I'm super excited to be
a part of this competition.

88
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,064
It could make or break my career.

89
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,441
- How are you?
- What's your name?

90
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,401
Hey, what's up, Tom?

91
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,403
Tommy and I have had
a long history of working together,

92
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,039
and we can bump heads creatively.

93
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,441
Tom: Definitely,
Gage was my protege.

94
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,452
His first six films
were with me or from me.

95
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,162
Frank: My name's Frank Ippolito.

96
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,414
I've lived in Los Angeles
for 10 years.

97
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,349
I'm in magazines, on TV,

98
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,334
and I work on these giant movies.

99
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,384
I can't settle for last.

100
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:15,964
Conor: My name is Conor McCullagh.

101
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,691
I currently live
in Orlando, Florida.

102
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,693
I'm relying on the skills
that I've been honing

103
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,637
for 20 years to win this thing.

104
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,599
[chattering]

105
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,688
McKenzie: Hey, guys.
Welcome to "Face Off".

106
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,481
I'm your host, McKenzie Westmore.

107
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,708
Gage: I know the Westmore name.

108
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,111
Her whole family's
been a huge influence

109
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,146
on the makeup industry for so long.

110
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,824
Conor: Westmore is synonymous
with makeup effects,

111
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,701
especially with all
the "Star Trek" series.

112
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,161
I was very much in awe.

113
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,537
Over the next coming weeks,

114
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,555
you will all be put to the test

115
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,557
as we determine who among you

116
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:55,086
is the best special effects
makeup artist.

117
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,296
Is everyone up for the challenge?

118
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,930
All: Yes.

119
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,567
Good, because your first competition

120
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,719
starts right now.

121
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,605
Megan: This is the first day,

122
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,240
I have a cute little dress on,

123
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,349
drinking champagne,

124
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,743
and now you want to challenge me.

125
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,178
Good God.

126
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,280
This is a Foundation Challenge.

127
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,617
Foundation Challenges
give you a perk or advantage

128
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,860
going into the Spotlight Challenge,

129
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,572
where someone will be
eliminated each week.

130
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,359
Before we begin,
I would like to introduce you

131
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,960
to your judge for this challenge.

132
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,030
He's work on everything
from "Buffy" and "X-files"

133
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,373
to "The Prestige" and "Legion".

134
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,251
Please welcome Glenn Hetrick.

135
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,907
- Hey, Glenn.
- Hello.

136
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,634
Tate: Glenn's done everything,

137
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:43,943
so when I heard he was a judge,

138
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,345
I literally back-flipped.

139
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,513
McKenzie: Everything
that you see in this room

140
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,150
is going to be
a part of this challenge.

141
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,729
In fact, your waiters
are going to be your models.

142
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,255
Guys?

143
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,494
Wow.

144
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,997
Each model has a makeup kit
provided by Alcone.

145
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,533
You're going to have to
create an original face makeup

146
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,618
on your subjects.

147
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,670
Wow, man.

148
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,738
You're also
going to have to integrate

149
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,875
at least one item from this party
into your makeup.

150
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,112
And the stakes are huge.

151
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,299
The winner tonight gets immunity from
this week's elimination.

152
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,421
We're looking for
originality in your design.

153
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,855
But most importantly,

154
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,357
I'm looking for good technique

155
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,859
in your application and your paint.

156
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:37,563
You have two hours,
and your time starts now.

157
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,535
Megan: I grab the balloons.

158
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:46,105
I know nobody's going to
grab the balloons.

159
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,174
Tate: I saw these awesome flowers.

160
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,043
I'm going to glue them
to the head as horns.

161
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,579
I'm Sam, and I'm currently
living in Decatur, Georgia.

162
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,415
I have a lot
of classic arts training,

163
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:59,285
but I'm here to challenge my skills.

164
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,653
Get going with this.

165
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,188
Marcel: My name is Marcel

166
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,723
and I saw my first horror film
when I was four years old.

167
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,924
My parents explained to me,

168
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,050
"That's makeup, that's an actor."

169
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,376
And I was like,
"That would be so cool to do."

170
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,098
What the hell is this?

171
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,332
Anthony: The first thing I did
was I opened up my box

172
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,233
and I started ripping through it.

173
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,501
All right, brush kit.

174
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,536
I recognized 90%
of the stuff in there.

175
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,646
I was thanking God.

176
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,648
Jo: It's extremely intimidating.

177
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,174
You almost have to be a chemist

178
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,609
for most of this stuff
that we're using.

179
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,278
Frank: It was really hard

180
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,979
to even come up with something.

181
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,181
But I saw these peacock feathers
that looked like eyes

182
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,409
and I tried to make something
that was a bit sensible.

183
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,721
Conor: There were pre-made
prosthetic pieces in the kit,

184
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,832
and I found this leopard nose.

185
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,417
And I was like, "This is perfect."

186
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,696
So you're going to be
a reptilian creature.

187
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,382
I'm gluing heavy pineapple
leaves onto a guy's face.

188
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,634
I grab the Pros-Aide.

189
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,804
It's a contact cement
that can hold foam on real well.

190
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,806
I figure a happier zombie
to show my personality.

191
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,808
So I'm going to make teeth
out of cauliflower.

192
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,712
Jessica: I'm Jessica Kramer
from Scottdale, Pennsylvania.

193
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,580
I know I already beat out
a bunch of people to get here

194
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,816
and people would die
to be in my spot, so...

195
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,276
I know it's going to be tough.
It's going to be very tough.

196
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,361
You have one hour left.

197
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,993
How you guys doing?
I'm just about done.

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,928
Frank: Just by me being a big mouth,

199
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,413
I think that throws
a couple people off their game.

200
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,666
You guys can take your time
on the rest of that hour.

201
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,302
"I'm almost done!" I'm almost done!"

202
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,295
Shut up, Frank.

203
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,339
Anthony: This guy
puts on a prosthetic

204
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,590
and puts some brown makeup on it

205
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,092
and sat down and started eating.

206
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,410
Wow, this guy,
he's really full of...

207
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,251
I knew that a lot of people

208
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,586
we're going to go for horror.

209
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,272
I wanted to do something
a little more artistic.

210
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,566
You never quite know
how it's going to turn out.

211
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,527
If something doesn't work,
find another creative way of doing it

212
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,946
and it looks better
than what you've already thought of.

213
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,965
Tate: With about 45 minutes left

214
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,867
I had to abandon the horn idea

215
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,494
because they started to do this.

216
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,414
These things were literally
secreting juice.

217
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,666
I'm not a botanist.
I don't know this stuff.

218
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,923
Your time is up.

219
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,510
I'm completely unhappy.

220
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,987
- Hey, Tate.
- Hey, what's going on?

221
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,639
You want to tell us
a little bit about what you did here?

222
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,425
Tate: I didn't get to do
exactly what I wanted,

223
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,861
but I think that I pulled
a decent character together.

224
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,829
You do, huh?

225
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,730
Well, I guess that's your call.

226
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,940
How about the color?

227
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,733
I didn't have a chance
to go in and powder.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,110
I'm happy with my edges.

229
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,902
All right.

230
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,039
Thank you.

231
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,674
Gage: I was expecting the worst.

232
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,285
I literally put up my shield
and was like,

233
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,446
"All right, let's hear it."

234
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,349
My whole idea was as if
he was going to pick up his prom date

235
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,710
and she took his flowers
and smashed them up through his face.

236
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,120
But I also wanted to have
a little bit of symmetry.

237
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,215
I wanted it to be a little bit more
interesting than just mush on his face.

238
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,428
I actually really like this, a lot.

239
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,129
What excites me
about what you're saying

240
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,131
is that the symmetry is on purpose.

241
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,309
Fundamentally, it's very well done.

242
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,643
Thank you.

243
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,236
Marcel: I don't care
how confident you are,

244
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,939
if someone of that caliber
is up in your work,

245
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,641
you're going to be nervous.

246
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,943
I was trying to incorporate
the hotel into this makeup.

247
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,155
She came here on a date,
got turned down,

248
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,656
and she had revenge.

249
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,565
I think David Bowie
is going to love it.

250
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,372
You've got the idea.
I don't think that comes across.

251
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,890
Anthony: I'm watching Glenn,

252
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,091
and as he's going through the line

253
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,994
he's literally picking
[bleep] apart.

254
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,796
I'm like, "Dude,
we have flowers and two hours."

255
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,565
I mean, come on!

256
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,674
My roommate believes
that aliens live among us,

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,968
so this is one of them.

258
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,285
And it took me about an hour.

259
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,932
Glenn: I wish you would've broken
the color up more, though,

260
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,768
especially when you're telling me
it only took you an hour

261
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,144
and you're happy about that.

262
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,312
Okay.

263
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm disappointed you didn't utilize

264
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,857
all the time that you had
at your disposal.

265
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,982
Everyone else clearly did.

266
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,587
Thank you.

267
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,948
Anthony: I was elated
when Frank got called on it.

268
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,199
Bit him right in the ass.

269
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,626
I incorporated a couple aspects

270
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,619
of some different reptiles.

271
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,563
And, of course, a chameleon eye.

272
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,749
I'm impressed. You clearly knew
where it was going.

273
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,801
- Very cool.
- Thank you.

274
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,370
You could do anything.
You could do pretty, you could do ugly.

275
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,539
You could do scary,
you do a monster.

276
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,941
This foundation challenge
has big stakes.

277
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,109
You get immunity if you win,

278
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,844
so of course I want to win.

279
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,715
So, Glenn, the winner is?

280
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,750
Glenn: This is a tough decision.

281
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,886
It came down between Gage...

282
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,021
great eye, really nice balance...

283
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,056
and Tom.

284
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,652
You had the most creative use
of the materials.

285
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:35,903
The winner is...

286
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,244
This is a tough decision,

287
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:49,174
but it came down between
Gage and Tom.

288
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,409
Frank: Tom ended up hiring Gage

289
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,844
for his first couple of jobs,

290
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:52,670
so it's really interesting

291
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,346
to see them pit against each other.

292
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,015
Tom: I really want the immunity.

293
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,517
The last times I saw Gage's work

294
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,636
I think I could have
wiped the floor with him.

295
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,889
The winner is...

296
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,099
Gage.

297
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,526
Okay.

298
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:08,477
Gage: The moment of relief,

299
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,763
I don't know if it came
across on my face.

300
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,731
I was pretty dumb-founded.

301
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,232
Congratulations, Gage.

302
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,192
You have won immunity,

303
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:18,137
and you are safe from
elimination this week.

304
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,040
Gage: Tom and I, we're just getting
to know each other again.

305
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,975
I don't want to start
the whole thing off on the wrong foot

306
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,411
by being like,
"Okay, I won over you."

307
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,996
All right, guys, that's it for now.

308
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,664
Go check out your new loft,

309
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,584
and we will be seeing
all of you tomorrow.

310
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,262
Frank: Getting into these lofts
was really fun.

311
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,680
They're really cool spaces.

312
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,557
I'm kind of looking forward

313
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,309
to interacting with everybody
on a daily basis.

314
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,004
I just started jumping
on beds and on couches

315
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,672
just to drive Megan a little nuts.

316
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,400
This is a nice place, Frank!

317
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,011
Sam: I'm excited and nervous

318
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,530
and really unsure of what to expect.

319
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,493
Tate: I'm really tired,
but I'm also really excited.

320
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,670
I can't wait to see
what this lab is all about.

321
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,630
I'm out!

322
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,771
As soon as I walk into the lab,

323
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,681
it's literally Christmas.

324
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,110
I see the workspaces are great.

325
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,544
I see a woodshop,

326
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,581
I see ridiculous
amounts of materials...

327
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:39,118
all of the things that me
as an independent artist

328
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,861
don't have any access to.

329
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,949
Welcome to your new workplace.

330
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,128
Let's talk about your first
Spotlight Challenge.

331
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:53,749
You're going to have to create
a half-human half-animal hybrid.

332
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,671
But before I tell you anything else,

333
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,633
I'd like to give you a little bit
of inspiration for your creations.

334
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,884
First...

335
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,557
We've got a black beetle.

336
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,309
Beetles. That's gross.

337
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,520
Your next animal is...

338
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,359
[gasping]

339
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,820
... an ostrich.

340
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,130
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

341
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,132
Sergio: I've never really seen
as ostrich up close.

342
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,168
They told us to stay
three feet away and just look

343
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,369
because he'd poke your eyes out.

344
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,104
I have one more little
surprise for you.

345
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,751
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

346
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,477
Oh, my God!

347
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,670
Anthony: They open up the gates
to the place

348
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,130
and Dumbo walks in.

349
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,965
- Wow!
- Wow.

350
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,717
My hair stood up on my neck.

351
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,385
I was like, "A freaking
elephant in the building?"

352
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,921
This, everybody, is Susie.

353
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,139
Say hello to Susie.

354
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,270
You will be paired up
in teams of two.

355
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,430
Your teams were drawn randomly.

356
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,599
Each team will need
to choose an animal

357
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,068
to incorporate into your creations.

358
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,839
There are three animals
and two teams will use each one.

359
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,441
When it's your turn,
you will also need to select a model,

360
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,677
which you will be doing by selecting

361
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,694
one of the casts
of their heads off the shelf.

362
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,648
Jessica, Jo.

363
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,152
Jo is very young,
and it terrifies me.

364
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,453
It's going to be a scary challenge.

365
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,455
I say if we do the ostrich,
we get a girl.

366
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,132
I say if we do an elephant,
we do a male.

367
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,383
I think the beetle is a no go.

368
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,801
Jessica: I was thinking ostrich.

369
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,628
Let's do her.

370
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,463
Jessica: We decided to pick
Diana's life cast,

371
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,200
which is the exact
replica of her face, but in stone.

372
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,302
That's what we make
all our molds off of.

373
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,854
So if I wanted to have a beak,

374
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,523
I'd sculpt the beak on it
out of clay.

375
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,708
Sergio, Gage.

376
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,444
When she said it was Serge,
I had seen Serge's makeup.

377
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,213
My personal opinion of it
was that it was cool.

378
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,074
- I'd be up for the elephant...
- Okay, cool.

379
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,659
He has a nice full face.

380
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,152
That's the first one I looked at.

381
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,520
- Cool with that one?
- Yeah, yeah.

382
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,554
Go ahead and grab it.

383
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,322
[thunks twice]

384
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,390
- Crack.
- Sweet.

385
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,527
Let's go with the ostrich.
Joy. Okay.

386
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,671
Wonderful.

387
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,214
All right, elephant.

388
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,566
Maybe Jayson.
He's bigger.

389
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,733
Okay.

390
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:12,972
Beetle.

391
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,976
Which one do you want?

392
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,646
We get the tiniest
head in the bunch.

393
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,940
You will have have three days
for this challenge.

394
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,217
The judges will be
looking at your technique,

395
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,944
creativity, execution,

396
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,029
and your overall presentation.

397
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,573
Is everybody ready?

398
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,158
- Yes.
- Go ahead!

399
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,201
Come here, baby. Stay.

400
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,327
Oh, you!

401
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,362
Be careful.

402
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:38,664
Anthony: So I'm sketching it up

403
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,540
and asking the handler
a million questions.

404
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,749
Do they have teeth?
What's inside?

405
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,084
Is it basically just all beak?

406
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,627
Does it run,
does it fly, does it spit?

407
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:44,970
Anything I could think of

408
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,422
to help me incorporate
into my design.

409
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,840
It's almost like a triangle.

410
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,041
Do we have a soldering gun?

411
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,342
Yeah. It's one of these things.

412
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,543
Oh, sweet. Perfect.

413
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,711
We came up with this concept

414
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,214
of a 1950s mad scientist

415
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,049
that turns into an insect.

416
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,268
My idea was to make bug arms.

417
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,820
Marcel: Okay, everyone hold still.

418
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,689
Our concept is a giant beetle man

419
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:04,773
dressed as an exterminator.

420
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,191
It has to be...

421
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,226
It shouldn't be just
a very large beetle.

422
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,594
It should remind you of a humanoid.

423
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,904
So I'm going to sketch out mine.

424
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,896
You do whatever you want,
and then we'll mix and match.

425
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,030
Sure enough.

426
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,115
I want to elongate the neck here.

427
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,241
I was thinking about that, too.

428
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,335
I want to make the neck
as long as possible.

429
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,787
Megan: We're like,
"Why not make this ostrich

430
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,581
into a sophisticated women?"

431
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:21,624
Dude, you got me.

432
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:22,916
We're on the page, right?

433
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,511
I was thinking I want
to do it Vegas showgirl,

434
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,614
so it's like really high fashion.

435
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,817
Jo: The direction that we did
decide to go in was high fashion.

436
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,219
It's something I don't
do normally... ever.

437
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,421
I want a lot of volume.

438
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:41,185
The first thing that comes to my mind
is leaving parts of human.

439
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,361
A hybrid.

440
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,270
Human hybrid.

441
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,105
Human elephant man.

442
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:45,939
Elephant man.

443
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,367
Let's do it.

444
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,303
Tom: Working with Conor
is an interesting predicament

445
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,655
because we're both alpha males.

446
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,156
Right there.

447
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,701
We're just not on
the same page with this.

448
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,912
That's what I would do.

449
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,046
I'm not trying to call the shots.

450
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,114
No, no, no, no.

451
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,315
I'm going to put
my own flavor on it,

452
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,166
but I'll stay within that size.

453
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,293
Tell you what.
Use your discretion.

454
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,120
Anthony: Two and a half hours in,

455
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,521
I look over at the other ostrich,

456
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,990
they got a full-blown beak
going up off the cast.

457
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,301
I'm like, "Holy [bleep],
that looks like a duck."

458
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,220
You're doing a skeleton.
It's not a skeleton.

459
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,497
But, I mean, do what you will.

460
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,599
First day in working with Jessica,

461
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,767
I already know
this is going downhill.

462
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,269
Let me go and try and find Sculpey.

463
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,672
Conor: Tom's idea was to make
something that looked like

464
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,073
it was maybe created in a lab.

465
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,709
Tom: I noticed theirs' from
across the way now

466
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,245
and they're doing
a very, very, very similar take

467
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,313
on what we're doing.

468
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,747
Once we started getting into it,

469
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,516
we realized our competition

470
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,019
were doing almost exactly
what we were planning.

471
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,688
- Gotcha.
- What's up, Conor?

472
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,749
You guys are doing the same thing
we were going to do.

473
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,794
We're already technically
behind everybody.

474
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,594
Yeah.

475
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,258
We were going to have
to start from scratch.

476
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,405
Sergio: What's up, Conor?

477
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,640
You guys are doing the same thing
we were going to do.

478
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,683
Oh.

479
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,688
Conor: Gage and Sergio were doing
almost exactly what we were planning.

480
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,948
So we decided to switch gears

481
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,717
and go back to my original idea.

482
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:16,088
So change direction
back to genetic mutation?

483
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,615
No, we go back to an evolutionary...

484
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,325
That's what I mean.

485
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,368
Tom: Conor wanted to be the boss.

486
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,828
I deferred to that.

487
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,196
All right.

488
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,430
We have four hours today,

489
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,399
nine hours tomorrow of shop work.

490
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,469
Is we spent our 13 hours
butting heads,

491
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,686
I know that we're not
going to finish our project.

492
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,012
Megan: I started looking
around the room.

493
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,477
I start getting
a little intimidated.

494
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,261
Megan just takes her hands,
grabs the beak,

495
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,930
and rips it right off
the freaking sculpture.

496
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,133
I was like, "Okay, I guess we're
starting over then."

497
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,903
The eyes... If we made
big, big ostrich eyes.

498
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,706
Yeah, and not Donald Duck.

499
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,141
Not Donald Duck.

500
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,002
Sometimes at the last minute
you got to change up the game.

501
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,593
Jo: Why don't we do
the feet out of Sculpey?

502
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,420
I can sculpt feet.

503
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,087
Uh...

504
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,590
um, we only have
a certain amount of time.

505
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,658
Yes.

506
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,592
Let's get done what we can get done.

507
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,693
All right.

508
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,095
All right, that's time, guys.

509
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,862
Let's get out of here.

510
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,433
- Let's go, man.
- Whoo!

511
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Word.

512
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,208
Jo: So, day two,
we get back to the lab.

513
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,476
At this point
we have to really pull it out.

514
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,378
The sculpture
is slowly coming together.

515
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,788
The face is ready to mold.

516
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,986
Marcel: I sculpted the face
as much as I could,

517
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,322
and then in about an hour
I go, "Let's trade."

518
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,192
So she added her touches
while I was sculpting arms.

519
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,127
I'm headed, like, blam!

520
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,763
Put it up.
Power, heat.

521
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,898
I showed Tate how to use
the vacuform machine.

522
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,500
What it is is a big frame

523
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,801
and you put a piece
of plastic in there

524
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,069
and then it has heating elements

525
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,036
that heat that plastic up.

526
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,442
You pull it down
and suction it over a form

527
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,070
to make, in our case,
a plate to mount some antennas.

528
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,680
Sweet, man.

529
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,215
Tate: Me and Frank are jamming.

530
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,850
I love the guy.

531
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,084
He's talented, he's quick,
he knows his [bleep],

532
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,319
and I think that the judges

533
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,829
will honestly get a kick
out of what we do.

534
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,998
That's it.

535
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,878
Making molds takes a long time.

536
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,629
On a stone you can replicate

537
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,047
whatever kind of detail
you want with clay.

538
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,967
The place where the clay is

539
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,969
will eventually become foam latex,

540
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,637
which is what the actor will wear.

541
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,873
Some of these materials,
waiting for them to set up

542
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,874
can take awhile.

543
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,913
- How's it going, Frank?
- Just great.

544
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,783
I'm definitely noticing
Gage is working his ass off

545
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,419
and Sergio seems to be
at a snail's pace.

546
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,988
How are you and Sergio doing?

547
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,758
Well, he's finally molding the face.

548
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,993
Just now?
He just started?

549
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,961
Yeah, but there's still
so much to do.

550
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:15,400
Knowing that I have immunity
is a double-edged sword

551
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,919
because I really want to bring it.

552
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,837
I want Serge to shine

553
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,139
and I really don't want
to hinder him in any way.

554
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,309
I'm not the person
to screw someone over.

555
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,744
The splash coat's drying.

556
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,045
You should get a lot of the detail.

557
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,097
I realize that Serge
like to take his time.

558
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,883
I pulled super double duty.

559
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,518
I was trying to keep Serge on task,

560
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,835
trying to keep him sculpting,
but at a quicker pace.

561
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,059
- That would be cool.
- Yeah.

562
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,637
Marcel: Sam and I have
our sculpture done.

563
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,289
We have everything we need set up

564
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,623
and we feel really comfortable
with what we've done.

565
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,814
Frank: When I look around
at everybody else's work,

566
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,083
I have no doubt in my mind
that Tate and I

567
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,153
are going to be one of the top teams
in this challenge...

568
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,305
- Oh, that's so good.
- Right?

569
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,591
... if not the winner.

570
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,560
And then we saw Conor's sculpture
and it was beautiful,

571
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:16,603
so we knew we had some competition.

572
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,939
Yours looks good.

573
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,151
Jessica: They're perfect.

574
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,036
That's the exact color
I want to use.

575
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,338
Jo: I don't want to be
on the chopping block

576
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,906
because I go with
someone else's idea.

577
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,507
I need to be more assertive,

578
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,509
but instead of stressing her out

579
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,378
over trying to change something,

580
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,879
we're going to continue
on what we're doing

581
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,646
and hope for the best.

582
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,286
Gage: I look at the foot
and it's set rock hard.

583
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,380
It's supposed to be soft
and it's set like stone.

584
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,790
We didn't get the mix right.

585
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,359
I know right away
that we can't use it.

586
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,026
We have to scrap the foot.

587
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,863
Sergio: I'm very nervous

588
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,181
about presenting
our creation to the judges.

589
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,891
Since Gage has immunity,

590
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,369
if our makeup doesn't succeed,

591
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,730
I'm the one on the chopping block.

592
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:01,690
<i>McKenzie: Coming up...</i>

593
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:02,941
Gage: Our models walk in.

594
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,577
There was just no time.
I'm freaking out.

595
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,244
Nobody wants to be
the first one to go.

596
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,182
Really well done.

597
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:13,577
Please make me understand
whose idea this was.

598
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,860
Sergio: It's the morning
of Elimination

599
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,728
and we're very behind.

600
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,430
I'm not happy with these edges.

601
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,499
This is going to be
hard to blend out.

602
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:28,833
Sergio: We've hit some snags.

603
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,702
The leg piece that
we were working on

604
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,103
didn't set up right.

605
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,171
I think it's going to be horrible

606
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,606
because we really needed that

607
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,173
to balance the whole thing out.

608
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:39,811
Gage: Our models walk in

609
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,546
to start our application process.

610
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,114
Sergio.
Nice to meet you.

611
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,917
I was really hoping
to be much further along.

612
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,184
Are you excited?

613
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,623
Tate: Just stand right here.

614
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,617
I want to see how well
these fit you.

615
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:54,859
The bug arms are done.

616
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,127
Just push...

617
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,096
I slide them on her.
They fit perfect.

618
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,565
Frank, check it out.
We've got articulation.

619
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,300
- Oh, excellent.
- Nice.

620
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,469
Do me a favor.
Just lift your neck for a second.

621
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,837
Anthony: We took
the foam latex prosthetic,

622
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,305
fit it on her.

623
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:08,873
It fit beautifully.
The neck looked fantastic.

624
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,810
Great, now your character

625
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,764
is supposed to be a poet
in the 18th century in London.

626
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,248
Okay.

627
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,983
And you write your own tales
about yourself

628
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,819
and that's where
fairy tales come from.

629
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:22,287
There were a couple times
I'm looking at Megan

630
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,055
and I'm just not getting
what she was digging.

631
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,391
Your hands are together like this

632
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,093
and it looks like mittens.

633
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,595
And you walk like you're
a sophisticated woman,

634
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,831
but you are
an ostrich as well, so...

635
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,501
She starts doing the thing

636
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,669
with the prance and stuff like that.

637
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:38,903
I'm thinking maybe she did runway.

638
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,608
Then when you stop,
open up your arms.

639
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,276
There you go.
Wonderful.

640
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,412
Then what I'm going to do
is give you a pen

641
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,548
and then you just take that pen out
and get the book out.

642
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,184
You sign.
There you go. That's it.

643
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,456
First one to put the mask on.

644
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,632
- Put the horns up.
- Yeah.

645
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,867
When you have a bald cap on there,

646
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:09,901
you want it to be tight.

647
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,968
You can go ahead and let go.

648
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,071
[sighs]

649
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,608
Well, I end up pulling it too tight.

650
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,979
So we got a problem, Jessica.

651
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,480
I got a rip in my bald cap.

652
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,083
- Real bad?
- Pretty bad.

653
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,084
Jessica: That really bothers me.

654
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,084
I should have done it.

655
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,056
That's a half hour, guys.
You got 30 minutes to do this.

656
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,929
Do you guys have the super glue?

657
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,664
Thank you.

658
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,932
Cut the strap, cut the strap.

659
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,749
No, no, no.
We got it.

660
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,805
I think we should spend
the rest of this packing.

661
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,840
All right.

662
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,401
Found it.
It was all the way in the back.

663
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,778
And that's time!

664
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,113
Jessica: We pack up our kits

665
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,949
and we head over
to the stage for Last Looks.

666
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,123
We have one more hour
to do touch-ups.

667
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,458
Oops, she has a bald spot.

668
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,027
Yeah, I'm re-darting.

669
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,795
Jo: I am stressing.

670
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,631
Jessica is on my case
about this hole in the bald cap.

671
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,967
I'm trying to figure out
anything I can do to fix it.

672
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,036
It's going to be messy,
so we'll see how it goes.

673
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,537
Megan: You got the clips?

674
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:20,905
Hey, everybody, I think we found

675
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,074
our new challenger over here.

676
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,243
Megan and Anthony's
is looking really great.

677
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,980
And Sergio and Gage's
is looking worse and worse.

678
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,748
Nobody wants to be
the first one to go.

679
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,250
There's still a lot of places
to prove yourself.

680
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,986
I'm going to blow
into your fake eyeball.

681
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,254
Gage: There was just no time

682
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,555
and he still doesn't have hair def.

683
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:38,857
I'm freaking out.

684
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:39,824
You know what else
we could do real quick?

685
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,226
We can use the bandanna.

686
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,560
It's not looking
very good for us now.

687
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,261
Hey, guys, we got 15 minutes left.

688
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,333
[muttering]

689
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,101
Don't worry.
Let's get the arms on

690
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,753
and then you won't feel anything.

691
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,104
Tom: As I'm painting these hands

692
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,373
and trying to put my spin on things,

693
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,675
my own partner is kind of covering up
what I'm doing

694
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,110
as I'm doing it.

695
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,879
Conor: Try something other
than a paintbrush.

696
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,214
So now we're down
to six minutes and he's putting dirt

697
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,550
over everything
I keep cleaning off and painting.

698
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:06,951
Tom: I don't want too much dust

699
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,053
because I'm afraid it looks
like we're covering

700
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,889
everything I'm doing with dust.

701
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,725
I need to show what
I'm doing here as well.

702
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,560
And he's like, "Elephants are dirty.
What do you expect?"

703
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,196
And I'm like, "Well, your face
isn't covered with dirt."

704
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,531
Is there anything else?

705
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,965
We're just panicked.

706
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,166
We're like, "What if
they don't like it?

707
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,968
What if they see
something we don't?"

708
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,237
It is one nightmare after another.

709
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,274
I've got to say, I've never made
a costume like this before.

710
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,808
I know the hair thing
doesn't make sense right now,

711
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,110
but it will.

712
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,462
Brushes down...
our makeup looks like crap.

713
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,130
Welcome to the "Face Off"
reveal stage.

714
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,771
Tonight, one of you will be
eliminated.

715
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,808
Our judges, owner of Optic Nerve
makeup effects studio,

716
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,343
- Glenn Hetrick.
- Hey, guys.

717
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,113
Three-time Oscar-winning
makeup artist Ve Neill.

718
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,448
- Hi.
- Hi, Ve.

719
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,950
Gage: Talk about pressure.

720
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,818
I'm very familiar with Ve's work.

721
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,378
I have Beetlejuice,
a character that she helped create,

722
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,322
tattooed on my arm.

723
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:21,225
And creature designer
and director Patrick Tatopoulus.

724
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,595
- Hello, guys.
- Hey, Patrick.

725
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,597
Tate: Patrick is
one of the most talented in Hollywood

726
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,665
because he kind of
transcends that barrier

727
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,534
of effects artist
and production design.

728
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,369
Your Spotlight Challenge this week

729
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,738
was to create a human-animal hybrid

730
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,240
and we cannot wait to see
what you have created.

731
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,567
Let's get started.

732
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,892
Sergio: We had
an unfinished product.

733
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,328
There was no leg
to balance out the design.

734
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:58,830
I don't want to be sent home

735
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,092
on something that's not truly mine.

736
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,347
Sam: It's great
to see the piece done,

737
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,282
but I'm feeling
a little bit nervous.

738
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,584
I have no idea what to expect.

739
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:28,960
Anthony: Joy comes out
and opened her arms

740
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,537
just like Megan wanted her to.

741
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,807
I look over at Ve Neill,

742
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,308
and she's nothing but smiles.

743
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,654
Jo: My nerves were so on edge.

744
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,990
I felt like vomiting
all over the stage.

745
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,107
At this point I'm thinking
I'm going to go home.

746
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,772
Frank: I'm really confident in
how our creature turned out.

747
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,007
I'm not really nervous at all.

748
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,342
So it's just up to the judges.

749
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,723
Conor: I'm pretty critical
about my own work,

750
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,591
but I'm feeling pretty good.

751
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,126
I think we did the best we could

752
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,293
and I think we really
got a shot at winning this.

753
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,037
Judges, if you would like
to take a closer look.

754
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,341
Jo: So, of course.

755
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,494
Why would I think that they would look
at this thing from afar?

756
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,412
They got to come up close.

757
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,414
We have edges, intricate paint

758
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,182
that they're going to
have to look out.

759
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,849
And they are going to rip me
to shreds in front of America.

760
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:08,960
Judges, if you would like
to take a closer look.

761
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:12,163
Jo: Of course, why would I think that
they would look at this thing from afar?

762
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,080
They gotta come up close.

763
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,701
Can you turn?

764
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,776
Ve: I didn't realize he had
something on his hands'til just now.

765
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,711
Marcel: They went
into extreme detail,

766
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,379
Ve was running her hands on seams.

767
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,914
And we're all, oh, wow,

768
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,048
they're not joking.

769
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,450
Could you open your mouth a bit?

770
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,690
Jessica: I'm, like, please
don't turn around,

771
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,358
'cause you could see the bald cap.

772
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,962
Can you just turn
your face to the side?

773
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,097
Jessica: Ah, don't look at that.

774
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,266
Look somewhere else.

775
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,866
Hmm. Yeah.

776
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,536
Move your hand.

777
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,742
Ve: Let's see your hands.

778
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,245
Conor: The judges got to see
how well the prosthetic moved,

779
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,981
how well the wrinkling
actually helped sell the movement.

780
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,748
There's things we're just not
gonna be able to get away with.

781
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,571
Well, the judges have
scored your creations,

782
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,995
Megan and Anthony,

783
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,062
Sam, Marcel,

784
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:22,833
you're both safe.

785
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,037
Would you please
head back to the makeup room.

786
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:42,053
The rest of you
were the best and the worst.

787
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,621
Now, the judges would
like to take a moment

788
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,891
to speak to each one of you
about your work.

789
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,426
Frank and Tate,
would you please step up.

790
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,448
You two seem pretty proud
of yourselves.

791
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,906
You should be.

792
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,207
Really like this a lot.

793
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:04,809
And it looks like a lot of work

794
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,078
in the time that you had to do it.

795
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,113
My one complaint with this is that

796
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,917
the construction
looks a little Darth Vader-y.

797
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,685
Other than that,
I think it's really cool.

798
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,188
And it looks like you used
a bunch of different materials

799
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,423
and stuck to an idea, so well done.

800
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,859
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

801
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,661
It came out really great
and I like the way that

802
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,429
everything is all tied in.

803
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,165
I'm kind of there with Glenn
about the Darth Vader helmet,

804
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,800
but very nicely done, guys.

805
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,069
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

806
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,337
I like your background.

807
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:34,805
The background tells
me you worked in

808
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,174
the direction of
a '50s looking movie,

809
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,785
and when I got truly close to it

810
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,112
I forgot the person behind the mask

811
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,947
and to me, that's the
most important thing.

812
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,548
So I'm a big fan.
Good job.

813
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,316
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

814
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,321
Gage and Sergio, would you please
take center stage.

815
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,529
Where were your
responsibilities here?

816
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,232
I mean, who was
responsible for what?

817
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,069
I did the sculpture
on the face and the little tusk.

818
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,138
I took on the liberty of
sculpting the arm.

819
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,240
The arm basically was designed to be

820
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,375
like it was forming
an elephant trunk.

821
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,044
We wanted to take
the trunk off the face

822
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,545
and bring it down somewhere else.

823
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,114
Except for the actual tusk,

824
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,982
I don't recognize an elephant.

825
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,583
On the conceptual idea, it's great,

826
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,952
you just didn't
exercise it at the end,

827
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,187
and that's a bummer.

828
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,489
Do both of you remember me mention
the difference

829
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,225
between asymmetry and
something being lopsided?

830
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:29,760
- Yeah.
- Not only did you do it to the face

831
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,029
- But you put the arm
on the same side. Why? - Right.

832
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,066
I thought with the leg,
it would balance him out a little more,

833
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,300
'cause the leg would
have flared out.

834
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,935
And the leg went wrong because...

835
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,971
We ran polyfoam inside of the leg

836
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,272
and is solidified really hard

837
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,773
because it wasn't mixed right.

838
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,476
Guys, it's atrocious.

839
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,244
The hair work is hideous,

840
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,779
the paint job's terrible,

841
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,382
The arm is, I don't even know
what the heck it is.

842
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,518
I can't find anything good
to say about any part of this makeup.

843
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,354
I didn't go with my gut feelings,

844
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,289
and so I think that
I could definitely

845
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:02,259
hone that and be more
specific to my strong skills.

846
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,161
You should have
implemented that on this makeup

847
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,247
because you knew
going in that he had immunity.

848
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,124
We can't do anything to him.

849
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,999
But we can certainly
do something to you.

850
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,743
Conor, Tom, please
come to the center.

851
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,982
So, guys, I like this.

852
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,350
Thank you.

853
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,853
When I got close
to the makeup, I realized that

854
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,555
this is a pretty thick
animal form on the face.

855
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,090
When I asked him to move his neck,

856
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,859
I was very impressed
the way those all

857
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,154
worked together very well with the
expression of the actor.

858
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,297
And I think that's a big deal.
So good job.

859
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,033
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

860
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,902
I agree. How did you break down the
responsibilities here?

861
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,272
I sculpted the face,
but Tom sculpted the ears,

862
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:52,376
blocked out the nose, finished out
the hands, gave me the trunk.

863
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,412
Every step of this
was a collaboration.

864
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,713
Glenn: Very cool.

865
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,882
You really took
the actual elephant being

866
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,550
and put it on his hands

867
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,852
and I think that's very cool.
Congratulations.

868
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,119
- Thank you very much
- Thanks.

869
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,124
Jessica and Jo, please come forward.

870
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,733
What the duck happened here?

871
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:21,338
Please make me understand
who's idea this was.

872
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,782
We collaborated, I think.

873
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,786
We wanted to be more
like Vegas showgirl meets an ostrich.

874
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:31,615
There's lots of things that I dislike
gravely about this makeup,

875
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,485
but the bald cap thing
on the back...

876
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,788
That was my doing.
It was already glued onto the front.

877
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:41,175
I pulled on the back
and I got a huge tear in the side.

878
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:43,427
When you guys have
huge problems like that,

879
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,763
stop what you're doing
and take 5 minutes to

880
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,849
problem solve that together.

881
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,635
Silly, silly mistake, 'cause one
of you is possibly gonna hang for it.

882
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,907
I don't know what you guys were
thinking when you did this

883
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,044
but you can never put this on film.
Even for a kids' show.

884
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,979
Well, you would have been
better off taking a swim cap

885
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,948
and gluing feathers on it
as far as I'm concerned.

886
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,918
I wish you had a design
before you started.

887
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,221
It takes some time,
a half an hour, an hour,

888
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,555
but you have a good sense of
where you're going.

889
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,257
And challenge yourself
on the design.

890
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,726
The design is not there,
this is never gonna go anywhere.

891
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,662
Jessica, why do you think you should
stay in the competition?

892
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,598
I think I put a lot of work
into the sculpture.

893
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,533
The painting and
the skirt, you know,

894
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,568
I think I have a lot to offer.

895
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,937
I would rather hear that
you understand what your mistake was.

896
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,906
For you to battle
and defend this piece

897
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:30,933
is a little more
challenging, I think.

898
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,811
And Jo?

899
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,346
I've a lot of ambition for this.

900
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,215
I have a lot to offer
just learning now that

901
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,351
you have to have and idea,
you have to stick with it,

902
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:42,695
and you have to go
and that's something that I can do.

903
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,889
Do you realize now
that you made a mistake?

904
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,893
I want to shoot myself in the face
in front of all of you right now.

905
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,060
Okay.

906
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,902
All right, judges, who is
the winner of this challenge?

907
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,837
The two top teams

908
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,240
were Frank and Tate,

909
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:06,443
and Conor and Tom.

910
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,879
The top team is

911
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,915
Conor and Tom.

912
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,267
But there can only be one winner.

913
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,145
And that person is...

914
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,054
Conor.

915
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,927
Glenn, why did you pick
Conor to be the winner?

916
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,862
We felt out of that top team

917
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,665
Conor's sculpting really
helped to pull that makeup along.

918
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:28,732
Thank you.

919
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,534
And I was really surprised.

920
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,411
I actually thought we
were gonna win as a team.

921
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:36,106
In the end, my effort
was the one that stood out.

922
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,375
Conor, there's something
more you should know.

923
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,047
Each week, the winner of
the spotlight challenge

924
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,716
will have a chance to
consult with the judges

925
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,920
as to who they think
should be eliminated.

926
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,256
If the rest of you would please
go wait in the makeup room

927
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,973
until the judges have
made the decision.

928
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,337
Conor, between Jo,
Jessica and Sergio,

929
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,704
who do you think did
the worst job on this challenge?

930
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:16,380
I'm gonna reluctantly
say Jessica because

931
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,948
she made the choice to sculpt

932
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:22,753
an upper and lower beak
above the mouth of the performer

933
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,623
and that was just never gonna work.

934
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,824
That's a good point.

935
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,292
Thank you, Conor.

936
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,828
You can head back
to the makeup room.

937
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,529
All right, judges.

938
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,890
It's time to begin your deliberation
on who should be eliminated.

939
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,433
Let's start with Sergio.
What are your thoughts?

940
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,803
He was quite passionate about it

941
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,872
and I really like to hear that.

942
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,741
Ve: And as you said
he does have the passion.

943
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,109
- Yeah.
- And I think he will

944
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,710
make a comeback and
show us something good.

945
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,738
Yeah. I, I disagree.

946
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:52,383
There's many bad things
to come from Sergio, in my opinion.

947
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,160
All right, what are your
thoughts on Jessica?

948
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,919
I need to feel that they're gonna do

949
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,321
something better next time.

950
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,690
And in her, I felt
she was giving up.

951
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,126
She says 'cause, well, I spent
a lot of time sculpting the feet.

952
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,560
Well, you know what?
The feet aren't on somebody's face

953
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,462
but that goofy bill was.

954
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,631
So she should have completed that

955
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,167
and at least made an
attempt to make it a complete face.

956
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,305
It's a close one.
I mean, I think if Jo sat back

957
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,640
and let it happen,
it's just as much her fault.

958
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,909
- I agree.
- The only thing you can look at to say

959
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,377
which one seems to want to fight

960
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,413
and get to the next level?

961
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,522
McKenzie: All right, judges.

962
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,115
Have you come to a decision?

963
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,482
- I think so.
- I think so, yeah.

964
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,966
So, judges, who's
going home tonight?

965
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,718
So, judges, who's
going home tonight?

966
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,358
Glenn: Gage, you have
immunity this week.

967
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,027
You better make the most
of your second chance.

968
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,095
- Head back to the makeup room.
- Thank you.

969
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,806
Serge. So far, we've seen
two looks from you.

970
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,274
I'm not impressed, and I don't think

971
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,442
the other judges are either.

972
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,048
Jessica, your decision-making skills

973
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,008
have been severely lacking.

974
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,655
And Jo, if you have better skills,

975
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:41,572
I don't feel like you're
showing them to us.

976
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,131
The person going home tonight is...

977
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,906
it's Jessica.

978
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,077
Well, thank you for the opportunity.

979
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,478
I know tonight I didn't meet up
to your standards.

980
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,817
Jessica, please head
back to the makeup room

981
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,551
- And pack up your kit.
- Thank you.

982
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,956
Jessica: I don't think I should
be going home tonight.

983
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,757
I should have
defended myself harder.

984
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,863
Runs in the family.

985
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,598
Everybody, come on.

986
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:25,302
I wish I could have given the world
a better chance to see my talent.

987
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:28,305
But I know in my heart that I'm good
and I'm gonna be out here making movies.

988
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:29,907
You know, I can do it.
I'm not afraid.

989
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:31,824
I'll be out here someday.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
