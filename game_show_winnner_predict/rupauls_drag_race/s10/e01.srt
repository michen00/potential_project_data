00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,182
and I'm the best one
out of all of them.

188
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,684
[laughs]

189
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,919
- I am gagging!

190
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,919
- Why?

191
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,255
Ms. Mayhem Miller.

192
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,255
Finally, girl!

193
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,057
Finally. I know, huh?

194
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,092
I auditioned year
after year after year,

195
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,860
and it took me forever

196
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,860
to get here.

197
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,796
I'm here.

198
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,796
I ain't going nowhere.

199
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,830
I need a bitch to fucking
move out the way

200
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,099
so I can get my money.

201
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,968
What is drag like
in California?

202
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,102
Like this.

203
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,503
No, just kidding.
It's not that good.

204
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,872
[all laugh]

205
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,009
Ooh.

206
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,445
Hope you're ready for your
all-carb, high-calorie diet.

207
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,714
Yes, ass.

208
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,148
I'm Kalorie Karbdashian

209
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,148
Williams,

210
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,851
and I am sass, class,
and a whole lot of ass.

211
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,119
[chuckles]

212
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,520
Oh, yeah!

213
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,055
[cheering]

214
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,992
Kalorie is pretty much
the twerk queen.

215
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:36,663
She can shake her ass

216
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:36,663
like full-on like booty shaking.

217
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,064
So where are you from?

218
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,833
I'm from Albuquerque,

219
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,833
New Mexico.

220
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,101
- Oh, New Mexico.

221
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,101
- New Mexico!

222
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,669
Yes, New Mexico.

223
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,669
[laughs]

224
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,105
So what's the drag

225
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:45,105
in New Mexico?

226
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,940
What drag?

227
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,041
[all laugh]

228
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,043
Cat-kitty-cat-cat-cat.

229
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,012
Cat-kitty-cat-cat-cow.

230
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,447
Bringing you the heart
of Season 10, honey.

231
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,783
Monique Heart, the Face.

232
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,019
Well, there's gonna be flavor

233
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,019

234
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,487
[all laugh]

235
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,588
My name is Monique Heart.

236
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,189
She's the Razzle Dazzle Queen.

237
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,991
A little sprinkle over here,
a little glitter over there.

238
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,926
Honey, yeah!

239
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,929
She gonna give you

240
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,929
the ooh-ah-ah sensation, honey.

241
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:14,034
[cheering]

242
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,469
Oh, yeah!
[laughs]

243
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,704
Oh, my God. Come on!

244
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,005
Girl, she's fabulous!

245
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,608
First of all, I can tell
you are a dancing queen.

246
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,044
Dance queen, hair queen,

247
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,044
hairography.

248
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,478
All of that good jazz.

249
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,880
You give me a category,

250
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,880
watch me play.

251
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,515
All right!

252
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,549
Well, she's gonna gag you,

253
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,549
honey.

254
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,118
She is "I'm a production!"

255
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,987
- Hi, I'm Blair.
- Blair, Monique.

256
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,588
- Hi, and then...
- Cracker.

257
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,090
[all laugh]

258
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,925
Look at her face!

259
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,328
- I did the same thing.

260
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,328
- Okay.

261
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,930
Honey, these southern queens,
they're like, Cracker?

262
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,165
They are not feeling
that shit, girl.

263
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,068
Miz Cracker loves that name
because it causes a stir.

264
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:51,538
Every time she says Cracker,
I'm like, girl?

265
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,672
Girl, yes.

266
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,078
Never loved ya.

267
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,446
Aah!

268
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,981
My name is Dusty Ray Bottoms.

269
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,584
I'm from the best city on earth,

270
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,584
New York City.

271
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:09,689
Dusty Ray Bottoms is dark,

272
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:09,689
glamorous and trashy.

273
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,990
She's also dyslexic.

274
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,693
[cheering]

275
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,128
Hi, girls!

276
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,098
- Come on, le queen.

277
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,098
- Aah!

278
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,199
Well, you guys

279
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,199
all know each other.

280
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,667
We all know each other.

281
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,670
Girl, there's like 100

282
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,670
people here from New York City.

283
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,105
New York City's drag scene

284
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,941
is some of the most

285
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,941
competitive drag there is.

286
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,142
What kind of drag do you do?

287
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,510
- I'm like a punk girl.

288
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,510
- Really?

289
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,946
I do a lot of rock queen,

290
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,946
Janis Joplin,

291
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,981
but I also do obscure
musical theater.

292
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,116
- Girl, I'm a drama queen, too.
- Yes.

293
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,684
- Come on, Broadway queen.

294
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,684
- Best friends.

295
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,822
Oh! Harpo, who this woman?

296
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,558
I'm just here to fight!

297
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,227
- Ooh!
- Uh-oh.

298
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,563
Ooh, she mad, y'all.

299
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,600
The Vixen is magical,

300
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,600
exciting and unpredictable.

301
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,535
[contestant]
I bet she's a Taurus.

302
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,172
When I'm onstage, I'm

303
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,172
giving you earth, wind and fire.

304
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,874
Hey!

305
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,874
[cheering]

306
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,276
[Eureka]

307
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,276
What kind of drag do you do?

308
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,978
Mostly political art,

309
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:08,782
a lot of protest performances,
such as that.

310
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:12,152
I definitely am very influential
in the Chicago drag scene.

311
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:15,355
I'm very vocal and sometimes
that rubs people the wrong way,

312
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,990
but I keep it real.

313
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,992
Y'all know Chicago

314
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,992
is full of it.

315
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,294
You know, we got some of

316
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,294
the best queens in the country,

317
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,829
so I'm gonna represent.

318
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,039
Tens, tens,

319
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,039
tens across the board!

320
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,010
I'm Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.
Gitchie's cookin', baby.

321
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,547
Vanessa's known

322
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,547
for dottin' and boppin'.

323
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,715
Hi-ee!

324
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,350
Like a hooker
on Rodeo Drive.

325
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,721
So she's kind of ghetto,

326
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,721
but still, you know, eloquent.

327
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,089
You have a big
like drag family?

328
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,092
Yes, guys! I'm like
a Mateo drag daughter.

329
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,095
Oh, a Mateo.

330
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,163
I don't remember her.

331
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,732
[all laugh]

332
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,267
Did she just shade her mama?

333
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,903
Oh, oh, she did!
Oh, she just shade.

334
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,772
- From across the table.

335
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,772
- Shady palm tree.

336
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,841
[all laugh]

337
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,244
Alexis Mateo is <i>Drag Race
</i>royalty from Season 3.

338
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,214
Now I'm gonna finish
what she started. Bam!

339
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,415
What type of drag do you do?

340
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,883
Vanjie, Vanjie.

341
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,018
I've done pageants,

342
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,018
but it's not like mine.

343
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,386
Have you won pageants?

344
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,090
[Monét]

345
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,090
These girls are so shady.

346
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,124
Have you won, though?

347
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,793
So does that mean

348
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,793
I'm a pageant queen, then?

349
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,894
Have you won one?

350
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,396
I've won all of them

351
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,396
I competed in.

352
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,166
But didn't you also say
like there's no drag there?

353
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:37,103
[all laugh]

354
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,139
<i>Bonjour!</i>

355
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,276
[cheering]

356
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,145
My name's Aquaria,
and I am a superstar.

357
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,647
Sorry to keep you waiting.

358
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,182
Five New York girls!

359
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,950
Aquaria is the name
on everyone's lips

360
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,151
in New York City.

361
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,520
I've been told

362
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,520
that every girl in the room

363
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,388
knows exactly who this bitch is.

364
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,689
Oh, my God!

365
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,025
And, uh, they should.

366
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:03,062
Aquaria, Aquaria, Aquaria!

367
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,031
Cracker, your twin is here.

368
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,933
It's battle

369
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,933
between the twins, y'all.

370
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,201
Who? Who's the twins?

371
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,069

555
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,645
Kalorie Karbdashian, oh, oh.

556
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:29,015
I see the fishnets.
They're ripped.

557
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,985
[RuPaul] Monique Heart!

558
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,187
No shade,

559
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,187
no T from these girls.

560
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,022
They're living for me,

561
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,857
because they're going,

562
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,857
get it, girl!

563
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,425
Twirl, sidewalk, sidewalk.

564
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,160
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah,

565
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,160
ooh, ah-ah.

566
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,996
Yes, honey,

567
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,996
shake those golden girls.

568
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,332
Monique

569
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,332
is a great entertainer.

570
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:50,169
I thought the silhouette of the
outfit looked super gorgeous,

571
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,904
and it looked like
there was a hem everywhere.

572
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,239
I'm impressed.

573
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,876
[RuPaul] The Vixen!

574
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,280
Correct me if I'm wrong,

575
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,716
but I think she might be

576
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,716
from Chicago.

577
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:07,253
When I'm onstage,
I am going to move the real.

578
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,157
My skirt is coming apart,

579
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:11,157
but I don't care.

580
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,260
As long as they know
that I came to party.

581
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,663
This is <i>RuPaul's Drag Race,
</i>Season 10, girl.

[RuPaul] Dusty Ray Bottoms!

584
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,869
But that ain't

585
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,869
none of my business!

586
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,638
I'm killing this challenge.

587
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:29,275
I'm not giving you death drops,

588
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:29,275
splits, dance moves.

589
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,177
I'm giving you something

590
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,177
you didn't expect.

591
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:34,180
These frowns

592
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:34,180
are turning upside down.

593
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,049
Except for Tempest.

594
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,049
She doesn't smile too much.

595
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,785
Could someone please
wake me up when Dusty's gone?

596
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,089
Oh, yes, honey,
she's Scary Bradshaw.

597
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,093
Yuhua Hamasaki.

598
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:47,093
You a ho.

599
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:50,162
It's a U-Ho. That's the girl
that works for the company

600
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,365
that moves people
from houses, no?

601
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,733
When people see me
for the first time,

602
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,035
they're like who is this
glamorous man in a dress?

603
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,003
But I'm actually
a very silly person.

604
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,839
I'm not scared

605
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:59,839
to act like a frikkin' fool.

606
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,375
Yuhua Hamasaki is giving me

607
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,375
Asian Bianca del Rio,

608
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,410
and I'm rooting
for my Asian sister.

609
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,747
Yuhua better work!

610
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:10,483
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo!

611
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,952
[Vanessa]

612
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,952
From the House of Mateo!

613
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,754
I see these girls
and I was excited.

614
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:15,955
Because I said, oh,
I'm about to show the movement

615
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,123
that the Vanjie is.

616
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,657
Ooh, yes.

617
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,961
Vanjie was because I wanted
to be called Vanjie like ghetto.

618
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,863
But Alexis couldn't even

619
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,863
pronounce Vanjie.

620
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,998
She said it wouldn't be Vanjie

621
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,998
because of our accent.

622
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,867
So we took the Vanjie and Mateo,

623
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,036
because I'm part
of the Mateo Empire.

[RuPaul] Kameron Michaels!

627
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:35,941
Ms. Kameron Michaels,

628
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,110
I love some freshly got

629
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,110
fuck in there,

630
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,546
and she knew how to toss it.

631
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,148
I say, bitch,

632
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,148
she's coming from a gig.

633
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,550
[Kameron] Some of the queens
are giving me judgy looks,

634
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,452
and some are living for me

00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,021
and saying, yes, girl, twirl!
Flip that hair!

636
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,224
So I'm getting

637
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,224
mixed reactions, I think.

Monét X Change, she looks

641
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,268
like a million bucks.

642
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:05,171
Her body looks great.
She's giving you high energy.

643
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,205
She is earning it!

644
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,042

I thinks she's super original.

I've been following her
since she was like 14.

666

and is clapping 'cause
you just slapped Jinkx.

00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,999
I didn't mind being slapped
across the face.

All right, y'all.
Time for us to get outta drag.

687
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,389

Dang, we all skin.

We all don't look alike.

Asia. Asia.

by the black people
getting out of drag.

712
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,163
She done went down the whole

00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,163
line of chocolate girls.

714
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,097
Yes.

00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,566
Ladies, I have to say

716
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,901
I was really, really, really
trying to stop the booger,

00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,003
but everyone looks
fucking fierce.

718

Y'all are cute.

where that trail go.

732
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,499
What is all that?

733
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:49,802
Why nobody say there was
actual trade up in here?

734
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,338
She's smuggling ham

735
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,338

And I mean rough trade,

738
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,142
the kind of trade that'll

739
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,142
throw you on the wall

740
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,011
and you be like,

741
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,011
oh, I think I'm into it.

742
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,146
Yeah, but for sure, he's it.

743
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:05,050
Hey, kitty girls!

744
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,686
[cheers and applause]

745
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,089
Whoo, butch queens.

746
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,323
First time out of drag.

747
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,492
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

748
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,997
Ladies, now, on the runway,
y'all snatched our attention.

749
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,433
But one of you

750
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:21,433
scored a perfect 10.

751
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,072
Monét X Change,
you're the winner

752
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,175
of this season's
first mini challenge.

753
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:35,247
You've won a $2,000 gift card

754
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:35,247
from Fierce Queen Heels.

755
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,782
[applause]

756
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,119
Yes, bitch! I won the first
mini challenge of Season 10!

757
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,220
I'm here to let these girls know

758
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,655
don't fuck
with New York City.

759
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,556
Yeah, we won last season,
and we gonna win again.

760
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,125
[chuckles]

761
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,595
Now, ladies, to kick off
a new decade of drag,

762
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,097
we're going back to our roots,

763
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,634
as in back

764
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,634
to the very first challenge

765
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,638
from the very first episode
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

766
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:04,009
We call it Drag on a Dime.

767
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,479
[cheering]

768
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,315
Oh, pit crew?

769
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:13,452
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

770
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,487
Oh, yes!

771
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,523
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

772
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,192
Wait a minute! Is that it?

773
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:22,995
There's gotta be more!

774
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,534
Oh, my God!

775
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,406
Now that's what I'm talking
about right there.

776
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:37,576
For this week's maxi challenge,

777
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:40,512
you need to create
million-dollar looks

778
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:45,184
using a bunch of junk
from the 99 Cent Store.

779
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:49,088
Now, you can use your own hair,

780
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:49,088
heels and undergarments,

781
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,457
but everything else
that meets the eye

782
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:54,727
should be bargain-bin beautiful.

783
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,261
I don't do drag on a dime,

784
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:59,131
so this is about to go left,
right, up, down, side to side.

785
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,968
Gentlemen, start your engines,

786
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,704
and may the best woman win.

787
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,476
Our first challenge

788
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,476
is based on

789
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,779
the first challenge
in <i>Drag Race </i>herstory, girl.

790
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,949
We have to make things
from the 99 Cent Store.

791
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,984
It's chaos, madness,

792
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,984
confusion,

793
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,120
and everybody's running
like hell and high water.

794
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,554
Look at all these

795
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,554
Barbie dolls.

796
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,090
I'm grabbing the flowers

797
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,090
and the tulle,

798
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,425
and I'm making me
a princess look.

799
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,760
And I'm gonna make sure

800
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,762
none of these hos
is doing the same look as me.

801
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,531
- What you need?
- That doggie.

802
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,566
I see this little stuffed dog,

803
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,269
and I immediately got
inspiration from this puppy.

804
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,406
I wanna go very Valley Girl

805
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,406
or Sweet 16,

806
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:43,075
someone that would carry

807
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:43,075
a dog in a purse.

808
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,076
Excuse me.

809
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,110
Don't come for my shit, girl.

810
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,278
[Monét] Get outta here.

811
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,880
- Oh, honey, shit.

812
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,880
- Ladies...

813
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,048
You're acting like men.

814
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,683
I'm gonna look like
a charcuterie plate.

815
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,219
Got carrots and celery

816
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,219
and things.

817
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,121
I don't like to spend
a lot of money on drag,

818
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,490
so dollar-store challenge

819
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,490
is right up my alley.

820
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,659
I feel like if I spend $5.00

821
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,659
on a dress

822
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,529
and I make $100 in that dress,

823
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,529
that's a good investment.

824
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,531
All I'm missing
is the hot wings.

825
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,833
What material does she have?

826
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,967
Looking at what I have,

827
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,470
I realize that

828
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,470
it adds up to nothing.

829
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,041
But I'm gonna Cinderella

830
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,041
this pumpkin into a carriage.

831
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,142
- Monique?

832
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,142
- Yes?

833
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,610
[Miz Cracker] Do I have
anything that you want

834
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,479
in exchange for your blue hat?

835
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:24,016
In order to make my look,

836
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:24,016
I beg and barter.

837
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,151
- Here you go.
- Oh, my God, you're amazing.

838
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,053
Look at y'all sharing
and whatnot.

839
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:33,826
I end up with three straw hats
and a shower curtain.

840
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,994
Not even a partridge
in a pear tree.

841
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,997
Do you make

842
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,997
a lot of your outfits?

843
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,500
I really like making things

844
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,168
from the stuff

845
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,168
that I find in the street.

846
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,603
Like in a literal street?

847
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,004
In the actual street.

848
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,874
When we were growing up,
I was really, really poor,

849
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:51,009
so we had to improvise.

850
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,078
My mother is an artist

851
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,615
who learned to make

852
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,615
fabulous things on a dime.

853
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,586
So my mother taught me to comb
the streets for garbage I liked

854
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:04,122
and to make it into something
fascinating by sunset.

855
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,657
There's something
really rewarding

856
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,527
about the challenge
of like looking at something

857
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,462
like on the street,
and being like, okay,

858
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,197
what could this be
in another life?

859
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,466
And I love that.

860
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,335
I think I've reneged
on the Barbie dolls.

861
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,970
If anyone want
the Barbie dolls...

862
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,473
Here, babe,

863
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,473
'cause I don't think

864
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,975
I'm gonna have enough
of the flowers.

865
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,979
[Monét] My first idea is to do
this doll-constructed thing.

866
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,949
But I realized that there aren't
enough to cover my big-ass body.

867
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,384
And I know that I can create

868
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,488
this really like Gaga

869
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,488
couture-esque look with sponges.

870
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,423
I'm either gonna be couture

871
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,423
or cou-torn.

872
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,692
I don't think nobody wants
to look like the cleaning crew.

873
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,928
I came here to get
the <i>Drag Race </i>check,

874
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,097
not the cleaning crew's check.

875
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:48,267
[Monét] Girl, wait.
So what is your plan?

876
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,869
Is this like some

877
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,869
like aluminum foil fantasy?

878
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,938
I have a vision.

879
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:56,208
I'm inspired by this sun shade

880
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,043
to make like

881
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,043
a Judy Jetson dress.

882
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:59,211
Oh, word.

883
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,612
Come on, Judy Jetson.

884
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,914
I'm very crafty.

885
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,982
I can craft

886
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,982
a look the house down.

887
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,252
[contestant] Look.

888
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,252
Somebody's doing something, too.

889
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,021
It look mighty similar!

890
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,322
Ooh!

891
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,590
Well...

892
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,425
Get into those cookies.

893
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,127
Cool.

894
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:16,929
Nuts.

895
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,165
[Yuhua] So I have
these two ideas.

896
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,600
I was thinking of like a leotard

897
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,935
with ping-pong balls

898
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,935
all over it.

899
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:26,204
Or use this

900
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:26,204
and make a dress out of it

901
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,639
and glue the caution tape

902
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,639
all over it.

903
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,142
Which one do you think

904
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,142
is better?

905
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,778
I think I like
the caution tape look better.

906
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,780
If you can find a way to

907
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,780
make it like really like chic.

908
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,115
I am feeling the pressure

909
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,685
because I'm known

910
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,685
for being a seamstress.

911
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:41,853
I've made a lot of costumes
for the girls in New York City,

912
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,922
and I can't go on the runway
looking like a fucking mess.

913
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,324
I can totally hear

914
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,324
a show reading

915
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,659
about Gaga, caution tape.

916
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,659
We've seen it before.

917
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,660
You know what I mean?

918
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,262
- Yeah.

919
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,262
- So should I skip it?

920
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,698
We're just trying

921
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,698
to caution you about it.

922
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,999
People think that Yuhua

923
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,999
is a designer.

924
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,201
No. She's a seamstress.

925
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,070
She can use a sewing machine,

926
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,872
but that a designer
does not make, okay?

927
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,407
I hate this

928
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,407
fucking challenge, girl.

929
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,709
[laughs]

930
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,245
What you doing over here?
How you feel about this?

931
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,481
Now you coming
to my station.

932
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,782
Well, because you got pink too
and pretty stuff,

933
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,883
so I need to get
some like inspiration.

934
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,986
So now you coming to see.

935
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,922
Mama, this is the epitome

936
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,922
of winging it.

937
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:20,959
I'm gonna do a headpiece with
the Barbies and kook 'em out.

938
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,428
I'm gonna take the tulle

939
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,428
and make a little...

940
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,664
Like a little bolero-ey
kind of thing? Okay.

941
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,700
You know, to come out serving
a little bit of crank.

942
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,035
Are you nervous about it?
I'm nervous about mine.

943
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,638
I'm nervous on how these
judges might feel about it.

944
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:34,873
I need to slay and get
these girls to recognize

945
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,643
I ain't trying to be pork chop.

946
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,643
I might be fish fillet.

947
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,547
Ooh, wait a minute, Jesus.

948
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:42,547
Fuck!

949
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,650
It is the end of the day.

950
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,784
We are running out of time.

951
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,353
- [whining]

952
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,353
- Is she burning herself?

953
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,721
Everyone is going crazy

954
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,721
a little bit.

955
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,089
Oh...

956
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,324
No one wants to be

957
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,324
the first girl to go home.

958
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:54,426
[Mayhem] You only get one chance
to make a first impression,

959
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:57,062
and for somebody,
this is going to be

960
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,764
their only chance
to make an impression.

961
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:00,232
Fuck!

962
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,670
[Kalorie] Day two!

963
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,039
Hey, y'all!

964
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,107
[Eureka] It's elimination day.

965
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,009
It's the first runway
of the season.

966
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,212
Stakes are high,
hearts are pounding,

967
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,614
buttholes are clinched.

968
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,716
Whew!

969
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:21,019
How do you feel, girl,
about this outfit?

970
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,087
They wanted

971
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,087
a million-dollar dress,

972
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,789
so I'm giving them
a million-dollar dress.

973
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,058
Oh, it's all money.
Just rich fish.

974
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,559
I went literal. Yeah.

975
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,628
You know, if Kim Kardashian
just had a bunch of extra money

976
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,463
and she just wanted to get
rid of it, she'd make a dress.

977
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,466
Kalorie is very confident

978
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,466
about her look.

979
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,769
She is like,

980
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:37,769
I am the color of $100,000.

981
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,139
Hopefully, they live for it.
I'm living for it.

982
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:46,445
[Aquaria] Whose look do you
think are not--are like--

983
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:50,115
Bottom three,

984
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:50,115
I would say Vixen probably.

985
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,150
It doesn't look finished.

986
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,653
It looks poorly executed.

987
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,354
But she is very crafty.

988
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,190
That's like

989
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,190
her drag style, so...

990
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,226
Listen, there's a difference
between crafty and crunchy.

991
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,260
[all laugh]

992
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,764
Monique, how's this
house of cards?

993
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,535
Oh, bitch.

994
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,004
From head to toe,

995
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,004
I am serving the 99 Cent Store.

996
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,207
I'm gonna do a whole
Queen of Hearts thing.

997
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:19,244
I made hair out of the plastic
No Trespassing signs.

998
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,346
She's looking opulent.

999
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,347
Are you worried

1000
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,347
about going home today?

1001
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,349
Oh, I'm not going home. Trust.

1002
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,352
Look around the room, I really
feel like I'm gonna win this.

1003
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,388
Bitch, if I don't win it,
I'm pushing whoever does.

1004
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,158
So, Eureka, last season

1005
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,726
you ended up falling
and hurting yourself?

1006
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,828
- Oh, my knee?
- Yeah.

1007
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:40,232
It was a lot, you know.
It was hard, of course.

1008
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,733
The surgery was a lot tougher
than I ever imagined.

1009
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,068
- I didn't even--

1010
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,068
- You had to have surgery?

1011
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,569
I had to have surgery, yeah.

1012
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,071
I tore my ACL in my knee

1013
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,071
completely.

1014
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,406
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

1015
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,075
I didn't even know if I

1016
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,075
would be able to dance again.

1017
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,811
Like...

1018
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,811
oh, I'm gonna get emotional.

1019
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,513
How was like the recovery
process for you?

1020
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,914
It was horrible. [sobs]

1021
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,282
Oh, baby.

1022
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,484
It was terrifying.
You know what I mean?

1023
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,953
Even though Ru invited me back,

1024
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,222
once I found out more
information about my injury,

1025
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,590
I thought there was a chance

1026
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,058
I wasn't gonna be able

1027
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,058
to come back.

1028
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,360
The doctor was like,

1029
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,562
oh, it could take

1030
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,562
up to two years to be back.

1031
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:13,765
And I just every day,
I like did my physical therapy

1032
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,066
and stretched my knee and stuff.

1033
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,035
It was like six months in,

1034
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,670
and the premier show

1035
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,670
for this show

1036
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,440
was the first time that

1037
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,440
I danced again since surgery.

1038
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,344
It was just amazing
to dance again.

1039
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,014
It's why I do this, you know.

1040
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,550
- Well, look at you now, girl!
- I know.

1041
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,684
You back!

1042
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,684
You're in Season 10!

1043
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,219
I'm here!

1044
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,219
Sorry. I didn't mean to--

1045
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,388
And you still kicking and

1046
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,388
splitting and twirling, girl.

1047
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,889
This is my second chance,

1048
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,059
and you barely get those

1049
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,059
in life.

1050
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,664
So if I fuck it up,

1051
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,664
it might be my last chance.

1052
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:46,665
How do you feel?

1053
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,166
Of course like I'm nervous.

1054
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,668
The world's been waiting

1055
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,668
on you to be here.

1056
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,169
And that's why I'm like,

1057
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,169
oh, my God.

1058
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,804
I don't wanna let no one down.
Like I'm--

1059
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,905
You won't, though.

1060
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,507
It's tough.

1061
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,507
It's really tough...

1062
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,508
I know. It is tough.

1063
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,576
To have that pressure on you.

1064
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,078
We're all here
with the same goal.

1065
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,013
I definitely feel like

1066
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,013
I have a lot to live up to

1067
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,149
because of the drag family

1068
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,149
I come from.

1069
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,150
I come from the best.

1070
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,185
Let's paint.

1071
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,554
Which one are you doing?

1072
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,723
I think I'm gonna do
like my 1930s one

1073
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,924
if I can find it.

1074
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,226
Cute. That is so smart.

1075
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,027
What made you decide to put them

1076
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,027
all in the scrapbook?

1077
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,763
Because I know that when

1078
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,763
I'm second-guessing everything,

1079
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,433
I just wanna be able
to look at something

1080
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,368
that I know

1081
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,368
that I've done before.

1082
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:27,739
These are makeup ideas,

1083
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:27,739
what I have done in the past.

1084
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,574
So that I remember
who I have been

1085
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,210
when I can't remember
who I'm going to be.

1086
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,044
I don't think there's
gonna be any problem

1087
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,513
with me standing out.

1088
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,916
Dusty, so what look are we
serving the children tonight?

1089
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,619
I might be doing
my signature makeup tonight

1090
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,255
and putting the dots on my face.

1091
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:46,324
It's funny, because

1092
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:46,324
I didn't mean to do it at first.

1093
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,326
I was trying to figure out

1094
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,326
my eyebrows.

1095
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:51,429
Someone told me I could map
them out by making dots,

1096
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,231
and they were like,

1097
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,231
put the first dot here,

1098
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,266
the second dot there.

1099
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,634
So that's what I started doing.

1100
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,769
And I looked at it and

1101
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,769
I was like, that's really cool.

1102
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,804
And I just kept doing
variations of it

1103
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,039
and it stuck

1104
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,039
and it looks good on me,

1105
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,207
so I kept it.

1106
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,276
Cracker's doing those
downturn eyebrows.

1107
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:07,012
Any time we do this look,
it cracks me up.

1108
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:08,546
'Cause you think
I'm really upset.

1109
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,116
And like doing a whole show,

1110
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,116
it cracks.

1111
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,550
So and then you're like...

1112
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,053
- Hmm.

1113
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,053
- [laughs]

1114
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,924
So I feel kind of confident
with my look, but...

1115
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,363
We're both doing like
the same brows now, too?

1116
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,768
- I noticed.
- Girl.

1117
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:35,073
Cracker and Aquaria

1118
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:35,073
are doing the same face.

1119
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,208
[gasps]
I just saw!

1120
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,677
Like not the same,

1121
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,677
but the same.

1122
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,278
Why is she
so obsessed with you?

1123
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,514
I cannot believe
we're doing the same makeup.

1124
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,049
That's the gag.

1125
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,251
Gag to the gag
to the gag, gag, gag.

1126
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,252
Is this like a frequent thing?

1127
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:50,889
[laughs]
It's a common moment.

1128
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,590
Miz Cracker seems to take
a lot of inspiration

1129
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,959
from my makeup looks.

1130
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,795
I think that can be
a little annoying sometimes.

1131
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,263
I am in it to win it,

1132
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,533
and I did not come here
to make friends, bitch.

1133
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,001
Oh, we gonna talk about this!

1134
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,613

She's back, back, back again!
Michelle Visage!

1141
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,203
It's our 10th anniversary,

1142
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,203
darling.

1143
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,438
And they said

1144
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,438
it wouldn't last.

1145
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,674
No, they said that about
your girl group Seduction.

Style superstar
Carson Kressley!

1148
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,180
What's in fashion this season?

1149
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,082
Oh, gosh, Ru. All the kids

1150
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,082
are wearing sponges,

1151
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,717
pool noodles and piñatas.

1152
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,386
I love it.
I'll take one in every color.

1153
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,620
Done!

1154
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,156
And the hilarious

1155
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,156
Ross Mathews.

1156
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,025
A decade of drag.
Can you believe it?

1157
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,193
You know, I've been watching
since kindergarten, Ru.

1158
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,797
- [laughs]

1159
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,797
- Lies. Pathological liar.

1160
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,133
This week,

1161
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,133
we challenged our queens

1162
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:12,837
to make million-dollar looks
out of 99 Cent Store junk

1163
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,140
in the classic challenge,

1164
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,140
Drag on a Dime.

1165
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,143
Gentlemen, start your engines,

1166
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,178
and may the best woman win.

1167
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,653
[RuPaul] Up first, Aquaria.
Larry had a little lamb.

1168
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,655
[Carson] Was that
a staff infection?

1169
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,157
[Aquaria] It's my first time

1170
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,157
on the runway,

1171
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,259
and I am overwhelmed
with confidence.

1172
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,729
My look is very Little Ho Peep
meets New York Fashion Week.

1173
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,031
Call me Mother...Goose.

1174
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,366
[Carso] So sheepish
about everything.

1175
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,401
[RuPaul] Yeah, well, that's
because she's on the lamb.

1176
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:45,103
[all laugh]

1177
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,371
[Michelle] Oh, Mary.

1178
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,106
[RuPaul] Asia O'Hara.

1179
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:51,009
I'm sorry, ma'am, but that
is not 15 items or less.

00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:56,047
[Asia] I'm giving you
very Katy Perry,

00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,217
cutesy, little girl fantasy.

1183
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,719
My drag is all about creativity

1184
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,719
and fun and magic.

1185
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,421
[Michelle] Oh!
[Carson] Oh.

1186
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,091
[RuPaul] Yes, girl,

1187
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,091
she's going back to Party City.

1188
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,827
Ross] Where she belongs.

1189
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,827

1190
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:14,299

[RuPaul]

1193
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,201
Dolla make you wanna holla.

1194
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,802
[Michelle] Yes.

1195
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,037
[Kalorie I'm just trying to give

1196
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:21,206
very expensive, rich,
white woman.

1197
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,875
I'm feeling like Kris Jenner
at the Met gala

1198
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,044
giving you Mama's realness.

1199
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,679
I'm feeling fabulous.

1200
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,047
[Michelle]

1201
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,047
The buck stops here.

1202
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,048
[all laugh]

1203
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,217
[Ross] Cash me outside.

1204
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,217
How about that?

1205
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,451
[all laugh]

1206
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,589
[RuPaul] Well, I declare,
Blair St. Clair.

1207
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,023
[Ross] Category is

1208
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,059
things you find in my windshield

1209
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,059
in Palm Springs.

1210
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,494
[all laugh]

1211
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:45,096
[Blair] This look to me is
Vivienne Westwood-inspired

1212
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,066
Paris runway. I feel
very high-fashion and edgy.

1213
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,268
I came here to slay.

1214
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,171
[Ross] She's a vision!
No, I'm sorry. A visor.

1215
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,440
[RuPaul] Are you advising her?
[Carson] I wouldn't advise it.

1216
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,376
[RuPaul] Now she's off

1217
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,376
to call her spiritual advisor.

1218
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,878
[all laugh]

1219
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,413
[RuPaul] Dusty Ray Bottoms!

1220
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,650
Tin! Tins across the board!

1221
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,987
[Dusty] I am serving
Space Odyssey clown realness.

1222
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,956
And I've got my cute little dots

1223
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,956
all over my face.

1224
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,992
And, listen,

1225
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,992
I'm Dusty Ray Bottoms,

1226
00:38:13,992 --> 00:38:15,660
so I've got to show
a little bottom.

1227
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,363
[RuPaul]

1228
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,363
Oh, and there's the bottom.

1229
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,198
Kameron Michaels!

1230
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:23,501
The grass is always greener
between me down there.

1231
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,004
[Kameron]

1232
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,004
This outfit is very me,

1233
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,306
because I like to play on

1234
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,306
the opposite end of the spectrum

1235
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,874
and be very feminine,

1236
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,876
since I'm a little more
masculine out of drag.

1237
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,211
[Ross]

1238
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,211
I think I see her tulips.

1239
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,513
[Michelle]

1240
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,513
Look at all that AstroTurf!

1241
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:37,115
[all laugh]

1242
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,450
[RuPaul] Monét X Change!

1243
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,019
[Ross] Cleanup on Season 10.

1244
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,120
[laughs]

1245
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,821
[Monét]

1246
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,821
My look is very conceptual,

1247
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,258
and it feels like a whole story

1248
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,258
with the dirt in my eyes.

1249
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:51,095
And I have ping-pong balls
to make little soap suds,

1250
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:54,032
and I have blue earrings
to signify the water.

1251
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,867
I'm literally cleaning the floor

1252
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,867
with my garment

1253
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,101
as I'm walking down the runway.

1254
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,504
And it's fucking fierce.

1255
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,939
[Carson] Oh, God,

1256
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:00,939
she's so self-absorbent.

1257
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,708
[RuPaul] Yeah.
[Michelle] That is Brillo-iant!

1258
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,543
[all laugh]

1259
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:06,978
[RuPaul] The Vixen!

1260
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,980
[Carson] She really used
her noodle on this one.

1261
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,881
[Michelle] She has!

1262
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,116
[The Vixen]

1263
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,116
My look is kind of Carnival.

1264
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,986
It's definitely art,
but it's still fun.

1265
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,822
It's everything
that I hope that I am.

1266
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,957
[Michelle] Hope floats.

1267
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,492
[all laugh]

1268
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:25,029
[RuPaul] Mother,
may I Mayhem Miller?

1269
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,098
[Michelle] Ooh, I wonder if
that dress has three-ply lining.

1270
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,032
[RuPaul] Hmm.

1271
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,667
[Carson] Well, for safety,

1272
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,667
she double-bagged it.

1273
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,935
[Michelle] Yes!

1274
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,004
[Mayhem] She's giving
garbage pail goddess.

1275
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,706
It's lovely, it's fierce,

1276
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,706
it's dark,

1277
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,975
it's mysterious,

1278
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,975
it's mayhem.

1279
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,943
[RuPaul] And if the glove

1280
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,943
don't fit...

1281
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:39,944
[Michelle] You must acquit!

1282
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,212
[RuPaul] No.

1283
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:41,212

All right, all right!

1286
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,485
[Michelle]
Do not comfort her!

1287
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:48,853
[all laugh]

1288
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:52,724

and I feel like I'm at home.

1291
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,397
Honey, I'm giving 'em

1292
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,900
My Drag on a Dime is bitchin'!

00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,502
I'm letting them know
Eureka is back.

1294
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,037

00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,775
[Michelle]
Somebody call my dealer quick!

1297
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,877
[RuPaul] Now, Michelle, would
you call this a poker face?

1298
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,680
[Michelle] Yes, I would,

1299
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,680
and I would also poke her face.

1300
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,015
[laughs]

1301
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,584

Bitch, is that hair
made out of plastic?

1306
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,223
It is.

1307
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:27,091
#Stunning.

1308

[Ross] Flower power bottom.

1313
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,272
[Carson] You can lead
a whore to culture.

1314
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,107
[all laugh]

1315
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,108
[Vanessa] Forget fashion week.

1316
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,777
This runway

1317
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,777
is the one that matters.

1318
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,078
Eat it up, eat it up!

1319
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,314
These cookies is coming down

1320
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,182

baby.

1322
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,318
A little wink-wink, nudge-nudge,

1323
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:54,852
and headed for the door.

1324
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:54,852
Let's go.

1325
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,020
[RuPaul]
Flowers in the attic.

1326
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,188
[Michelle] And in the basement.

1327
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,723
[RuPaul] Mm-hmm.
- [all laugh]

1328
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,391
[Carson] And on the back porch.

1329
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,391

00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,093
[all laugh]

1331
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,362

[Carson]

1336
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,600
I didn't get it.

1337
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,235
It's an ankh on her head!

1338
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,038
[Carson] Oh, that's an ankh?

1339
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,038
- [all laugh]

1340
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,407
[Yuhua] I'm embodying
a futuristic woman

1341
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,210
because in the future,

1342
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,210
there's not many supplies left.

1343
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,180
And as I turn, all those

1344
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,180
caution tapes just turn with me.

1345
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,248
I feel beautiful.

1346
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,952
This is <i>Law and Order,</i>

1347
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,952
<i>SV-Yuhua.</i>

1348
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,921
[Carson] Well, I think this look

1349
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,921
is criminal. Ankh, ankh!

1350
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,757
[Michelle]
Thank you! I tried!

1351
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,227
[RuPaul] Miz Cracker!

1352
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:36,227
Mr. Cheez-It!

1353
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,830
Oh, she looks so sad.

1354
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,300
[Miz Cracker]

1355
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,300
Today, I'm serving sad widow.

1356
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,136
My body language
is silent film drama.

1357
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,105
I'm telling you everything

1358
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,105
without saying a word.

1359
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,841
It's not the outfit that will

1360
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,841
sell the runway, it's me.

1361
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,609
[RuPaul] Miz Cracker,

1362
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,609
she's putting on the Ritz.

1363
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,145
[all laugh]

1364
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:56,247
Welcome, ladies.

1365
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,416
That runway

1366
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,416
was worth every penny.

1367
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,553
Now when I call your name,

1368
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,553
please step forward.

1369
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,022
Kameron Michaels,

1370
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,059
Aquaria,

1371
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,194

1373
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:14,665
Monét X Change,

1374
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:17,034
Monique Heart,

1375
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,070
The Vixen.

1376
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,240
You are all safe.

1377
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,247
What? Safe?

1378
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,949
Bitch, I was stunning!

1379
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,451
#Bitter.

1380
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,586
You may step your pussy up.

1381
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,556
And step

1382
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,556
to the back of the stage.

1383
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,665
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1384
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:52,170
Now, before the judging begins,
I have an announcement to make.

1385
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,607
There's one more queen

1386
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:00,011
I'd like to add
to this competition.

1387
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,648
- What?
- Shut up.

1388
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:06,017
We have enough! We already
got Eureka from last season!

1389
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,386
Oh, my God!

1390
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,386
Y'all are killing me!

1391
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:10,688
A queen we all know and love.

1392
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,059
Please welcome back
to the main stage...

1393
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,527
Farrah Moan.

1394
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,163
[Kalorie] Farrah? Really?

1395
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,499
They have to bring back
another Season 9 girl?

1396
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,201
[Monique]

1397
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,201
I'm like wait a minute.

1398
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,002
Farrah Moan got some work done.

1399
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:29,040
[cheers and applause]

1400
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,241
Yes!

1401
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,076
Aah!

1402
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:38,082
Stop the press! Xtina

1403
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:38,082
is in the building, baby!

1404
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:43,888
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

1405
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:48,226
Farrah Moan, you look
beautiful in every single way.

1406
00:43:48,226 --> 00:43:49,327
Thank you, Ru.

1407
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,162
Farrah, tell me.

1408
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:54,632
Why do you deserve to return
to the competition?

1409
00:43:54,632 --> 00:44:00,137
Oh, Ru, I only have
one thing to say.

1410
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:07,011
♪ Yeah ♪

1411
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,513
♪ Oh ♪

1412
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:12,984
♪ Oh...yeah ♪

1413
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,520
[cheers and applause]

1414
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,021
My queens, say hello

1415
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,157
to the one and only
Christina Aguilera!

1416
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,193
[cheers and applause]

1417
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:25,496
I want to like run onstage
and like grab her and touch her,

1418
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,331
but I know security

1419
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,331
will probably check me,

1420
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,833
so that's why

1421
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,833
I didn't make that move.

1422
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,104
Christina, you may join

1423
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,104
the other judges.

1424
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:34,739
Come on over, baby.

1425
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,908
All right.

1426
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,243
Not only do I live for
Christina Aguilera,

1427
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,712
but I ♪ live ♪

1428
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,712
for Christina Aguilera!

1429
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,115
I'm gonna tell you one thing
about Season 10.

1430
00:44:44,115 --> 00:44:46,050
When you think you know
what the fuck is going on,

1431
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,251
you don't know nothin'!

1432
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:52,089
Ladies, Christina watched
your runway presentations

1433
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,292
from backstage.

1434
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:57,094
And now it's time

1435
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:57,094
for the judges' critiques.

1436
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:02,166
First up,

1437
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:02,166
Kalorie Karbdashian Williams.

1438
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,801
- Hi.
- Hi.

1439
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,804
I loved your confidence
coming out here,

1440
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:10,508
and you do such a sweetness
about you, and I loved that.

1441
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,109
[Michelle] But I'm gonna
go out on a limb here

1442
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,978
and say that I'm thinking

1443
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:15,947
designing may not be
your strong suit.

1444
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,516
I mean, I might be biased,

1445
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,952
but I feel like
a million bucks, so...

1446
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:24,055
A design challenge look needs
to have presence on the runway.

1447
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,489
I would have loved
to have seen earrings

1448
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,858
made out of dollar bills

1449
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,858
in origami shapes.

1450
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,595
I would have loved to see
like maybe a big green wig.

1451
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,196
I wanted more impact.

1452
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:35,533
This is a dress
that's been done a few times.

1453
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:38,235
In fact, Raja did

1454
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:38,235
a version of it, Manila,

1455
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,171
and Acid Betty did one, too.

1456
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,739
And that's a lot
to live up to.

1457
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,107
But this just falls short

1458
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,107
for me.

1459
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:47,745
Up next, Blair St. Clair,

1460
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:47,745
I declare!

1461
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,880
You look really young.

1462
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,182
Me, too.

1463
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:52,917
That's funny.

1464
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:52,917
Tell another one.

1465
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,518
[all laugh]

1466
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,854
I love this look
because of all the textures.

1467
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,090
It's very artful,
and I really appreciate that.

1468
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,626
It's not easy to make a visor
look like a skirt.

1469
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:03,294
I think the only thing
that throws me off

1470
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,129
is maybe the visor in the back.

1471
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,098
I have to disagree

1472
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,098
with Michelle.

1473
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:07,999
I love the reflective collar

1474
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,368
because it's really

1475
00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:10,368
shooting some nice light

1476
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:11,369
right under my chins.

1477
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,770
[all laugh]

1478
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,973
Is it okay to say that

1479
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,973
the 99 Cent Store can be chic?

1480
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:19,343
Like you made it look very cool

1481
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:19,343
and futuristic.

1482
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,344
I'm intrigued by you.

1483
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:21,712
I think you have
something special.

1484
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,014
Thank you.

1485
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:26,150
Up next, I want to talk about
my favorite subject, bottoms.

1486
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,852
Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1487
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:29,320
I think this is really fun

1488
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,556
because it's got
a very 1960s mod feeling.

1489
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,558
It's a little bit like

1490
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,558
Jo Anne Worley and the Tin Man

1491
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:35,726
had a baby.

1492
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,028
Yeah.

1493
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,697
You chose to put a cone
on your head for a hat.

1494
00:46:39,697 --> 00:46:40,998
It almost turned it witchy

1495
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,035
when it was really fashiony

1496
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,035
on the bottom.

1497
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:48,105
I also want you to talk me
through the dots on your face.

1498
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,008
That's my signature makeup.

1499
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:51,008
That's what I do.

1500
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,710
You just wanted to do your
first look as your signature?

1501
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,944
Absolutely.

1502
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,279
We're gonna see this

1503
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,279
all the time?

1504
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,515
Not all the time.

1505
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,515
I can do a lot of things.

1506
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:00,384
Okay. Looking forward

1507
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:00,384
to a dot-free face, Dusty.

1508
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,887
Mayhem Miller.

1509
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,122
[coughs]

1510
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,024
Sorry. I was gagging.

1511
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,993
That's never happened before.

1512
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:12,029
[all laugh]
But I'm gagging over your look.

1513
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,598
I love the way you created

1514
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,598
that shoulder detail

1515
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,999
and how you used the trash bags

1516
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,135
to kind of almost make it
look like quilted leather.

1517
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,137
Even using the latex gloves

1518
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,873
as a chic cocktail glove

1519
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,873
is fantastic.

1520
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:23,941
You can serve a cocktail

1521
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:26,143
and check a hernia
all at the same time.

1522
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,044
[all laugh]

1523
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,647
The creativity

1524
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,647
is off the charts with this.

1525
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,116
This is a fantastic way
to come out of the gate.

1526
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,051
Somebody's who's auditioned
as many times as you have,

1527
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,054
you're here
and you did what you came to do.

1528
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,489
[sniffles]

1529
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:39,490
How you feeling?

1530
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,694
I'm just...

1531
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,694
I'm overwhelmed.

1532
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,196
Because I was so nervous.

1533
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,165
I've waited so long for this.

1534
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,234
[sobs]

1535
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,937
Sometimes the universe
knows better, Mayhem.

1536
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:56,040
The universe was waiting

1537
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:56,040
for you to be here at Season 10.

1538
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,508
This is your time,

1539
00:47:57,508 --> 00:48:00,544
and this is a great start
to this season for you.

1540
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,079
Thank you.

1541
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:08,252
Up next, Vanessa Vanjie Mateo
of the Mateo Dynasty. Bam!

1542
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,355
So do you have

1543
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,355
a background in design?

1544
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,990
I wouldn't say

1545
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,990
I'm Project Runway ready,

1546
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,092
but I got my patterns

1547
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,092
in my clutch.

1548
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,294
[all laugh]

1549
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,996
You have a lot of flavor,

1550
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,996
uh-huh.

1551
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,998
All kinds of flavors.

1552
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,867
Yeah, and I like
fell in love with you

1553
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:24,335
the minute you started talking.

1554
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:27,004
I agree.

1555
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:27,004
As soon as you talk,

1556
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,141
it like brings everything about
you to a whole different level.

1557
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,643
I love the quirkiness
and the campiness

1558
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,979
of the dolls on your boobs,
coming out of your waist.

1559
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,480
They're just like, hey, girl.

1560
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,215
But here's the story.

1561
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:41,552
I'm looking at you
and I see round almost.

1562
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:43,053
It's about definition.

1563
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,823
You wanna see

1564
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,823
the lines in the outfits.

1565
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,058
So it's literally
a head and legs,

1566
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,660
and the rest is flowers.

1567
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,662
You guys put so much time

1568
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,662
and effort

1569
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:55,099
into making undergarments and
bodies that give an illusion,

1570
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,101
and then you're slamming

1571
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,101
everything on it

1572
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,369
and covering it up.

1573
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,905
So think about that before
you step out onto the runway.

1574
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:05,042
Yuhua Hamasaki.

1575
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:05,976
I really like this look.

1576
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,412
You've taken two disparate ideas

1577
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,914
where you did

1578
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,914
a very couture shape,

1579
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:11,615
but you used

1580
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:11,615
a very campy material.

1581
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,917
The caution tape,
was it something

1582
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:15,052
we've never seen before?

1583
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:15,052
Absolutely not.

1584
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:19,123
But it was cute, and I think
you...Yuhua pulled it off.

1585
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,125
[all laugh]

1586
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,627
So do you know that you have
an ankh on your head?

1587
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,929
I don't even know
what an ankh is.

1588
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,932
An ankh is an Egyptian symbol,

1589
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,932
I believe, of peace.

1590
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:30,034
Oh, I thought you meant
by like car, onk, onk.

1591
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:30,968
That was the joke.

1592
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,804
[all laugh]

1593
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,539
I thought you had personality
when you came out.

1594
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,841
Obviously, all I saw was an ankh

1595
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,475
that you had no idea
you had on your head.

1596
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,044
Michelle, you're never
gonna make ankh happen.

1597
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:42,613
- [all laugh]
- Onk, onk!

1598
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:44,348
Up next, Miz Cracker.

1599
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,383
Yes, Miz Cracker,
if you're nasty.

1600
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,718
And I'm disgusting.

1601
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,220
[all laugh]

1602
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,688
Sassy cracker, too.

1603
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,656
Where'd you get that name?

1604
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,694
I used to be Brianna Cracker,

1605
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,694
like "brie on a cracker."

1606
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,162
Oh, my gosh.

1607
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,197
But then

1608
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,197
it was too complicated.

1609
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,498
And a little cheesy.

1610
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,101
Yeah. I thought it would be
simpler to be just Miz Cracker.

1611
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,069
And I live in Harlem,

1612
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,238
so people call me by name

1613
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,238
all the time.

1614
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:10,007
[all laugh]

1615
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,041
Okay, let's talk
about this look.

1616
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,077
This is not an easy shape to do,

1617
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,778
this kind of 1940s

1618
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:14,778
peplum jacket.

1619
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,847
So kudos on the way
you've constructed it.

1620
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,450
So what materials did you use?

1621
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,186
Shower curtains

1622
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,186
and broad-brimmed hats.

1623
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,989
I think that you constructed
a masterpiece here,

1624
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,758
and you painted your face
to go along with that.

1625
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,660
But I think

1626
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,660
what really sold it

1627
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,128
was the presentation

1628
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,128
on the runway

1629
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,463
when you came out

1630
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,463
and you were looking lost.

1631
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:35,065
I saw myself
as this sort of tragic figure

1632
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,134
that goes with the outfit.

1633
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,270
What was the tragedy,
a fisting accident?

1634
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,171
There are no accidents

1635
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,171
in fisting.

1636
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:44,475
[all laugh]

1637
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,912
To know that you created this

1638
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,912
from the 99 Cent Store,

1639
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:50,147
I'm super blown away.
Awesome job.

1640
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,582
Thank you, Christina Aguilera.

1641
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:56,086
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1642
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,022
While you untuck backstage,

1643
00:50:58,022 --> 00:51:00,824
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1644
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:04,361
All right, so just between

1645
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:04,361
us squirrel-friends,

1646
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:05,863
what do you think?

1647
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:09,233
Kalorie Karbdashian Williams.

1648
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,834
I think she has
a beautiful smile,

1649
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,704
but I think that dress

1650
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,704
was hideous.

1651
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,406
Everything just came out

1652
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,406
ill-fitting,

1653
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,707
and when she turned around,

1654
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,042
the back

1655
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,042
was kind of falling apart.

1656
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:19,009
What I really didn't like

1657
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,912
was the black showing
in the back of her.

1658
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,681
This was essentially
a fashion challenge.

1659
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:25,716
You have to wow us visually,

1660
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:28,018
and it just looked, for me,
like she ran out of time.

1661
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,255
You can't show up and show us
something we've seen before,

1662
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,058
and not even show it as good
as it was done the first time

1663
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:35,492
or the second time
or the third time.

1664
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,661
This is Season 10.

1665
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,661
You've gotta be different,

1666
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,964
you've gotta be unique,
and you've gotta wow us.

1667
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:41,799
Blair St. Clair.

1668
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,901
[Christina] She was hands down

1669
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,901
one of my top favorites.

1670
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:46,270
I really, really
liked her a lot.

1671
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,838
[Carson] And I love
that she's giving us

1672
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,108
Vivienne Westwood Judy Jetson
looks made out of a sun visor.

1673
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,910
And she also is gorgeous.

1674
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,778
She's like our little ingénue.

1675
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,847
I've got tucking panties

1676
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,847
older than her.

1677
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,082
[all laugh]

1678
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:00,050
Tonight what she did
with the sun visors

1679
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,218
is not easy to do.

1680
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,887
There's a regalness about her

1681
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,887
which I love,

1682
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,023
and I just cannot wait
to see more from Blair.

1683
00:52:06,023 --> 00:52:07,925
[RuPaul] Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1684
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,326
[Michelle] I actually really
liked the construction

1685
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,061
she did with these visors.

1686
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,930
From back to front,
it all went together.

1687
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,064
And then she lost me

1688
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,768
by putting a cone on her head
covered in tin foil.

1689
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:20,838
It took me out of fashion

1690
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:20,838
and into costuming,

1691
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:22,506
and I didn't want to see that.

1692
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,608
I wanted to remain
in the fashion sphere.

1693
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,779
I would have loved for her
to connect the dots, per se.

1694
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:31,181
I thought it was moderate

1695
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:31,181
plaque psoriasis.

1696
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,182
[all laugh]

1697
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,384
There's a pill for that.

1698
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,219
At least it was interesting.

1699
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,121
At least it was something
I hadn't really seen before.

1700
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:38,989
Now, if she does that

1701
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:38,989
every week,

1702
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,824
of course
we're gonna read her for that.

1703
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,160
But I want to see
what she's gonna do next week.

1704
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,495
Mayhem Miller.

1705
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,631
I loved just the boldness

1706
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,631
and the fearlessness.

1707
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,066
She knew

1708
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,066
what she was here to do,

1709
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,068
and she executed it flawlessly.

1710
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,103
I love

1711
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,103
when a queen's time comes

1712
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,338
right when the stars align,

1713
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,672
and it's happening

1714
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,672
for Mayhem.

1715
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,508
But now she set herself up.

1716
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,676
Can she deliver

1717
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,676
at that level every week?

1718
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,513
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

1719
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,148
She's in your face,
and I love that.

1720
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:06,283
What I didn't love
was everything else.

1721
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,452
She's wearing like flowers

1722
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,452
that are all pastels,

1723
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,954
and she has sparkly rhinestones

1724
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,954
and Barbie dolls.

1725
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,189
And then she's like...

1726
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,657
[deep voice]
Yeah, I caught a bitch. Like--

1727
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,559
I love that dichotomy.

1728
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,761
We've seen these queens

1729
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,761
who we love

1730
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,664
who don't necessarily
have the taste level yet

1731
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,232
evolve and mature.

1732
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,502
I just hope she's around

1733
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:25,502
to get there.

1734
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,105
Yuhua Hamasaki.

1735
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:30,174
She did have beautiful
movement with the dress.

1736
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:32,076
It was kind of predictable

1737
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:32,076
in the sense

1738
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:34,278
that we've seen it, you know,
a few times before.

1739
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,046
But I think what I fell in love

1740
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,046
with this girl about

1741
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,114
was her personality.

1742
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,049
She seems to really know

1743
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,049
who she is

1744
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,250
or at least thinks she does.

1745
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,352
But will she have the talent

1746
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,352
to back it up?

1747
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,222
If she doesn't,

1748
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,222
things are gonna get ankh-ward.

1749
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,791
[laughs]
Shut up, Ross!

1750
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,126
Miz Cracker.

1751
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,461
I love how she constructed

1752
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,461
the look.

1753
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,330
I thought it was kind of

1754
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,330
a complicated look to build.

1755
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,233
She's very interesting.
She's very cerebral.

1756
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,968
Whenever she started speaking,

1757
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,804
she was so articulate

1758
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,804
about everything she had to say.

1759
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,272
She's the Serena Williams

1760
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:02,272
of one-liners.

1761
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,008
Every time you threw
something out, she hit back.

1762
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,277
She is a weirdo,

1763
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,946
and that's

1764
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,946
what I love about her.

1765
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:10,147
And she's funny.

1766
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:11,849
- And smart.
- And smart.

1767
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,350
Okay.

1768
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,350
Michelle want a cracker?

1769
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,952
Yes, please,
and my goal is to--

1770
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:16,220
[clap clap]
Silence!

1771
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,255
I've made my decision.

1772
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,991
Bring back my girls.

1773
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,526
Welcome back, ladies.

1774
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:24,061
I've made some decisions.

1775
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,233
Miz Cracker.

1776
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:30,601
You're safe.

1777
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,205
Blair St. Clair.

1778
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:37,074
You're safe.

1779
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,578
Mayhem Miller.

1780
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:44,781
Mo glove, mo love.

1781
00:54:46,183 --> 00:54:47,451
Con-drag-ulations.

1782
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,120
You're the winner

1783
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,120
of this week's challenge.

1784
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,156
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1785
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:54,391
You've won

1786
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:54,391
a luxury Hawaiian getaway

1787
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,095
to the Hale Mohalu
Guesthouse and Retreat.

1788
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,296
Thank you.

1789
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,598
I won the first challenge

1790
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,600
of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race
</i>Season 10.

1791
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,536
It is amazing.

1792
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:11,341
Yuhua Hamasaki.

1793
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,943
You are safe.

1794
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:14,211
Thank you, Mama Ru.

1795
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,047
Dusty Ray.

1796
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,651
Your topper just might
land you in the bottom.

1797
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,421
Kalorie Karbdashian Williams.

1798
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,223
You're dripping in dollars,

1799
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:29,059
but you didn't make it rain.

1800
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,997
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.
You're a doll,

1801
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:39,069
but your body was overpowered
by a field of flowers.

1802
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,039
Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1803
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:45,742
You're safe.

1804
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,878
Thank you.

1805
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,214
You may join the other girls.

1806
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:55,619
Kalorie, Vanessa,
I'm sorry, my dears,

1807
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,155
but you are up for elimination.

1808
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:01,758
Two queens stand before me.

1809
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,660
Prior to tonight,
you were asked

1810
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,697
to prepare

1811
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,697
a lip-sync performance

1812
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:10,267
of "Ain't No Other Man"
