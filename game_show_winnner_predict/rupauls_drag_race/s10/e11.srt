1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,102
- Previously
on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:06,073
You'll be transforming
these kings of social media

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,610
into flawless drag queens.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,711
[cheers and applause]

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,047
Miz Cracker and Miz Cookie.

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,350
- You did such a great job
on the hair and the makeup.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,185
The family line is there.

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,920
- And the detail is ridiculous.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,121
- Aah!
- Monet X Change

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,624
and Short Change.

11
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,660
- There is no family resemblance
apart from a pair of glasses.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,730
- Kameron and Kelly Michaels.

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,899
- I would say
y'all were a little muted.

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,234
- This is really too simple.

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,270
- Miz Cracker,
con-drag-ulations.

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,273
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

17
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,474
- Yeah--

18
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,910
- Kameron Michaels,
shantay you stay.

19
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:47,180
Monet X Change, sashay away.

20
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:58,926
- [sighs]

21
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,494
Lord.

22
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,862
- Oh, the sponge.

23
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,665
- Long live the sponge.

24
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:05,899
- Yes!

25
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,201
- Money is one of
the craziest people I know

26
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,170
and I love her so much
and I'm so gonna miss her.

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,539
- She's one of those people
that's a good Judy to everybody.

28
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,274
- Absolutely.

29
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,443
- There's so many time that
she talked me down off a ledge,

30
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,045
and I'm not
gonna have that anymore.

31
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,047
It drives me fucking crazy.

32
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,549
That's my lady,
and you sent her home, bitch.

33
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,717
- Don't even say that.

34
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,452
- You were a lip sync slayer.

35
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:29,456
- I am pretty devastated
that Monet is gone.

36
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,925
Once again,
another girl goes home,

37
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,662
and this time
it's kind of because of me.

38
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,230
I feel terrible.

39
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,332
- Why do you feel terrible?

40
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,902
- 'Cause I just don't like...

41
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,303
I would be less upset--

42
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,138
Oh, this sounds terrible.
I can't believe I'm saying this.

43
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,641
I would feel less upset
being in that position

44
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,644
than standing here wiping off
somebody's else's shit.

45
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,946
It sucks.
I don't want to stand here

46
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,114
and wipe off
somebody elses's name

47
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,584
and knowing that I was
the cause of them going home.

48
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,586
- So, Kameron, leave then.

49
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,189
But don't stand here and tell me

50
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,192
that it would be easier
to be in her shoes

51
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,360
than in yours.

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,395
If that's the case,
then put her shoes on,

53
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,697
lace them up, and walk
your ass back to Tennessee.

54
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,066
- Just make sure to honor her.

55
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,701
Take her place with pride.

56
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,169
- Don't let it be in vain.

57
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,071
- I'm gonna miss her.
- Yeah, me, too.

58
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,407
[cheering]

59
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,709
- A sponge!
[all laugh]

60
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,745
Long live the sponge!

61
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,680
- Long live the sponge!

62
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,181
- This is for you,
Monet X Change.

63
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,016
I love you.

64
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,784
- That's clean as hell.

65
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,020
We should use a sponge
every week.

66
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,087
I've made it to the top five

67
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,156
of "RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 10,"

68
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,159
and I am beyond ready
to make it to the end

69
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,762
and take home that crown.

70
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,997
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

71
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,098
- Thank you.

72
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,433
- You're breaking free.

73
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,769
- I just really, really,
really wanted it,

74
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,570
and that's all.

75
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,639
- But it feels
so good to win, though.

76
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,576
- Yeah. This is my mother's
favorite creature,

77
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,779
the butterfly,
and I feel like

78
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,381
seeing my mother and sister
really changed things for me

79
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,717
because I suddenly
remembered who I was.

80
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,986
And if these crazy people

81
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,422
are willing to use a computer
for the first time in a year

82
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,425
so that I could have
a message sent to me,

83
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,193
then I gotta step this up.

84
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,562
- Miz Cracker's drag is nice,

85
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,165
Her hair is nice,
her makeup is beautiful.

86
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,199
She's funny.

87
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,034
But it's the top five,

88
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,070
and being just kind of,
you know, good enough,

89
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,105
that time has come and gone.

90
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:28,742
If I haven't seen you
be a star by now at some point,

91
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,711
I have a hard time
seeing you be a star period.

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,247
- We are the top five!

93
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,615
[cheering]

94
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,184
- Kameron, I'm so glad
you're still here, bitch.

95
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,286
You better fight your way
to be here, bitch.

96
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,588
- And we enjoyed the times.

97
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,224
- And we enjoyed the times.
- And we enjoyed the times.

98
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,159
[all laugh]

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,828
- The first time
I performed in drag,

100
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,397
my tits fell out
so my dress fell off.

101
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:53,900
And now
it's a top five finally.

102
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,102
We're so close to the end.

103
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,871
I only have to remember
one thing.

104
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,042
Don't fuck it up.

105
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,677
- Aah!
- [laughs]

106
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,980
- The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

107
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,548
receives a one year supply

108
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,017
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

109
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,754
and a cash prize of $100.000.

110
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,991
With extra special
guest judges Ashanti

111
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,659
and Lena Dunham.

112
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,994
- ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race ♪

113
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,162
- ♪ May the best woman ♪

114
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,732
- ♪ Best woman win ♪

115
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,735
- Next episode.

116
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,937
Challenge. Another challenge.

117
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,038
- Baby, we are back.

118
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,775
I am just so excited.

119
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,345
But we also have to remember
we got about 2.7 seconds

120
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:41,214
to bask in the glory
of the top five

121
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,849
before Ru walks down the stairs

122
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,184
and say, okay, get ready,

123
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,086
'cause another bitch
is about to pack her stuff.

124
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,054
- I feel like
they're gonna make us do

125
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,122
a really intense mini challenge.

126
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,158
As long as I don't have
to get in quick drag again.

127
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,993
- What'd you look like
your first time in drag?

128
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,561
- I wore one wig.

129
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,429
I'm sure it looked like
spaghetti on my head

130
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,198
- Girl, when I started drag,
I had just saw Ru,

131
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,566
so I thought every black girl

132
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,934
was supposed to be
platinum blonde.

133
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,804
So I had the cheapest
Kanekalon synthetic--

134
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,273
- Kanekalon.
- Kanekalon.

135
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,175
- And it looked like
the Barbie dreamhouse hair.

136
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:10,310
Like so plasticy
you can't even brush it.

137
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,512
It was just--it moves
like a piece of cardboard.

138
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,181
And I thought
I was the last woman.

139
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,783
- Girl.
What about you, Aquaria?

140
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,351
- I thought I looked cute.
I like--

141
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,352
- Of course you did.

142
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,188
[alarm]

143
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,689
- Ooh, girl!

144
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,892
She done already
done had herses.

145
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,195
- Hey, racers.
- Hey, girl.

146
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,697
- It's time to split...
personalities.

147
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,067
I want to see
some civil disobedience.

148
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,036
So double down.

149
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,339
All aboard
the bipolar express.

150
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,041
Whoo-hoo!

151
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,676
Deuces!

152
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,344
- Wait.

153
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,445
If they bring Vanjie in.

154
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,747
She'd come in
on the bipolar express.

155
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,049
[all laugh]

156
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,551
- Hello, hello, hello.

157
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,222
[cheers and applause]

158
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,559
Ladies, say hello
to Cheyenne Jackson.

159
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,361
- Hi.
- Hi, ladies.

160
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,965
- Now, Cheyenne,
where is the first place

161
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,634
a drag queen goes
on Sunday mornings?

162
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,703
- Jail?
[all laugh]

163
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,204
- Good answer, actually.

164
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,939
But if she's smart,

165
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,175
she goes to drag brunch,

166
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:19,279
lie the ones hosted nationwide
by Voss Events.

167
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,981
- Whoo!
- Yes.

168
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,884
- For today, I want you
to get all culinary with it

169
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,654
as we do a mini challenge

170
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,324
called Resting Brunch Face.

171
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,525
[all laugh]

172
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,428
You need to drag up pancakes

173
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:39,099
to create devastatingly
delicious dishes.

174
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,601
So, Cheyenne, you hungry?

175
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,069
- Actually, I had
a really big breakfast, so--

176
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,174
- Good, because I'm relying
on your discerning palate.

177
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:53,747
Ladies, whichever pancake
Cheyenne likes best wins.

178
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,116
And when I say pancake,
I mean, you know...

179
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,985
[cheers and applause]

180
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,621
Now, you've got 15 minutes.

181
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,857
Ready, set, go!

182
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,993
- Whoop!

183
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,629
- Oh, I'm gonna really,
really not like this part.

184
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,932
[gagging]

185
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,967
Oh, my God, I can't.
I literally cannot.

186
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,168
[gags]

187
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,604
This is probably
the grossest challenge

188
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,638
I've ever done in my life.

189
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,842
There was just
so many food groups.

190
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,210
They don't go together at all.

191
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,945
- I love a good snack challenge.

192
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,715
Girl, the garnishes
look delicious.

193
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,484
These raspberries look yummy,
the gummy worms.

194
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,820
I ain't mad at these
little baby red tomatoes.

195
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,222
I'm going to eat that, I think.

196
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,093
Can we do
an all you can eat challenge?

197
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,161
- Are you eating?

198
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,430
- ♪ Breakfast ♪
- Eureka!

199
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,166
Like, Eureka,
why is your pancake bare?

200
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,102
- [laughs]
I got hungry.

201
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,270
- [retches]

202
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,038
- Time's up, ladies.

203
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,009
Well, Cheyenne, welcome

204
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,813
to the International
Halfway House of Pancakes.

205
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,949
First off, we've got
Kameron Michaels.

206
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,217
- This is little Patty Punta.

207
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,719
- I didn't know
you were bilingual.

208
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,088
- I'm not really.
I know that word.

209
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:10,623
And she's married
to Peter Pancake,

210
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,092
plus she's having an affair
with Wally Waffle.

211
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,927
She has whipped cream hair

212
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,196
and a little
ombre root going on.

213
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,598
And then since she's having
the affair with Wally Waffle

214
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,600
and he's the one with the money,
so she's got her veneer.

215
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,802
- [laughs] You have
a little taste of Punta?

216
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:23,837
- Sure.

217
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,106
- Remember, portion control

218
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,540
is very important
here in "Drag Race."

219
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,176
- Proportionizing.
- [laughs]

220
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:34,147
Yes, get into that pancake.

221
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,349
- There's a certain
je ne sais quoi. I like it.

222
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,718
- Miz Cracker.
- Hello, Ru.

223
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,154
This is Lil Miss Wedding Cake.

224
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,557
This is her very first time
at a drag brunch,

225
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,326
and she's so excited
to meet queens

226
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,094
for the first time in person!

227
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,396
This is your last chance

228
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,997
to taste her
before the wedding, so...

229
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,565
- Cheyenne, I have to ask.

230
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,501
Are you allergic to peanuts?

231
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:58,371
Because our queens are known
to hide their nuts.

232
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,642
Do you think it's
a virgin pancake?

233
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,910
- Questionable.

234
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,578
- Eew.

235
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,946
- This is Panquisha.

236
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,214
She's from South Dallas.

237
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,482
We've got the government spam.

238
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,984
She's got her little
olive nose ring.

239
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,952
You know, she's smoking a blunt,
she's missing a tooth

240
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,287
'cause she's been through
a couple things

241
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,823
trying to get here,
but she's happy to be here.

242
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,025
- So she's like
an around the way pancake.

243
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,627
- Around the way,
around the corner.

244
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,029
- Okay. Cheyenne, I can tell

245
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,999
you are dying
to put this in your mouth.

246
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,035
- Mmm.
- How's it taste?

247
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,004
- Panquisha.
- Hey.

248
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,872
- This is Cindy Ann.

249
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,774
She used to reside

250
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,545
in East Compton
residential federal prison.

251
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,680
She's full of many things:
anti-oxidants,

252
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,449
non-allergens, heroin.

253
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,350
[both laugh]

254
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,786
She hasn't been tasted
in a long time

255
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,356
by especially a male,
so she is so ready.

256
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,426
- Ooh.
- Nice.

257
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,094
- Aquaria.

258
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,197
Tell me about your panty-cake.

259
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,531
- I'm from Bushwick,

260
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,600
and you know we like
to keep it very artsy there,

261
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,736
so I call this art piece
"Pancakes Labyrinth,"

262
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,438
inspired by the film.

263
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,340
We've got eyeballs on her hands.

264
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,776
We've got lots of greens.

265
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,110
We're hitting pretty much
every food group

266
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,178
on the pyramid possible.

267
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,379
- Is it edible?

268
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,048
- It is edible.

269
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,049
- [laughs]

270
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,520
Hmm.

271
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,088
- [gulps]

272
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,157
- Well, thank you very much.

273
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,558
Cheyenne's going to go
get his stomach pumped.

274
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,726
We'll be right back.

275
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,161
- If you need any help pumping,
let me know.

276
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,229
- Okay, will do.

277
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,432
All right, ladies.

278
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,402
You all served a mean
resting brunch face,

279
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,672
but one of you
really made Cheyenne

280
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,241
want to eat it.

281
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,909
Hungry for more.

282
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:48,114
- And the winner
of today's mini challenge is...

283
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,616
Asia O'Hara.

284
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,917
[applause]

285
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,152
- Thank you.

286
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,821
- You've won a $2.000 gift card

287
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,724
from The Spa on Rodeo.

288
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:59,125
- Whoo.

289
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,061
- Now, Cheyenne, you have
growing twins at home.

290
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,029
- I do.

291
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,100
- And I insist
you take one of these with you.

292
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,902
- Uh, no--
- Like Asia,

293
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,437
come on over
and bring your plate.

294
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,040
You can tell them
the story of Panquisha.

295
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,842
- Oh, wow.
- Yes.

296
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,344
- Make sure
they eat their greens.

297
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,513
- The twins are going
to love that, Cheyenne.

298
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,081
- Bye.
- Bye.

299
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,550
- Love you.

300
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,218
- Goodbye, Cheyenne.

301
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:30,056
Ladies, now, we all have
negative voices in our heads,

302
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,091
the inner saboteur

303
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,161
that tells us we can't do it

304
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,996
or we're not good enough.

305
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,466
I know I fight them off
every single day.

306
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,137
But if you can't beat 'em,
put 'em in drag.

307
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,773
For this week's maxi challenge,

308
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:51,444
you need to present
two distinct characters.

309
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:55,648
One character is you
at your best and brightest,

310
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,951
while the other character

311
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,520
is your evil twin.

312
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,056
The yin to your yang.

313
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,259
A dark sided bee-otch

314
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,061
that oozes negativity.

315
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,530
You need to write and record

316
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,533
the inner dialogue
for both characters.

317
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:17,070
Tomorrow, you and your evil twin

318
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,173
will strut your stuff
on the main stage.

319
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,109
You can use your own drag,

320
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,877
Fierce! Drag Jewels,

321
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,081
plus materials
from the Mood fabric wall.

322
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,215
And remember,

323
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:33,019
one queen's charisma,
uniqueness, nerve and talent

324
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:38,825
is another queen's deep, dark
black hole of despair.

325
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,794
Gentlemen, start your engines,

326
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:45,732
and may the best
and worst woman win.

327
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,767
- We are literally personifying

328
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,336
the things
we hate most about ourselves.

329
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,138
What could go wrong?

330
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,842
- Maybe this and maybe this.

331
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,044
- Oh, wow. That's cool.

332
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,345
- For this maxi challenge,

333
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,115
we have to develop
two characters:

334
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,951
our good side
and our inner saboteur.

335
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,220
We have to come up with
an outfit for each one

336
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,757
and a voiceover that shows
each one's personality.

337
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,058
- My inner saboteur's trying

338
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,593
to make me
put three feathers on this,

339
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,728
even though
it's only supposed to be one.

340
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,997
- This challenge
calls for us to address

341
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,701
a lot of parts of ourselves
that we're not proud of,

342
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,037
so everyone is feeling
very vulnerable

343
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:27,073
because there's nothing to
hide behind in this challenge.

344
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,275
- I would love to get ideas
of other people

345
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,843
of what they think's
good about me

346
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,179
and what they think's bad,
though, 'cause that would help.

347
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,214
- Well, I don't find
a lot of things good about you.

348
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:39,986
- I think
one of your best qualities

349
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,788
is the fact
that all of your drag

350
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,189
is like hot whore drag.

351
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,991
Your drag looks like
a lot of effort

352
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,726
and money and time
has been put into it.

353
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,728
- So on bad side, a whore,

354
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,530
but on good side,
a high quality whore.

355
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,864
- [laughs]

356
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,032
So what's on the bad?

357
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,200
- You talk too much.

358
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,568
- We all know that.

359
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,869
- I think, you know,
the rough and tumble.

360
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,005
- Oh, that I need to be
a little more edgy?

361
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,340
Like too tailored, too precise.

362
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,042
- We call is Suzy Creamcheese.

363
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,478
- A little too Suzy Creamcheese.

364
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,815
- A little too
Suzy Creamcheese. Okay.

365
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,450
- All right, I'm ready.

366
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,720
- Cracker, you like really
beat yourself up about stuff,

367
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,822
and like I definitely
noticed it a lot

368
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,023
during the "Breastworld"
challenge.

369
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,559
Like every time Michelle
would say something,

370
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,194
you were just like,
bad Cracker!

371
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,197
- She talks to herself
all the time.

372
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,998
- What I absolutely love
about you

373
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,000
is that you are
fucking hilarious.

374
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,670
My least favorite is that
you over-explain everything.

375
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,271
- Yeah.

376
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,107
- A bad quality of yours is

377
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,175
you're like under-emotional.

378
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,910
You don't show a lot of depth.

379
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,013
Your response to a compliment
and a read

380
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,015
are like
almost exactly the same.

381
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,118
Last week
when you won that challenge,

382
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,353
I expected you
to be doing cartwheels

383
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,588
to the back of the stage

384
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,189
and you just, thank you,
and you bowed.

385
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,925
- She refuses to show emotion.
- She's like a robot.

386
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,028
- I think it's funny that
everyone in this competition

387
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,097
thinks of me as emotionless,

388
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,467
because inside, I think
I feel things more strongly

389
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,635
than anyone else.

390
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,774
- Hi-ee.

391
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,042
- Hi-ee.
- Hi.

392
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,978
- How are
my twisted sisters doing?

393
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,946
- Just twisting it up.

394
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,948
- Hi, Asia.
- Hi.

395
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,285
- So how much of what
we're gonna see on the runway

396
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,553
is what you brought,

397
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,156
and how much of it
is something that you made?

398
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,058
- Well, all of it is going
to be things that I have made.

399
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,360
- Did you make this? Wow.
- Yes, ma'am.

400
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,729
It's definitely
going to be all things

401
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,564
that I have created
with my own two hands,

402
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,167
because I think this challenge
above all others

403
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,036
requires me to utilize
things that I have created

404
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,705
because that's my outlet

405
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,507
and I learned about myself
through that.

406
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,942
- I want to talk about
your dark side.

407
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,544
You don't seem like
you have one.

408
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,847
- I take comfort in misery.

409
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,017
Being sad or being angry
feels comfortable for me.

410
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,018
- Where's that come from?

411
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,053
- I don't actually know.

412
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,655
Like I have found that,
you know,

413
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,989
you get happy or whatever,

414
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,058
and as soon
as something bad happens

415
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,459
or something negative happens,

416
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,695
it kind of feels
like home sometimes.

417
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,464
- Yeah, I'm sure most people
feel very comfortable with it.

418
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,500
I think the world feels
more comfortable with fear.

419
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,202
In this competition,

420
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,338
when have you been
the most raw?

421
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,507
- Probably the ball.
I was in the bottom

422
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,042
and I could have
potentially went home.

423
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,010
And I blamed
everyone around me

424
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,546
because I felt like
I had helped so many people

425
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,014
and hadn't gotten help,

426
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:26,452
and an authentic part of myself
sometimes is you did bad.

427
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,821
It's that person's fault
and it's that person's fault.

428
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,590
And, you know,
later in the competition,

429
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,692
I started seeing
some of those qualities

430
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,994
in someone else, and that
was even more eye opening

431
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,531
because I was like,
that right there's a part of me.

432
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,467
- That's why I think
this challenge is so important,

433
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,035
because we have
to look at those things.

434
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,137
You know,
I always see my saboteur

435
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,006
in my peripheral vision always,

436
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,375
and I always like to say,
you can look, Ru.

437
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,610
Just don't stare.

438
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,811
- Yes.

439
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,145
As I'm vocalizing these things

440
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,148
that before I was only able
to put on paper,

441
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,117
I'm like am I ready for this?

442
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,952
Like I don't know

443
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,254
if this is going to be
as easy as I thought.

444
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,824
- Hi, Eureka.

445
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,093
- Hello. How are you?
- I'm doing great.

446
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,761
Got a lot of stuff out here.

447
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,962
- Yeah, I've got
a lot of directions

448
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,963
my mind's going in.

449
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,499
- Are you making costumes
for your saboteur?

450
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,867
- Yes, I am.

451
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,203
I really want to take
a direction with my saboteur

452
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:21,274
that's a legitimate evil twin
to a look that I have.

453
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,609
- So you're starting
with your good girl,

454
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,945
and then you're just going
to do the opposite of that.

455
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,847
- Yes.
- Tell me about your saboteur.

456
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,016
Is it as vicious as mine is?

457
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:31,651
- My saboteur
tells me all the time

458
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:32,818
that I'm not good enough,

459
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,087
and that, you know,
my size is an issue

460
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,490
and that it holds me back
from things in life.

461
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,925
It tells me
that I'm not a good person.

462
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,293
It tells me that I'm not funny.

463
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,262
It tells me that I'm ugly,
that I'll never be with someone.

464
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,131
- When does it rear
its ugly head?

465
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,299
- Any time I question myself.

466
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,634
Honestly, in the beginning
of this competition,

467
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,470
I had a big issue with
like my saboteur telling me

468
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,340
that you all hated the idea
that you brought me back

469
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,976
and that I was taking a dream
from someone else and--

470
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,946
- That is all made up
in your head.

471
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,380
- Mm-hmm.
- We use these things

472
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,884
to sort of scare us
into moving forward.

473
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,787
Like the concept of you better
get out there and work harder

474
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:09,989
because you want to prove
to Ms. Paul

475
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,691
that you deserve to be here.

476
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,925
That's just a ploy.

477
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,595
You can propel yourself
with positive energy.

478
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,363
You can propel yourself
with negative energy.

479
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,700
That's an example of trying
to propel yourself out of fear.

480
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,335
- Mm-hmm.
- I do this thing.

481
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,136
When I go onstage,
I always imagine

482
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,339
that I'm going to go perform
in my mother's living room.

483
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,841
Because no matter
what I would do,

484
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,109
she would love it.

485
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,110
So every time I go onstage--

486
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
I don't care
if it's thousands of people--

487
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,480
I'll go, okay,
mama's living room.

488
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,849
And rather than
working through

489
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,752
the "oh, my God,
oh, they're not gonna like me,"

490
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,521
rather than going that route,
I go the love route,

491
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,125
and it allows me
to just be myself.

492
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,460
- I'm actually excited
to do this

493
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,362
and admit to the world
some of the things

494
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,831
that I'm the most vulnerable
or afraid of.

495
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,100
Because what I've learned
being here

496
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,436
is that being vulnerable
is actually strength.

497
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,171
- Yes.
- And being honest is strong.

498
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,107
- Yes. Absolutely.

499
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,942
- Oh, I'm excited.
I'm like, oh!

500
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,810
- All right. I can't wait
to see you out there.

501
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,978
- Thank you.
- Bye.

502
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,148
Hi, Aquaria.
- Hey, RuPaul.

503
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,916
- So what are you doing
in the challenge?

504
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,418
- So it's been made apparent

505
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,021
I have a good eye
for style and fashion.

506
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,455
- Did it come from
your mom or your dad?

507
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,657
- I think maybe
it skipped a generation.

508
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,860
It's in there somewhere
I'm sure.

509
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,129
For my good side,
I wanted to do

510
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,032
a really fun,
whimsical look.

511
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,768
This is that Aquaria
who's getting painted

512
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,103
to go out to a party
in New York City.

513
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,839
And this,
this is the Aquaria

514
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,342
who's like, oh, you're
gonna need a couple drinks

515
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,643
before you talk to people

516
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,845
because you're, you know,
too shy and too nervous.

517
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,148
- But that's kind of
a sort of sanitized voice.

518
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:46,285
That voice has got to be darker
than that, isn't it?

519
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:50,322
Isn't it saying, you think
you're something, don't you?

520
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,992
- I think this is like
such a vicious design.

521
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,727
- Yeah, I see it.
It is that.

522
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,895
But hear what I'm saying.

523
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,698
Try to evoke what
that darkness is in you.

524
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,569
- Aquaria seems very wrapped
around what she wants to wear.

525
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,072
That's going to be great,

526
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,574
but I don't know
if she completely grasps

527
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,177
the concept of this challenge.

528
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,945
- Tell me about your saboteur.

529
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,580
What does that voice say to you?

530
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,216
- I can be a little tight.

531
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,551
- Ooh, girl.

532
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,552
- And high strung at times.

533
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,920
- Okay, sis.

534
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,758
- And I think my saboteur
oftentimes is...

535
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,827
I kind of hold myself back

536
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:31,297
from doing things that are
out of my normal comfort zone.

537
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,298
- You know, let me tell you

538
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,899
what I think
your saboteur is, okay?

539
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,434
Every time
I come and talk to you,

540
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,370
you get a little tongue-tied,
you know.

541
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,107
And I think you think
I'm gonna say... [gasps]

542
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,741
you're a fraud.

543
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,078
You don't belong here.

544
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,114
- Mm-hmm.
- Listen, I know that feeling.

545
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,582
I felt it when I was 21.

546
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,916
I felt it. I know.

547
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,552
But, you know, what you say
to that saboteur is

548
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,387
thanks for sharing.

549
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,756
I hear you. Thanks for sharing.

550
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,161
You err on the side
of fashion and style, you know,

551
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,363
but do convey that darkness.

552
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:08,768
The saboteur, the ego
really wants to kill you.

553
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,570
I want to see
that you understand

554
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,039
who your saboteur is.

555
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,042
- I am nervous
to come to terms with

556
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,578
all these negative truths
about myself.

557
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,613
- All right,
I'll see you out there.

558
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,714
- Thank you, RuPaul.

559
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,683
But if I'm about
to try to win a crown

560
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,051
and be America's
next drag superstar,

561
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,088
I need to find a way
to dig out that inner saboteur

562
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,956
and throw her out on the runway.

563
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,162
- Hey, Cracker.
- Hey, Ru.

564
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,163
- You finally cracked the code.

565
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,197
- I did.

566
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,866
- You finally won a challenge.

567
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,067
- Oh, gosh.

568
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,905
- Are you making costumes
for your saboteur from scratch?

569
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,207
- Yeah. I have one
that I like a lot.

570
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,876
It's this kind of
happy princess,

571
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,877
which is me
when I'm feeling great.

572
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,079
And then there's the other side.

573
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,916
So I'll use a very similar
silhouette with drapy sleeves,

574
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,952
but a much more vampire
feel to it

575
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,954
'cause she's literally
sucking the life out of me.

576
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:04,723
- Mm.
- My lady friends here,

577
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,326
we talked about
some of our flaws,

578
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,827
and over-explaining
is one of them.

579
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,197
- Ahh.
- I want to say it,

580
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,199
re-say it,
make sure it's perfect,

581
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:14,166
say it again.

582
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,835
- So you don't want other people

583
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,437
to have their own
opinion of you.

584
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,340
You want to produce
their opinion of you.

585
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,342
- Uh-huh.
And if I just keep talking,

586
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,945
you can't develop an opinion

587
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,112
that's not something
under my control.

588
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,681
- Have you ever heard me say

589
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,517
what other people think of me
is none of my damn business?

590
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,119
This is when you realize,
you know what?

591
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,722
I don't have time in my life

592
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,524
to shape how other people
see me, you know.

593
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,726
I'm too busy living my life.

594
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,928
- It's funny, because for me,
I feel like my saboteur

595
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,030
is someone that was
helpful to me at one time.

596
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,765
It was someone that said,

597
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,200
push harder, push harder,
push harder.

598
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,035
- Sure.
- But there was a crossover.

599
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,938
So now
it's that crossover person

600
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,773
that never shuts up.

601
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,575
- But it's about a balance.

602
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,078
And if you're able
to have a perspective,

603
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,714
if you could see both
at the same time,

604
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,848
then you can regulate

605
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,783
how much you need
at any one time.

606
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,620
'Cause, listen, the ego
can be very important to you,

607
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,054
and it can propel you forward.
- Yeah.

608
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,155
- Just not too much.

609
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,024
You can look.
Just don't stare.

610
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:15,094
- The hardest part
of this challenge

611
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:19,331
is letting go of control
and opening up.

612
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:22,935
I've been through
so much in my life.

613
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,938
I'm still learning...

614
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:28,107
to trust people.

615
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,143
When Ru asks me to open up
and be vulnerable,

616
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,045
I really want to do it

617
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:35,648
because I want this so bad.

618
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,152
- Kameron.
- Hello.

619
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,554
- Bitch, you were in the bottom
twice in a row.

620
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,889
- I was.

621
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,091
- Well, how you gonna
stay out of the bottom?

622
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,094
- I'm excited to do
some more extravagant looks.

623
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,830
- Are you making everything
we see on the runway?

624
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,867
- I have some pieces
that I haven't used yet

625
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,035
that I might put together.

626
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,403
I have these really cool horns

627
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,271
that I think
may be my "sabotwah."

628
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,373
- There's a spear there.

629
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,776
What you gonna do
with that spear?

630
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,778
- My "sabotwah" is--
- Saboteur?

631
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,714
[both laugh]

632
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,383
- "Sabotoir", saboteur.

633
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,953
"Sabotwah." I'm gonna
keep saying it that way.

634
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:19,158
- Have you been able
to open up in the workroom?

635
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,026
Are you friends with anybody?
- I am.

636
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,661
I don't think I've really had

637
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,930
any true conflict
with anybody.

638
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,432
I think that's because
I'm so shy

639
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,534
that I haven't
stepped out of my comfort zone

640
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:30,602
to have any problems
with anyone.

641
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,604
- I'm not buying it.

642
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:33,939
If you don't have
anything nice to say,

643
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,507
don't say anything at all,

644
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,809
and that's probably why
Kameron don't talk.

645
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,944
All she has
is nasty things to say.

646
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,145
No, I'm just playing.

647
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,481
- What do you think shyness is?

648
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,216
What is that about?

649
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,985
- I don't know. I think it just
stems back to my childhood

650
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,189
of, you know, being reserved
was a safe place for me.

651
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:53,092
And I think that's carried over
into my adult life

652
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,361
is that if I'm shy,
I'm not too exposed.

653
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,663
Maybe not enough people
will notice me

654
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,198
and I'll get to hide
a little bit

655
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:01,200
and that being exposed,
being vulnerable won't happen.

656
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,001
- That's interesting, though.

657
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,337
Some would say that being shy

658
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,941
is a way for the ego
to actually pull more attention

659
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:11,210
because you're not
saying something.

660
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,945
Showing your saboteur
is an opportunity

661
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,214
to sort of read yourself
and have fun.

662
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,015
- Yeah.
- How would you read yourself?

663
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,884
- That bitch
has a faceful of Voluma

664
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,052
and she had her lips done

665
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,720
and she thinks she's so pretty,

666
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,989
but is that really gonna
help her at the end of the day?

667
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,424
- Uh-huh.

668
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,593
Is that as deep
as you're gonna go?

669
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,927
- Um...

670
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,865
- Kameron's biggest weakness
is lack of connection

671
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,135
and just the fact that she
doesn't really talk to anybody.

672
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,605
I don't think
she has the depth

673
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,840
to be America's
next drag superstar.

674
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,377
- All right,
gather round, ladies.

675
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,346
Ladies, gather round.

676
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:53,018
- Oh. Gather round, ladies.
Gather round.

677
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,219
[all laugh]

678
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,990
- Oh, my God.
It's my evil twin RudePaul.

679
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,492
You think you're something,
don't you?

680
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,693
- Yeah. Heh heh.

681
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,130
I don't care
who you think you is, RuPaul.

682
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,034
- You get out of here
before I kick your ass.

683
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,870
Leave the way you came in:

684
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,539
through the door!

685
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,107
[cheers and applause]

686
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,608
- Back door my ass.

687
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,177
You ain't seen nothing yet.

688
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,711
Bitch, you know.
I'll key your car.

689
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,548
Your car is keyed, bitch.

690
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,082
- Bye, bitch.
- Get out of here.

691
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,318
- Girl, what just happened?

692
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,886
- I'm so sorry about that,
ladies.

693
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,354
- Understandable.

694
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,989
- Tomorrow on the main stage,

695
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,827
we'll be joined by our
extra special guest judges...

696
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:36,995
Ashanti.

697
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,598
[screaming and cheering]

698
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,001
And the creator and star
of HBO's "Girls,"

699
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,103
Lena Dunham will be here.

700
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,973
[cheers and applause]

701
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:51,343
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

702
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,680
Now I got some ass
I need to go kick.

703
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,714
- Beat it!

704
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,116
- Yes!

705
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,087
- I am Asia O'Hara's evil twin
North Korea.

706
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,289
- She's really
a disgusting fat whale

707
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,859
that only makes jokes
about food and her size.

708
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:10,662
- My destructive power
is growing and growing.

709
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,299
- Wow.

710
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,300
You all right, Aquaria?

711
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,668
- Someone needs
anger management.

712
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,538
- I need therapy.
[all laugh]

713
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,879
- Did you already
cut your patterns out?

714
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,080
- Kind of.

715
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,094
- Miz Cracker
is having a mental breakdown

716
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,496
over a sewing machine.

717
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,967
We're top five, and girl,
you're a drag queen.

718
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,670
A sewing machine should not have
have that much power over you.

719
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,138
- Okay, I'm stopping this.

720
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,641
I have my prehistoric garment.

721
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,143
She looks dirty, she looks mean.

722
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,344
What do you think?

723
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,812
- This is the problem
that I had earlier.

724
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,247
My self saboteur,

725
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,949
the whole point
of this fucking challenge,

726
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,817
was telling me
that if I didn't make

727
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:08,053
a brand new creation
from scratch

728
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,455
that I was being lazy and
I wasn't doing this challenge.

729
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,623
That is not the challenge.

730
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,960
The challenge is
to style from your wardrobe

731
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,862
to make this happen.

732
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,932
And the biggest challenge is
making your message come across,

733
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,967
your recording, the looks,

734
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,435
you know, acting it out
during the runway, et cetera.

735
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,570
You see what I'm saying?

736
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,971
So we're overthinking it.

737
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,873
I had to literally tell myself,

738
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,207
okay, I have this, this,
and this.

739
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,311
I can alter these,
make this work, and do this.

740
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,478
You see what I'm saying?

741
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,780
So that's what
you need to do right now.

742
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,250
It's a styling challenge,
not a sewing challenge.

743
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,886
- Everyone else
is going to bring

744
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,120
their inner saboteur
to the runway.

745
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,023
I'm already sitting with mine.

746
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:49,127
I feel fucked.

747
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,268
- Oh, top five, good morning.

748
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,769
- Gonna nail it.

749
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,771
- I'm ready to be good and evil.

750
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,973
- Rise and shine, bitches.

751
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,908
The top four
is going to be decided today,

752
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,078
and I swear to God
if I don't make it,

753
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,281
my inner saboteur
might have its way.

754
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,786
- You made this all
for this challenge?

755
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:15,887
- This one I made all here.

756
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,857
- Girl, what a migraine.
I do not envy you.

757
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,293
- Well, I did not get
much sleep last night.

758
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,661
- Me, neither, girl.

759
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,029
I was listening
to this lip sync,

760
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,597
because who knows what
the judges are going to say?

761
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,833
- At this point,
it's like, really?

762
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,868
Can I not be
three weeks in a row?

763
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,536
I would love for them
to like my looks

764
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:35,007
and just let me stand
on the back of the stage again

765
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,141
because I miss it.

766
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,143
I haven't been there
in forever.

767
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:42,014
- This challenge is all about
putting yourself out there

768
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,883
in the best and worst ways
possible.

769
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,519
So just knowing
that one of us

770
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,421
is going to go home

771
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:54,826
based solely on our qualities
and characteristics as a person

772
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,094
is a lot to handle right now.

773
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,362
- We're at this point
in the competition

774
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,666
where all of our thoughts
are those self doubting thoughts

775
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,100
because we do
have to double think

776
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,502
everything that we're doing.

777
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,936
- I feel like
my inner saboteur

778
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,005
is the voice of Michelle Visage.

779
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,707
- Somebody told me I don't
even have an inner saboteur.

780
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,008
It might just be
Michelle Visage.

781
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,544
- I think Michelle Visage
is nicer than my inner saboteur.

782
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,779
- Oh, definitely.
- Oh, really?

783
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:14,813
- Oh, yeah.

784
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,014
- Well, you should hear

785
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,349
what Michelle Visage says
about you when you're offstage.

786
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,017
- Tell us more, Kameron.

787
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,819
Since you don't speak,
tell us more please.

788
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,120
- I speak.

789
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,222
- One of them has to speak.
- Charades. Give us charades.

790
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,757
What you trying to say?

791
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,192
- My inner saboteur
is just...

792
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,061
You know,
you can always be better.

793
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,495
You're never gonna be the best
at anything.

794
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,265
- That's me.
Every time I like go home,

795
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,000
I like wash my face
and look in the mirror,

796
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,168
I'm like, hey, girl,

797
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,736
[deep voice]
you'll never be good enough.

798
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,004
All right, bedtime.

799
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,106
- I'm glad our inner saboteurs
have something in common.

800
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,507
- Oh, girl.

801
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,712
Right now, it's RuPaul's Conquer
Your Inner Saboteur Race.

802
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,013
Kameron and I are neck and neck,

803
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,382
trying to defeat ourselves

804
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,184
so that we can
get to the challenge.

805
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,254
- Do any of you
feel like you have gotten

806
00:30:56,254 --> 00:31:00,058
less confident as a boy
since you started doing drag?

807
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,495
- Sure, because I'm
overconfident as Aquaria.

808
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,696
- Yeah.

809
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,531
- It's like what
I was talking about earlier

810
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,702
where it's like if you don't
take care of yourself,

811
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:15,507
'cause I'm too busy like...
using drag as a distraction.

812
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,976
- Yeah, and it's hard
not to feel

813
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:22,047
less confident as a boy
with relationships

814
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,616
when everyone has
such a high respect

815
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,885
for Eureka your character.
- Right.

816
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,520
- And like even when
you try to date,

817
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,156
they're such fans
of that character,

818
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:34,092
that it makes you feel less than
when you're not the character.

819
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,093
You know what I mean?

820
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,661
- Yeah.
- What about you, Kam?

821
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,896
- Well, I was doing drag

822
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,065
long before I ever
found confidence as a boy.

823
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,167
I was doing drag
when I was young,

824
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:44,202
so drag gave me confidence
back then.

825
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,271
And then I found
my confidence as a boy

826
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,507
once I started going to the gym
and working out

827
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,741
and being healthy.

828
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,245
- Girl, a healthy body
will help you so good.

829
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,113
- Oh, I don't know about that.

830
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,248
- It's like peeing clear.

831
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,049
If peeing clear feels good,

832
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,618
imagine like
everything feels good.

833
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,852
- Yeah.

834
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,521
- Peeing clear?
- What?

835
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,489
- You said peeing clear
feels good?

836
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,525
- Yeah, Oh, don't tell me y'all
don't cheer when you pee clear.

837
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,462
If you pee clear, cheer.

838
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,430
- Cheer when you pee clear?

839
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,431
Am I supposed to be
peeing clear?

840
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,700
I pee like Red Bull.

841
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,036
[all laugh]
That's not a joke.

842
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:21,973
- Yo.

843
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,050
[RuPaul laughs]

844
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:38,390
- ♪ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ♪

845
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,060
♪ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ♪

846
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,262
[applause]

847
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,831
- Yes.

848
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:48,466
- Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

849
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,970
My evil twin Michelle Visage.

850
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,940
- Baby, I'm the Serena
to your Samantha.

851
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,174
- [laughs]

852
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,944
Style superstar Carson Kressley.

853
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,212
Are you dark sided?

854
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,580
- No, I have
a little astigmatism

855
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,881
just in the right eye,

856
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,983
but I use the good one
and I'll be fine.

857
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:05,984
- [laughs]

858
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,988
And the gorgeous Grammy winning
Ashanti is here.

859
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,790
- Well, thank you so much, Ru.

860
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,025
You're slaying me
with your sequins.

861
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,427
- Thank you.

862
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,263
Actor, writer, director
Lena Dunham.

863
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,298
Now, are you ready
to meet my girls?

864
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,467
- I've never been more excited
in my life.

865
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,668
- [laughs]

866
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,770
This week
we challenged our queens

867
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,206
to conjure up their evil twins.

868
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:32,944
And on the runway,
category is Double Trouble.

869
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,614
Gentlemen, start your engines,

870
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,883
and may the best woman win.

871
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,989
First up, Kameron Michaels.

872
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,423
You know what they say.
If you stay yeti,

873
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,326
you ain't got to get yeti.

874
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,928
- I am Kameron Michaels,

875
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:53,164
and I am a fierce,
fabulous muscle queen.

876
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,700
My drag is all about
beautiful makeup

877
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,372
beautiful garments,
and the moves to back them up.

878
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,040
My style is influenced

879
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,476
by video game
and cinema heroes

880
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:05,644
and the villains.

881
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,747
Even though my evil twin
is always out to get me,

882
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:11,049
when the stage lights up,
so do I.

883
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,219
And the light always
overtakes the darkness.

884
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,288
[thunder]

885
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:19,858
I'm Kameron Michaels evil twin
Katrina Michaels.

886
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,026
Peace!
[Michelle laughs]

887
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:24,329
- Kameron Michaels
thinks she's so pretty,

888
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:26,264
but come on,
she's really two-faced,

889
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,601
and both of them
are busted and ugly.

890
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,603
If Kameron Michaels
expects to become

891
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:33,939
America's next drag superstar,

892
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,675
she better wake up
and smell the poppers,

893
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:37,976
because face it.

894
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,878
When people hear
Kameron Michaels,

895
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,646
they think dude in a dress.

896
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,015
[all laugh]

897
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,650
- Eureka.

898
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,118
- I'm Eureka,

899
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:51,022
and I am a be yourself
to free yourself kind of queen.

900
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,758
I like family time, laughing,

901
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,094
and all you can eat buffets.

902
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,096
I'm the life of the party.

903
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,097
My drag is all about

904
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,032
representing
the plus size community

905
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,269
with strength, confidence,
and beauty.

906
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,971
Growing up was hard for me,

907
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,107
but I've always fought
through difficulties in life

908
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,809
with a smile,

909
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,878
and I just wanna teach others
how to do the same.

910
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,614
[thunder]

911
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,883
- I'm Eureka's evil twin
Eufilthior.

912
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,720
Eureka thinks
she's beautiful and funny,

913
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,921
but come on.

914
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:25,023
She's really
a disgusting fat whale

915
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:28,093
that only makes jokes
about food and her size.

916
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,629
Face it.
When people hear Eureka,

917
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,364
they think, oh, my God!

918
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,532
She's gonna dominate
the conversation

919
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,035
and simply annoy everyone

920
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:40,605
with her desperate need
for acceptance.

921
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,041
Hey, Eureka,
you come from nothing,

922
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,310
and you ain't never
gonna be nothing.

923
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,746
Apply for disability
and food stamps

924
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,247
and give up already.

925
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,383
- What a filthy whore.

926
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,084
[all laugh]

927
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,386
Miz Cracker.

928
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:58,189
- I'm Miz Cracker,
and I'm the queen of comedy.

929
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,058
I like the beats at the bar,

930
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,559
the boys on the block,

931
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,263
and a nice, big, uncut...
lace front.

932
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:09,234
My style is influenced
by everything from sci-fi flicks

933
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,202
to the Paris runways.

934
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,071
She's so worldly.

935
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,073
When people hear Miz Cracker,

936
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:18,309
they think, hey, she's smart.

937
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,079
But not so smart
that she can't be funny.

938
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,382
She's just one of the guys--
I mean, gals [laughs]

939
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,818
Could a guy do this?

940
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,054
[thunder]

941
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,690
- I'm Miz Cracker's evil twin
Miz Crumbs.

942
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,960
Miz Cracker thinks
she's the comedy Barbie,

943
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,961
but come on.

944
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,531
She's more like a Bratz doll,

945
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:43,268
and her so-called comedy
is just a few puns

946
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,637
that she stole
from Bob the Drag Queen.

947
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:49,040
Because face it, when people
talk about Miz Cracker,

948
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,809
they say she's a copycat

949
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,079
who faked her way to the middle.

950
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,714
As Miz Cracker's inner saboteur,

951
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,983
I have one thing to say:

952
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:04,255
she better work
on blending that jawline.

953
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,057
I mean, come on.

954
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,192
- Ladies and gentlemen, Boniva.

955
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,027
[all laugh]

956
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,462
Aquaria.

957
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:13,064
- She gave her left arm
for that top.

958
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,732
- She did.
[all laugh]

959
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,770
- I'm Aquaria,
and I'm a superstar club queen.

960
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:22,974
I am the most wonderful
and perfected version of myself.

961
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,711
My drag is all about
expanding people's perceptions

962
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:30,615
of beauty, style, and gender.

963
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,552
My style is influenced by
the runways of Paris and Milan

964
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,654
mixed with the gag-worthiness

965
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,957
of being a Club Kid spectacle.

966
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:41,326
I always remember
to shower myself

967
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:44,028
is positive self love and praise

968
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:47,532
because if not, my evil twin
will have an opportunity

969
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,768
to unleash her wrath.

970
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,871
[thunder]

971
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:56,307
- I'm Aquaria's evil twin
Sabatina.

972
00:37:56,307 --> 00:38:00,178
Aquaria thinks she's perfect,
she's beautiful.

973
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,847
She looks like Linda--
Oh, gross.

974
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,583
Face it.
When people hear Aquaria,

975
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:08,653
they think of what
a lonely, awkward,

976
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,289
and isolated diva she is.

977
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,224
I think she's starting to crack,

978
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,895
and my destructive power
is growing and growing!

979
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,464
As Aquaria's inner saboteur,

980
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,433
I have one thing to say.

981
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,969
Kill the bitch. [laughs]

982
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,772
[laughs]

983
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,542
[laughs hysterically]

984
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,443
- I knew Joan Crawford
was scary, but...

985
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,779
[all laugh]

986
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,781
- Asia O'Hara.

987
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,918
- I'm Asia O'Hara, and I like
prancing down this runway

988
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,753
blowing kisses at these judges,

989
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:45,023
and, you know, making
all the girls tremble backstage.

990
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,759
My drag is all about
being a fierce queen

991
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:48,927
with an open heart
and open mind

992
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,696
and the strength
to be a true leader.

993
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,432
My style is influenced
by America's dire need

994
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,768
for a high-glam drag superhero

995
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,003
that is aware of her community.

996
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,440
When people see me, they expect
a high energy atmosphere,

997
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,409
a dazzling evening of magic,

998
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,910
and the most beautiful costumes

999
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,880
you have ever seen
in your life, honey.

1000
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,114
[thunder]

1001
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,952
_ I am Asia O'Hara's
evil twin North Korea.

1002
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,920
Asia thinks
she's the first bitch

1003
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,922
to have the money
to go buy herself some teeth.

1004
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,023
But come on.

1005
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,859
She's really
just a middle-aged man

1006
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,261
living in a 21-year-old's
fantasy

1007
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:26,431
covered in a layer
of cheap rhinestones.

1008
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:30,702
If Asia O'Hara expects to be
America's next drag superstar,

1009
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,004
she better stop the smiles
and glitter crap

1010
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:36,941
and start being
the self-indulged, pot belly ho

1011
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,378
that everybody knows
that she is.

1012
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,348
As Asia's inner saboteur,
I have one thing to say:

1013
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:46,484
sit your old stank booty

1014
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,886
washed up pageant ass down.

1015
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,924
This is clearly
Miz Cracker's season.

1016
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,994
- I can see
her demilitarized zone.

1017
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,329
[all laugh]

1018
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,066
- Welcome, ladies...

1019
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,301
And bitches.

1020
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:09,173
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1021
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,777
First up,
good twin Kameron Michaels.

1022
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,046
- You look beautiful.
Makeup is snatched.

1023
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,015
- Thank you.

1024
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:18,149
- And you look
just like an ice princess

1025
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,518
out of a video game
exactly as you said.

1026
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,488
- Ah, nailed it.
- I love it, I love it.

1027
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:27,091
- It's beautiful.
It just seems little costumy.

1028
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,994
Takes me a little out of drag
and into Halloween.

1029
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:35,433
- Let's go to Kameron's
evil twin Katrina.

1030
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,135
- The makeup is great,
the details on this are great.

1031
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,369
And I get that
you were doing the opposites

1032
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,971
of the same kind of theme,

1033
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,607
but I would have loved
to have seen more yin and yang,

1034
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,809
like two very different looks
maybe.

1035
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,512
- I wanted to almost feel
this persona

1036
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:52,116
being more of the dark side
of the other persona.

1037
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,352
A little more evil,
a little more bad,

1038
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:55,787
a little less glam,

1039
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,256
even embracing your body
in a different way

1040
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,925
- Yeah. I wish
you'd gone in more on Kameron.

1041
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,028
'Cause I feel like, Katrina,
you were being a little nice,

1042
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:06,531
and evil is not ever nice.

1043
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,035
- Up next, Eureka.

1044
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,170
- I thought
the message was awesome.

1045
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,939
You know, just love yourself,
you know, be confident.

1046
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,542
- The minute you said
be yourself to free yourself,

1047
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,210
I was just like...

1048
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,512
And you really had a fun,

1049
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,449
self-effacing, playful energy

1050
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,085
that just made sense to me
as another woman

1051
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,921
who maybe doesn't necessarily
feel like my body always fits in

1052
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,622
in the industry
that I've chosen.

1053
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,924
- You're always naked.

1054
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,259
- That's a great point.
[Michelle laughs]

1055
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,363
I don't know who's
making me do it. Thank you.

1056
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:42,133
- Let's go to Eureka's
evil twin Eufilthior.

1057
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,768
- I really appreciate this look.

1058
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,037
I thought that there was
a real yin to your yang.

1059
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,940
I liked that you tied
the two plaids together.

1060
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,377
- The frown has been on
since you walked out, honey.

1061
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,812
The cigarette.
I don't want to mess with you.

1062
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,181
- You are a fucking great actor.

1063
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,618
Every moment
you've been out on this stage

1064
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,953
in both personas,

1065
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,089
you have been giving me
real nuance,

1066
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,657
up, down, all around.

1067
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,359
My mind is blown.

1068
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:12,029
- In your voiceover,
you really hit those things

1069
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,599
that may have been things
that you hear in your own head,

1070
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,502
maybe they were insults
that people have thrown to you,

1071
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:18,770
but you owned them.

1072
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,106
And both performances
were very confident.

1073
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,941
- [deep voice] Thank you.
- Thank you.

1074
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,877
- You're welcome.

1075
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,746
- Up next, Miz Cracker.

1076
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,114
- Hello, Ru.

1077
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,783
- I'm losing my head
over this look.

1078
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,418
It's so good.

1079
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:36,053
- There's just like
a Marie Antoinette

1080
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,455
by way of Sofia Coppola,

1081
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,657
and it also feels like something

1082
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,125
that Mariah Carey would
casually wear in her home.

1083
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,128
[all laugh]

1084
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,931
- I like your swag
just going across the stage.

1085
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,467
Super animated, you know.

1086
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,002
I was watching you
like character.

1087
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:52,537
- Thank you.

1088
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:57,675
- And now Miz Cracker's
evil twin, Miz Crumbs.

1089
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,878
- This look didn't quite match
your good twin.

1090
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,082
This felt a little more
Halloween store to me.

1091
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:10,087
- Your voiceover
didn't come across as evil,

1092
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,423
and I think that lends
to how much of you

1093
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,126
you're allowing us to see,
and I don't know

1094
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:18,162
if you're protecting yourself
from Miz Cracker,

1095
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,697
but I think a part of you is

1096
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,100
because you didn't go in
very much at all.

1097
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,472
- Up next, Aquaria.

1098
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:28,940
- Oh, my gosh.
You look like

1099
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,309
you are on the way
to a shoot for "Vogue."

1100
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,445
I think you just exude
sexiness and passion.

1101
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,746
Even how you're standing
right now,

1102
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,082
your stance
is very like, I'm here.

1103
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,251
- Makeup spectacular.

1104
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,886
I love the color combination.

1105
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:44,121
I love the one shoulder.

1106
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,757
I mean, the tuck
is just like unbelievable.

1107
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,527
That is like a thin little slice
of beef capaccio.

1108
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:52,163
The whole look,
really phenomenal.

1109
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,164
- Thank you.

1110
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,499
And your good girl dialogue,

1111
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,833
it was just very clear

1112
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,202
you're about beauty, style,
gender bending,

1113
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,071
and it was delivered
very nicely.

1114
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:05,276
- Let's go to Aquaria's
evil twin Sabatina.

1115
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,478
- When you came out with
the bloody gloves and the apron,

1116
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,715
I feel like
it was super creative.

1117
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,450
- And I really thought
your acting

1118
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,386
as the evil twin
was even stronger.

1119
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,088
- I believed
that you killed the bitch.

1120
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,925
- I love the combination
of like a cheetah

1121
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:22,927
with an ocelot print.

1122
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,028
It is an iconic fashion moment.

1123
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,931
- And then I liked
the exposed bones.

1124
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,100
It's weird and it's editorial,

1125
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,801
and a really great contrast

1126
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,304
from that super pretty
feminine pastel

1127
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:34,872
to this literally killer look.

1128
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,476
- Up next, Asia O'Hara.

1129
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:39,911
- I love the orange.

1130
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:42,947
You know, it's like the orange
popsicle with the cream.

1131
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:43,948
I love how you created
with the hair,

1132
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,284
and I would love
to borrow those tights.

1133
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,753
- You can take 'em tonight,
sweetheart.

1134
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,122
- Your response
to your negative self

1135
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:52,590
was just so good.

1136
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,458
You were just like,
What? No. Oh, me?

1137
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,794
Your acting
was just really, really great.

1138
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,162
It was one of my
favorite performances

1139
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,298
of the entire runway.

1140
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,933
- I don't think
you needed the balloons.

1141
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:04,468
I felt like they were
just a last minute thought.

1142
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:08,873
- All right. Here's
Asia O'Hara's evil twin

1143
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,207
North Korea.

1144
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,210
- This is definitely
the most dramatic transformation

1145
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,245
of the evening,

1146
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,948
and I buy every minute
of this.

1147
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,984
It's dark. You could see evil
on your face

1148
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:22,086
from the minute you came out,

1149
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,255
and the balloon deflated
to those shrunken balloon heads,

1150
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,123
I didn't really think
you needed the balloons--

1151
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:27,692
- How do you like
the balloons now, Michelle?

1152
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:29,093
- Now I'm glad she has them.

1153
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:31,729
I can admit when I was wro--

1154
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,465
wro--wrong.

1155
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,067
[all laugh]

1156
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,869
- And I think that you had
the funniest punchline.

1157
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,539
That washed up
spanky booty behind.

1158
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:44,775
Honey, she wasn't ready
for that.

1159
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,912
- Yeah, your voiceover
more than anybody else's

1160
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,247
just seemed like you were
talking and describing yourself.

1161
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,284
It was just very authentic
and very natural.

1162
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,952
Everything about
your performance tonight.

1163
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:55,987
was effortless.

1164
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:02,627
- Ladies, I have
an evil question.

1165
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:09,867
- Ladies, I'd like
a moment alone

1166
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,736
with the evil twins.

1167
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:17,375
Good twins,
you may leave the stage.

1168
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:30,421
Now I have an evil question.

1169
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,724
Excluding your good twin,

1170
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,294
who should go home tonight
and why?

1171
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:39,397
Katrina Michaels.

1172
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:43,567
- I think that
all of these girls are strong,

1173
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,303
so I'm going to say my biggest
competitor should go home,

1174
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,073
and that is Aquaria.

1175
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:49,907
- Eufilthior.

1176
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,275
- I say
send all the bitches home.

1177
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,576
You got the winner right here.

1178
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:53,878
- [chuckles]

1179
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:56,981
- If I was gonna pick one,
I would go on critiques,

1180
00:46:56,981 --> 00:47:00,017
and as far as the worst,
I think it was Miz Cracker.

1181
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,887
- Miz Crumbs.

1182
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,088
- Based on critique,

1183
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:07,024
Cracker and Kameron
are in the bottom.

1184
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:08,626
I have a bias.

1185
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,061
Kameron should go home.

1186
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:12,963
- Sabatina.

1187
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,466
- Frankly, Ru, I don't give
a fuck about your critiques.

1188
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,002
But I wasn't obsessed
with the looks tonight,

1189
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:21,806
and I think this might be
Kameron's final hurrah.

1190
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:23,841
- And North Korea.

1191
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,510
- I am not going to decorate it
with pretty words,

1192
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,145
and I'm also not going
to send someone home

1193
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,181
because they're my competition.

1194
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,749
If the bitch is my competition,
let her stay here.

1195
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:35,052
The person that I do not think
is a star in this lineup

1196
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,355
is Miz Cracker or Miz Crumbs.

1197
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,726
- Thank you for your honesty.

1198
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:42,960
- You're welcome.

1199
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,062
- I think we've heard enough.

1200
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,865
While you untuck backstage,

1201
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,401
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1202
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:54,739
Now, just between us girls,

1203
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,275
what do you think,
starting with Kameron Michaels?

1204
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,878
- Kameron Michaels
always has a bead face.

1205
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,247
She always pays attention
to detail.

1206
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,382
She never comes out here
half-assed.

1207
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,818
But the outfits
were the same exact outfits.

1208
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,754
They were just
different materials.

1209
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:13,424
And I get that she was going
for the identical evil twin,

1210
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,359
but to me,
it was just like costumey

1211
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,560
and like, eh.

1212
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,561
You could have bought it
somewhere.

1213
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,896
It didn't look original.

1214
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,964
- Yeah, it almost feels like

1215
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:21,265
we're not seeing
like the real Kameron.

1216
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:24,935
We're seeing just more costume
than we are the person.

1217
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,437
- I don't feel
Kameron is giving me

1218
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:27,972
what I need performance-wise

1219
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:32,643
to really feel
like I'm seeing beyond

1220
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,745
this ability
to create glamour.

1221
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,881
- There hasn't been
a lot of openness,

1222
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,216
and we've been pushing
and pushing Kameron

1223
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:41,752
to go deeper and to reveal.

1224
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,320
I didn't find out
anything new about her.

1225
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,923
And it's not until
you go really deep

1226
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:46,991
that the audience
has an opportunity

1227
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:48,025
to fall in love with you.

1228
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:48,959
- Of course.
- You know?

1229
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,961
Until you reveal something
really honest,

1230
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,030
and she just doesn't do that.

1231
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,999
Eureka.

1232
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:56,333
- For me it worked.

1233
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,936
She embraced herself obviously
on the good twin,

1234
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,038
and she kind of
came off like a bully

1235
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,072
with her other twin.

1236
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,475
- I agree. Eureka really
understood the assignment.

1237
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,911
She went embarrassingly deep,

1238
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,047
which is really what
this challenge was all about.

1239
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,749
- Though I didn't love
the outfits.

1240
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,150
- I actually liked
the two looks.

1241
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,385
I liked the two film references.

1242
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,855
One a very pure, innocent Cher
in "Clueless,"

1243
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:22,726
and then one very dark,
bawdy, naughty Divine reference.

1244
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,028
- Did I think
that the two looks

1245
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:27,631
were the most creative fashion
thing I've ever seen in my life?

1246
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,601
No. Did I think
that her performance

1247
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,103
had power and passion
through the entire thing?

1248
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:36,440
Yes, and I loved that
she's doing this a different way

1249
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,775
and she's doing it her way.

1250
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:39,977
- Miz Cracker.

1251
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,045
- I'm a huge Miz Cracker fan,

1252
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,614
and tonight, that first look
was so beautiful.

1253
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:46,817
And then her evil twin,
she just lost me.

1254
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,453
- I just didn't get it. For me,
there wasn't a through line.

1255
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,988
There just wasn't
any meat there.

1256
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,990
There was no meat on the bone.
- No.

1257
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,793
- The voiceover
didn't give us anything, really.

1258
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:59,096
It felt kind of surface
like she was afraid to go deeper

1259
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,998
because she doesn't want us
to expose her.

1260
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,467
- But what I could tell
about Miz Cracker

1261
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,769
was that she was an intellectual

1262
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:08,839
working a smart odd girl angle.

1263
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,008
And when I watch the show,

1264
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,243
I'm gonna be
very, very, very intrigued

1265
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:15,279
to see where this person
is going.

1266
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,747
- No, you're absolutely
right on.

1267
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:19,049
She is all of the things
that you said,

1268
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,651
but throughout this competition,

1269
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:24,788
I have pushed her
to not produce herself.

1270
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,024
And this challenge
was an opportunity

1271
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,828
for Miz Cracker
to come out of her box

1272
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:34,765
and let us have a taste
of that crunch.

1273
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,034
She didn't do that for me.

1274
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,837
I feel like I need to say,
wake the fuck up.

1275
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,039
This challenge
was built for you.

1276
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,140
- She's too interested
in being a puppet master.

1277
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,509
- And she's too interested
in trying to control

1278
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:47,144
how we see her.

1279
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,812
It's like let it
all hang out, bitch.

1280
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:49,980
- She can't.

1281
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,849
- Aquaria.

1282
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:52,983
- Fashion indeed,
and fashion she is.

1283
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,818
She came out here tonight
and delivered us

1284
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,987
a two sucker punch
with both looks.

1285
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,989
- There was
a great through line

1286
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,624
and a very beautiful
presentation

1287
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,661
of this couture look
done like a confection,

1288
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,029
and then done deadly.

1289
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:07,932
- And her evil twin
really revealed

1290
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,467
that she feels she can't
relate to other people.

1291
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,835
That was a window

1292
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,705
into why presentation
is so important to her,

1293
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,874
because it's kind of the
only way that she can connect.

1294
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:20,444
- Now, understanding what
the yin to your yang was,

1295
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,612
it didn't have the depth

1296
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,948
of someone who was
10 years older than her

1297
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:25,049
or even five years older
than her,

1298
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:26,951
but I think that comes in time.

1299
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,886
You know, in 10 seasons
of doing this show,

1300
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:31,755
a lot of fierce queens
have walked down this runway.

1301
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,856
You talk about Violet Chachki,

1302
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,993
you talk about
Chad Michaels, Raja.

1303
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:38,829
This is in the top 10 outfits

1304
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,798
I've ever seen
walk down this runway.

1305
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,534
- For sure.
- That animal print,

1306
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,970
that silhouette,
and then that color combination?

1307
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,706
Oh, my goodness.
I was gobsmacked.

1308
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,441
Asia O'Hara.

1309
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,010
- Y'all, when Asia came out,
I was like, oh, yay.

1310
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,979
Another spangled bodysuit.

1311
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,814
- I have to echo what you said,

1312
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:59,049
but I'm going to say, oh, yay!
Another sparkly bodysuit!

1313
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:02,419
Because everything about
that good girl was great,

1314
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,887
and then I just thought

1315
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,622
she was really
like honest and authentic

1316
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,957
in both of her voiceovers.

1317
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,527
- I will say she had
the best dark side tonight.

1318
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,962
Her evil twin was evil.

1319
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,098
Her evil twin looked dark.

1320
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,700
Her evil twin was fully there
and committed

1321
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,603
from the moment she walked out
and let that balloon go.

1322
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,405
And for Asia,
that's the opposite, you know.

1323
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,575
We see this beautiful smile
and the bubbly pageant girl.

1324
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:26,210
This was a reach for her,

1325
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,045
and she scored.

1326
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:30,981
- Honey, Miss Asia, North Korea

1327
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,951
let that black rage out,
and it was scurry.

1328
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:34,952
- Yes, I relate.

1329
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:36,120
- [laughs]

1330
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,354
- Same.

1331
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,024
[all laugh]

1332
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,460
- Silence!
I've made my decision.

1333
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:47,197
Bring back my girls.

1334
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,200
No seriously.
Lena...bring back "Girls."

1335
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,970
- Only if you agree
to be the fifth girl.

1336
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:53,971
- I could surely try.

1337
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:56,707
- Welcome back, ladies.

1338
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:58,275
I've made some decisions.

1339
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,545
Oh, and by the way,

1340
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,648
your good twins
are watching this backstage.

1341
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:08,318
- She looks like
that Season 8 promo, girl.

1342
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,689
- Kameron Michaels,
you and your "sabotwah"

1343
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,426
were not a twinning combination.

1344
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,098
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1345
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,769
- Oh, no.

1346
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,071
- Eureka.

1347
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:29,473
Your split personalities

1348
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:31,942
were a Divine pairing.

1349
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:34,912
You're safe.

1350
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,048
- Eureka's gonna be
so happy about this.

1351
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,817
Goddamn it.

1352
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,385
- Oh, thank God.

1353
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,921
- You may step
to the back of the stage.

1354
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,526
Asia O'Hara.

1355
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:53,997
This week, you made us root
for North Korea.

1356
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,167
Damn you!

1357
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,937
You're safe.

1358
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,738
- Called it.

1359
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,040
- Oh, wow.

1360
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,375
- You may step
to the back of the stage.

1361
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,810
- Thank you.

1362
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:09,847
- Aquaria.

1363
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:14,718
You make evil look good.

1364
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:15,986
Con-drag-ulations.

1365
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,221
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1366
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,056
[applause]

1367
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:21,925
[cheering]
- Oh, my gosh!

1368
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,027
- They like me
more than I like myself.

1369
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,863
- You've won a trip for two

1370
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:29,133
to the fabulous
Grand Resort and Spa

1371
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:31,034
in Fort Lauderdale

1372
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:35,405
and two sets of Raden luggage.

1373
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,040
- Thank you so much.

1374
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,644
Winning this is
so much more meaningful to me

1375
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:43,280
just because of what
I've learned about myself

1376
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,048
from this challenge.

1377
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,884
So thank you for giving us
all this opportunity.

1378
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:48,085
- Thank you.

1379
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,653
You may join the other girls.

1380
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:56,994
Miz Cracker.

1381
00:54:56,994 --> 00:55:00,063
The judges ate up
Marie Antoinette,

1382
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,866
but Miz Crumbs
did not take the cake.

1383
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:08,172
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1384
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:09,740
- I understand.

1385
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,579
- Two queens stand before me.

1386
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:20,984
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1387
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:25,255
and save yourself
