And, honey, it ain't over yet.

186
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:55,769
Aquaria, Asia O'Hara, Eureka
and Kameron Michaels,

187
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,138
you've made Mama Ru very proud.

188
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,807
Are you bitches ready
to lip sync for the crown?

189
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,410
[cheers and applause]

190
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,779
One by one, you'll battle.

191
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,014
And in the end, only one of you

192
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,750
will be crowned America's
Next Drag Superstar.

193
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,452
But before we get started,

194
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,255
I want to take a moment
to celebrate each of you.

195
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,591
First up, turning looks,
stunting pretty,

196
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,760
she's the bitch
from New York City.

197
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,028
Take a look.

198
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,098
- My name is Aquaria,
and I am a superstar.

199
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm here to prove to people

200
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,436
that I actually do have the
chops that I say that I have.

201
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,038
I went with
Russia hooker urine.

202
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,406
[all laugh]

203
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,608
I can walk on this runway
in a diaper

204
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,512
and they would eat me up.

205
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:43,049
- Every week, you brought
amazing looks to the runway.

206
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,652
- It is an iconic
fashion moment.

207
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,387
- ♪ Turning looks,
stunting pretty ♪

208
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,756
♪ I'm the bitch
from New York City ♪

209
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,858
[cheers and applause]

210
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,693
- Hi, Aquaria.

211
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,162
- Hi, RuPaul. How are you?

212
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,599
- Now, you were never
in the bottom two.

213
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,268
- I'm not really into bottoming
as far as I know now.

214
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,839
But I am not necessarily
opposed to trying

215
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,340
or at least lip syncing.

216
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,975
- Yes, of course.
Well, now what's your strategy

217
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,077
for slaying
these lip syncs tonight?

218
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,680
- I've definitely learned
what the audiences like

219
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,416
and what the fans like from me,
which is for me to be me.

220
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,618
And I think I've tickled
your fancy

221
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,621
a couple of times on purpose,
by accident, either/or.

222
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,755
So I know how to impress you.

223
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,224
I know how to impress
the audience,

224
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,160
and I'm definitely here
to steal this show

225
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,128
and hopefully a check, so...

226
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,797
- Yeah. So now,
of all the top four,

227
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,734
who is the toughest queen
to take down tonight?

228
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,202
- Definitely,
the toughest to take down

229
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,704
seems to be Asia O'Hara.

230
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,074
She has been doing this for...

231
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,711
she has been doing drag
for nearly 46 years

232
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,079
or something like that
approximately.

233
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,148
And that's not age-ist.

234
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,950
That's just knowing that
she's proven herself

235
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,220
to be someone who is
fierce freaking competition.

236
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,956
- So, now, Aquaria, tell me.

237
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,993
Who are Gina and David
Palandrani?

238
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,661
- Not their government names.

239
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,063
- Are they from Philly?
- They are from Philly.

240
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,166
They are my beautiful mother
and father, so supportive.

241
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,768
- Whoo! Whoo-whoo!

242
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,303
- Now, I know
you have a restaurant.

243
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,505
Do you serve Philly cheesesteaks
at the restaurant?

244
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,275
- Well, where we live, you don't
call it a Philly cheesesteak.

245
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,609
- Oh, what do you call it?

246
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:20,013
- A cheesesteak.
- Oh.

247
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,915
[audience laughs]
- That's true.

248
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:25,285
- Mama Aquaria,
a little birdie told me

249
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,520
that you have a history
with one of our judges.

250
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,122
Actually, we have a photo

251
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,890
of your meeting
with one of our judges.

252
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,260
There you are.

253
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,529
- It's all coming back to me.

254
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,164
- What was the event
that you were at?

255
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,399
- Oh, "The Nutcracker."

256
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,935
- Was your Giovanni
in "The Nutcracker?"

257
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,703
- Yes, he was
The Nutcracker and--

258
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,538
- Oh! Giovanni
was The Nutcracker?

259
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,240
- Yes, he was,

260
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,443
and he had been cracking nuts
for a number of years.

261
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,079
[audience laughs]

262
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,381
- Aquaria, you should be
very proud that you have parents

263
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,649
who have supported you

264
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,186
from being The Nutcracker
to being a nut packer.

265
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:03,022
- [laughs]

266
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,658
- When we come back,
more with Aquaria.

267
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,427
- ♪ Hey, kitty girl ♪

268
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,062

272
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,809
- Hey, RuPaul. I have to say
what an accomplishment,

273
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:28,481
and what "Drag Race's" influence
has been on our pop culture.

274
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,049
It's played such a role

275
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,720
in fostering a global message
of inclusion

276
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,955
and accepting individuals

277
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,491
for just being
their authentic selves.

278
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,462
And you and your show
have made that happen

279
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,031
in a way bigger
than anybody could imagine.

280
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:49,636
So congratulations to you all.

281
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,538
Thank you
for letting us all to see

282
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,408
that we're all
just humans in drag.

283
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,745
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my God.

284
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,114
Oprah! We love Oprah!

285
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,518
Oprah! [laughs]

286
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,286
Thank you, Oprah!

287
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,822
Okay, now we've got
some fan questions.

288
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,592
Let's go to the audience
and hear what they have to say.

289
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,662
First up is Jaymes Mansfield.

290
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:19,098
- Hi, Aquaria.

291
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,334
- Hey, shape shifter!

292
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,636
- Aquaria,
Ari from New York says,

293
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,872
I loved your Melania
in the Snatch Game.

294
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:28,141
How would you
make America great again?

295
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,744
Like truly great
and not just great for some?

296
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,814
- Facts are facts, America.

297
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,284
America's not great
for all right now.

298
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,186
And for me, I think
creating opportunity

299
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,287
for people to feel included,

300
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,856
whether it's within
our own community

301
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,626
or the country as a whole,
I think is very important.

302
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,595
As Melania Trump once said,
"Any hole is a goal."

303
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,798
[all laugh]
And I think that--

304
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,767
That cannot only apply
to something humorous,

305
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,938
but also creating opportunity
and filling that opportunity.

306
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,941
[cheers and applause]
Thank you.

307
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,977
- So what would it mean to you

308
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,814
to be crowned America's
next drag superstar?

309
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:11,284
- For me, I've been a fan
of this show since it started.

310
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,819
I remember catching Season 1.

311
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:17,690
Especially Nina Flowers, I was
like I don't know what it is,

312
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,726
but I see something
about me in her.

313
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,663
Let me be a fan of this
as long as I can.

314
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,398
And to go from that position

315
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,500
to literally
being in the Final Four

316
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,537
of probably the coolest season
of "Drag Race" ever.

317
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:36,209
[cheers and applause]
Facts are facts.

318
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,543
- And, finally, Aquaria,

319
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,447
I want to thank you
for giving me my new mantra.

320
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,249
Any hole is a goal.

321
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,586
Give it up for Aquaria,
everybody!

322
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:51,290
[cheers and applause]

323
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,960
Next, a queen
who's both motherly

324
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,362
and one bad ass mama.

325
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,430
Let's take a look.

326
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,399
- Texas is back in the house.

327
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,567
My name is Asia O'Hara.

328
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,035
I'm known for doing pageants,

329
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,104
but I'm also
a versatile performer.

330
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,475
With a "Baywatch" body, even
though she got a hurricane face.

331
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,877
[both laugh]

332
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,445
- Oh, my gosh!

333
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,813
Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,948
- It's about to be
"Asia O'Hara's Drag Race."

335
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,251
I'm about to own
this whole building!

336
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,854
- You were one of the most
eye catching on the runway.

337
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,422
- You betcha!

338
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,758
♪ Her name
was etched in sorrow ♪

339
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,894
♪ But now
it's blasted in lights ♪

340
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,562
♪ She is stars and stripes
flying high ♪

341
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,835
[cheers and applause]

342
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:38,871
- Hi, Asia. How you doing?

343
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,139
- Good. How are you?

344
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,109
- So, Asia, who's rooting
for you tonight?

345
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,477
- Hopefully, the entire world,

346
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,214
but most importantly--
[cheers and applause]

347
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:50,716
But most importantly
my drag daughter Kiley

348
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,519
and my lovely boyfriend
Bret are here.

349
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,221
- So, Bret, how long
have you and Asia been together?

350
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,190
- A little over a year.

351
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,691
- So Mama Ru wants to know

352
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,493
what are your intentions
for my child here?

353
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,329
[all laugh]

354
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,031
[cheers and applause]

355
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,232
- We're going to get married.

356
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,800
- You are gonna get married?
[laughs]

357
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,902
Does he know about this?

358
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,637
- Well, he does now.

359
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,674
[all laugh]

360
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:18,878
- Now, Asia, we've got
some fan questions for you.

361
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,113
Let's see.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,

362
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,183
it's Olympian Gus Kenworthy!

363
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,352
[cheers and applause]

364
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,988
You went to the Olympics!

365
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,759
- I did.
- Wow!

366
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,494
- It's like a straighter,

367
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,797
not as fun sporty version
of "Drag Race."

368
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,832
[both laugh]

369
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,736
Asia, Andre from Birmingham died

370
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,238
during your Buttrface
challenge,

371
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:49,175
and he wants to know have you
ever been catfished online.

372
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,176
- Oh, my God.

373
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,611
- Hoo!

374
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,045
- No!

375
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,348
[all laugh]

376
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,949
Yes, I have been catfished.

377
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,286
Unfortunately, people love
to catfish drag queens.

378
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:03,122
That is like a sport now.
- Really?

379
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,892
- And luckily
I didn't bite the bait,

380
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,760
but, yeah, I have been almost.

381
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,996
- Well, thank you, Gus.
- Thank you guys.

382
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:15,735
- Now, all season you were
lifting your fellow queens up.

383
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,504
What you gonna do
to tear these bitches down?

384
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,675
[cheers and applause]

385
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,377
- I'm not looking
at this experience

386
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,379
as an opportunity
to tear bitches down.

387
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,347
I'm looking at it
as an opportunity to show

388
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,883
that I'm the best person
for what you're trying to do.

389
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,619
- Ooh, bitch! [laughs]

390
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,188
- There we go!

391
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:40,860
- Asia, your parents passed away
several years ago.

392
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,129
And in case they're watching,

393
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,064
because, you know,
they get VH-1 in heaven,

394
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,267
what would you say to them?

395
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,870
- Oh.

396
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,838
- Asia, we love you!
- Thank you.

397
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,709
[cheers and applause]

398
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,878
I would say to my mom,

399
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:02,415
thank you for being
a symbol of excellence

400
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,152
for how people should help
other people down their roads.

401
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:09,255
And I would tell my father,

402
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,791
thank you for being
such a great example

403
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,793
of what type of man I should be.

404
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,228
Because it was through
dressing up like a woman

405
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,396
I learned how to be a man.

406
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,798
- All right.

407
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,768
[cheers and applause]

408
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,840
- Work! Work! Work!

409
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,044
- Last but not least,
I have talked to my lawyers

410
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,280
and I think I owe you an apology

411
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,616
for allegedly slapping you
this season.

412
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,118
- Yes.

413
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,356
- I would like to offer you
a chance to slap me.

414
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:46,892
[cheers and applause]

415
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,929
So go ahead, Asia.
Slap the one person

416
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,131
who brought you to "Drag Race."

417
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,769
[audience laughs]

418
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,806
The one person who stands
between you and $100.000.

419
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,246
I'm ready.
You can give it to me.

420
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,515
- Um, maybe I jumped the gun.

421
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,651
Maybe I should wait
and see how tonight plays out.

422
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,253
- Okay, sure.

423
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,721
[laughs]

424
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,223
Asia, all kidding aside,

425
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,593
thank you for reminding us
that kindness is cool.

426
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,062
Give it up for Asia O'Hara!

427
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:26,999
[cheers and applause]

00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,401

433
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,613
- RuPaul, Michelle Visage,

434
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,983
this is to congratulate you
on your last 10 years.

435
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,651
It's brilliantly done,

436
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,055
and all I have to say is
shantay you stay.

437
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,123
And Finty
has to say to you...

438
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:55,428
- Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

439
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:58,731
- [laughs] Wow!

440
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,333
Welcome back to the grand finale
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

441
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,902
And thank you both.

442
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,270
You know, when I think about it,

443
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,941
the only queen Dame Judi Dench
hasn't played is me.

444
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,376
[audience laughs]

445
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,312
Now, once in a blue moon,
life gives you a second chance,

446
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:17,383
and this queen would be the
first to tell you all about it.

447
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,619
- Like a Phoenix from the ashes,
Eureka is back!

448
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,555
I got something to prove,

449
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,857
and I'm here
to fucking slay.

450
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,661
- Alana was amazing.

451
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:32,164
- Your mama. We do drag
to celebrate ourselves

452
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,400
in a political climate
where right now,

453
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,168
none of us feel like
we belong truly.

454
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,637
- The minute you said,
be yourself to free yourself,

455
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,473
I was just like...

456
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,942
- ♪ Watch me smile

00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,276

461
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,617
What are you gonna be?

462
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,187
[cheers and applause]

463
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,324
- Oh, my goodness.

464
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,926
So tell me, Eureka,

465
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,596
what was it like watching
yourself this season?

466
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,632
- Honey, the camera definitely
adds 54 pounds.

467
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,101
- [laughs]
- You know.

468
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,169
- So tell me this.

469
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,338
Who are you looking forward

470
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,740
to lip syncing against tonight?

471
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,941
- I'm looking forward

472
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,076
to lip syncing against
all of them really

473
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,577
if it means I get the crown.
- Okay.

474
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,779
And what would you do
with $100.000?

475
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,817
- My mother raised me and my two
sisters as a single mother

476
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,119
and was put in debt
because of that,

477
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,521
also with her medical condition.

478
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,156
So what I would like to do is

479
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,258
I would like to actually
pay off all of those debts

480
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:35,594
and be able to give my family
a fresh start at life.

481
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,030
[cheers and applause]

482
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,733
- Well, hello, Mama Eureka
and Monique!

483
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,569
You're her twin sister?
- Yes.

484
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,038
- And who's
the more dominant twin?

485
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,573
- Obviously Eureka.

486
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,041
- [laughs]

487
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,443
- Honestly, being extra
is what makes her so wonderful.

488
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,978
- Yes.

489
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,182
- And you are gonna do it.

490
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:59,785
[cheers and applause]

491
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,253
- I love you, Mom.

492
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,821
- Thank you so much.

493
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,658
Okay, now time for
some fan questions.

494
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,595
Let's say hello
to Mariah Paris Bolenciaga!

495
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,430
[cheers and applause]

496
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,232
- All right, Miss Eureka,

497
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,301
us being two queens
from the south,

498
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:17,570
we know we love our snacks.

499
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,072
We love to savor, devour,

500
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,374
and then there's just some
to throw away.

501
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,476
That brings me to my question.

502
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,079
- [laughs]
Wait! Wait!

503
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,549
That was... [laughs]

504
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,918
That was the leadup
to the question?

505
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:37,590
[all laugh]

506
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,092
- So that brings me
to our question.

507
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:44,563
Shag, marry, kill
your top three fellow sisters.

508
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:48,200
- I would probably fuck Asia,

509
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,536
marry Kameron Michaels,
'cause she's quiet.

510
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,037
I talk a lot. I think
a match made in heaven.

511
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,206
- Uh-huh.
[all laugh]

512
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,875
- And I would kill Aquaria.
Why not?

513
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,877
[cheers and applause]

514
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,213
- And finally, Eureka,

515
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:06,085
your "Drag Race" experience
has been one wild ride.

516
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,188
What do you think it all means
sort of metaphysically speaking?

517
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,290
- I think it means

518
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,259
that we don't know the path
that we're designed,

519
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,195
and we have to follow that path
with our best foot forward

520
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:20,399
and as much positivity and joy
as you can.

521
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,669
What this path has done for me
is it has taught me

522
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,571
you have to care for the people
that love you the most

523
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,074
instead of worrying about
what society and what media

524
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,610
and what our peers
tells us we have to be.

525
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,512
We are so much more than that.

526
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,581
And we are family.

527
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,683
Treat each other like family.

528
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:41,120
- Thank you.
And remember, Eureka,

529
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,690
you're never too much.
You are everything.

530
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,824
- [laughs]

531
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,059
- Give it up for Eureka!

532
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,627
- Everything!

533
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,795
[cheers and applause]

534
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,965
- Next, a silent
but deadly queen

535
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,935
whose powerhouse lip syncs
took her all the way to the top.

536
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,936
Take a look.

537
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,405
- I'm Kameron Michaels,

538
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,773
and I'm the muscle queen
from Nashville, Tennessee.

539
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:04,510
Outside of drag, I am
a tatted muscle dude at the gym.

540
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,612
And then I tuck it back,
throw on some pads,

541
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,814
and walk out
looking fishy as fuck.

542
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,649
I like to think
I'm silent but deadly,

543
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,785
but maybe I need to be a
little more on the deadly side.

544
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,456
♪ Born in Cali,
mama named me Cherilyn ♪

545
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,558
- You set the bar
very, very high.

546
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,627
- I did not think
you could lip sync

547
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,028
the way that you lip sync,
bitch.

548
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,831
You can turn the party.

549
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,766
- ♪ I'm gay and proud,
might not be loud ♪

550
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,102
♪ But I found my sound ♪

551
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:34,673
[cheers and applause]

552
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,376
- Kameron Michaels!

553
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,045
Now, all season long,
you were underestimated,

554
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,748
and, bitch,
look at your ass now.

555
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,583
- I'm here!
- Yes!

556
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,719
[cheers and applause]

557
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:48,887
You lip synced four times.

558
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,623
Not many girls can pass three.

559
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,693
What's your secret
to the perfect lip sync?

560
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,628
- First and foremost,
we are entertainers.

561
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,366
And I think it's most important
to know your words.

562
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,701
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

563
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,371
Now, before "Cher, the Rusical,"

564
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,339
you failed to mention

565
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,910
that you actually do Cher
in your nightclub act.

566
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,446
- Did I not say that?
Did I keep that from everybody?

567
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,982
- You certainly did. Now,
does that make you a quiet queen

568
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,283
or a shady queen?

569
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,952
- That may have been
a little more shady.

570
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,887
- Yes. [laughs]

571
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,056
Now, Kameron, get ready,

572
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,258
because we have some
fan questions for you.

573
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,259
- Perfect.

574
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,329
- BeBe Zahara Benet!

575
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,464
- Hi, delta cutie.
- Hi, beautiful.

576
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,701
- Jesse from Seattle
wants to know

577
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,872
do you get laid more in drag
or out of drag?

578
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,741
We want to know, Kameron.
Tell us, bitch, tell us.

579
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,044
- You know what?
I don't have time!

580
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,446
I don't have time!

581
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,482
I get four hours of sleep,
and I need all four hours.

582
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,151
I'm not giving that hour
or 30 minutes

583
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,587
or however long it takes
to anyone!

584
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,990
- So, Kameron, who's here
supporting you tonight?

585
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,691
- Here supporting me tonight

586
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,927
is one of my very best friends
for over a decade

587
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:02,928
who did about
three-fourths of the stuff

588
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:03,962
that you saw on the show.

589
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,330
And his name is Ryan.

590
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,499
- Hi, Ryan.
- Hi.

591
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:12,004
- And my amazing, lovely,
super supportive mother Vicky.

592
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,939
- Hello, Mother Michaels.

593
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,307
- Hi, Ru.

594
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,542
- When Kameron's in drag,

595
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,844
what family member
does Kameron look like?

596
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,579
- Me.
- Oh, okay.

597
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,082
Now, you guys share clothing?
- We do.

598
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,417
- And you have
the same shoe size?

599
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,885
- Yes, we do.
- How is that?

600
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,454
Girl, you must have
some big ass feet.

601
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,823
- I do, I do.

602
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:36,028
- Now, Kameron, our ratings this
season are higher than ever,

603
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,463
and thanks to you,

604
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,532
we've been attracting
a whole new demographic.

605
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,167
Take a look.

606
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,937
- Hello, Dane.
This is grandma.

607
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,972
I saw you on "Drag Race,"

608
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:52,611
and I am very, very shocked
at the talent

609
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,147
and what you have accomplished.

610
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,683
And I am so proud of you.

611
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:02,020
And I love you dearly,
and I always will.

612
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,358
- Oh, wow!

613
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,527
Gorgeous.

614
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,530
- My grandmother loves me.
I am her only grandchild.

615
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,233
She is the mother of my father
who's passed away.

616
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,802
Coming from a really religious
background and family,

617
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,704
I was very worried
what she would think of me

618
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,939
and how she would react
when she found out.

619
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,775
So to see that and know
that she still loves me

620
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,479
and supports me no matter what
is really amazing.

621
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,014
- See? I'm gonna say it again.

622
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,449
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"

623
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:34,820
still bringing families together
after all these years.

624
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,489
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for Kameron Michaels.

625
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,759

finale of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

633
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,217
Tonight we celebrate
10 wonderful years

634
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:08,353
of tears, triumphs
and tongue pops.

635
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,224
Unfortunately, due to a severe
case of wig water poisoning,

636
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,293
I can't remember any of it!

637
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:18,430
So with the help of super fan
Sally Jesse Raphael,

638
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,165
let's turn back time.

639
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,570
- The year was 2008.

640
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:29,341
Nine queens sashayed
into a little TV studio.

641
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,576
- It is my pleasure

642
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,111
to have you all here
at "RuPaul's Drag Race."

643
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:37,049
- Where they experienced
some very harsh lighting.

644
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,383
Little did they know

645
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,888
that they would be changing
herstory forever.

646
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,358
Soon change was in the air.

647
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:49,161
- All our equal, all are free.

648
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:52,864
- And we celebrated
the art of drag.

649
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,201
- These girls are given
production values.

650
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,669
- Okay.

651
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,538
- With sickening challenges.

652
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,473
- Baloney!
- That made us laugh...

653
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,276
- Get those nuts
away from my face.

654
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,744
- H-h-ham!

655
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,312
- Change.
- Gag...

656
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,247
- [gags]
- Oh!

657
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,583
- I'd like to keep it on,
please.

658
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,951
- I'm going home.

659
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,189
- What's going on here?

660
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,024
- And cry.

661
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:22,995
- I've been living with HIV for
the last two years of my life.

662
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:25,497
- My mother left my sister
and myself at a bus stop

663
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,766
when I was three.

664
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,301
- We are a family here.

665
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:33,538
- Always served
with a deep sense of love.

666
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,308
- [gasps] Uh!

667
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,944
- Soon the secret was out.

668
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,480
- Say hello
to Christina Aguilera.

669
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,283
- ♪ Oh ♪

670
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,219
- Mother Monster has arrived.

671
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,454
- Yes, Gaga!
[cheering]

672
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:53,558
- And "Drag Race" became
a national obsession...

673
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:54,926
- Okur?

674
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:58,897
- And an international
phenomenon.

675
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:01,566
- So they are supposed
to hire y'all hookers

676
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,068
to seduce the gays?

677
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,136
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

678
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,373
- Growing up,
I never could have dreamed

679
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,941
that this day would come.

680
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,780
- In 2015, love won
and so did Violet Chachki.

681
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,415
- Congrats!

682
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,984
- Drag queens became superstars.

683
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,719
- Hello. This is what
makes me money.

684
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:21,953
This is what people hire to see.

685
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,257
- It even started
a whole new economy.

686
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:28,927
- Drag Con L.A. 2018!

687
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,595
[cheering]

688
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,999
- And, honey, we are
just getting started.

689
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,367
10 years later,

690
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:39,004
instead of focusing on
the things that divide us,

691
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:43,542
"RuPaul's Drag Race" celebrates
what brings us together.

692
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,544
- The night that Donald Trump
was elected president,

693
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47,512
I watched five
back-to-back episodes

694
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,114
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

695
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,416
- Bob the Drag Queen
for president.

696
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,285
- I was basically watching
the version of America

697
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,787
that I wanted to live in
rather than watching the one

698
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,789
that was unfolding
in front of history.

699
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:03,328
- And the mission is as clear
as it was from day one.

700
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,630
- Everybody say love!

701
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,832
- Love!
- Love!

702
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,267
- To take over
the mothertucking world...

703
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,736
- We will always be here,

704
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,537
and we have always been here.

705
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,974
- One death drop at a time.

706
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,613

Welcome back, ladies.

808
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,308
You've waited all season
for this moment.

809
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,810
But first, to explain

810
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,647
how this legendary lip sync
for the crown will go down,

811
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:26,317
here's our very own
Carson Kressley.

812
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,852
- Thank you, RuPaul.

813
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,723
Tonight's lip sync smackdown
is going to be bigger.

814
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:32,791
- Bigger!

815
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,958
- Louder.
- Louder!

816
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,794
- Queenier than ever.
- Queenier!

817
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:40,999
- Four sickening queens entered,
but only one will survive.

818
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,903
First, a spin of the wheel
determines which two tuck titans

819
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:48,773
will face off
in lip sync number one.

820
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:52,377
Then the remaining two glamazons
fight to the death

821
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,380
in lip sync number two!

822
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,716
Then those two finalists
will battle head-to-head,

823
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,385
camel toe-to-camel toe,

824
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:05,023
for the final lip sync
for the crown!

825
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:10,662
Ru, this is going to be epic!

826
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:15,066
Ooh! It was like someone else
was inside my body.

827
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,135
Anyway, back to you, Ru.

828
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:19,137
- [laughs]

829
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,672
Thank you, Carson.

830
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,341
- No, no, no.
Sit down, everybody.

831
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,943
Sit down. Sit down.

832
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:29,881
- Now, on this wheel are
the faces of our top four.

833
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,649
Wherever the wheel stops

834
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,652
will determine which queen
lip syncs first.

835
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,588
Ladies, are you ready?

836
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,289
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

837
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,858
- All right, here we go.

838
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,459
I'm so glad I stretched.

839
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,728

All right, the wheel has spoken.

843
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,520
Kameron Michaels,
you will be competing

844
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,556
in tonight's first
lip sync for the crown.

845
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:17,495
And now it's your turn to pick
who you will lip sync against

846
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,931
in this first round.

847
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,335
Who do you choose?

848
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,306
- I didn't want to do this!

849
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,974
Um...

850
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:35,346
I think my choice
is going to be Asia O'Hara.

851
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,183
[cheers and applause]

852
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,317

That means Aquaria, Eureka,

854
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,060
you two will face off

855
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,397
in tonight's second
lip sync coming up next.

856
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,532
You may leave the stage.

are you ready to pick?

865
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,061
- Absolutely.
- Good.

866
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:27,832
Do you choose box number one
or box number two?

867
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,033
- Always number one.

868
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,537
- Jason, open your box.

869
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,042
