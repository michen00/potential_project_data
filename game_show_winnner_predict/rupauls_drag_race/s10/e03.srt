- Previously
on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:05,905
I'm writing you a prescription
for Pharmarusical.

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,274
- ♪ Welcome to Ruco Labs ♪

4
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,575
Yeah!

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,110
- Bitch, I'm from Chicago.

6
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,478
[all laugh]

7
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,181
- Team The Vixen.

8
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,083
Con-drag-ulations.
You are the winning team.

9
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,284
[applause]

10
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,920
- And The Vixen, as team leader,

11
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,490
you are the winner
of this week's maxi challenge.

12
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,025
- Monique Heart.

13
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,728
- In the musical performance,
I can't remember you.

14
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,062
- Kalorie.

15
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,599
- I wanted to see more
imagination, more creativity,

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,768
and I think that's why
a lot of us lost you.

17
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,437
- Eureka.
- What happened, Eureka?

18
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,539
- I didn't realize
I was still so emotional

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,442
over what had happened to me.

20
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,678
- Your knee sent you home
last season.

21
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,246
If you don't get
out of your head,

22
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,148
your head's gonna send you home
this season.

23
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,551
- Eureka, shantay, you stay.

24
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,886
- Thank you.

25
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,689
- Kalorie, sashay away.

26
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,198
- Whew.

27
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,567
- Yes, mama, congratulations.
- Girl.

28
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,936
- You tore that shit up.

29
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,704
- What did she have to say?

30
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:12,905
- "Thank you, sisters.

31
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,942
"I'm so blessed
to have met you all.

32
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,743
Keep it kute?"

33
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,911
- Cute with a K.

34
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,214
- My chubby girl sister, honey,
back-back-back,

35
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,850
we'll be all fat
together again one day.

36
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,319
I'm completely shook.

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,988
I can't believe I got
that close to going home.

38
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:33,392
I've worked so hard and fought
for so long to be here again.

39
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,761
If I don't get out of my mind,

40
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,563
then literally all this
hard work that I've done

41
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,998
is gonna be for nothing.

42
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,166
- I'm very proud of all of us,

43
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,801
because this was
a really hard challenge.

44
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,135
- Yeah.
- Congrats, Vixen.

45
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,170
I thought you were gonna win.

46
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,604
- I didn't get here on accident.

47
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,976
- Who was it that I said that
you were gonna cause her to win

48
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,444
by giving her that hair.
Who did I say that to?

49
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,179
- Me.

50
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,582
I think it's kind of funny
that The Vixen's best drag look

51
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,917
was composed of a wig

52
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,419
that she didn't even
bring from home.

53
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,289
- I have to say I was
a little nervous at first.

54
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,791
I just thought you were
a little like, you know,

55
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,560
but you pulled us together.

56
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,562
- I chose y'all
because I trusted y'all.

57
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,696
But at the end of the day,

58
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,399
I trusted y'all
because I trust my judgment.

59
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,235
- Monique, you were in like
the bottom three essentially.

60
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,705
- I don't feel I was the worst,
because I feel like I sold it.

61
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:24,577
My whole look made out of hats,
layered in cards, safe.

62
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,513
And then I come out
in a Cookie Monster costume,

63
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,882
with an extra layer
of my personality,

64
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,218
which is the fact that
I'm a crafty queen.

65
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,619
- It wasn't no sponge, though.

66
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,820
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

67
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,022
- And you were safe.

68
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,257
Moving forward into this week,

69
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,059
I'm just gonna make sure

70
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,628
that I'm the biggest personality
they don't forget.

71
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,563
I'm not going home
any time soon, America.

72
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,831
You can bet that.

73
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,200
When you work so hard
to get here,

74
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,103
like fucking might have been
almost disconnected

75
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,638
trying to get here,

76
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,209
I feel like get woke,
shook, I'm awake.

77
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,311
- Every week, Monique thinks

78
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,347
that she should have been
in the top.

79
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,982
Girl, you oughta take a hint.

80
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,518
If you're not getting
what you think...

81
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,422
Step your pussy up.

82
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,793

she gonna get dated.

105
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,045
- Whoo-hoo.

106
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,346

107
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,149

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,190
I'm holding screen tests

112
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:23,429

RuPaul's Chocolate Bar campaign.

114
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,799
Let me set the scene.

115

You've just arrived
in Hollywood,

00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,971
eager for your first big break.

117
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,273
And I want you to do
whatever it takes

118
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,576

and make me laugh.

119

124
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,125
- Can y'all turn off the HD
for this part?

125
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,160

but you can call me

131
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,340
what they call me
on the streets of Harlem.

132
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,142

- [laughs] See that
chocolate bar right there?

134
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,281
I want you to do a monologue
as the chocolate.

135
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,218
- I am the chocolate bar.

Hop like a chocolate
bunny rabbit.

140

- Is this an episode
of "Twin Peaks?"

141
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,934
- [laughs]
Okay, be a cat.

142
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,236
- Meow.
- Use your paws.

143
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,737
- Meow.

144
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,272
- Does kitty like chocolate?

145
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,874
- Mee-ee-ow.

146
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,843
- [laughs]
Give that chocolate a try.

147
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,446
- It's nutty.
I love nuts in my mouth.

00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,914

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,358
- Can you dance an Irish jig?

180
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,093
- Oh, I sure can.

181
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,130
It's an Irish jig, girl.
You gotta jig it.

182
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,431
[all laugh]

183
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,266
- Oh, yeah, girl.

184
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,702
- Sing something Irish
to the chocolate.

185
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,305
♪ It's in the bra ♪

186
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,473
♪ In the bra ♪

187
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,642
♪ In the bra ♪

188
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,544
[all laugh]

189
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,713
- [speaking foreign language]

190
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,649
- Okay, now say it sad,
and then smile.

191
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,585
- [speaking foreign language]
- [laughs]

192
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,621
- Now, can you do an accent?

193
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,090
- [British accent]
Top of the morning to you.

194
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,692
Do you want something delicious

195
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:45,464
that is succulent, decadent,
hot and vivacious?

196
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,500
Well, you should totally have
RuPaul's Chocolate bar.

197
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:52,137
- That's the worst Jamaican
accent I've ever heard.

198
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,639
[all laugh]

199
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,174
- Tell the chocolate bar
what you think of it.

200
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,777
- Oh, you decadent
chocolate bar, you.

201
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,512
Succulent.

202
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,915
[all laugh]

203
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,616
- Hey, kit cats.

204
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,651
- Hey.
- Hi.

205
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,853
- Three of you
really made me snicker.

206
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,857
Blair St. Clair.

207
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,359
[applause]

208
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,462
- Monique Heart.
- Yeah!

209
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,130
- And Monét X Change.

210
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,599
[cheers and applause]

211
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,334
- Now ladies, this season,

212
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,804
our mission is to take over
the mother-tucking world.

213
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,273
So for this week's
maxi challenge,

214
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,343
I want you to use
your charisma, uniqueness,

215
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,345
nerve and technology

216
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:38,684
to help me market new emerging
breakthrough dating apps

217
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:43,489
designed to connect with
lonely underserved consumers.

218
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,492
Now, the first app
is called "End of Days."

219
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:49,194
It's for doomsday preppers

220
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,530
who want to spend
the rest of their lives

221
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,167
with someone special,
even if that's just two weeks.

222
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:56,201
[all laugh]

223
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,837
- Second is "Fibstr."

224
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,306
It's for pathological liars

225
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,243
who are looking
for a real connection.

226
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,878
Or are they?

227
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,746
[all laugh]

228
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:12,418
- And last and maybe least
is "Madam Buttrface."

229
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,886
[all laugh]

230
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,723
- It's for she who's got
a banging body, but 'er face.

231
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,824
[all laugh]

232
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,460
- Blair, Monique, and Monét,

233
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,595
you are team captains.

234
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:27,166
- Monique has not been
in the top at all,

235
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,067
which is gaggy to me.

236
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,203
So I'm going to pick teammates

237
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,073
that are going
to kill this challenge.

238
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,843
- First pick, Blair St. Clair.

239
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,845
- I'm gonna go with Miz Cracker.

240
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,213
[applause]

241
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,182
- Monique.
- Miss Dusty Ray Bottoms.

242
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,083
- Thank you.
- Monét.

243
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,152
- Asia O'Hara.

244
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,254
- Eureka.
- Oh, I'm not last today.

245
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,255
[applause and laughter]

246
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,124
- Kameron.

247
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,959
- Aquaria.

248
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,662
- So you Yuhua, Mayhem,
and The Vixen

249
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,996
remain to be chosen.

250
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,934
- The Vixen.
- Yeah!

251
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,669
- My good sister Miss Mayhem.

252
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,475
- Which means Yuhua,
you-a with Team Monét.

253
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,876
- Thank you for choosing me.

254
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:15,047
- Team Blair, you'll be
working on "End of Days."

255
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,083
Team Monique, you'll be
working on "Fibstr."

256
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:23,222
And Team Monét, you'll be
working on "Madam Buttrface."

257
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,526
Now, each team needs to use
their acting and writing skills

258
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:28,994
to come up with a commercial

259
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,097
that makes me
wanna tap that app.

260
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,500
Gentlemen, start your engines.

261
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,402
And may the best woman win.

262
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,438
- So we're Team Fibstr.

263
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,440
- All right.
- Come on, Fibstr.

264
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,875
- What were
some of your thoughts?

265
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,477
- Him being somebody talking
about "I'm completely sane"

266
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,913
and all this and that,
and this and that, but--

267
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,281
and her be in
the straitjacket,

268
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,016
like she's absolutely
fucking nuts.

269
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,951
- I think you could play that
very, very well.

270
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,353
- Great. I would love to.

271
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,389
- What if we called it out?
Are you a pathological liar?

272
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,991
- Is truth serum
not your cup of tea?

273
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,093
Catfish have been
bottom feeders for too long,

274
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,094
and we're bringing them
to the surface,

275
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,562
or something like that.

276
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,631
- Do you find it hard
to find love as your true self?

277
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,632
- Yes.

278
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,934
- Okay, so let's
write those down.

279
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:13,338
- So everyone's collaborating,
throwing out ideas.

280
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,340
Mayhem's a little quiet.

281
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,877
- Does one of us need to be like
the narrator of the app?

282
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,012
- I'll do it.

283
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,246
- Girl, you better deliver,

284
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,849
because if I'm in the bottom two
because of you,

285
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,584
I'm cutting up all your wigs.

286
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,618
All of them.

287
00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:29,888
- Introduce your app.
What is it called?

288
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,256
What should we call it?
- It is Buttrface.

289
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,758
We don't have
to make up a name.

290
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,293
- We don't have to come up
with another name for it?

291
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,661
- No, that's the name of it.

292
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,062
- Okay. Madam Buttrface?
- Madam Buttrface.

293
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,598
I wanted to pick people who
I felt were strong competitors,

294
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,400
but also were the most creative.

295
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,769
So here's the thing
about intro-ing the app.

296
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,737
- Do you look
for a healthy girl?

297
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:50,876
- We have to set it up like have
you--are you tired of those--

298
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,644
- Are you tired
of unhealthy girls?

299
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,480
- I got stuck with Yuhua.

300
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,916
I didn't choose her,
I got stuck with her.

301
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,351
And you say,
are you tired of those girls

302
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,419
you take to the movies?

303
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,687
They have those beautiful faces,

304
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:04,423
but then their body
feels like a lumpy mess.

305
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,125
- Mm, no.
That's too...too...too...

306
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,126
- Rhyme-y?

307
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,963
- No, not even that.
So...so typical.

308
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,297
Make it funny.

309
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,100
- Right, well, I'm, like,
brainstorming ideas, girl.

310
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,735
This is the tackiest
and crunchiest

311
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,605
and oldest line in the book, but
there's no "I" in "team," girl.

312
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,711
- So we could kind of like
have the four of us

313
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,213
introducing what's going on,

314
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,814
and saying like this is my
problem, this is my problem,

315
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,015
this is my problem.
- Yeah.

316
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,585
- But we all have
an end solution together.

317
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,820
For this week's challenge,
we are asked to write,

318
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,256
produce, and star in our own
commercial for a dating app.

319
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,191
And I am
one of the team leaders.

320
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,926
I'm so excited.

321
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:41,961
- I feel like
it either has to be

322
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,395
you guys
introducing the product,

323
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,464
or a narrator introducing
the product, but not both.

324
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,932
- One thing
that I can always use

325
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,335
is my size to be comedic.

326
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,837
I mean, I know that's
like stereotypical funny,

327
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,706
but it's the end of the world,

328
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,875
and I could just be
excessively eating

329
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,376
'cause I'm afraid
the world's gonna end,

330
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:00,646
so that way just in case all the
food goes bad, I won't starve.

331
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,981
- Right off the bat,

332
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,049
Eureka has her own ideas

333
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,486
on what I should do, she
should do, everyone should do.

334
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,990
She jumps right to, oh,
let's make it about a fat joke,

335
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,292
and then it could be about me.

336
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,960
- At the end, like,
we can all just be like,

337
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,328
fight each other,
the end of the world

338
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,663
is fucking out of our hands.

339
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,865
And like have like there's bombs
coming at us, like...

340
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,535
Who would be open
to being my lesbian lover?

341
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,838
- Miss Kameron, I know

342
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,339
that it takes you
two hours to paint.

343
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,742
Do you wanna write
some lines down once again?

344
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,644
'Cause I do not--
- Well, I was gonna talk to you.

345
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,813
Since I wrote out
the opening lines,

346
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,348
do you want me to narrate

347
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,718
since I know them really well
since I wrote them?

348
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,554
- I mean...

349
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,556
- What's your call?
- That kind of makes sense.

350
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:44,757
- I mean, I don't wanna
step on any toes.

351
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,192
If you wanna do it,
I'll let you do it.

352
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,393
But just since I wrote them out,

353
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,828
I feel like
I can spit them really easy.

354
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,163
- What do you feel?

355
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,398
- I was just
gonna play that role

356
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,499
because I felt like I needed
to do some kind of like

357
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,002
more acting into it.

358
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,072
Basically,
I don't really have lines.

359
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,142
- Were you really like
wanting to be that narrator?

360
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,946
Mayhem looks like

361
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,782
she has an issue with Kameron
being the narrator.

362
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,183
But closed mouths don't get fed.

363
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,454
- I could--that's fine with me.
- Stunning. Okay.

364
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,558
Let's get ready.

365
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,928
- Who "nose" what you can find
with "Madam Buttrface?"

366
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,431
- [chuckles] Our app
is Madam Buttrface.

367
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,765
So since we're
gonna be Buttrfaces,

368
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:27,933
we agree that the ugly girls

369
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,002
need to be really,
really fucking ugly.

370
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,937
They need to be nothing
like their Grindr pictures.

371
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,672
They are like
the exact opposite.

372
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,574
- Where'd you get
those noses, Asia?

373
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,010
- Right there on the table.
- I want one, too.

374
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,445
- I don't know
if there's any more.

375
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:40,713
- The other two have noses.

376
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,148
and then you've gotta have
a prosthetic nose, too?

377
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,751
The app isn't
"Date the Nose, Girl."

378
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,786
Black all your teeth
and draw moles,

379
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,155
and just put hair on it,
like big hairs.

380
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,991
- Just like gross,
like, what's--

381
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,993
- I'm thinking of it.
Stop screaming at me, dude.

382
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,294
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not screaming.

383
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,295
- I'm not screaming at you.
I'm just telling you.

384
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,230
- We're just encouraging quickly

385
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,231
because there's a time limit.

386
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,366
- Yes, I heard it.
Like no noses.

387
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,234
I heard it. I heard it.
I heard it. I heard it.

388
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,536
- I actually like clutched
my pearls a little bit.

389
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,838
I was like you all relax.

390
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,706
We are not attacking you, girl.

391
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,441
This is a team.
We are here together.

392
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,976
If you lose, we all lose.

393
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,444
- One time is enough.

394
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,080
It's enough times 10.

395
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,248
I'm getting irritated

396
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,317
because nobody asked
for Aquaria's opinion.

397
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,019
Take care of those noses
on your face, girl.

398
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,720
I don't need 10 voices about it.

399
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,122
- Oh, "nose,"
she better know.

400
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,823
- Oh, "nose," she better know.

401
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,992
[laughs]

402
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,261
- Uh, Miss Mayhem?

403
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,563
- Yes, love?
- Okay, you getting painted?

404
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,865
- Yes.
- Thank you.

405
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,768
And can you do something
very strong

406
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,169
and dominatrix-like?

407
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,305
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

408
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:42,374
Love you.
Appreciate your kindness.

409
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,776
- Monique
is an effective leader,

410
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,813
and I know Monique is tired,
like me, of being safe.

411
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,215
So I know Monique is going
to do everything possible

412
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,217
to kind of steal the win.

413
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,719
- Fish, what are y'all doing
in y'all group?

414
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,220
- Girl, the fool.

415
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,655
- [laughs]

416
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,290
- The absolute, 100% fool.

417
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:02,461
- Team Buttrface
might be in the bottom.

418
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,129
Asia isn't feeling the concept.

419
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,331
She's like, girl.

420
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,566
And when another drag queen
goes, "girl,"

421
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,034
you know it ain't good.

422
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,669
- Girl, I think
you're gonna do just fine.

423
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,171
- Just fine
ain't good enough.

424
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,641
I didn't come to "Drag Race"
to do just fine.

425
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,343
- I came to win.
- Amen.

426
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,713
- I am so into it.

427
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,081
- He ain't gotta tell you
how to get ugly.

428
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,482
She just like
putting on her eyebrows.

429
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,683
They just look stupid.

430
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,585
- Did she really?

431
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,354
- Can you--I--
because I can't.

432
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,089
- I'm so frustrated.

433
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,290
I'm like, ugh.

434
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,491
Really, girl?

435
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,592
- Oh, yeah, I was afraid.
I was like,

436
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,560
why are you painting
so pretty, though?

437
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,828
- I'm saying you look pretty.

438
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,697
- No, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna put dots, girl.

439
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,232
- The hardest part for me
in this challenge,

440
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,734
is wrangling Yuhua.

441
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,502
This is just Yuhua all the time.

442
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,505
She just--I don't think Yuhua
ever really stands on something

443
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,873
and like commits to it fully.

444
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,275
And that problem is coming
to bite us in the ass.

445
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,177
- Yuhua, I know you don't
want me telling you what to do,

446
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,345
but look really fucking ugly.

447
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,180
- Wait, so, you know--
Are you the pretty one?

448
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,915
- I'm the ugly one.

449
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,250
- Not with them brows.

450
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,985
- I will look ugly in a second.

451
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,553
- Team Captain.
- So get to it.

452
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,455
- I call foul.

453
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,490
- Yuhua, if you don't look ugly,

454
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,691
I'm gonna punch you
in your nose.

455
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,626
- I'm gonna look ugly,
don't worry.

456
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,628
- We need you to serve Monét

457
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,930
after she's twirled
like three numbers,

458
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,533
four high kicks,
and one platypus death drop.

459
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,901
- [laughs]

460
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,803
- Give her the cucumber, baby.
Give her the cucumber.

461
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,371
- Give us the cucumbers.

462
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,506
- I think our name
should be Team Sponge.

463
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,807
- No, bitch.

464
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,308
- Are we gonna have
the luck of the sponge?

465
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,177
- The luck of the sponge
didn't work the first time.

466
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,479
It's not gonna work.
- It did work. I was safe.

467
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,581
My ass is here, and Vanessa and
Vanjie are somewhere else, girl.

468
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,849
- Vanjie.

469
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,851
- Vanjie.
- Vanjie.

470
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,921
- Vanjie.
- [laughs]

471
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,856
- Hello.

472
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:38,990
- Hi.
- Hi.

473
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,991
- Hi, ladies.

474
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,459
- Lights, camera, action.

475
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,062
It's time for us
to shoot our commercial

476
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,297
with Michelle and Carson.

477
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,065
Let's kill it.

478
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,169
- You could use anything here,
including our pit crew boys.

479
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,938
And of course,
all these furnishings

480
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,839
brought to you by Objects.

481
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,608
Do you wanna talk us through
your commercial?

482
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,543
- So our app
is called "Fibstr."

483
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,578
It's for pathological liars.

484
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,448
We're gonna start this scene
with the narrator first.

485
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,749
- Who's the narrator?
- Kameron is.

486
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,217
- Kameron. Okay. Great.

487
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,619
- And are those your boobs?

488
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,688
- Yeah, I was trying to give
a little Michelle Visage--

489
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,789
- Oh, wow.
- Same doctor, yeah.

490
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,624
- Congratulations.
All right, liars.

491
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,758
Make us believe it.

492
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,360
- And action.

493
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,362
- Introducing "Fibstr,"

494
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,899
the new app for pathological
liars looking for love.

495
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,500
- Cut. Okay, hold on.

496
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,969
"Fibstr," you can't do it
in front of your face.

497
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,071
- And I think what you're
trying to really sell

498
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,472
is the name of the app,
which is "Fibstr."

499
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,841
So I think it should
be big on "Fibstr."

500
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,110
Like that's your
like showgirl moment.

501
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,445
"Fibstr."
- Okay.

502
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,080
- And action.

503
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,349
- Introducing "Fibstr,"

504
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,752
the new app for pathological
liars looking for love.

505
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:44,489
- Kameron is trying to be
a real businesswoman

506
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,591
about being the narrator.

507
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,326
But it's falling flat.

508
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,494
I could have done better.

509
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,363
- Okay, what's next, ladies?

510
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,298
- So my scene is pretty much
I'm playing like I'm bougie.

511
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,299
I live in Beverly Hills.

512
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,867
However, when it pans out,

513
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,969
it's actually that I'm broke
and from Compton,

514
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,538
and I have roaches, so,
you know, very, very bad.

515
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,441
Three, two, one, action.

516
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,011
- She's self-directing.
- She is.

517
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,747
- I'm looking for
a beautiful, strong--

518
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,415
Let's do that part again.

519
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,716
- Okay.
- Action.

520
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,853
I'm looking for
a beautiful, strong man

521
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,688
with big arms and great legs

522
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,424
that loves house visitors
and house guests.

523
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,493
A man that loves
the simple things.

524
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,061
Great. Cut.

525
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,330
- She'd rather be a director
than an actress.

526
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,564
[Michelle laughs]

527
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:27,866
- We've got four and a half
minutes left.

528
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,703
I wish I had a doctor
that didn't wear pants.

529
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,238
- You've gotta see a new doctor.

530
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,640
- Okay, what's happening
in this scene, Mayhem?

531
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:36,641
- We're on this date, finally,

532
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,410
and then I'm gonna drop my menu,

533
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,844
because I'm covering my face.

534
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,814
I'm gonna drop my menu, and
then I'm gonna reveal like--

535
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,649
- You're a different person.
- We're seeing the blonde hair.

536
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,884
Okay. I get it.
- Yeah.

537
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:46,918
It's a sight gag.

538
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,686
Here we go. And action.

539
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,294
Okay. So, Mayhem, what's
the reaction you want from him?

540
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,365
I get the sight gag is
this is different than this.

541
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,968
- Mm-hmm. Yes. Um...

542
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,071
- What comes after this?

543
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:07,472
- Then he's supposed
to be into it.

544
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,540
He's supposed
to go along with it.

545
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,475
It's what we talked about,
remember?

546
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,744
Just Bryce,
she does her deep voice,

547
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,546
you still kind of give
that puzzled look,

548
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,648
then you're gonna go ahead
and be like, sure,

549
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,682
let's go on and get out of here.

550
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,250
- Monique is definitely
a micromanager

551
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,785
when it comes to leading.

552
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,954
God, this is frustrating.

553
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,923
- And you have to
make it known, Mayhem,

554
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,891
because looking at you,
we don't really read bondage.

555
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,760
You know,
it reads hot leather chick.

556
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,894
- Right.
- It doesn't really--

557
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,895
- Should I take off my jacket?
- Maybe.

558
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,931
- Whatcha got underneath?

559
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,132
- Yeah.
- Much better, yeah.

560
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,234
- Stunning.
At the end of the day,

561
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,937
this is the finished product
of  <i>moi.</i>

562
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:42,440
I need them to excel
in front of the judges,

563
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:46,010
so I probably
overstepped my bounds.

564
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,613
Kill me.

565
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,781
- And action.

566
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,792
- I think that's it.

567
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,160
- Is that everything?
- Yes, ma'am.

568
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,862
- All right.
- I had nowhere to go

569
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,163
with being a dominatrix.

570
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,332
I think if I was playing
the narrator,

571
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,633
I would have had
more fun with it.

572
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,138
- Oh, look how cute.
- Hi.

573
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:16,107
- It's our time to go
in front of Michelle and Carson,

574
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,443
and what we bring to the stage
first of all

575
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,612
is smiles and confidence.

576
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,848
We know Michelle is like a dog.
She can smell fear.

577
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,050
- So our commercial
that we're shooting today

578
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,352
is called "End of Days."

579
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,687
It's a new dating app
for more than just the gays.

580
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,989
- Very campy and over the top.

581
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,724
- So whatever you want to do
first, let's get to it.

582
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,059
Here we go. And action.

583
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,128
- Oh, ladies!
Ladies, have you heard?

584
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,764
It's the end of the world!

585
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:40,765
- Well, yeah, girl.

586
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,101
- I can't die tired or hungry

587
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:44,502
or worse...

588
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,371
a virgin!

589
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,840
- Sweetheart, snap out of it!

590
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,942
- Oh!
- Don't be such a drama queen!

591
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,578
[both laugh]

592
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,147
- Cut, cut, cut, cut.
You actually hit her.

593
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,615
- I think I did a little, yeah.
- It's method.

594
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,284
- We're method acting.

595
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,285
- That's actually--
no, it's called hitting.

596
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,286
- Miz Cracker, are you okay?

597
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,122
- Drag is a contact sport.

598
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,290
- [laughs]
- Okay, good.

599
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,058
We're gonna do that again,
and I think

600
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,393
you could do better
than that, Eureka.

601
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,394
- Okay.

602
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:10,395
- You got more in you, girl.
Come on.

603
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:13,298
Ready? And action.

604
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,133
- Sweetheart, snap out of it.

605
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,101
- Ah!
- Don't be a drama queen.

606
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,102
- Aah!

607
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,438
- Jesus! Cut!

608
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,940
- That was funny.
- Okay.

609
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,241
- I'm ready to hit
another bitch.

610
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,510
- Okay, here we go.
Let's go for it.

611
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,412
And action.

612
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:28,680
- Till death do us part.

613
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,215
[applause]

614
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,284
- Oh.
- Oh.

615
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,186
- Okay, cut.

616
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,487
I like that little makeout,

617
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,523
but you should give
a little shrug like, fuck it.

618
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,524
- Okay. Right.

619
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,725
- Right.
- That's great. Yeah.

620
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,260
- And Vixen, be present,

621
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,229
because you're by yourself
with a sandwich board on.

622
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,898
She's just gonna be looking
at them or like, aah, you know.

623
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,701
- The Vixen seems
kind of disconnected,

624
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,737
and I feel like she's taking
this a little too serious.

625
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,006
- And action.

626
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,708
- Till death do us part.

627
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,509
[applause]

628
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,581
[Michelle laughs]

629
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,116
And cut.

630
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,384
- Is that too much?

631
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,952
- Eureka just said,
"Was that too much?"

632
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,587
- Of course Eureka did great

633
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,757
in a scene-stealing challenge

634
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:13,925
because Eureka's great

635
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,527
at making all
the attention on her, so...

636
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,197
[intentionally silent]

637
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,667
- Hello.
- Hello, ladies.

638
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,836
- Wow. Tell us about your app.

639
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,871
- Our app
is "Madam Buttrface."

640
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,706
It's for those lovely ladies
and gentlemen

641
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,142
who want to find a lady
who is everything,

642
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,011
but her motherfucking face.

643
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,112
- Oh.
- Okay.

644
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:36,514
And are you the team leader?
- I am.

645
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,316
For this commercial,
we did a lot of typecasting.

646
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:41,519
And, you know, I am the most
pretty one out of the group.

647
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,754
Aquaria thinks it's her,
but it's not.

648
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,756
So I took the role
as a pretty bitch

649
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:45,957
with a shitty body

650
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,159
because that's pretty much
art imitating life

651
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,627
imitating art, girl.

652
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,363
- Okay, here we go.
And action.

653
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,600
- Welcome to Madam Buttrface,
the new revolutionary dating app

654
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,502
where you can find
that beautiful chick

655
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:00,038
with a face--sorry.
Fucked my line.

656
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,639
- No worries. Redo.

657
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,308
Asia, this is
a great opportunity

658
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,811
for you to like upstage people
and give us lots of face and--

659
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,446
- Asia, you need to mug
back there.

660
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,881
- Yes. Give it everything.

661
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,116
- Okay.
- Here we go.

662
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,352
And action.

663
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:18,456
- Welcome to Madam Buttrface,
the revolutionary new dating app

664
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,092
where you find that beautiful
girl with that sexy body,

665
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:23,461
but the face you probably
wanna shove into a pillow.

666
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:26,164
[stifling laughs]
- Cut.

667
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,201
She literally looks like Lucy,
like the missing link.

668
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,036
Asia, great work.

669
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,471
- Thank you.

670
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,772
- So I see them
like living for Asia,

671
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,475
and I'm like goddamn it,
that needs to be me, not Asia.

672
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,143
Focus on me.

673
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,445
Like me.

674
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,913
- That's great.
- Cut. Great.

675
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,049
- Let's move on.
- Okay, rolling. Here we go.

676
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,050
Action.

677
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,488
- My hot and sexy body

678
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,825
allows me to exercise
in all different positions.

679
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,827
- Cut.

680
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,329
- Is that good?
- Um...

681
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,597
We're gonna do that again.

682
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,799
Here we go.
Time's ticking.

683
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,867
And action.

684
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,504
- My hot and flexible body

685
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,007
allows me to exercise
in all different positions.

686
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,577
- Um, I don't underst--

687
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,445
Like, is it going
to make sense in context?

688
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,013
I'm not sure
I'm quite getting it.

689
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,416
- With my strong
and flexible body,

690
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:21,686
I can move
in all different positions.

691
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,522
I don't think Yuhua's jokes
really landed

692
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,592
because it somehow had nothing
to do with the dating app.

693
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:31,963
I think this is Yuhua's
like do-wah-do-wah moment.

694
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,899
I could watch that
a million times.

695
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,868
- We have 11 minutes left.

696
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,203
Here we go.
Hold on, where you going?

697
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,705
Go back, girl. Action.

698
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,509
- What? Oh.

699
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,912
- Okay.

700
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:51,282
- I am thinking, bitch,
I'm on a sinking boat,

701
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,217
and I'm the only bitch
with a life jacket.

702
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,318
- Okay, got it.

703
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,558
- All right, ladies,
here we go.

704
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,893
- Yeah.

705
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,730
- It's elimination day,
and I'm nervous.

706
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,467
I don't feel like I stood out,
and that's a bad thing.

707
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:13,438
- I feel like it's been
really difficult for me

708
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,473
to actually connect
to other people here.

709
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:18,709
How am I supposed to get by
our whole competition by myself?

710
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,079
It's actually been really hard
being here without my mom.

711
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,481
- Yeah.

712
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,116
- My mom and I are really,
really, really, really close.

713
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,952
And me being here without her,
not hearing her every day

714
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,154
or talking to her or like
even that moment to vent,

715
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,255
and be like, hey,
I did really well today,

716
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,957
or, hey, I had
a really rough day,

717
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,258
and I just need
to talk about it.

718
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,960
That's been like all bottled up
this whole time here,

719
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,229
and it's been, like...

720
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,630
I've just like
needed that support.

721
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,999
- I have several drag children.
I'll be your friend.

722
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,835
- [laughs]

723
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,837
- How is it not being
a team captain?

724
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,138
- I did not like it at all.

725
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,874
Now I gotta depend on
somebody else to get it right?

726
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,142
This is gonna be hard,
like...

727
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,543
- And they're gonna be
looking at you, bitch.

728
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,611
Okay, you were sticking it
last week.

729
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,779
Are you sticking it again?

730
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,315
- Right, because I won
twice in one week, so--

731
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,650
- But one of them times
was a Eureka wig.

732
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,986
- That I borrowed from Monique.

733
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,921
I earned that wig
fair and square.

734
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,456
You gotta let that go,
Miss Thing.

735
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,058
- Can we talk about
how your best drag

736
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,226
is someone else's wig,
though?

737
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,360
That's confusing.

738
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,928
- Ooh.
- I brought my best drag.

739
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,064
I didn't borrow my best drag.
- You brought your best drag?

740
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,932
Why didn't you wear it
on the runway, though?

741
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:18,369
- Obviously we weren't
being judged on our drag.

742
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,971
- You got read.
Is the library open?

743
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:21,806
- I'm saying
the hair was borrowed.

744
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,808
- I had another wig
that matched the dress, as well.

745
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,377
- Okay, I'm just saying.

746
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,912
- So what are you saying?
That I won?

747
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:30,014
So I won,
and you were in the bottom.

748
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,415
You wanted to be shady.
It didn't work.

749
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,417
- America, let the facts
be the facts.

750
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,020
Vixen handed Aquaria her ass

751
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,856
in a gift bag, gift-wrapped.

752
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,292
There you go.
Merry Christmas.

753
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:42,960
- So let's talk about--
- Aah!

754
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,595
A spider!

755
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,596
- What?
- Aah!

756
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,098
- I can't--I can't--I can't.

757
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,132
I know I'm queening out.
I can't.

758
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,902
Aah! It's a big one!
I told you.

759
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,471
- It's huge!
- Aah!

760
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,672
- Aah!
- It's just a spider.

761
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,673
- You can see it
through the lace.

762
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,908
- It's a dinosaur.
Did you see it?

763
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:58,576
- Oh, Kameron, you're a bitch.
- It's huge.

764
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,878
- Aah! Oh, my God!

765
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,381
- It is a spi--
oh, my Lord.

766
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,883
- That spider
saved Aquaria's life.

767
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,855
- Blair, how was your team?
You're a team leader.

768
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,190
- Our scene that we were selling
was called "End of Days,"

769
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,992
so we came up with
the storyline

770
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,761
that the end of the world,

771
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,763
like the Rapture
is coming kind of thing.

772
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,098
- You made it religious?
- A little, yeah.

773
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,700
But we weren't making fun
of religion in it.

774
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,769
I grew up in an extremely
Christian household.

775
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,870
- Same.

776
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,005
- My parents
are very, very religious.

777
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,674
- But I find it so interesting,

778
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:32,076
because your parents are so
supportive of you and your drag.

779
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,979
- Yeah. My mom is seriously
my biggest 100% supporter.

780
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,915
My mom wears around, like,
Number 1 like Blair fan.

781
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,317
- My parents have never
seen me in a show.

782
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,284
I don't think they'll ever come.

783
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,652
- Never?
- No.

784
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,254
- So, like, they're still
not supportive to this day?

785
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,524
- Me and my family
don't really talk anymore.

786
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,993
It feels good to hear

787
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:52,430
that Blair came from
a really conservative,

788
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,398
religious family,

789
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,934
and everything is working out
just fine for them.

790
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,803
My family
doesn't even know I'm here.

791
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,104
When I came out to my family,

792
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,339
the night before it happened,

793
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,741
I literally was like
at my breaking point.

794
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,476
Like I was at my lowest low
with everything.

795
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,345
And I literally, like,
cried out to God,

796
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,613
and was like,
I need a change in my life.

797
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:10,147
Like, I need something
to happen

798
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,782
and to be different for me.

799
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,618
And then literally the next
morning, my mom was like,

800
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,886
hey, come downstairs,
we need to talk about this,

801
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,556
and the whole
me coming out happened.

802
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,158
My mom knocks on my door
and says,

803
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,728
uh, your dad just found
something on your computer.

804
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,129
They lost it.

805
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:29,200
They took me to church.
They got me exorcised

806
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:32,870
because they thought I was
possessed by a gay demon.

807
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,339
I had this like prayer warrior
sitting in front of me.

808
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,608
My mom and dad were standing
behind her looking at me.

809
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,944
I had to list every person

810
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,812
I've ever had
a sexual encounter with.

811
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,883
I was so confused after
the whole thing went down,

812
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,319
because was I straight now?

813
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,422
Like...

814
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,658
I had to go through therapy.

815
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,060
- Oh, my God.
- And I was on a track

816
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,628
to go to straight camp.
- That's crazy.

817
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,897
- I was meeting
with these pastors,

818
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,333
and he was like,
"In a homosexual relationship,

819
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,268
you'll never find success.

820
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,103
You'll never find love."

821
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,106
[sobs]

822
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,809
And I stopped him
and I went upstairs

823
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,110
and I packed
my car.

824
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,112
I said I can't do this anymore.

825
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:24,989
It was the most humiliating,
awful thing of my life ever.

826
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,091
Now I have a wonderful fiancé.

827
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,026
We have a beautiful life
together.

828
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,928
Things are going
really great in my life,

829
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,064
and I didn't have
to compromise or change

830
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:36,867
for someone's small-minded view.

831
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,036
But it was a journey.

832
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,107
I still believe in God because
I cried out and I was heard.

833
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,743
My whole life is different
because of that day.

834
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:49,146
- Yeah. It's gut-wrenching
to feel like these little boys

835
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,549
were in communities where
they thought they were loved.

836
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:55,553
But to have these experiences
where you are so ostracized,

837
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,188
and you feel like
you can turn to no one else,

838
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,124
it makes me grateful to know
that I never had to endure that.

839
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,026
I still go to church
every Sunday morning.

840
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,762
I'm the section leader
of a Methodist Church, girl.

841
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,864
I go to choir rehearsal
on Wednesdays in full drag.

842
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,898
- Yay!
- Do you really?

843
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,034
- Yes.
- That is amazing.

844
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,570
- Hearing everyone's story

845
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:16,307
is truly helping me see
the truth of who they are.

846
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,275
We come here with big makeup,
big hair,

847
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,746
and it's easy
to live behind a character.

848
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:24,849
So it's so great
to see vulnerability.

849
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,083
- When y'all come
to New York City,

850
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,885
we all gonna go to my church
in full drag.

851
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,854
- Yeah!
- And they will live for it.

852
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,757
- I might have to meet y'all
at brunch afterwards.

853
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,730
- Girl, can y'all stop being
so negative all the time?

854
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,831
Jeez.
- What'd you call me?

855
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,266
- Negative.

856
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,135
- Was it something I said?

857
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,202
- Aquaria, what happened?

858
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,604
- No, Vixen's just a bitch.

859
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,340
And she's just trying to like
get my goat at everything,

860
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,175
so I'm not--
- Apparently I got it.

861
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:52,743
- Ooh.
- Y'all quit.

862
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,245
- You don't have to keep
like coming at me.

863
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,780
- But I can.
- That's fine, and--

864
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:56,847
- And it is.

865
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,382
- Will you just
shut the fuck up?

866
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,617
- I will if I feel like it.

867
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,152
- All right, then keep talking.

868
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,888
- You threw the rock,
hit your head, and got spanked.

869
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:05,022
Deal with it.

870
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,091
Deal with it.

871
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,460
- Can't we be sisters
at least sometimes?

872
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,995
- She ain't no kin to me.

873
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:11,996
- You came for me.

874
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,465
- And you got got.
- Stop it.

875
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,666
- I was just saying
that it's clear

876
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,301
that the runways
aren't being judged.

877
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,335
- Ooh.

878
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,770
- If the runways
weren't being judged,

879
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,272
then me wearing that hair on the
runway would not be an issue.

880
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,640
So what is your point?

881
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,775
I was just saying that
it was interesting--

882
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,243
- So if the runways
aren't being judged,

883
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,813
me wearing that hair
on the runway was mute.

884
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:29,914
- I'm not talking to you, Vixen.

885
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,248
- All right, well,
silent you shall be.

886
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,817
- Silent I was.

887
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,351
You're the one with the problem.

888
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,387
- That's all.

889
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:38,122
- Aquaria.

890
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,657
Oh, she's exiting.

891
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,226
- You knew
that I was a pit bull.

892
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,828
- So why don't you be
the bigger person?

893
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,930
- I hear what you're saying,
be the bigger person.

894
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,065
- South Chicago don't need
to be here right now.

895
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,568
- Oh, but South Chicago
is in the building.

896
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,702
- Vixen, she told y'all

897
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,970
from the first word that
came out of her mouth--

898
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,139
- You wanna fight, girl.
She said it.

899
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
- And I'm not here
to fight y'all.

900
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,141
I'm here to fight for the crown.

901
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,242
But if you try it--

902
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,810
- Ooh.

903
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,811
- The problem with Aquaria is

904
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,314
she likes to poke the bear
and run.

905
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,715
This bear will chase you.

906
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,084
So if I have to hunt her down
to remind her

907
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,854
that I am not to play with,
that's what I'm gonna do.

00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:45,950
I have white feathers dripping
from my shoulder tip to my toes.

a nest on my fire escape.

So this is in honor of him.

from the 18th century.

if they had feathers then,

- I thought I saw a puddy cat.

1032
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,644
- I'm on the runway

1033
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,312

for a second think,

1034
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,747

00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,720
So I am just modeling

1039
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,489
and living
my Tweety Bird fantasy.

1040
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,024
- Anyone got eyes on Asia?

1041
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,026
[all laugh]

1042
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,694
- Yuhua Hamasaki.

1043
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,997
Murder, she crowed.

1044
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,031
[all laugh]

1045
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,367
- I am wearing
a black feathered dress

1046
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:25,435
with stick-up crows,

1047
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,503
and they're just flying to me

1048
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,704
because I'm the queen
of the crows.

1049
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,106
I feel amazing.

1050
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,742
I'm embodying
the shape of that dress.

1051
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,710
It is very Alexander McQueen
inspired.

1052
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,046
- This is really a look
to crow about.

1053
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,047
- Ca-caw!

1054
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,982
[all laugh]

1055
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,585
- Aquaria.
- Mmm.

1056
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,620
- Are you okay, Cupid?

1057
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,455
- My look this week

1058
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:49,092
is a cross between St. Sebastian
and a wounded bird.

1059
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:53,130
I'm projecting complete agony
and melodrama.

1060
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,399
Some people kill
two birds with one stone.

1061
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,801
I decided to kill one bird
with two arrows.

1062
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,904
- This is what it sounds like
when doves cry.

1063
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:01,838
[all laugh]

1064
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,275
- Welcome, ladies.

1065
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,579
It's time to screen
your commercials.

1066
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,349
First up, Team Blair St. Clair.

1067
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,219
I do declare.

1068
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,687
- Heaven help us alive, Jesus.

1069
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:20,157
The end is near!
You, you, the end is near!

1070
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,725
- Whatever do you mean?

1071
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,228
- Find someone to love you
and hug you and hold you, girl.

1072
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:25,462
The end is near!
- Oh!

1073
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,997
- Don't die alone.

1074
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,299
Run!

1075
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,702
- Oh, ladies, ladies,
haven't you heard?

1076
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,137
The end of the world is coming.

1077
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,406
- Yeah, we know, girl.
[all laugh]

1078
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,809
- I can't die tired or hungry,

1079
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,644
or worse...

1080
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,946
a virgin!

1081
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,849
- Sweetheart, snap out of it.

1082
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,119
Anybody who's worried
about the end of days has...

1083
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,654
"End of Days."

1084
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:51,688
- The same thing as

1085
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,123
Christian Tingle.

1086
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,426
- It's just a new dating app
for doomsday preppers

1087
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,029
who want to find
that special someone...

1088
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,332
[deep voice]
before it's too late.

1089
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,902
I was all alone in my bunker,
rocking back and forth.

1090
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,771
Now I have someone to

1091
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,406
rock my world.

1092
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,841
"End of Days."

1093
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,976
Together till the end.

1094
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,712
- I was stealing food from
the grocery store alone.

1095
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,115
Now I've got a partner in crime.

1096
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:22,152
I love End of Days because
there's just never enough.

1097
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,520
[laughs]

1098
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,222
[snorts and laughs]

1099
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:28,859
- But how can I get
my end of days?

1100
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,926
- All you gotta do

1101
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,994
is download the app.

1102
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,095
What are you waiting for?

1103
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,331
- Maybe it isn't
the end of the world.

1104
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:35,599
I got a hit.

1105
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:39,770
- "End of Days,"
till death do us part.

1106
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,905
- Oh. [laughs]

1107
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,743
- The end  <i>is  </i>near.

1108
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,845
[doink]
Thanks, "End of Days."

1109
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:51,014
Armageddon laid tonight.

1110
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,650
[all laugh]

1111
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,753
[applause]

1112
00:40:56,754 --> 00:41:00,524
- Up next, Team Monique Heart.

1113
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,093
- Are you a pathological liar?

1114
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:06,029
Is truth serum
not your cup of tea?

1115
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,700
Is it hard to show people
the real you?

1116
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,369
Introducing "Fibstr,"
the new app

1117
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,339
for pathological liars
looking for love.

1118
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,408
So no bottom feeding for you
anymore, catfish.

1119
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,743
[deep voice]
Unless you're into that.

1120
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,978
[coughs and laughs]

1121
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,981
- I'm Judy. I'm a 26-year-old
gorgeous teacher

1122
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,617
on vacation here
at this beautiful resort.

1123
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,822
I'm looking for a man who can
handle all my personalities.

1124
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,690
It's hard to find true love

1125
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,059
when you have Samantha,
[deep voice] Becky,

1126
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,061
[southern accent]
and Tim living inside you.

1127
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,196
[all laugh]

1128
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,931
- Hi, my name is Taneesha,

1129
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,733
spelled just like it sounds.

1130
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,836
I live in Beverly Hills
in a six-bedroom mansion.

1131
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:50,507
I'm looking for a man who loves
houseguests and house visitors.

1132
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,175
- It's me, Tammy.

1133
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,777
[Valley girl accent]
I'm totally a California girl,

1134
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:56,413
tall, blonde,
with an awesome tan.

1135
00:41:56,414 --> 00:42:00,250
I'm looking for a super dude
that totes down for hiking,

1136
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,519
going to the farmers market
on the weekends,

1137
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,423
and down for a girl who's
not afraid to take charge.

1138
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:09,960
- Simply log in and
one little white lie

1139
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,497
can lead to a lifetime
of happiness.

1140
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,633
- Thanks to "Fibstr,"
all of us have found true love.

1141
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,436
[deep voice]
And he loves all of us.

1142
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,271
- Thanks, "Fibstr,"
for helping me find

1143
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,908
a man that loves me
and my true beauty.

1144
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,543
It's one
of our houseguests, hon.

1145
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,878
Let 'em play.
[all laugh]

1146
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,348
- [tough voice]
Let's get out of here.

1147
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,049
I'm gonna make you my new bitch.

1148
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,988
All: Thanks, "Fibstr."

1149
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,656
- It's not lying.

1150
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,792
It's "Fibstr."

1151
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:47,597
[applause]

1152
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,634
- Up next, Team Monét X Change.

1153
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:55,305
- Ever been at a $3.00 matinee
with that special girl?

1154
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,540
A romantic scene comes up,

1155
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,975
and you want something sexy
to grab onto.

1156
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,410
Just one problem.

1157
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,312
Feels like a bag of bricks.

1158
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,080
- Welcome to "Madam Buttrface,"

1159
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,049
the revolutionary new dating app

where you can score
that sexy chick

1161
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,086
with a face you'd rather
shove into a pillow.

1162
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,089
Wanna take your old lady
to the beach,

1163
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,659
but don't want your friends
to clock that busted body?

1164
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,194
Try "Madam Buttrface."

1165
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,696
- Everyone knows
that during the summertime...

1166
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:25,869
A banging body is way more
important than a cute face.

1167
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,637
Come to "Madam Buttrface,"

1168
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,140
where you can get yourself
a cute girl like me

1169
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:31,975
with a Baywatch body,

1170
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,611
even though
she got a hurricane face.

1171
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,146
[all laugh]

1172
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:37,647
- For a night out on the town,

1173
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:40,750
it's crucial to have
a hot lady to show around.

1174
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,919
Whether you're at the club
or just want someone to hug,

1175
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,754
download "Madam Buttrface,"

1176
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,123
and we can help you
find some love.

1177
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,459
- I was invited to
this super exclusive party,

1178
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,394
but I didn't even have
a hot date.

1179
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,863
Thanks to "Madam Buttrface,"

1180
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:56,500
I found a hot guy
who could take all this body

1181
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:59,636
without worrying about
this busted face.

1182
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,239
- Need that hot chick to impress
your friends at the gym?

1183
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,775
Well, now she's only a swipe
away with "Madam Buttrface."

1184
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,179
- My hot and flexible body

1185
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,115
allows me to exercise
in all different positions.

1186
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,416
And with my strong hands,

1187
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,819
I can hold onto your weight

1188
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,687
and your friend's weight.

1189
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,923
Oh, wow, so heavy.

1190
00:44:19,924 --> 00:44:21,892
And thank you,
"Madam Buttrface."

1191
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:25,462
Without you,
I would be single forever.

1192
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:28,131
- Don't these men look
delightfully awkward

1193
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,566
with their paper bag beauties?

1194
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,069
Who needs to date a dud
when you can have a buttrface?

1195
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,471
[all laugh]

1196
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:35,972
- Everything's better...

1197
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,541
[deep voice]
with a buttrface.

1198
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,276
[all laugh]

1199
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,278
[applause]
- Whoo.

1200
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,413
- On a scale of 1 to 10,

1201
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,348
I'm gonna give myself an 8,

1202
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:49,719
Aquaria a 7, Monét a 6,
and Yuhua a 2.

1203
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,154
I'm gonna have to do the math
and get back to you,

1204
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,089
but I don't think
that averages out

1205
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,291
to a winning performance.

1206
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,530
- Ladies, this week
you worked as teams.

1207
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:03,468
But tonight, you'll
be judged individually.

1208
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:06,237
- Yikes. This is not good.

1209
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:10,208
- Now when I call your name,
please step forward.

1210
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:13,178
Asia O'Hara.

1211
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:15,914
Eureka.

1212
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,351
Blair St. Clair.

1213
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,422
You are the tops of the week.

1214
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:27,125
[applause]

1215
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,196
- Yuhua Hamasaki.

1216
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,966
Kameron Michaels.

1217
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:36,134
Mayhem Miller.

1218
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,006
You are the bottom three.

1219
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,143
The rest of you are safe.

1220
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,446
And you may leave the stage.

1221
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,319
- It's time

1222
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,319
for the judges' critiques.

1223
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,655
Up first, Blair St. Clair.

1224
00:45:57,656 --> 00:45:59,491
- I will say this is not
one of my favorite looks.

1225
00:45:59,492 --> 00:46:01,459
It looks a little bit
arts-and-craftsy.

1226
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,627
- I have to disagree.

1227
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:04,763
I don't think it looks
arts-and-craftsy to me.

1228
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:05,930
It almost is giving me

1229
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:09,501
like a Marchesa
Chicken Ranch wedding moment.

1230
00:46:09,502 --> 00:46:12,070
You were the "End of Days" team,

1231
00:46:12,071 --> 00:46:15,006
and you waltzed in there
in your Amish Amy Adams getup.

1232
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:16,007
- Mm-hmm.

1233
00:46:16,008 --> 00:46:17,675
- And I appreciated
your leadership.

1234
00:46:17,676 --> 00:46:20,178
I think these commercials
are about three things:

1235
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:22,747
about concept, comedy,
and about teamwork,

1236
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:26,584
and I think you did
all of those beautifully.

1237
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:28,553
- You're obviously
some sort of seasoned actor.

1238
00:46:28,554 --> 00:46:32,624
It's not an app maybe I'd use,
but I'd think about it

1239
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,894
if it was, you know, Armageddon,
which may be coming.

1240
00:46:35,895 --> 00:46:39,197
[all laugh]

1241
00:46:39,198 --> 00:46:41,066
- Up next, Eureka.

1242
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,333
- I'm so happy to see you here.

1243
00:46:42,334 --> 00:46:45,603
I was such a big fan
in season 9.

1244
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:47,172
- Oh, thank you.

1245
00:46:47,173 --> 00:46:48,673
- You definitely
brought it tonight.

1246
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:50,809
- Welcome back
to the competition, Eureka.

1247
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,244
- Thank you. I feel like
I finally showed up.

1248
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:55,780
- This is the level of Eureka
we expect to see.

1249
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:58,983
And the funniest line almost
out of them was, "I know, girl."

1250
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,485
- Yeah, that was the best.

1251
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:02,454
- It's so simple,
but it's just you being you.

1252
00:47:02,455 --> 00:47:05,023
- This particular look,
why I love this,

1253
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,958
is that you're giving us drama,

1254
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:08,927
you're giving us
glamorous makeup.

1255
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:10,161
- I love all the goth stuff.

1256
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:13,765
Putting that raven on your hand,
it's great drag.

1257
00:47:13,766 --> 00:47:15,333
- Oh, that was a raven critique.

1258
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,901
[all laugh]

1259
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:19,571
- Up next, Mayhem Miller.

1260
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:20,939
- That's a beautiful color
on you.

1261
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,575
Your makeup is,
as always, flawless.

1262
00:47:23,576 --> 00:47:25,777
And I think the reason
that you're in the bottom

1263
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:28,179
is because of what happened
in your commercial.

1264
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,183
- We didn't notice you even
in this commercial.

1265
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:34,919
You appeared at the end
and the joke wasn't tight,

1266
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,888
and there wasn't like
a yin to the yang of it.

1267
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:39,290
And it's just like,
hmm, I don't get it.

1268
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:42,160
- The joke was so disjointed
it didn't play.

1269
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:44,929
You probably knew
it wasn't going to work.

1270
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:45,964
- I did.

1271
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:47,632
- Did you say something
to your team?

1272
00:47:47,633 --> 00:47:50,768
- Um, no, because
I wanted to be a team player.

1273
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:52,871
- Who was the person
you were supposed to tell

1274
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:54,772
that you didn't like that?

1275
00:47:54,773 --> 00:47:57,675
- Monique.
She was our team leader.

1276
00:47:57,676 --> 00:48:01,513
- So was there
some kind of clash?

1277
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:03,982
- She was very direct
in what she wanted.

1278
00:48:03,983 --> 00:48:06,151
So I was like, okay,
I'm gonna fall back,

1279
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:09,420
because I know if I was
to try to enforce something,

1280
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:10,622
I would get shut down.

1281
00:48:10,623 --> 00:48:14,826
- You realize that you
get one shot each week.

1282
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:16,361
It could be your time to go.

1283
00:48:16,362 --> 00:48:17,795
On this show, you didn't come
to make friends.

1284
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:19,564
You came to win a competition.

1285
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,768
- Up next, Kameron Michaels.

1286
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:26,037
- I hate minimalism.

1287
00:48:26,038 --> 00:48:28,006
So when I saw you come out
in this look,

1288
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:30,074
which is like Malifi-Cher.

1289
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:31,643
[all laugh]

1290
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:32,877
The shoulder detail,

1291
00:48:32,878 --> 00:48:35,079
how the arms and the wings
kind of move,

1292
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,414
and they're like mechanical.

1293
00:48:36,415 --> 00:48:40,051
The bodysuit is kind of like
a Bob Mackie moment.

1294
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:43,421
- The Bob Plockey.
- It's a Bob Plockey, yeah.

1295
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,890
- I am shocked that you are
in the bottom three this week.

1296
00:48:45,891 --> 00:48:49,260
This look is one of
my favorites of the night.

1297
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,362
- Thank you.
- Your performance, however,

1298
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:54,432
that's why you're standing
in the bottom three.

1299
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:56,301
It was very flat.

1300
00:48:56,302 --> 00:48:57,502
I'm getting the feeling

1301
00:48:57,503 --> 00:48:59,404
that acting is not
your favorite thing to do.

1302
00:48:59,405 --> 00:49:03,474
- I think my problem with it
was I had one funny line.

1303
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:06,044
- But sometimes
the most boring words

1304
00:49:06,045 --> 00:49:08,413
are the ones that can be
the most impactful or funny.

1305
00:49:08,414 --> 00:49:09,480
And if a director
gives you direction,

1306
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:10,715
you have to really take it.

1307
00:49:10,716 --> 00:49:12,584
- Yeah.

1308
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:14,619
- Up next, Asia O'Hara.

1309
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,755
- I think fashion oftentimes
is about references,

1310
00:49:17,756 --> 00:49:19,924
and this interpretation of it
is so good.

1311
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:23,194
The Tweety Bird,
the eyes, the coloring.

1312
00:49:23,195 --> 00:49:24,162
The glove detail is great,

1313
00:49:24,163 --> 00:49:25,230
because
when you clasp your hands,

1314
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:27,065
it looks like
the Tweety Bird beak.

1315
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:30,068
- It could Moschino couture.
It's witty.

1316
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:33,471
Your face is hidden, but
it's obviously very beautiful.

1317
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:34,539
- Normally when I hate
when your face is blocked,

1318
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,574
but the way you did it,

1319
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:40,311
with the blowing up,
the Tweety thing, it all works.

1320
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:42,914
And literally my favorite part
of the entire challenge

1321
00:49:42,915 --> 00:49:45,250
was your face behind them.

1322
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:46,684
- I think
it was the favorite part

1323
00:49:46,685 --> 00:49:48,119
of the last 10 years of my life.

1324
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,121
[all laugh]

1325
00:49:50,122 --> 00:49:52,957
- It's the only part of that
entire commercial that popped.

1326
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,959
Just bow down killed it.

1327
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,227
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1328
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:59,597
- Up next, Yuhua Hamasaki.

1329
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:00,698
- Tonight on the runway,

1330
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:02,567
your head feels like
a different look.

1331
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:03,868
I just feel like the red flowers

1332
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,770
are saying something different
than the goth dress.

1333
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:07,905
- The crows in Asian culture
means death,

1334
00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:11,009
so I wanted to emphasize like
an Asian queen of the crows.

1335
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,411
- Which is great, except
nobody is going to get that.

1336
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,848
- Title of the video
is "Buttrface."

1337
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:19,017
Your face
actually looked pretty.

1338
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:22,287
- I think you focused on
looking crazier versus ugly,

1339
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:23,821
where Asia just looked ugly.

1340
00:50:23,822 --> 00:50:27,158
She put regular moles,
a smashed-down nose.

1341
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:28,393
- I did moles.

1342
00:50:28,394 --> 00:50:31,329
- It looked more like a club kid
than it did ugly.

1343
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,497
- Yeah, that's what it was.

1344
00:50:32,498 --> 00:50:34,799
- I originally wanted
to put on the ugly nose,

1345
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,934
but my teammates said no,
so I didn't put it on.

1346
00:50:36,935 --> 00:50:40,438
- Your performance in the ad.

1347
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:42,874
The few times
that we did your ball line,

1348
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:44,909
it didn't go anywhere.
- Yeah.

1349
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,178
- I didn't get that joke.
Your hands were tied

1350
00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:48,913
with dialogue that wasn't great.

1351
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:50,381
Who wrote your dialogue?

1352
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:51,683
- I wrote my own dialogue.

1353
00:50:51,684 --> 00:50:53,484
- Okay. I think that--

1354
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:55,520
- I felt like I was rushed.

1355
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:57,955
I was told to hurry up
every second.

1356
00:50:57,956 --> 00:51:00,692
- You should know that
we're not gonna let you do that.

1357
00:51:00,693 --> 00:51:03,361
I was giving you a time count.

1358
00:51:03,362 --> 00:51:04,796
You have to be responsible
for you.

1359
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:06,164
- Okay.

1360
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:07,665
- Thank you, ladies.

1361
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:10,168
While you untuck backstage,

1362
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:12,170
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1363
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:16,774
Now, just between
us squirrel-friends,

1364
00:51:16,775 --> 00:51:19,043
what do you think of my girls?

1365
00:51:19,044 --> 00:51:22,580
Blair St. Clair, I do declare.

1366
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:25,316
- She's definitely buttoned up
like a theater kid is.

1367
00:51:25,317 --> 00:51:29,420
I'm excited to see more
of her quirky-dirky self.

1368
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:30,655
- I think she has
the right attitude.

1369
00:51:30,656 --> 00:51:31,956
She took great direction.
Willing to learn.

1370
00:51:31,957 --> 00:51:35,126
- In the walk, I have to say,
at first I was like,

1371
00:51:35,127 --> 00:51:36,861
is she going for
an old Hollywood Marilyn look?

1372
00:51:36,862 --> 00:51:38,296
And I was like no,

1373
00:51:38,297 --> 00:51:44,302
it's like, Doris Day G-rated,
something not quite there.

1374
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:47,071
- But I think she's gonna grow
and it's gonna be great.

1375
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:48,172
She'll be the total package.

1376
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:49,173
- TP?

1377
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:50,408
- The TP.
- Okay.

1378
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:51,542
Eureka.

1379
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:53,544
- She kind of stumbled
last week,

1380
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:56,080
but she felt the sting,
and I think because of that,

1381
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:58,049
she delivered it all for us
tonight on the runway.

1382
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,518
- Yzma, Little Mermaid,
Ursula hair.

1383
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:02,086
- Uh-huh.
- Which I love.

1384
00:52:02,087 --> 00:52:03,588
I'm a Eureka fan.

1385
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:07,225
- In the app commercial, once
she just relaxed into herself

1386
00:52:07,226 --> 00:52:08,226
and did it the Eureka way...

1387
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:09,794
- Yeah, we know, girl.

1388
00:52:09,795 --> 00:52:10,995
- It was wonderful.

1389
00:52:10,996 --> 00:52:12,563
- You live long enough,
and you realize

1390
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:13,831
you just do you.

1391
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:14,932
- Yes.
- You know what I mean?

1392
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:16,534
Mayhem Miller.

1393
00:52:16,535 --> 00:52:18,903
- Mayhem was flawless tonight
on the runway.

1394
00:52:18,904 --> 00:52:22,373
She's just one of those magical
queens that do it effortlessly.

1395
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:23,541
- I'm sorry, Michelle,

1396
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:24,942
I just didn't think
that dress was enough.

1397
00:52:24,943 --> 00:52:27,245
Like from the neck up, it looked
like she was like a realtor.

1398
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:28,913
- So arts and crafts
is more creative

1399
00:52:28,914 --> 00:52:30,081
than that magenta beauty?

1400
00:52:30,082 --> 00:52:32,183
- I thought that was
a better head to toe.

1401
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:35,219
- Oh, stop.
- I'm gonna agree with Carson.

1402
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,354
- Oh, Courtney!

1403
00:52:36,355 --> 00:52:37,422
- I thought
it was kind of blah.

1404
00:52:37,423 --> 00:52:38,423
- Thank you, Courtney.

1405
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:40,525
- It was a little meh-hem.

1406
00:52:40,526 --> 00:52:41,893
[all laugh]

1407
00:52:41,894 --> 00:52:43,761
- I made my first quip.
[all laugh]

1408
00:52:43,762 --> 00:52:46,297
- In the app, I think
she was a victim of circumstance

1409
00:52:46,298 --> 00:52:47,698
and not speaking up.

1410
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:48,733
- The whole idea is that

1411
00:52:48,734 --> 00:52:50,301
she didn't wanna ruffle
any feathers,

1412
00:52:50,302 --> 00:52:52,236
pun intended.

1413
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:54,338
You can be respectful about it,
and just say, listen,

1414
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:55,406
I'm not comfortable with this.

1415
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:56,441
Because they didn't know

1416
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:57,875
they were getting judged
individually.

1417
00:52:57,876 --> 00:52:59,110
They should have all
been trying

1418
00:52:59,111 --> 00:53:00,878
to make it the best
commercial possible,

1419
00:53:00,879 --> 00:53:02,780
and I don't think
she stepped up and did that.

1420
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:05,616
- Kameron Michaels
with that gorgeous outfit.

1421
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:08,553
- Yeah, the runway look
was just embellished so well.

1422
00:53:08,554 --> 00:53:12,089
But she was dismal
in the app commercial.

1423
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,391
- And literally we tried
so many times to--

1424
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:14,492
- 10 times.

1425
00:53:14,493 --> 00:53:16,594
- And she just--
every line was like this.

1426
00:53:16,595 --> 00:53:17,962
I delivered it like that.

1427
00:53:17,963 --> 00:53:20,298
- You know,
the bit just didn't work.

1428
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:21,933
Asia O'Hara.

1429
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:24,869
- When we pushed her to be ugly
and have fun and be stupid,

1430
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,304
it was like a release for her,

1431
00:53:26,305 --> 00:53:27,638
and she stole the show.

1432
00:53:27,639 --> 00:53:28,973
- Right.

1433
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:29,974
- She didn't have
that many lines.

1434
00:53:29,975 --> 00:53:31,943
She just had
a full character choice.

1435
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:34,412
- I thought that she really
brought it with Tweety Bird.

1436
00:53:34,413 --> 00:53:36,113
She brought modern, pop art.

1437
00:53:36,114 --> 00:53:38,182
- This is what I love
about drag.

1438
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:39,684
Thinking outside the box.

1439
00:53:39,685 --> 00:53:41,486
I'm so excited about Asia.

1440
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:43,621
- Yuhua Hamasaki.

1441
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:45,122
- In the app commercial,

1442
00:53:45,123 --> 00:53:48,025
the look was just like
a hairy dalmatian with HPV.

1443
00:53:48,026 --> 00:53:50,161
- Ooh, that sounds sexy.
- I knew you'd like that.

1444
00:53:50,162 --> 00:53:51,462
- I'm getting turned on
as well.

1445
00:53:51,463 --> 00:53:53,498
- That's why I said it.
You're welcome.

1446
00:53:53,499 --> 00:53:56,934
And then tonight on the runway,
it was very costume-y.

1447
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:58,302
- Even when you critiqued it,

1448
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:00,505
she brought up this whole story
about Asian heritage, too,

1449
00:54:00,506 --> 00:54:01,739
and it had nothing to do

1450
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,341
with what you said
about the color combination.

1451
00:54:03,342 --> 00:54:05,309
- I just feel like
everything's got a clap-back.

1452
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,578
- It was a little tiresome.
I don't know.

1453
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:09,046
- I have one thing to say.

1454
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:11,082
Yuhua in danger, girl.

1455
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:12,316
[all laugh]
- True.

1456
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:13,951
- [clap, clap] Silence.

1457
00:54:13,952 --> 00:54:15,786
I've made my decision.

1458
00:54:15,787 --> 00:54:17,822
Bring back my birds.

1459
00:54:17,823 --> 00:54:19,690
- Welcome back, ladies.

1460
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:21,626
I've made some decisions.

1461
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:27,265
Blair St. Clair,
you're a plucky girl.

1462
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,568
You're safe.

1463
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:35,106
Asia O'Hara.

1464
00:54:35,107 --> 00:54:38,910
Your Tweety chic
was the peak of the week.

1465
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:44,315
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

1466
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:46,050
[applause]
- Ooh.

1467
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:51,188
- You've won a $2,000 gift card
from Casper Sleep

1468
00:54:51,189 --> 00:54:56,494
and a $3,000 gift card
from Catherine D'Lish.

1469
00:54:56,495 --> 00:54:57,528
- Yeah!

1470
00:54:57,529 --> 00:54:58,996
- Oh, my God.

1471
00:54:58,997 --> 00:55:02,033
I won. Tweety Bird
worked out for me.

1472
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:05,002
And I'm so happy
to hear Ru say

1473
00:55:05,003 --> 00:55:07,471
Asia O'Hara,
con-drag-ulations.

1474
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:10,641
Eureka.

1475
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:13,778
After a "fowl" performance
last week,

1476
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:15,646
tonight you soared.

1477
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:19,050
You're safe.
- Thank you all so much.

1478
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:21,285
- Yuhua Hamasaki.

1479
00:55:21,286 --> 00:55:24,322
The judges were not crowing

1480
00:55:24,323 --> 00:55:26,223
about your performance
this week.

1481
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,061
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1482
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:33,431
Mayhem Miller.

1483
00:55:33,432 --> 00:55:36,233
This week,
your wings were clipped,

1484
00:55:36,234 --> 00:55:38,536
and you failed to take flight.

1485
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:45,443
Kameron Michaels,
your runway look slayed,

1486
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:49,480
but in the challenge,
you laid an egg.

1487
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:56,787
- Mayhem Miller,

1488
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:59,423
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.

1489
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:03,961
- Kameron, you're safe.

1490
00:56:03,962 --> 00:56:06,230
Join the other girls.

1491
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:10,835
Two queens stand before me.

1492
00:56:10,836 --> 00:56:12,937
Prior to tonight,

1493
00:56:12,938 --> 00:56:16,540
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

1494
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:19,543
of "Celebrity Skin" by Hole.

1495
00:56:19,544 --> 00:56:24,749
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1496
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,185
and save yourself
from elimination.

1497
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,189
- The time has come...
[thunder]

1498
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,190

00:59:16,888 --> 00:59:20,324
[cheers and applause]

1549
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,395
- There's so many thoughts
going through my head right now,

1550
00:59:24,396 --> 00:59:26,397
thoughts of me going home,

1551
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:29,200
disappointing people,
not going far enough.

1552
00:59:29,201 --> 00:59:31,335
I think the competition
got into my head a little bit,

1553
00:59:31,336 --> 00:59:34,271
because I was doing so well
in week one and week two

1554
00:59:34,272 --> 00:59:36,173
that I just got complacent.

1555
00:59:36,174 --> 00:59:37,942
All I've gotta say
to the other queens is...

1556
00:59:37,943 --> 00:59:39,009
[speaking foreign language]

1557
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,477
That means I love you.

1558
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:43,814
And may the best winner win.

1559
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:48,786
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1560
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:51,121
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1561
00:59:51,122 --> 00:59:53,057
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1562
00:59:53,058 --> 00:59:54,425
Can I get an amen up in here?

1563
00:59:54,426 --> 00:59:55,426
- Amen!
- Amen!

1564
00:59:55,427 --> 00:59:57,494
- All right.
Now let the music play.
