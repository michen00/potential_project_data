1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,202
- Previously
- On "RuPaul's Drag Race..."

2
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:06,405
You need to create
your own Drag Con panels.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,674
[cheers and applause]

4
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,310
- I am trying to focus
- On that T.

5
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:11,677
[all laugh]

6
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,979
- I'm a wig-aholic.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,481
- You wouldn't know
by looking at you.

8
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:16,916
- Oh.

9
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,719
- Hairlines are what
can look really masculine

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,088
- or go really femuline...
- Feminine. Femuline.

11
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,289
- Eureka.

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,925
- You are setting the tone.
You did such a great job.

13
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,327
- I said that. Vixen.

14
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,098
- It was just in Yiddish
- A mishegas.

15
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,430
- We were very confident,

16
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,735
and they're like, fine,
we don't need a moderator.

17
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:37,303
- Actually, you would have
benefited from a moderator.

18
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,972
That was the real issue.

19
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,442
Eureka, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

20
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,610
[applause]

21
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,579
- The Vixen, shantay, you stay.

22
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,449
Blair St. Clair, I do declare.

23
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,319
Sashay away.

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,197
- Sisters.

25
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,366
Vixen, you're here!

26
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,436
- That is not fun at all.

27
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,805
"Let me be your star."

28
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,041
- I'm gonna miss Blair so much.

29
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:15,842
- She's been one of the most
- Genuine sweet people

30
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:17,009
I've ever met.

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,080
- I am more than happy
to live another day,

32
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,152
- but I'm scared,
- Because I'm giving my drag,

33
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:28,287
and it feels like the judges
just don't get me.

34
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,323
- Congratulations on your win.

35
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,625
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:35,094
- Well, this win
is for my twin sister,

37
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,998
- because the video tonight
- In "Untucked" reminded me, yeah,

38
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:42,034
she's the strength
that I wish that I had, so...

39
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,904
- Let's just get the elephant
out of the room.

40
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:45,304
I know you were shocked.

41
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,940
- Absolutely.
- You was gagged.

42
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:49,575
- I was really trying
to like make peace

43
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,744
with, okay, you could go home
right now.

44
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:56,215
And I started thinking about all
the queens that look up to me,

45
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,451
like, I see myself in her.

46
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,153
- Y'all think
- I don't hold back now,

47
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:02,923
- y'all should...
- Y'all in trouble, 'cause...

48
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:04,657
- But one thing's for sure.

49
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,893
You care about these people
that you're a role model to.

50
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,195
Keep that in your mind
during this competition.

51
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,664
You have a level
of intelligence

52
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:12,999
and a level of love and passion

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,969
- that doesn't always have
- To be the bite from the bear.

54
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:19,038
You can show that love
and be, you know, the...

55
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,774
- Well, thank you so much
- For bringing that up.

56
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,845
Even the bear is a part
of why people look up to me,

57
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,447
- because
- That is being 100% honest.

58
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,620
- I've seen The Vixen use
- Her anger for fire and for fuel,

59
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,355
but you've got to know
when to leave it alone

60
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:38,157
and when to use it
for the greater good.

61
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,695
- I'm okay being safe,
but I'm at that middle road

62
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,398
where I go, bitch,
I know I'm stunning,

63
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,199
I know I'm talented,

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,871
- and I feel like it's the clothes
- That I have with me

65
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:53,305
that are not putting me forward.

66
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,476
My issue coming in is money.

67
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,810
My look probably
wasn't the strongest.

68
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,714
Was it probably
the most creative?

69
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:03,817
- Yeah, maybe, with
- The materials that I had

70
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,686
- in making a costume
- Literally in 30 minutes.

71
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,821
- Thank God
we're addressing this problem,

72
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:09,921
I don't have a lot
of fucking money,

73
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:11,689
but you know what?
I make things work.

74
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,160
And to see Monique literally

75
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,594
as we're walking up the stairs
to the runway,

76
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,129
she is gluing on sequins.

77
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,097
I love her to death, but you
just have to step your pussy up

78
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,167
a little bit more than that.

79
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:23,335
- You have been safe or better

80
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,605
- on outfits that
- You made in 30 minutes.

81
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:33,212
So that must mean that you have
something really big going on

82
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,049
- to make up
- For this hemless outfit.

83
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,583
Take it as a compliment.

84
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:41,187
- America, I may sew
at the last minute,

85
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,621
but my shit is right.

86
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,559
This mug is always right.
The hair always matches.

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,796
- And the bitch's personality
- Is right.

88
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,062
But you know what?

89
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,833
Bitch, if I am safe
all the way up

90
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,534
and then I win the damn crown...

91
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,671
I'll take my check.

92
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,639
[laughs]

93
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,776

- Whoo, girl.

110
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,047
She done already
done had herses.

111
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,115
Hey, queens.

112
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,619
- Hey.
- It's not about who you know.

113
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,119
It's about who you do.

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,823
And I'm not talking about
that thing with Carrot Top.

115
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,424
That was a long time ago.

116
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,828
- I was young,
- And he needed the money.

117
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,695
[all laugh]

118
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,197
Hello, hello, hello.

119
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,632
[cheers and applause]

120
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,699
- Yeah.

121
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,637
- Ladies,
as the department of education

122
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,007
continues to make
deep budget cuts,

123
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,043
we are doubling down
to our commitment

124
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,147
to teach the children
how to read.

125
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,950
[cheers and applause]

126
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,154
- The library
- Is officially open.

127
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:23,123
- Yes.
- [cheers and applause]

128
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,157
Because reading is what?

129
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,925
All: Fundamental.

130
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,428
- That's right.
- First up, Kameron Michaels.

131
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,663
- Whoo, come on, Kameron.

132
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,097
- Here you are, darling.

133
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,632
- [clears throat]

134
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,168
Eureka, we found it.

135
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,970
Girl, how could we miss it?

136
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,605
[all laugh]

137
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,407
Miss Monet X Change.

138
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,075
Ru, just an exchange?

139
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,778
I would have asked
for a full refund.

140
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,012
[all laugh]

141
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,748
- The Villain.
- I mean, The Vixen.

142
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,716
[all laugh]

143
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,953
I really think it's so fierce
that back in Chicago

144
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,055
- you have that show
- Called "Black Girl Magic."

145
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:57,691
- Now can you show me a
- Magic trick and just disappear?

146
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:59,024
[all laugh]

147
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,262
- Monique Heart,
- You've got a heart of gold,

148
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,864
- the voice of an angel,
- And a hairline

149
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,800
that looks like it's been
fucked with a weedwhacker.

150
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,101
[all laugh]
- Oh, my God.

151
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,571
- The Vixen,
- You told us from day one

152
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,205
you are here to fight.

153
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,406
Sweetheart, why don't you
fight some of those wigs

154
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:16,610
with some soap and water?

155
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,711
[all laugh]

156
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,947
Aquaria, God's gift to makeup.

157
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,484
So sorry God didn't bless you
with the gift of a personality.

158
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,086
[all laugh]

159
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,222
- Kameron Michaels, I don't
really have a read for you.

160
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,923
Please, just fuck me.

161
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,725
[all laugh]

162
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,426
Please, just fuck me!

163
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,894
[all laugh]

164
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,230
- Aquaria,
- I love you confidence.

165
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,366
You're always telling yourself
how you're beautiful,

166
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,968
how you're talented,
how you're gonna win.

167
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,603
You're also a pathological liar.

168
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,505
[all laugh]

169
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,741
The Vixen, do you have
a housekeeper, girl?

170
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,010
Your kitchen is a mess.

171
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:54,346
[all laugh]

172
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,648
Thank you all so much.

173
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,984
- I can't wait to hear your reads
- About me being fat.

174
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:00,252
[all laugh]

175
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,721
- You won't have to wait long.
- [laughs]

00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:06,392
- Eureka O'Hara, I know
you've probably seen "Dumbo"

177
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,726
like a thousand times.

178
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,930
But it doesn't matter
how big you paint these wings.

179
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,233
You are staying
on the ground, bitch.

180
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,601
[all laugh]

181
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,505
- Aquaria,
- People don't appreciate

182
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,974
- how much money
- You have to spend on makeup

183
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:23,042
when you're covering two faces.

184
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,978
- Ooh.
- [laughs]

185
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:28,013
- Kameron Michaels, I think
I speak for all the girls here

186
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,317
when I say we're really
gonna miss you next week.

187
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:33,085
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

188
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:37,957
- Eureka O'Hara,
- Stop relying on that body fat.

189
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,792
[all laugh]

190
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,295
- Miss The Vixen, though
your tumbles are stunning,

191
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,531
your hair gives me tumbleweed.

192
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,133
[all laugh]

193
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,805
- Monet X Change, girl,
- You know better to be black

194
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:52,806
using hotel lotion.

195
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,107
[all laugh]

196
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,845
- Asia O'Hara,
- You are the Amazon queen.

197
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,679
You get your tights from Amazon,

198
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,382
- you get some of your outfits
- From Amazon,

199
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,317
and apparently
they sell teeth, too.

200
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,951
[all laugh]

201
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,153
And Miz Cracker.

202
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,322
- You coin yourself
- As thin, white, and salty,

203
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:10,621
but you're forgetting bitter.

204
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:12,292
Bitter that you are
a near titty queen

205
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:14,427
- that had to fuck Bob the
- Drag Queen to get to the top.

206
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,329
[all laugh]

207
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,665
- [laughs]

208
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,400
- And that's shade.

209
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,202
- All right, ladies.

210
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:26,306
- The library
- Is officially closed.

211
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:27,940
[applause]

212
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,377
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...

213
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,212
Eureka.

214
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,347
[cheers and applause]

215
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,915
Con-drag-ulations.

216
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:42,955
You've won a $2,000 gift card
from l.a. Eyeworks.

217
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,191
- Don't be jealous
- Of all this weight, honey.

218
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:46,893
- 'Cause y'all
- Are waiting to win some.

219
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,794
- Waiting for you to go home.

220
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,562
- All right, ladies.

221
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:54,167
- Time to show me
- How far you can stretch

222
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,270
- your charisma, uniqueness,
- Nerve, and talent.

223
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:59,973
- Because for this week's
- Maxi challenge,

224
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:02,207
we're playing the Snatch Game.

225
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,144
[cheers and applause]

226
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,615
- I am so glad and proud
- To have made it to Snatch Game.

227
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:09,847
This is a mile marker.

228
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,284
Everybody wants to be here.

229
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,519
- Pick a celebrity
to impersonate,

230
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,189
and make me laugh my blank off.

231
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,691
Gentlemen, start your engines,

232
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,127
and may the best woman win.

233
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,129
[cheers and applause]

234
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,865
- Hello, RuPaul.

235
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,600
My name is Maya Angelou.

236
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,105
- Oh, my God, this week
- Is the Snatch Game.

237
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:33,973
- It is the greatest show
- I've ever seen.

238
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,141
- It's almost like Christmas
- For drag queens.

239
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:38,676
- What do you have planned?

240
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:39,879
- I'm going to be Chyna,
- The wrestler.

241
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:41,847
- What is Chyna's voice like?

242
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,249
- It's very, like, high pitched,
like up here.

243
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,418
[laughs]

244
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,954
- You sound like a ho-man.

245
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,623
- So you're definitely
doing Miss Blue Ivy?

246
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,090
- Yeah. And like

247
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,227
- who's more Black Girl Magic
- Than Blue Ivy?

248
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,129
- Just off her
- Facial expressions alone,

249
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:59,532
- I have this whole personality
- Of what I think she is.

250
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,701
- The thing about Blue
- Is we don't know how she talks.

251
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:03,936
But I get a kick
out of all the memes.

252
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,303
Her face is always telling you

253
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,240
that she is not
in the mood for it,

254
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,476
and I relate to that.

255
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:14,047
- Hey, kitty girls.
We've got company.

256
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,015
[cheers and applause]

257
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:17,950
- Yeah!

258
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,152
- Bianca del Rio is here

259
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:23,522
to lead us all
in a peaceful group mediation.

260
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,857
- Baloney.

261
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm here to say everything
hateful that RuPaul won't.

262
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:29,294
[all laugh]

263
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,432
- Oh, my God,
- It was Bianca del Rio.

264
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,833
Her Judge Judy is legendary.

265
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,535
Probably one of the best Snatch
Games in Drag Race history.

266
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:37,704
It's just really cool
to have Bianca here

267
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,438
to give us some solid advice.

268
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,341
- Well, hello, Eureka.

269
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,843
- Hello. How are you?
- Meet Bianca del Rio.

270
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:44,877
- Hi, Bianca.

271
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,546
- There's a lot of stuff here.
- Yeah.

272
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:48,147
- I see a little doggy
- Over there.

273
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,415
- Right. This is Devine,

274
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,950
and this is Honey Boo Boo.

275
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,020
- Have you done
- Either of those before?

276
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,756
- As far as Devine, I actually
- Find a lot of inspiration

277
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,125
from her character for Eureka
the character herself.

278
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,762
- Because she wasn't afraid
- To be ridiculous.

279
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,896
I'm not afraid to be silly
and ridiculous, either.

280
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,165
- That's important.

281
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,535
- Can I hear a little bit
of your impersonation?

282
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,136
- Filth. Filth is my life.

283
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,540
- I am Devine.
- Condone cannibalism.

284
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:14,606
Kill everyone.

285
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,176
- Blood.
- I love the taste of it.

286
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,480
Hot, freshly killed blood.

287
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,016
- Okay, now do Devine.

288
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,617
[all laugh]

289
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,052
- That was Devine.

290
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,222
- If you have to tell us,
- It wasn't convincing.

291
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,756
- Yeah. Okay.

292
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,791
- Honey Boo Boo is really funny.

293
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,993
I mean, that show alone,

294
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,261
- I always say,
- It's on the Learning Channel,

295
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,096
and it just shows you
what you don't wanna be.

296
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,965
- [laughs]
- But it is quite amusing.

297
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:41,300
I mean, the child is hysterical.
- Yeah.

298
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,735
- I don't know
- If she realizes she's funny

299
00:11:42,738 --> 00:11:46,005
- or if it's just the inbreeding,
- But it's really amusing.

300
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,173
- I'm just a little torn.

301
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,776
- You've seen
- How Snatch Game works.

302
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,843
You've got to go
for what you know

303
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,046
and go for the jugular.

304
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,547
I can't wait
to see you out there.

305
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,450
- Make me laugh.
- I will do my best.

306
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:58,850
- Okay.
- Trust me.

307
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,253
- See you later.

308
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,655
Well, hello, Monique Heart.

309
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:03,956
- Hello, Mama Ru.

310
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,091
- Meet Bianca.
- Hi.

311
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,793
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

312
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:09,528
So I thought I wanted
to do Maxine Waters.

313
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,763
- I mean, she's very much
- Against Trump

314
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,931
and getting him out of office.

315
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,167
- And she's right,
which makes it good.

316
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,568
- Boom.

317
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,438
But I auditioned
with Cookie Lyon.

318
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,073
- From the TV show "Empire."

319
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,641
- So I don't know.

320
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,043
- I mean,
- I don't watch "Empire,"

321
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,712
so I'm unfamiliar with
the character of Cookie.

322
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:28,814
But Maxine just seems like
the obvious choice in my world.

323
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:32,085
- I think her only strong point
- Was "reclaiming my time."

324
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,686
- Are you not familiar
with her other slogans?

325
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,924
- She has a few that I know.
- Not that many.

326
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:39,324
Now I'm drawing a blank

327
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,893
- because I'm feeling
- The pressure right now.

328
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:41,961
- That's the game.

329
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:44,162
- So if I asked you a question,

330
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,898
can you answer me back
as Maxine Waters?

331
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,899
- Yes.

332
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,534
- Madam Congresswoman,

333
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,571
- what is on the lunch menu
- For today?

334
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:53,839
- On the lunch menu today, Ru,

335
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,042
we're having greens, beans,
tomatoes, yams, collard greens,

336
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,511
you name it and I'll have it.

337
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,880
- No?
- Oh.

338
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,915
- I was thrown off
by the soft-spoken.

339
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,818
- Well, she has this really
kind of Clair Huxtable voice

340
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,188
where she hits these highs
and lows when she talks.

341
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,224
- That ain't funny.

342
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,825
Make it funny, bitch.

343
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,127
- You've got to sell it.

344
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,129
- Uh...

345
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,531
- All right. I'm gonna
ask you another question,

346
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,265
Madam Congresswoman.

347
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,034
Could you be friends with Trump?

348
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:23,602
- I surely couldn't be friends

349
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,672
- with Donald Trump's
- Little orange Cheeto ass.

350
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:28,240
- [laughs]
That's what I'm talking about.

351
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,042
- Sell it.
- Trust your gut.

352
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:32,612
- Mother Ru
- Gets me right together.

353
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:35,415
- It's reclaiming my time,
- Reclaiming my time.

354
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:36,948
Maxine Waters it is.

355
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,318
Time to give it to the children.

356
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,989
- Hey, Asia.
- Hey.

357
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:44,557
- Meet Bianca del Rio.
- Hi.

358
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,492
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

359
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,825
- So what are you thinking?

360
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,462
- My first choice
is Whitney Houston.

361
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,229
- Oh, I love Whitney Houston.

362
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,464
- So do I.

363
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,033
- Have you done Whitney
- In your act?

364
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,202
- I do it in my shows
- All the time.

365
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,403
- And when you do it
- In your act,

366
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:59,504
does it also involve
powdered sugar?

367
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,773
- It has in the past.

368
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,545
- I see, which we're probably
- Going to stay away from.

369
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,146
- It's not gonna work.

370
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:12,018
- I don't feel like
- I can make Whitney funny

371
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,952
without the whole drug thing.

372
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,588
- Now, you have
a strong Texas accent.

373
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,957
Have you thought of doing
a famous Texas person?

374
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,393
- Beyoncé.

375
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,696
It has been done,
but I can do her voice

376
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,101
- and I know what's funny
- And what's not funny about her.

377
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,335
- So I'm gonna ask you
- A question.

378
00:14:29,338 --> 00:14:32,371
- So, Beyoncé, when's
- The next album coming out?

379
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:35,273
- Well, Ru, my team and I have
been working on some things,

380
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,042
and when we know, you'll know.

381
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,845
- That was not funny at all.

382
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,514
- [all laugh]
- Oh, you're killing me.

383
00:14:41,517 --> 00:14:43,883
- Well, either she tells you now
- Or you find out later.

384
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:46,585
- So Beyoncé. Any others?

385
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,654
- Maybe one of the ex-members
- Of Destiny's Child.

386
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,722
That would be funny.

387
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,791
- Um, that's all.

388
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,360
- But we knew
- This was coming up.

389
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:56,896
- I mean, Snatch Game is kind of
- Like a Drag Race staple.

390
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,997
- [sighs]

391
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,967
I am upside down
hanging from my toenails now.

392
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,568
I still do not know

393
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,604
what the hell I'm about to do
for Snatch Game.

394
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,907
- All right, so you've got
your work cut out for you.

395
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,007
- Absolutely.

396
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,444
Oh, Jesus, be with me.

397
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,149
- Well, hello, Miz Cracker.
- Hello, Ru.

398
00:15:16,152 --> 00:15:18,718
- Now, I see
- You have a pussy bow

399
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:20,319
- on your fabulous fit form
- Over there.

400
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:22,287
- Yes, I do.
- The blouse.

401
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,822
And I see black hair.

402
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:25,091
- Would it be Edith Head?

403
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:27,526
- No, I'm looking
for Dorothy Parker.

404
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,027
- Oh.

405
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:33,633
- She is an icon of comedy
- And the one-liner,

406
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:35,968
- which is where I live
- In my comedy.

407
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,002
- Now, many people at home
won't know who that is.

408
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,305
- Yeah, and what solves it

409
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:43,275
is that she makes everything
dark, everything funny,

410
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,677
everything turns into an insult.

411
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,778
- Sounds like me.
- [laughs]

412
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,247
- I didn't want to...
- I was trying not to look at you

413
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,348
when I said that.

414
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,850
- Most people
- Try not to look at me.

415
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:54,719
- [laughs]
- She wasn't ever really gross.

416
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,390
- It was just taking a nice thing
- That someone said to her

417
00:15:57,393 --> 00:16:00,225
and bending it backwards
and jabbing them with it.

418
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,527
- Well, it is quite
a challenge, though,

419
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,094
because it's the kind of humor

420
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,363
that your receivers
have to think about.

421
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,833
It's not like, oh, ha-ha-ha.

422
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,368
So therein lies the challenge.

423
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,071
- But I wanna go
- With something that I love

424
00:16:12,074 --> 00:16:14,406
that feels like
it is absolutely me.

425
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,877
- Because last week,
- Even though I was playing,

426
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,312
I came off as mean
to other people.

427
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,014
- It's not easy.
This is really challenging.

428
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,683
- But you've got to make it
- Entertaining.

429
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:25,184
- Right.
- I mean, that's the main thing.

430
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:28,521
- All right, Miz Cracker.
- Make me laugh.

431
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:30,889
- Thank you, guys.

432
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,158
- Aquaria.
- Hi, RuPaul.

433
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,493
- Hi.
- Bianca del Rio.

434
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,460
- It's so nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you.

435
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,631
- Now I see a gorgeous
little dress with a necklace.

436
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,131
There's a Tiffany box.

437
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,401
- I'm getting with the Tiffany
box, Melania Trump.

438
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,437
- Yep.
- All right.

439
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,905
Do you consider yourself funny?

440
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,240
- You know, I don't
consider myself funny,

441
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,541
but I think my humor

442
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:53,012
- comes from a very
- Confused place in my brain.

443
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,647
- [laughs]
- I don't get my words right.

444
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,549
- I don't form sentences
- Very well.

445
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,984
- Well, it works
for our president.

446
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,584
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

447
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,120
- So I'm trying to play that up
with Melania.

448
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,390
- Yeah, I feel like words
- Get tripped up

449
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,491
because you're thinking about

450
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,426
- how you might be perceived
- By other people.

451
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,861
- I mean, in such
a tight competition,

452
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,130
- you have to be mindful
- Of your words,

453
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,200
- especially being popular online
- And stuff like that.

454
00:17:14,203 --> 00:17:16,636
- Well, the thing is,
- When you watch "Drag Race,"

455
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:20,071
the realest people are really
the ones you gravitate to.

456
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,108
- When you take a Latrice,
- Everybody's like, I love her.

457
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,441
Adore is another one.

458
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,411
It's those people that are
really their true selves.

459
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,879
- But you just need
- To trust your instincts.

460
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,078
- Mm-hmm.
- I think that's most important.

461
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,313
- Yeah, I mean,
I really can't form a sentence

462
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,414
most of the time.

463
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:31,817
- That's all right.
You're consistent.

464
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,552
- Hey.
- That's important.

465
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,720
- I definitely know

466
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,088
that my strengths lie
in my look turning.

467
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,391
But this is a great opportunity

468
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,662
- to show that not only
- Am I great at being myself,

469
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:44,930
but I can also do
a stupid silly job

470
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,600
- of being
- Another great celebrity.

471
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:50,001
Catch that?

472
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,304
- All right, listen up, ladies.

473
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,440
Make a splash,
and don't fuck it up.

474
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,975
- Yes, Mrs. Charles.

475
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,244
- Let's go have a drink.
- Let's do it.

476
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,311
- Thank you.

477
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,047
- Bye.

478
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,984
- What'd you end up deciding on?

479
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:07,553
- I guess I'm doing Beyoncé.
- Beyoncé?

480
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,587
- I decided to do Beyoncé

481
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,424
because although it's not
something I brought with me,

482
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,993
- it's something
- That I can pull together.

483
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:16,896
- And The Vixen
- Is doing Blue Ivy Carter,

484
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,497
so if I'm stuck, there's
another person on the panel

485
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,401
I know I can have banter with
and play off of.

486
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,243
- Gotcha.

487
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,347
- Beyoncé has been crucified
on the Snatch Game twice before,

488
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,882
and Asia is gonna try
to resurrect her

489
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,450
for the third time?

490
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,818
All right, girl.

491
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,686
- I'll wait to play off of you

492
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,157
until you've like really
established your character.

493
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,059
- I'm nervous.

494
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,661
Facts are facts.

495
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,597
Beyoncé really doesn't have
personality that we get to see.

496
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,168
- Blue Ivy, just like her mother,
- Has no personality

497
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:57,969
as of yet.

498
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,039
So...

499
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,508
we gonna pray.

500
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,079
- Welcome to Snatch Game.

501
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,482
Let's meet our contestants.

502
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:13,985
She's a Tony, Grammy,
and Emmy award winner.

503
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,987
Audra McDonald,
welcome to the show.

504
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,057
- Thank you.
- I'm so excited to be here.

505
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,326
- Who knows, maybe you'll even
- Get an Oscar for this.

506
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,193
- Fingers are crossed.

507
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,629
- And she's graced the cover

508
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,367
of "Sports Illustrated's"
swimsuit issue three times.

509
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,869
It's Kate Upton.

510
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,239
- Hi. I'm so excited
- To be here.

511
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,673
- Oh, we're excited to have you.

512
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,775
Are you ready to meet our stars?

513
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,278
- Yes.
- Okay, here we go.

514
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:43,615
- Washington DC's HBIC,

515
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,518
Congresswoman Maxine Waters.

516
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,986
- Hello, Ru.

517
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,587
- May I call you Auntie Maxine?

518
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,723
- You surely can.

519
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,757
- You've got your
"impeach Trump" there.

520
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,959
- Impeach Trump.
He has to go.

521
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,062
The Cheeto has to go.
Say it with me.

522
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,130
The Cheeto has to go.

523
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,732
- Okay. All right.

524
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,734
Up next.
[bell dings]

525
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:06,404
Professional wrestler
and bodybuilder Chyna.

526
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,405
Hey, Chyna.

527
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,473
- Hi, Ru.

528
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,875
- Wow, you're looking good.

529
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,545
- Do you have
- Any workout tips for me?

530
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:15,214
- Eating all the beef, Ru.
- [laughs]

531
00:20:15,217 --> 00:20:18,516
All right. Literary icon,

532
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,586
the original shady lady
Dorothy Parker is here.

533
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,490
- Hello, Ru.
- I love spending an evening

534
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:27,225
making jokes with smart
and beautiful people,

535
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,595
so you can imagine
how disappointed I am.

536
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,564
[all laugh]

537
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:36,502
- Up next,
- She woke up like this.

538
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:38,937
It is Beyoncé.

539
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,207
- What's your name?
- I'm RuPaul.

540
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,442
- Who-Paul?
- Uh-huh. RuPaul.

541
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,510
- Well, I'm glad
to be here with you.

542
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,378
- All right, moving right along.

543
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:51,050
- Author, actress,
- And a national treasure,

544
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,050
Maya Angelou.

545
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:54,285
- Hello, RuPaul.

546
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,222
Do you know why
the caged bird sings?

547
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:59,190
- I've always wanted to know.
Why does the caged bird sing?

548
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,293
- Because Mariah Carey
- Lost the key.

549
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,394
[all laugh]

550
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,564
- Oh, the shade coming from
Miss Maya Angelou this evening.

551
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:11,804
- All right, the First Lady
- Of the United States of America,

552
00:21:11,805 --> 00:21:13,038
Melania Trump is here.

553
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,773
- Hello, hello, hello.

554
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,943
- Now, RuPaul,
- I did bring you a gift.

555
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:21,179
- Oh. Oh, is this from
where I think it's from?

556
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,881
- Trinity's.
- Trinity's.

557
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,582
I love Trinity's.

558
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,619
Let's see what we got here.

559
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,988
Oh, this is lovely.

560
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,557
- I hope it fits.
- Thank you so much.

561
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,259
All right, up next,

562
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,430
Destiny's Grandchild, Blue Ivy
is here with us this evening.

563
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,531
Hi, Blue Ivy.
- Hi.

564
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,534
- You look lovely.

565
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:43,536
- Is that from
- The House of Dereon?

566
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,271
- This is couture.
- No, it's not.

567
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,373
That's OshKosh B'gosh.

568
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:50,441
- You're so tall.
- Yes, I am.

569
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,545
- Okay, shut up now, girl.
Shut up now. Hush now, hear?

570
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:55,313
- Uh-oh. Mama has spoken.

571
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,284
Up next, another gorgeous child.

572
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:02,620
Mama June's pride and joy
Honey Boo Boo is here.

573
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,556
- Oh, my God, hi.

574
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,958
I'm Alana. I'm six.

575
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,660
And I'm a beauty queen.

576
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,095
- Yes, you are a beauty queen.

577
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,733
- Have you competed
- In any pageants lately?

578
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:16,702
- Well, the last pageant
- I competed in

579
00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:19,805
- was Miss Trailer Park 2015,
- And I won.

580
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:20,906
- Oh, good for you.
- I won.

581
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,475
- Oh, you are a winner,
- Honey Boo Boo.

582
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:26,345
- I am always a wiener.
- [all laugh]

583
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:28,780
- I'm sitting on the lucky side
of the room.

584
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,382
I have a grown woman
and an overgrown woman.

585
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,718
- Oh, how lucky
for Dorothy Parker.

586
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,588
All right, now, here we go.

587
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:41,392
Kate, did you hear about the new
Smart Phone for drag queens?

588
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:46,464
Instead of face recognition,
it recognizes your blank.

589
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,499
Looks like Beyoncé is writing.

590
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,535
- This is the first time

591
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,836
- Beyoncé's ever written
- For herself.

592
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,503
- Watch it, Toots.

593
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,938
- All right, Kate Upton.

594
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,208
- Charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.

595
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,710
- Oh, that's a great answer.

596
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,081
- Let's see if you matched
- Any of the stars.

597
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:06,417
Maya Angelou, Maya Angelou,
new Smart... are you asleep?

598
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,854
- No, sorry.
- I was resting my eyes.

599
00:23:08,857 --> 00:23:11,155
- I see. Okay.

600
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,558
Did you hear about the new
Smart Phone for drag queens?

601
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,327
Instead of face recognition,
it recognizes your...

602
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,632
- Well, RuPaul,
- I've written 17 books, 19 plays,

603
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:23,701
13 autobiographies
and two Hallmark cards.

604
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:27,506
- And it recognizes
- You're a phenomenal woman.

605
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:29,174
- You're a phenomenal woman.
- Yes.

606
00:23:29,177 --> 00:23:33,711
- Almost. Let's move on down
to Honey Boo Boo in the house.

607
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,015
We're looking for charisma,
uniqueness, nerve and talent.

608
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,883
- What did you write down,
- Darling?

609
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:38,984
- I really don't know
- How to write,

610
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:41,152
so just I just drew pictures.

611
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,789
My mama said if I don't know
what to do, just start drawing.

612
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,525
So I put like a star,
because I'm a star.

613
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,994
And I put my baby puppy,

614
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,431
- because that's
- A puppy right there.

615
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:55,667
- Let's go on over
to Auntie Maxine.

616
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,202
Did you hear about the new
Smart Phone for drag queens?

617
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:00,371
Instead of face recognition,
it recognizes your...

618
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,073
- Tuck touch.

619
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:06,011
- Tuck touch.
- That's a very smart idea.

620
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,578
I think you should patent that,

621
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,715
- and maybe
- Bring it up in Congress.

622
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:11,215
- I'll bring it up in Congress,

623
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,651
- and then I'll bring it up
- At Drug Can.

624
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:15,153
- At where where?

625
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,587
- Drag Con.

626
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:17,823
- Poor woman
- Can barely speak English.

627
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,058
What a disgusting...

628
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,825
- Aren't you dead?

629
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,527
- Like dust, still I rise.

630
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,930
- [all laugh]
- What's a tuck?

631
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:25,964
- Ask your mama.

632
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,498
- Mom, mama, mama.

633
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,701
- What's my name?
What's my name?

634
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,569
- Your highness?

635
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,004
- Continue.

636
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,505
- Reclaiming my time.

637
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,108
- Please tell your granny
to shut her mouth.

638
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,942
- Reclaiming my time.

639
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,645
- See, let me
- Let you know something.

640
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:41,680
- Oh, oh, it's starting
- Already up in here.

641
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:42,981
- Stop looking at me like that.

642
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:45,016
You're making me nervous.

643
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:48,287
- Beyoncé, you seem
- A little hostile today.

644
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:49,788
- You have to be on guard
- With these bitches,

645
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,090
claiming that I didn't write
my music and stuff.

646
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:53,024
- Mama, you said a bad word.

647
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,959
- Shut your mouth.

648
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,796
- I did not know Beyoncé
was that kind of mother.

649
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:00,532
- Somebody needs to call CPS
- For her girl,

650
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,800
because that is not cute.

651
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:05,203
- All right, this next one's
for Audra McDonald.

652
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:09,507
Martha Stewart is a really
bad influence on Snoop Dogg.

653
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:16,180
Now when he makes brownies,
he puts blank in them.

654
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,785
- He puts parsley, sage,
- Rosemary, and thyme.

655
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,053
- "Scarborough Fair."

656
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:22,587
It's a really good song.

657
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,022
Sounds like some awful brownies.

658
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,358
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go on down

659
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:28,927
- to the First Lady
- Of the United States of America.

660
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:29,928
[mispronouncing]
Me-lane-ia Trump.

661
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:30,928
- Melania.

662
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,497
- Melania, Melania. Sorry.

663
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,299
- It's all right, Barack.
- No worries.

664
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:36,300
[all laugh]

665
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,471
- I went with
- Russian hooker urine.

666
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:42,440
- Russian hooker urine.

667
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,143
- It has a funny smell,
but it just the right kick.

668
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,546
- That's an unusual answer.
What made you think of that?

669
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,348
- I don't know.
- My husband does the same thing,

670
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:52,418
- so I figured that the Snoop Dogg
- Would probably love it.

671
00:25:52,421 --> 00:25:53,985
[all laugh]

672
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,254
- All right, Chyna.

673
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,957
- Yes, look at those guns.
- My goodness.

674
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,626
We're looking for parsley,
sage, rosemary, and thyme.

675
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:03,327
Did we have a match?

676
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,063
- [deep voice]
- I said testosterone.

677
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:06,197
[all laugh]

678
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,200
- I ate a whole pan.
- Yeah.

679
00:26:08,203 --> 00:26:11,036
- Got my estrogen levels
- A little low, so...

680
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,703
- Oh. Okay.

681
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,740
Not a bad idea to put
testosterone in your brownies.

682
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,276
- My husband
- Could use some as well.

683
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,277
[all laugh]

684
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,045
- Okay, Blue Ivy.

685
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,713
- My mama don't make brownies.

686
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,651
- My mama don't cook.
- She's rich.

687
00:26:25,654 --> 00:26:29,086
But when she gives me lunch
money, she calls it royalties.

688
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,023
- Royalties.
- Unfortunately, not a match.

689
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:32,623
- I wanna go home.

690
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:36,028
- Everybody's old and poor...
- And fat.

691
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:37,361
- Your mama.

692
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,130
[all laugh]

693
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,799
- Vixen has made
a daring choice.

694
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,568
I knew it could go either way,

695
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:46,905
- and right now
- I see it going only south.

696
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:48,874
- How cunning is this fox
- After all?

697
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:52,010
- All right, let's move on down
- To Maya Angelou.

698
00:26:52,013 --> 00:26:54,779
- Well, RuPaul, before
I answer the question,

699
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,281
these women seem very hostile,

700
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,618
- and I wrote a soliloquy
- To inform them.

701
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,953
- Oh, I'd love to hear it.

702
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,754
We have nothing but time here.

703
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,123
- If these hos
try to come for me,

704
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,793
I surely will cut thee.

705
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,564
- I will not hesitate
- To put thou in a ditch,

706
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:15,333
because Maya Angelou
ain't no punk bitch.

707
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:18,971
- [all laugh]
- Oh, it rhymes, it rhymes.

708
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:21,874
- All right, but did you write
- An answer to this?

709
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:24,309
- I would put my underwire
- In a brownie,

710
00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:26,377
because I don't have
any support here.

711
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,712
- Oh, underwire.

712
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:29,346
Unfortunately, Audra,
it's not a match.

713
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,616
- It's still not a match,
- But it's good.

714
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:34,018
- All right, our next question
is for Kate,

715
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,687
and it is our Gaily Double.

716
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,423
It's a video question.

717
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,593
- Hi, everyone.
I'm Alex Trebek,

718
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,296
and I'm putting together a
brand new version of "Jeopardy!"

719
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,198
just for drag queens.

720
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,435
- Instead of answering
- In the form of a question,

721
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:54,940
- the queens must now respond
- With a blank.

722
00:27:54,943 --> 00:27:56,607
- Well, thank you, Alex.

723
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,676
That's a great question.

724
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,411
All right, Kate Upton.

725
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,215
- Instead of answering
- In the form of a question,

726
00:28:03,218 --> 00:28:05,683
the queens answer with a blank.

727
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,051
- With a death drop.

728
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,387
- That is a great answer.

729
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,589
I would watch that show.

730
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,990
Let's see what Congresswoman
Maxine Waters...

731
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,992
Now, what district are you in?

732
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,627
- The 43rd.

733
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:17,962
- Is that Compton?

734
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:21,999
- [laughs]

735
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,266
- Actually I think it is.

736
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:24,901
It's probably Inglewood
or something like that.

737
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:26,038
- It surely is.

738
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,605
We... I'm the 12th...

739
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:30,040
one of the 12 women
that are in the Black Caucus.

740
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,641
We're really involved
in the black community,

741
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:32,878
trying to raise us up.

742
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,012
- Okay. All right.

743
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,316
- So we're looking for death drop,
- All right?

744
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:38,816
What do you have,
Congresswoman?

745
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,851
- I have Honey Boo Boo
eating President Cheeto.

746
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,989
- Okay, Honey Boo Boo eating
President Cheeto.

747
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,825
All right, I'm afraid that's
not a match, Congresswoman.

748
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,328
Let's move on down
to Honey Boo Boo.

749
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,530
Maybe she's got the match.

750
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:53,898
- Well, again, I just
kind of drew pictures.

751
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,034
- But whenever
- I really don't know,

752
00:28:56,037 --> 00:28:57,835
and I'm in a sticky situation,

753
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:01,607
- I just draw a smiley face
- On my belly, and I talk with it.

754
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,275
I'm Honey Boo Boo, y'all.

755
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:06,410
- That sounds like a match.

756
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,380
- That's a death drop
in its own way.

757
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:10,982
- It's a match.
- I won? I win? I win?

758
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,550
- No, she gets a point.

759
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,419
- Oh, you're welcome.
- All right.

760
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,690
Here's our fourth and final
question for Audra McDonald.

761
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:23,561
Lady Bunny's therapist
said she was going crazy.

762
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:26,498
- She said,
- I want a second opinion.

763
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:29,701
- He said, okay,
- You're also a blank.

764
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,572
- You're also
- A thousand years old.

765
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,174
- [laughs]
- The truth hurts.

766
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:38,976
All right, let's move on down
to Dorothy Parker.

767
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,747
What did Lady Bunny's therapist
also say?

768
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,650
- Well, I want to say
very quickly, Audra,

769
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:47,051
I hear you have
a swimsuit issue?

770
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,819
- No, darling.
That's Kate.

771
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,955
- I have one, as well.

772
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,056
It's that no one
wants to see me in one.

773
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,760
- Now the answer to your question,
- I believe,

774
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:57,729
- is something that me
- And Lady Bunny have in common.

775
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:59,031
She's an antique.

776
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:00,732
- That's a match.
- Yes.

777
00:30:00,735 --> 00:30:02,134
- That's a match.
- All right, let's go on down

778
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:06,071
- to our First Lady,
- Melania Trump.

779
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:07,271
What say you?

780
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,607
- I think this Snatch Game
- Was a bit rigged.

781
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:09,939
- Oh, was it?
You think?

782
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,810
- I haven't won any points.
- You haven't won any...

783
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:15,112
- That's because you didn't
have to suck to get any.

784
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,347
- All right.

785
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,483
Now, you still have
a chance, darling.

786
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:24,188
I said, Lady Bunny
is a wonderful entertainer,

787
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,291
a humble queen,
and she keeps the show going

788
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,661
and is a handsome
and smart gentleman.

789
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,064
[all laugh]

790
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,332
- Close?

791
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,369
- So close, but not a match,
- I'm afraid.

792
00:30:37,372 --> 00:30:39,470
- Any hole is a goal.

793
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,138
- What did you say?

794
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,440
- Any hole is a goal.

795
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,442
[all laugh]

796
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,378
- My mother used to tell me that
- When I was little.

797
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:47,945
- Clearly it worked.

798
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,282
- All right,
- Let's go down to Chyna.

799
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:53,651
Lady Bunny's therapist
said, okay, you're also a...

800
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:55,320
- Well, I think we have
two things in common.

801
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,856
- A right answer, and another
- Old whore right here.

802
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:00,959
- An old whore.
- I think that's probably a match.

803
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,959
It is a match.

804
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,128
- No wonder why my husband's

805
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,297
- complaining about Chyna
- All the time.

806
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,599
[all laugh]

807
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,505
- Let's move on down
- To Beyoncé Knowles-Carter.

808
00:31:13,508 --> 00:31:15,540
- Boo Boo, do me a favor.
- Close your ears for a second.

809
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:19,643
I said that she is a woman
whose husband cheated on her

810
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,913
- and she wrote
- An entire album about it.

811
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,482
And y'all thought she was joking

812
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,551
- and then I still made a whole
- Bunch of money off of it,

813
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,619
so it don't even matter.

814
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,652
It's a match.

815
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,521
Continue.
- Mother!

816
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,656
- I told you to close your ears.

817
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,825
- Oh, okay.
- I knew that was about you.

818
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:36,894
- Okay. All right. Right.

819
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,998
Unfortunately not a match. No.

820
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,734
Let's move on down
to Honey Boo Boo.

821
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,368
Maybe she's got the match.

822
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,804
- I drew a picture of a bunny.

823
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:48,572
- Oh, you did, didn't you?

824
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,174
- I'm such an artist.

825
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,309
- RuPaul, that's exactly why

826
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,544
I fight for the arts
in school education.

827
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,880
- Yes, it's very important.

828
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,947
- I'm home schooled.

829
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,382
[all laugh]

830
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,918
- Wow. What a game.

831
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,487
But the winner is...

832
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:08,225
me, because I get to go home
and watch Judge Judy.

833
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,161
- Baloney.

834
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,229
- Here she is.

835
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,533
- Why wait until 4 P.M., Ru?
- I'm here.

836
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:16,901
- Well, that's our show.

837
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,336
Remember, "uh" is not an answer.

838
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,337
By-ee.

839
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,906
- Reclaiming my time.

840
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:22,908
[cheers and applause]

841
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,911
- Yeah!
- Get in there.

842
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:28,813
- Sitting on a zero.

843
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:31,048
- Yeah!

844
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,083
- Today's elimination day,

845
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,053
and everyone is snatched
after Snatch Game, honey.

846
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,621
There are no edges in sight.

847
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,089
♪ noonehasedges.

848
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,625
- It doesn't matter
who did well and who did not.

849
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,894
It was traumatic.

850
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:44,261
- I know.

851
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,664
- Wish Melania would have
- Bantered with me,

852
00:32:45,665 --> 00:32:47,499
because I gave her
plenty of opportunity.

853
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,766
- Ooh.

854
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,101
- It's not my job
to make your Snatch Game good.

855
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,736
- Ooh.

856
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,538
- I'm just fucking with you.

857
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,140
You opened the door.

858
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,211
- Snatch Game has turned
- People upside down.

859
00:32:59,214 --> 00:33:00,979
- Half of us
- Have not been to sleep.

860
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,248
Kameron is very quiet,
even more quiet than usual,

861
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:04,548
if you can imagine that.

862
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,885
- The stakes of what we're
- About to present to the judges

863
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:09,321
- are really high
- Because it may come down

864
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,722
to what we wear on the runway.

865
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,489
- Psst. Mama.

866
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,191
Ma. Mama.

867
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,528
- We're no longer related after
the catastrophe of yesterday.

868
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,763
- That's not nice.
How you think we did?

869
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:20,898
- Terrible.

870
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,868
- As a family?
- Yes.

871
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:24,703
- I would love to get
a positive critique.

872
00:33:24,704 --> 00:33:27,838
I don't know how that feels.

873
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,574
- That's not going to happen.

874
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,879
- It's kind of random how we
both did, like, the little kids.

875
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,980
- Yeah.

876
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,747
- And we both get ready
beside each other.

877
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:40,018
- Honestly, Eureka, I don't know
how you're gonna take this,

878
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,220
- but I feel like
- You stepped on a lot of people,

879
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:44,855
and like, kind of took
their moment from them.

880
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,357
Do you hear me?

881
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,725
- Yeah, I hear you.

882
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:48,927
- I don't think you can blame me
- For that because...

883
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,261
- I'm not blaming you...

884
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,796
- I was just trying to chime in
- Like we're supposed to.

885
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,062
You know what I mean?

886
00:33:53,063 --> 00:33:54,633
- But I think there's a level
of professionalism

887
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,534
- where you know
- When to hold back.

888
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,802
- Vixen is just pissed

889
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,838
- that Eureka did a good job
- In Snatch Game,

890
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,373
- and that she didn't shine
- As bright as her.

891
00:34:01,376 --> 00:34:03,607
Eureka was very funny.

892
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,310
She was doing what she had to do
to let her presence be known.

893
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,779
I feel like if anything
Asia was the one

894
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,482
like pouncing on everyone
throughout the whole thing.

895
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:15,653
- Does anyone feel like they did
something political yesterday

896
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,155
- that, you know,
- Might come back at them?

897
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:19,757
- Maxine Waters is the auntie

898
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,393
that says whatever she wants
and can get away with it.

899
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,462
- So you.
- So, well, yeah.

900
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,997
- Do you do like
a lot of political numbers?

901
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:27,298
- I really don't.

902
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:28,800
- I do
- A lot of political numbers.

903
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:31,001
I feel like it's really
important to do them.

904
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,002
- I agree.

905
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,071
- Especially, you know,
- As drag queens,

906
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:35,273
- I feel like
- That's our call to duty.

907
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:37,375
- Yeah, to get
- The queer agenda out there.

908
00:34:37,378 --> 00:34:40,211
- Exactly. All the shit
- Going down, girl.

909
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,377
- 'Cause in Denim and Diamonds,

910
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:43,348
I really thought about
doing homage to RuPaul,

911
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:45,883
and doing that confederate flag.

912
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,819
- Yeah.
- Oh, that would have been cute.

913
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,921
- But tensions were really,
really high in Kansas City,

914
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:55,893
and I just didn't want to
come back and just get shot.

915
00:34:55,894 --> 00:35:00,064
I have really not done
a lot of political work

916
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,567
- because I live
- In a former slave state.

917
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,735
Where I work, African-Americans

918
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:07,471
were not even allow to walk on

919
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,040
until the late sixties,
early seventies.

920
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,945
So I'm very aware
of what's going on,

921
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:19,016
however, I have to kind of
make sure that I educate you,

922
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:22,354
- but make sure
- That my bills are paid.

923
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:25,123
- I do a lot
- Of political performances.

924
00:35:25,126 --> 00:35:26,324
- Oh, yeah,
- You did say that.

925
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,426
- I wouldn't say
- That mine were humorous.

926
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:31,329
- Sometimes I just like to
- Throw it in white people's faces

927
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,795
that you know what you did.

928
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:34,032
- That's Vixen.

929
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:36,167
- I like carry like
- A giant crucifix on stage

930
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,768
covered in like racial slurs.

931
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:41,372
And then I'll like beat it
until it's like broken.

932
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,508
- There's two ways I could see
white people reacting to that.

933
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,909
Either A, completely silent,

934
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,113
or B, like, applauding
as hard as they can

935
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,513
to like get rid of
their white guilt.

936
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:51,750
- Which one is the one
- That you get?

937
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,750
- Exactly. I usually get
the white guilt applause.

938
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,853
They're like, yes!

939
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,654
- I think that's probably
- Why I don't

940
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,390
because I hate dealing
with the white guilt.

941
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,591
Like white fragility
really bugs me.

942
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:01,760
- But you can make
- Some cute coin off of it

943
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:03,527
if you play it right.

944
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:08,198
A lot of people say drag should
only be an escape from reality.

945
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,103
- But drag can also help us
- Face reality

946
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:13,871
and deal with it.

947
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,407
What set me off and like
really took me on that path

948
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:19,143
was after the Pride parade,

949
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:24,415
this bartender was posting that
Southside trash ruined Pride,

950
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:28,119
- which basically means
- That black people ruined Pride.

951
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,688
- And so I just became
- Another queen

952
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,790
and just started speaking up.

953
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,824
And then I was like, let me
figure out who the underdogs are

954
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:35,927
and how I can help.

955
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:39,531
- It is hard being
- A black person in America.

956
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:41,932
It is hard being a black
gay person in America.

957
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:46,870
It is impossible being a black
gay drag queen in America.

958
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,206
And so I spend so much time

959
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,742
keeping my mouth shut
to get ahead

960
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:55,847
- that when I feel attacked,
- It all comes out.

961
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,951
- Vixen just
- Seems to be the girl

962
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:03,854
that has always had to defend
herself and defend her drag.

963
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,791
- It's like a dog
- You get from the shelter

964
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:09,426
that has been bitten
and beat and abused.

965
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,796
- And it's cool
- While you feeding it,

966
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:14,232
- but will bite you
- If you look at it crazy.

967
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,969
- It's quiet time.

968
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,604
- I hate quiet time.

969
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,072

1031
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,833
- dripping in water
- And oil slick everything.

1032
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:04,335
I have blue tears coming
directly out of my eyes.

1033
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:06,837
I can't see anything
except for cyan.

1034
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,474
- I'm giving
- The most lethargic mermaid,

1035
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:11,441
but in the most editorial way.

1036
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,776
- She's fin-ished.

1037
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,678
[all laugh]

1038
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,647
- Asia O'Hara.

1039
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,449
- Ooh, from the Chernobyl Reef.

1040
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,086
- Yes. Never go swimming
- In Love Canal.

1041
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,487
[all laugh]
- No.

1042
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:25,256
- I don't believe mermaids
in real life are pretty.

1043
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,024
They're half woman, half fish.

1044
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,659
So my mermaid look

1045
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,196
- is inspired by lionfish
- Meets mermaid

1046
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:34,197
meets a sea cucumber.

1047
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,667
- Having fish and tits
- For dinner.

1048
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,867
- Oh, yes.

1049
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:40,070
I think Jason's making
the tartar sauce now.

1050
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,472
[all laugh]

1051
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,041
- Here's The Vixen.

1052
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,343
- Well, it's obvious
she has clam-mydia.

1053
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:48,612
[all laugh]

1054
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,382
- My mermaid look is heavy metal
- And reflective.

1055
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:52,749
I am spray painted.

1056
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,518
I am sequins.

1057
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,921
I am every girlie thing
that I would usually avoid.

1058
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,157
But I just wanted
to feel full fantasy.

1059
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,427
- She's looking
- For her friend Annette.

1060
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,697
[all laugh]

1061
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,332
- Monet X Change.

1062
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,500
- Battlestar Gill-actica.

1063
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,135
[all laugh]

1064
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,971
- Tuna Turner.
[all laugh]

1065
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,674
- I'm giving you a beat up,
tattered warrior mermaid,

1066
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,277
because I'm here to fight
these bitches to the top.

1067
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,915
- Monet is a strong, powerful
- Warrior mermaid fish.

1068
00:41:23,918 --> 00:41:26,983
- You wanna talk about
the deadliest snatch?

1069
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,521
- [all laugh]
- Stop polluting our oceans.

1070
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:31,655
- Eureka.

1071
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,791
- I think we're gonna need
- A bigger boat.

1072
00:41:33,794 --> 00:41:35,726
[all laugh]

1073
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,961
- I'm giving you
the biggest, baddest,

1074
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,397
most evil mermaid of them all.

1075
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:41,666
I think everyone expects me

1076
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,601
to be this colorful rainbow
Disney princess mermaid.

1077
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,236
No, bitch.

1078
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,406
- I am Ursula's cousin
- Twice removed,

1079
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:50,575
- drooling blood
- Where I just ate my food.

1080
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:52,109
- Don't forget to floss.

1081
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,177
- Yeah.

1082
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,012
- Kameron Michaels.

1083
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,582
- Oh, it's one of
the Reef Housewives.

1084
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,082
[all laugh]

1085
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,385
- My mermaid is a little vain.

1086
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:03,286
She's interested in herself
and nobody else.

1087
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,553
I'm way too grand
to look for Nemo,

1088
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:05,590
- because I'm only worried
- About myself.

1089
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:08,091
She looks fishy
and she knows it.

1090
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,260
- Touch this fin.

1091
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,896
Touch all this fin.

1092
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,332
[all laugh]

1093
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,100
- Welcome, ladies.

1094
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,505
- Based on your Snatch Game
- Performances,

1095
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:24,541
and your splashy
main stage presentations,

1096
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,010
I've made some decisions.

1097
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,316
When I call your name,
please flap your tail.

1098
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,353
Miz Cracker.

1099
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,190
Kameron Michaels.

1100
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,060
You are safe.

1101
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,966
You may leave the stage.

1102
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,805
- Well, actually you can't.

1103
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,740
Oh, Pit Crew.

1104
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,843
[all laugh]

1105
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,951
Miss Vanjie.

1106
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,453
- Miss Vanjie.

1107
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:10,520
[all laugh]

1108
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:11,822
Miss Vanjie.

1109
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,758
- The way she was moving
- Backwards when she was doing it.

1110
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:16,159
- It was just like, Miss Vanjie.

1111
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,295
[all laugh]

1112
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:21,098
- Girls.
- Woman named Miss Vanjie.

1113
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:22,799
[all laugh]

1114
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,039
- Ladies, you represent the tops
- And bottoms of the week.

1115
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,411
- Ladies, it's time
- For the judges' critiques,

1116
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:35,378
starting with Aquaria.

1117
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:38,516
- I love this whole oil spill
- Chic mermaid.

1118
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:41,485
I love the latex
dripping from the bodice,

1119
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:43,588
- how the tail
- Is kind of tattered.

1120
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:45,923
- it's so Italian "Vogue,"
- And I love the hair.

1121
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:46,956
I'm obsessed with it.

1122
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,226
- Thank you so much.

1123
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:49,593
- You chose Melania.

1124
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,695
- Yeah, I mean, Melania Trump

1125
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,798
- is just as cold and aloof
- As I am,

1126
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:55,933
- so I figured
- It would be a nice way

1127
00:43:55,936 --> 00:44:00,103
to use my weakness
to my advantage.

1128
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,038
- I think you killed it.

1129
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,375
- You gave us
- So many great references

1130
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:07,678
- with the help in the box,
- And the Michelle Obama placard.

1131
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:08,944
That was genius.

1132
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:10,781
- For me, it was the subtle
things that you did.

1133
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:14,318
- And when the focus
- Wasn't necessarily on you,

1134
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,551
I kept going back to you anyway.

1135
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,522
And I had to keep
reminding myself

1136
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:19,390
- that's not really Melania Trump.
- [laughs]

1137
00:44:19,393 --> 00:44:21,659
- So I was just very impressed
- With everything you did,

1138
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:23,027
- both the Snatch Game
- And tonight.

1139
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,694
- Thank you.

1140
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,863
- Up next, Monique Heart.

1141
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,098
- ♪ Hi ♪

1142
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:31,134
- I was really excited
for Maxine Waters,

1143
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,637
but you didn't really
dig into who she was.

1144
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:36,106
You had set bits,

1145
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,242
but you weren't able
to carry that throughout it.

1146
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:41,344
- And the kiss of death
in the Snatch Game

1147
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,480
is not being present.

1148
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:45,916
- I tried, but as soon
as anyone bantered,

1149
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,984
it just became a cluster fuck.

1150
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,320
- Which happens a lot,
which is another talent

1151
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:53,423
of knowing when to interject
and when not to.

1152
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,091
- Okay.

1153
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,394
- And tonight on the runway,

1154
00:44:56,395 --> 00:44:58,428
I don't understand
what's happening.

1155
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,497
I've got a look from here up,

1156
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:01,565
and I've got a look
from here down.

1157
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:04,801
The top up is kind of like
a bridal store thing for me.

1158
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,805
- And this multicolored
- Glittery look,

1159
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,640
- under the lights,
- It can just look a little cheap.

1160
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:12,776
- This really sucks, because
I feel like week after week,

1161
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:15,579
no matter what I do,
it's never what you want.

1162
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,947
- This is a competition.

1163
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,316
It's tough.
It ain't easy.

1164
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:19,482
- No, ma'am.

1165
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,152
- That's why
- Only the strong survive.

1166
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,653
- Boom.

1167
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:27,724
- Up next, Asia O'Hara.

1168
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:31,928
- I'm dumbfounded
as to why we're wearing a mask

1169
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,330
for a mermaid fantasy.

1170
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:34,664
- Grasping at straws,

1171
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,332
because I didn't feel
like when I got here,

1172
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,002
I didn't feel like
this was enough.

1173
00:45:38,003 --> 00:45:39,402
- I kind of loved it,

1174
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,939
because I've never thought
of a mermaid like that before.

1175
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,344
I think the art is amazing,
and the outfit is fabulous.

1176
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:50,381
- With the Snatch Game,
- I thought you looked beautiful,

1177
00:45:50,384 --> 00:45:51,983
- but I wished
- There had been more joy.

1178
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:55,552
- Yeah.
- When did Beyoncé get so mean?

1179
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,321
- Okay, shut up, now, girl.
- Shut up now.

1180
00:45:57,324 --> 00:45:59,990
- She's good old southern charm.

1181
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:02,059
- Was there a reason
- Why you played her so mad?

1182
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:05,096
- I didn't feel like the
- Sweet route was very comedic.

1183
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,897
- When we did the walkthrough,

1184
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:11,001
one of the clues I dropped

1185
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:13,603
was the ex-members
of Destiny's Child.

1186
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,039
- And then
- You could have been angry

1187
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:17,975
- about why's Beyoncé
- Getting all the attention?

1188
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:19,010
- But Beyoncé
- Don't need a reason

1189
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,177
- because
- She's queen of the world.

1190
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,679
In hindsight, do you get it now?

1191
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,214
- Yes. Can we do it again?

1192
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,416
[all laugh]

1193
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:29,619
- Up next, The Vixen.

1194
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,855
- The mermaid fantasy,
I want that wig.

1195
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,958
- The neck up
- Is absolute perfection.

1196
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:36,360
- But no one wants
- The breasts in the armpit.

1197
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:38,963
- That's why we all wear them...
- A little bra.

1198
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,264
- They're very far apart.

1199
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:42,399
It takes the illusion away.

1200
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,634
- I can see what you look like
- Out of drag.

1201
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:45,101
- Oh.

1202
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,505
- So, Blue Ivy,
- The outfit was adorable.

1203
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:49,407
- I loved that
- She had the big old fro.

1204
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,075
- But sorry, girl,
there was not much there.

1205
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:54,979
- It needs to be more
- Than just a few moments.

1206
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,814
There was not really
anywhere you could go

1207
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,548
if you weren't going
completely over the top

1208
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:00,718
like Honey Boo Boo.

1209
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,020
- Being next to someone
who was being such a brat,

1210
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:07,457
my mind went to like images
of Blue next to North West,

1211
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,959
- and North West
- Is having a having a fit,

1212
00:47:08,962 --> 00:47:10,994
and Blue's like,
that's not how we behave.

1213
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,864
- But it still wasn't funny.

1214
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:17,400
- Up next, Monet X Change.

1215
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,469
- This outfit is really cool.

1216
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,539
It feels like Wonder Woman
meets the Little Mermaid.

1217
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,407
- So, a shark... what... help me.

1218
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,576
- Well, I am a warrior mermaid,

1219
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,879
- fighting sharks
- And sea monsters and shit.

1220
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:31,482
- I got more of like
- A littering political storyline.

1221
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:33,784
- Oh, that, too.
- I meant to say that one.

1222
00:47:33,787 --> 00:47:36,653
- Sure. And want to talk
about doing your homework.

1223
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:41,591
We had just had somebody do
Maya Angelou on "All Stars 3,"

1224
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,829
- and this is how
- It should have been done.

1225
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:46,196
- Thank you.

1226
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,100
- All of the moments that
- You had as Maya were fantastic.

1227
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:50,400
When you fell asleep,

1228
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:53,436
and then to have the typical
black family response,

1229
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,438
I was just resting my eyes.

1230
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:55,572
[all laugh]

1231
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:58,174
- Brilliant choice,
brilliant execution.

1232
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,876
Monet is on a roll.

1233
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,878
Keep it going.
- Thank you.

1234
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,013
- Up next, Eureka.

1235
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,516
- I love this Ursula
finds her inner leather mama.

1236
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:07,917
My goodness.

1237
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,254
I wanna look like that when
I go home to my husband tonight.

1238
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:12,021
[all laugh]

1239
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:15,692
- Alana was amazing.

1240
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,160
- Oh, thank God.

1241
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:18,963
- You just completely
- Embodied her.

1242
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:20,930
You never broke character.

1243
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,264
- You were very smart
to play a character

1244
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:23,801
that you could really
rely on your strengths.

1245
00:48:23,802 --> 00:48:26,236
- And you were freaking funny.

1246
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,369
You made Ru laugh.

1247
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,506
You made the other people laugh.

1248
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:31,208
- And it was really, really
- Well done.

1249
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:33,777
- Thank you so much.
That means the world to me.

1250
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:36,178
- All right, so, ladies,
I have one final question.

1251
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,515
Who deserves to go home tonight?

1252
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,218
And why?
Starting with Eureka.

1253
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,220
- Oh, gosh.

1254
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,656
Honestly, maybe Asia O'Hara,

1255
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,325
because she's my biggest
competition, to be honest.

1256
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,528
- Monet X Change.

1257
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,932
- Taking into account
- Snatch Game

1258
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,168
- and tonight's assignment
- Mermaid Eleganza,

1259
00:48:57,169 --> 00:48:58,302
I would have to say The Vixen.

1260
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:00,570
- Vixen.

1261
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:03,307
- I have never seen such
- A level of unprofessionalism

1262
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,441
as I have watching Eureka,

1263
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,380
- and it baffles me
- That you guys enjoy her so much.

1264
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:12,216
- It has really
- Been very difficult

1265
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,951
- working in an environment
- With her

1266
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,884
because she takes
all the air out of the room.

1267
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:18,255
She's always the one
who has to get the last word.

1268
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,024
- In my defense,
I tell everyone all the time

1269
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:22,891
I'm sorry that I'm loud
and I'm sorry I'm too much.

1270
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:24,326
- But you don't try
to stop being loud

1271
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:25,794
or try to stop being too much.

1272
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:27,965
You're like, I'm sorry, but
this is who I am, deal with it.

1273
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:30,200
- It's also a strength of mine

1274
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,503
- when it comes to
- The confidence and acting.

1275
00:49:32,506 --> 00:49:35,338
- But what I've seen from Eureka

1276
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:37,874
is I'm the one who's getting
all the attention in the room,

1277
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,176
which to me is very childish,

1278
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:42,379
- which I guess is why
- The characters that she's played

1279
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,181
has worked for her,
because she's a child.

1280
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:45,282
- I'm sorry
- That she feels that way,

1281
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,016
but I will say one more thing.

1282
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,250
- Again getting
the last word in.

1283
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,187
- I'm sorry,
but I can't let her sit there...

1284
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,654
- Again.

1285
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,756
- And literally
verbally attack me.

1286
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,090
Yes, I do talk too much

1287
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,292
and I'm expressive and...

1288
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,194
- But everyone
- Doesn't have to accept it.

1289
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:58,863
- But I'm also extremely kind
and I'm full of love

1290
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:02,700
- because I know that sometimes
- I am a lot to deal with.

1291
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:04,801
But I can't change that.

1292
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,002
- You can try.

1293
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,238
- And I try to be
- Understanding of people...

1294
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:09,506
- You weren't attacked.
- You're a grown man.

1295
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,941
- But I can't help it
verbally attacking me

1296
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:13,509
in front of people that I want
to have respect for my art,

1297
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,980
- when I really have tried
- Everything I can

1298
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:19,048
to be as kind as I can to Vixen.

1299
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,451
- And that's all I'll say.
- I'm sorry.

1300
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,954
- All right, thank you, ladies.

1301
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,289
All right, Asia.

1302
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,690
- Because I'm an adult,

1303
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,861
- and although I've grown
- To love her and she's my sister,

1304
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:34,365
I think The Vixen
has the most room for growth.

1305
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,233
- Monique.

1306
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,736
- I love her so much,

1307
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,205
but I would say The Vixen,

1308
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:44,073
basing it totally
on the challenge.

1309
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,576
She had the weakest character
out of them all,

1310
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:51,381
and she has kind of
just plateaued.

1311
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,349
- And what say you, Aquaria?

1312
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,085
- The Vixen with the way

1313
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,256
- she's interpreted
- Some of the challenges.

1314
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:03,394
- All right. Well, thank you,
- Ladies, for being honest.

1315
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:04,628
I think we've heard enough.

1316
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,797
While you untuck backstage,

1317
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,134
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1318
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,536
Just between us
squirrel friends,

1319
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:16,073
- what do you think?
- Aquaria.

1320
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:19,175
- The mermaid fantasy
was my favorite of the night.

1321
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,077
It was cool.
It was edgy.

1322
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,412
It told a story.

1323
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:25,581
- Her Melania was a really
brilliant character study.

1324
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,518
- Not only was it political,
it was also funny.

1325
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,154
And it actually kind of
made me dig Melania.

1326
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,490
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is hard to do.

1327
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:35,224
Monique Heart.

1328
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,594
- "Reclaiming my time"
does not Maxine Waters make.

1329
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,629
There were so many things
that she left out,

1330
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,764
and the most important
was the comedy.

1331
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,702
- She read
- Maxine Waters' Wiki page,

1332
00:51:44,703 --> 00:51:46,202
and had the top 10 facts.

1333
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,638
- I think she read
the first couple lines.

1334
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:49,807
- Exactly.
- Up on your phone.

1335
00:51:49,808 --> 00:51:51,808
And the mermaid fantasy,

1336
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,378
- it was way too disjointed
- For me.

1337
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,546
- It was just a mess.

1338
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,215
- I like Monique,
- But tonight on the runway,

1339
00:51:58,218 --> 00:52:01,184
she was just defensive
and mismatching.

1340
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,320
- And the defensiveness,
- There's no place for that here.

1341
00:52:03,323 --> 00:52:05,356
- No.
- This is a competition,

1342
00:52:05,357 --> 00:52:07,358
and you have to hear
what the judges have to say.

1343
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,794
Asia O'Hara,
our Beyoncé, oh, boy.

1344
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,264
- Every time somebody tries
Beyoncé for the Snatch Game,

1345
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,532
they fail.

1346
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,536
- Beyoncé is not known for
- An over-the-top personality.

1347
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:21,204
- And then the mermaid fantasy.

1348
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:23,107
There's was such
pageant-y glamour.

1349
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:25,942
I wanted to see that carry
through in the hair and makeup.

1350
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:27,945
- I disagree with you guys.
- Sometimes pure beauty

1351
00:52:27,948 --> 00:52:29,846
gets to be a little bit boring.

1352
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:33,249
I enjoyed the fact
that it was such a contrast.

1353
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,851
- The Vixen.

1354
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,954
Tonight was the prettiest
I think she's ever looked.

1355
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:38,488
- But the body wasn't there.

1356
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,823
- And I've got to admit,

1357
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,460
I wasn't a big fan of her
interpretation of Blue Ivy.

1358
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,462
- She didn't go far enough
- With it.

1359
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:47,262
- She could have had
a Polish accent.

1360
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:49,064
- She could have
rapped everything.

1361
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,334
- I got 99 dolls, but...

1362
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:53,170
- But my mommy won.
- [all laugh]

1363
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,271
- And it was interesting to hear

1364
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:56,507
- that there's
- An abrasiveness about her.

1365
00:52:56,508 --> 00:52:58,575
- Her sisters done threw her
under the Greyhound,

1366
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,376
and there's a reason for it.

1367
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:03,079
- Yeah. Monet X Change.

1368
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,382
- Snatch Game,
- My edges are gone.

1369
00:53:05,385 --> 00:53:07,484
- She snatched them all
- Right away.

1370
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:10,620
- She had every note
of Maya Angelou down.

1371
00:53:10,621 --> 00:53:11,722
Ru, may I read you a poem?

1372
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:13,456
[all laugh]

1373
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:14,691
- And tonight on the runway,

1374
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,926
- even though
- It wasn't my favorite,

1375
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:17,427
it told me a story.

1376
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:19,462
Now, my story was 100% wrong.

1377
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:21,064
[all laugh]

1378
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,801
- I just didn't get it.
- It wasn't my thing.

1379
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:27,037
- But I think her Snatch Game
- Moment was so great

1380
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,539
that no matter what,
she's a winner tonight.

1381
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,040
- Eureka.

1382
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,209
- I think Eureka sucks...

1383
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,413
- characters into her
- And then lives as them.

1384
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:39,783
- She was able
- To get her jokes in,

1385
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:42,318
but not in an annoying way.

1386
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,954
- She did really well with
bantering with the other girls.

1387
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,023
- My favorite thing
was the brilliant idea

1388
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:49,625
of answering all the questions
with pictures.

1389
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:50,793
[all laugh]

1390
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,262
- Then drawing on herself
- At the end.

1391
00:53:52,265 --> 00:53:53,629
I loved it so much.

1392
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,999
- But tonight on the runway,
it was just kind of basic.

1393
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,769
- I didn't think
- She needed the blood at all.

1394
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,270
- I just thought
she did everything right.

1395
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:02,205
Character, makeup, all of it.

1396
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:05,575
That's someone who is obviously
detail oriented in everything.

1397
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,143
She's very impressive.

1398
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:09,713
- Let's hear what Alex
- Has to say.

1399
00:54:09,716 --> 00:54:12,281
And Alex, please answer
in the form of a question.

1400
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:16,152
- What is chunky, yet funky?

1401
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:19,355
- All right, for
the Latrice Royale reference.

1402
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,325
- [laughs]
- He's a fan of the show.

1403
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:22,626
- I know.
- You can tell.

1404
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:24,560
- All right, silence.

1405
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,362
I've made my decision.

1406
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,432
Bring back my gills.

1407
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,434
[all laugh]

1408
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,269
- Welcome back, ladies.

1409
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,038
I've made some decisions.

1410
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:42,011
Aquaria, from the Snatch Game
to the runway,

1411
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:46,482
this week we bought
what you were selling

1412
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:49,318
hook, line, and sinker.

1413
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,921
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

1414
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,857
- [applause]
- Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.

1415
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,559
- You've won a six-night stay

1416
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:01,298
- at the Grove Hotel
- And Ice Palace on Fire Island.

1417
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:05,135
- Whoo! I've finally won
- My second challenge.

1418
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:06,837
And Snatch Game to add.

1419
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,841
- Eureka, Monet X Change...

1420
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,376
You are both safe.

1421
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:15,445
- Thank you.

1422
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,681
- The Vixen,

1423
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:22,119
playing Beyoncé's child
was not your destiny.

1424
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:26,123
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.

1425
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,028
Asia O'Hara,

1426
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:35,432
- your snatch
- Was not the catch of the day.

1427
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,537
- Monique Heart,
- Your Auntie Maxine

1428
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,139
hit some rough waters.

1429
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,708
Asia O'Hara...

1430
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,212
You're safe.

1431
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:54,517
- Monique, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1432
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:58,254
- America, if I could cuss
in this competition right now

1433
00:55:58,255 --> 00:55:59,756
and just scream the capital F.

1434
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,394
America, y'all say it
for me right now.

1435
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,397
- One, two, three.
- Thank you.

1436
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,466
- Two queens stand before me.

1437
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:16,372
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1438
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,476
and save yourself
from elimination.

1439
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,914
