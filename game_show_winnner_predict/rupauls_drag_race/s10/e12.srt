1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,702
- Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...

2
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:04,905
It's time
to split...personalities.

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,841
Your evil twin.

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,477
A dark-sided bee-otch

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,679
that oozes negativity.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,414
- We are literally personifying

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,483
the things we hate most
about ourselves.

8
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,785
- Kameron Michaels.

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,755
- It just seems
a little costumey.

10
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,991
- I would have loved
to have seen more yin and yang.

11
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,593
- Miz Cracker.

12
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,030
- This look didn't quite match
your good twin.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,567
This felt a little
Halloween store to me.

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,701
- Aquaria.

15
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,637
- Oh, my gosh, you look like

16
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,273
you're on the way to a shoot
for "Vogue."

17
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,842
- And your acting
as the evil twin

18
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,044
was even stronger.

19
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,346
- Aquaria, con-drag-ulations.

20
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,848
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

21
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,918
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, my gosh!

22
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:53,787
- Kameron Michaels,
Ashanti you stay.

23
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:57,524
Miz Cracker, sashay away.

24
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,535
- Oh, my God!

25
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,737
- Oh, Miz Cracker.

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,206
My other
New York City sister.

27
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,975
- Miz Cracker is gone,

28
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,643
and I know that
she really wanted this,

29
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:19,446
but Kameron
slayed that lip sync.

30
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,515
Kam, you did it again.

31
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:24,017
You survived another lip sync,
bitch.

32
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,919
Kameron has lip synced
three times,

33
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,220
and she's won three times.

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,691
So I think Kameron's a threat
to anyone at this point.

35
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,393
You might be
our lip sync assassin.

36
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,563
- I think
some of the other girls

37
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,999
are probably thinking
this bitch is a locust.

38
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,901
We can't get rid of her.
She's here again.

39
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,670
But I'm going to claw my way

40
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,839
all the way
up to the big old tiara.

41
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,409
- I'm haunted by the last words
that I said

42
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,711
about Miz Cracker.

43
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,580
The person that I do not think
is a star in this lineup

44
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,116
is Miz Cracker or Miz Crumbs.

45
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,120
Nobody in any type of show
business wants to hear that.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,889
Unfortunately,
my opinion is that,

47
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,158
but it's a prime example

48
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,762
of knowing how much to say
and when to say it.

49
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,530
Maybe I didn't see
the star quality in her,

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,499
but Ru saw star quality in her.

51
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,334
I owe Miz Cracker an apology.

52
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,671
- I definitely think Asia
was a little extra

53
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,506
and a little below the belt.

54
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,841
I feel like if you're saying

55
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,209
somebody's not a star
when they are,

56
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,277
there's got to be
a root of jealousy in there.

57
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,214
So I think there's some other
opinions in that head

58
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,283
that I would probably
hate to hear.

59
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,052
Aquaria, congratulations
for winning.

60
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,353
[applause]
- Thank you so much.

61
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,188
This is my third win.

62
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,391
- So how many wins
have you had, Asia?

63
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,592
- Two. And you've had two,
right?

64
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,327
- I've had two maxis.
- You've had one.

65
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,497
In my opinion, who should
make it to the top three

66
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:47,167
are Kameron, Aquaria and myself.

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,603
Eureka's biggest weakness

68
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,640
is she can be so loud
and so overbearing.

69
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,410
- Top four!
- Top four!

70
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,644
- I wanna win.

71
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,780
- People say Aquaria
is the I-wanna-win queen.

72
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,814
It's Eureka.

73
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,682
She wants to be
the first big girl to win.

74
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,185
She wants those bragging rights.

75
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,488
- Now bitch, Asia, I want you to
look in this mirror at my face

76
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,991
and tell me
it does not look amazing.

77
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,292
Look at this.

78
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,460
- I'd rather not.

79
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,629
- Asia, admit it.
- It's something.

80
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,230
- You just hurt me.

81
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,933
- If I hurt you, you fished
for that pain, sister.

82
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,169
- No, I fished for a compliment.

83
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,571
I'm like, it's not my fault

84
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,506
she's sitting over there
looking like the Babadook.

85
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:29,009
[laughs]

86
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,545
Actually, fuck all these hos.

87
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,113
I wanna be
all their friends, honey,

88
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:34,448
but at the end of the day...

89
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,120
They have to lose
so that I can win.

90
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,724
- The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

91
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,093
receives a one-year supply

92
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,595
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

93
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,799
and a cash prize of $100.000.

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,101
- ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race ♪

95
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,469
- ♪ May the best woman ♪

96
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,872
- ♪ Best woman win ♪

97
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,275
- Bon jour, top four!

98
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,511
- Let there be four.

99
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,646
Look at all the room in here.

100
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,015
- Whoo-hoo!
We are the top four!

101
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,984
I feel so alive.

102
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,586
This has always been
a dream of mine,

103
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,989
and I've made it as far
as I possibly fucking could.

104
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,492
And I'm so excited
to prove to RuPaul

105
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,427
that the crown
belonged on my head

106
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,162
the second I walked into
that work room.

107
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,231
[alarm]

108
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,799
[shouting]

109
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,735
- She already done had herses.

110
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,005
- My top queens,
slay the children.

111
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,607
Steal the focus.

112
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,077
Add your own hocus pocus.

113
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,747
Just make me gag,
boots the house down.

114
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:45,352
And that's the T
on snatching the crown.

115
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:48,421
[evil laugh]

116
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,489
- Holy--

117
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,790
- I wish I'd known that
all season.

118
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,092
- I had no clue.
- Right.

119
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,461
- Hello, hello, hello.

120
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,029
[cheers and applause]

121
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,564
- And then there were four.

122
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,867
Ladies, now, I once said

123
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,870
every time I bat
my false eyelashes,

124
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,672
I'm making
a political statement.

125
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,341
Now, this week, I want you

126
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,212
to combine your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

127
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,814
for mother and country.

128
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,417
For your final maxi challenge,

129
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,619
you'll perform the song
"American,"

130
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,888
a new anthem I wrote

131
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,058
to help unite this
beautiful country of ours.

132
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,696
First, you'll each write
and record your own solo verse.

133
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,500
Then, you'll meet with
the incredible Todrick Hall,

134
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,335
who will challenge you

135
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,973
with the most difficult
choreography of the season.

136
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,277
- The most difficult?
- Uh-huh.

137
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,745
- We're talking Martha Graham
here, kids.

138
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,314
[all laugh]

139
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,882
- Fosse, Fosse, Fosse.

140
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:52,452
And tomorrow, as a super group,

141
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,855
you'll make America gay again

142
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,758
with the world debut
of "American, the Rumix."

143
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:03,163
You'll also exercise
your first amendment rights

144
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,732
as guests on my podcast

145
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,668
"RuPaul's What the Tee?
With Michelle Visage."

146
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,903
[cheering]

147
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,139
Ladies, this is your chance
to show the world

148
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,975
that you deserve to be

149
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:18,745
the next drag superstar
of America.

150
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,281
#DragRace.

151
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,751
So in the words
of the great Abraham Lincoln...

152
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,088
Don't fuck it up.

153
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,723
[all laugh]

154
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,891
Gentlemen, start your engines,

155
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,428
and may the best American win.

156
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,864
[applause]

157
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,399
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.

158
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,235
- I've always wanted
to write a verse

159
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,338
for one of RuPaul's songs
and perform it for him.

160
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,208
I can't even explain
how excited I am.

161
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,443
- I'm thinking
I'm gonna rap mine.

162
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,646
Just because like I don't know

163
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,048
if people will expect me to like
be able to rap or whatever.

164
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,584
This country bitch is gonna rap,

165
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,720
because I'm here to shock
and surprise the world.

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,157
Or I'm going to make
a fucking fool of myself.

167
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,059
Asia, you don't sing at all,
do you?

168
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,696
- Yes, girl, we got auto tune.
There's a computer.

169
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,066
- This challenge
is a chance to redeem myself

170
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,035
in a singing and dancing
challenge.

171
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,870
Finally!

172
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,172
But I don't sing,
I'm not a trained dancer,

173
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,174
and so I'm not feeling
super confident.

174
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,810
- I've never heard you even
try to sing I don't think.

175
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,912
Because for the Cher one,
yours was very spoken.

176
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,581
- Yeah. I'm gonna musically
find out how I can make it work

177
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,651
and if I need to add more words
to make it rappy,

178
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,321
or subtract some words
so I can sing some of it.

179
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,823
- I mean, the beat
is actually fairly simple,

180
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,525
so you can take it
in either direction.

181
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,293
- Yeah.

182
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,763
- At this point,
we have absolutely no idea

183
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:44,831
if they're going to keep
all four of us,

184
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,933
or if they're gonna
knock a girl out

185
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,967
and make a top three.

186
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,170
If they're gonna make a top two.

187
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,139
We all have strengths
that each other lacks,

188
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,742
so it's anyone's game now.

189
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,043
I think I'm gonna go record.

190
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,111
- Kill it, Quar-Quar.

191
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,579
- Don't miss me too much.

192
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,750
Hello.
- Hi.

193
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,920
Aquaria, meet Ru's producers
for "American," Kummerspeck.

194
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,987
- Hi.
- Hello.

195
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,489
- I wanna hear what you have,

196
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,624
so let's just get started
and jump right in.

197
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,226
Bring it.
I wanna hear Aquaria.

198
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,794

Todrick loves my track.

222
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,816
I am so happy with it.

223
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,752
It is definitely going to be
the most memorable of the four.

224
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,587
- That was some sketchy vocals.

225
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,526
- It's time to do the podcast

226
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,429
with Ru and Michelle
for "What's the Tee?"

227
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,864
- Well, Michelle,
here comes our first guest.

228
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:25,932
- I see.
- Oh.

229
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:26,933
- Eureka. Welcome to podcast.

230
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,668
- Oh, my goodness.

231
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,736
This is so exciting.

232
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,805
- And here you are
at the final four.

233
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,074
Are you surprised by that,
honestly?

234
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,742
- Okay, there's a part of me
that, yes, is surprised,

235
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,876
and there's a part of me
that's not.

236
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,711
- Point to the part of you
that says yes.

237
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,447
- This titty is surprised.

238
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,681
This is titty
is not surprised.

239
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,116
- [laughs]

240
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,751
- Do you think
being on Season 9

241
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,120
gave you any kind
of an advantage?

242
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,222
- You know, there might be
an advantage,

243
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:52,358
but last year might
have been easier for me.

244
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,761
- Why?
- Because when I injured myself,

245
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,531
I went home, and I was out
of commission for a few months,

246
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:02,502
you know, and I'd never been
so low on myself before.

247
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,404
Like my body gave out on me.

248
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,373
And I think because I went
through that dark adventure,

249
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,910
coming into this season there's
some moments in this competition

250
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,779
that I thought
I was going to break,

251
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,181
and that I wasn't sure if I
would be able to push through.

252
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,717
- Well, a lot of times
the dark night of the soul

253
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,587
is the passageway
to the other side.

254
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,522
You have to walk through
the fire, baby.

255
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,290
You know, I've been doing this
for 300 years.

256
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,327
Michelle's been doing it
for like over 400 years.

257
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,394
- Thank you. Yes,I have.

258
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,363
- And the way you survive

259
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,332
is you have to sustain yourself,
and certain things,

260
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,501
you just cut out
the things that don't matter

261
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,336
and you focus on
the things that do.

262
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,438
What does matter to you?

263
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:39,906
- My mom matters more
than anything.

264
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,107
- Aw.

265
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,876
- My mother was diagnosed
with throat cancer

266
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,377
when Season 9 started airing.

267
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,412
- Oh, jeez.
- Before I left...

268
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,847
She actually wasn't talking

269
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,084
because she was so swollen,
the voice valve wouldn't work.

270
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,553
And while I was here,
that's been the hardest thing,

271
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,421
because she taught me
how to work hard.

272
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,656
You know what I mean?

273
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,291
You know, I wish I could be
as strong as her,

274
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,959
and be able to be there.
- Yeah.

275
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,094
- It took a long time
for me to believe

276
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,929
that I could come back
and make it to the top,

277
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,198
but my mama said that I could,

278
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,167
and I'm going to, you know.

279
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,472
So that she remembers the
strength that she gave me

280
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,973
so that she can be strong.

281
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,042
You know what I mean?

282
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,415
- Well, well, well, here she is.
- Hi.

283
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,783
- Asia O'Hara.

284
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,852
These are Ru's producers
for "American," Kummerspeck.

285
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:31,357
- I have never been in front of
an actual music producer before,

286
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,694
so it is very intimidating
to stand here

287
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,663

and do Ru's song justice.

- Michelle Visage,
I want to introduce you

333
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,520
to the stylings of Giovanni.

334
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,721
- Hi.
- Hi. Giovanni.

335
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,390
- Giovanni.
- How's it going? Bon jour.

336
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,792
- People call you Giovanni?
- Yes.

337
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,360
- Can I call you Joey?

338
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,595
- You can call me
whatever you want,

339
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,730
as long as you make
the check out to Giovanni.

340
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,599
- Yeah. How old were you

341
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,134
when you became aware
of "Drag Race?"

342
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,136
- I think I was in seventh grade
or something,

343
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,439
and I wanted to know
how the heck I could get on.

344
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,741
- Did you know you were a
drag queen in the seventh grade?

345
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,912
- No, but I did know that I had
a lot of artistic inclinations.

346
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,814
- Is that code for gay?

347
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,716
- [laughs]

348
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,951
- You're from Philly, right?
- Yes, the suburbs.

349
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,253
- Ah. When did you move
to New York?

350
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,822
- I moved to New York
straight out of high school.

351
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,991
I went to pursue
women's wear design

352
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,393
at the Fashion Institute
of Technology.

353
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,795
- And did you actually
go to FIT?

354
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,897
- I went for a year and a week.

355
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,633
- [laughs]
Then you met Susanne Bartsch.

356
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,968
- Pretty much.
- The story of our lives.

357
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,871
- So what have you learned about
yourself in this competition?

358
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,274
- I've learned,
you know, so much

359
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,410
about needing to take care
of Giovanni as well as Aquaria.

360
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,447
The confidence in what I say

361
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:12,351
is really what I feel has grown
during this experience.

362
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,253
- Sure.
- Being in this competition,

363
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,222
I've learned to communicate
more with people,

364
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,691
and warm up to people,
and let them warm up to me.

365
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,427
I think it's important because
I'm not Aquaria all the time,

366
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,063
and sometimes I forget that.

367
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,032
- What are you going to do

368
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:30,336
to take home this golden
Tweeterhead statuette?

369
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,972
- I'm gonna knock you both out
and just grab it right now.

370
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,440
- Try me, bitch.

371
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,275
- I came here prepared.

372
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,045
I came here determined.

373
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,880
And I'm going to leave here

374
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,282
with that motherfucking
Tweeterhead trophy.

375
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,151
[all laugh]

376
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,753
I am one step away

377
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,756
from winning the title of
America's next drag superstar.

378
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,791
And I have thought
my entire life

379
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,726
that I was America's
next drag superstar,

380
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,294
so y'all ain't even ready.

381
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,598
- Hello.
- Hi, Kameron.

382
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,033
- Michelle, get ready
to have your ear chewed off

383
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,703
by the talkative Kameron.

384
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,037
- [laughs]
- So loud all the time.

385
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,706
- Oh, my God,
you talk so much, Kameron.

386
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,407
- I talk so much.
You can't shut me up.

387
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,675
- I want to talk about that.

388
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,345
Your description of yourself
is that you're shy,

389
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,648
but some birdies told me

390
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,416
that when the camera
is off of you,

391
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,218
you can't shut you up.

392
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,721
- I mean, I definitely
am a little more reserved

393
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,156
if I know
I'm in front of the camera,

394
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,290
except when I'm on stage.

395
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,159
- Yeah.
- Then I'm selling it.

396
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,795
- Then what is it you're
afraid of people knowing?

397
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,797
- [sighs] I don't know.

398
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,932
My dad was a very strong person.

399
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,934
He didn't speak his emotions.

400
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,403
Maybe that's my problem
is I like to just do it

401
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,471
rather than talk about it,

402
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,273
and maybe talking about it
scares me.

403
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,142
- And by the way, that's what
the challenge was for last week,

404
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,812
was show us
that part of yourself

405
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,648
that you don't want to be seen.
- Yeah.

406
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,049
- But you didn't really show it.

407
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,985
- Maybe, you know, even though
I am my own worst critic,

408
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,923
just hearing me talk about
myself out loud, it's scary.

409
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,357
- But those are the places

410
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,760
that allow us
to fall in love with you.

411
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,695
- Yeah.
- That's what we want to do.

412
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,764
And so the audience at home
will fall in love with you.

413
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,999
- Because
we still don't know you.

414
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,202
- Is your father still with us?

415
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,405
- He's not. My father passed
away about five years ago.

416
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,373
- Were you close?
- Yeah, I was very close.

417
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,342
My parents both loved me
very much.

418
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,911
They came to see my shows.
They supported me 100%.

419
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,346
- Your father
went to see the shows?

420
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,614
- Yeah. My dad, I think,

421
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,016
may have been a little offset
in the beginning,

422
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,184
but I remember he said to me,

423
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,353
I don't have a problem
with you being gay,

424
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,155
but he goes, just don't
dress up as a woman.

425
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,091
And lo and behold, here I am.

426
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,759
And, you know,
he came to the show,

427
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,230
he understood it,
and he supported it in the end.

428
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,397
- What do you think
your father would say

429
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,234
about your performance
in this competition?

430
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,369
- You know, before he passed,

431
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,372
I think I was struggling
to find my place in life,

432
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,074
and I didn't really know
my direction

433
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,942
or what I wanted to do
with my life.

434
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,613
And his biggest thing with me
was don't ever say can't.

435
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,048
Can't is not a word.
You can and you will.

436
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,551
You know, just find
your inner strength and do.

437
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,753
And I think me finally
finding something

438
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,622
that I am good at
and that I enjoy,

439
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,991
I think he'd be very proud of me
finding the direction

440
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,960
and sticking to it
and just going for it.

441
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,064
- All right,
let's just play the music,

442
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,332
and I want to hear what you got.
- Okay.

443
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,101
- I want you to be committed
from the beginning.

444
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,335
- I'm so ready for it.

445
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,504
- Kill it, bitch.

446
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,506
- ♪ You can be a stripe
and get in line ♪

447
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,142
♪ Or be a star
and not be defined ♪

448
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,844
- He's losing the beat
like on the second half.

449
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,946
So just stay on the beat
on the second half.

450
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,347
- It needs to be
right in the pocket

451
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,749
if you're going to be rapping.

452
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,451
- Okay. ♪ You can be a stripe
and get in line ♪

453
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,988
♪ Or be a star
and not be defined. Ha-ha ♪

454
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,456
- That was great.
I loved that.

455
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,692
- When you're in it and your
hands start moving and stuff,

456
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,693
I can tell that you're--

457
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,361
- Feeling the personality.
- Yes.

458
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,530
It's like the Holy Ghost
has crept into Eureka.

459
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,998
- Oh, my God.

460
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:50,569
I have normally been terrified
of singing in front of people.

461
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,139
Bitch, I feel great today.

462
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,675
♪ Come on, y'all,
let's live free ♪

463
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,344
♪ I'm an elephant queen,
what are you gonna be? ♪

464
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,980
- I just think you should

465
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,048
just make an elephant noise
at the end.

466
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,115
Whatever you want.

467
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,283
- How do you make
an elephant noise?

468
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,652
- Do a blblblbl.
[all laugh]

469
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,954
- Bblblblbl.

470
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,456
- Like scream inside
and do that at the same time.

471
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,691
Blblblbl.

472
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,926
- Blblblbl. Is that right?

473
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,328
- Up. Go up,
like you're screaming.

474
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,729
- Blblblbl.

475
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,930
- Blblblbl.
- Blblblbl.

476
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,333
It's so bad.
What is that?

477
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,101
I can't even do it.

478
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,903
Blblblbl.

479
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,638
[all laugh]

480
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,306
- I'm like, girl,
I ain't never heard

481
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,441
an elephant sound like that.

482
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,110
- Hi.

483
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,312
- Asia is here
from Dallas, Texas.

484
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,948
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi, Asia.

485
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,083
You're finally on the podcast.

486
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,385
- I am.
I have waited my entire life.

487
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,554
- Well, you're 35.
- 35, yes.

488
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,722
- You look much younger
than that.

489
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,323
- Thank you so much.

490
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,092
- You really do.
- Thank you.

491
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,593
- So I know that
in your personal life

492
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,129
you've had some real adversity.

493
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,232
I know that your parents
are no longer with us.

494
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:57,269
How were you able to overcome
that in your personal life?

495
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,938
- You know, there's
something that happens

496
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,974
when you lose your parents
at an early age.

497
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,577
- How old were you?
- I was 27.

498
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,878
- Both.
- Both, yes.

499
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,313
- At the same time.
- Same year.

500
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,449
My mother passed in January
and my father passed in July.

501
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,719
Being forced into that situation
so early in life,

502
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,588
it provides for you a situation

503
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,524
where mentally, spiritually,
emotionally, financially,

504
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,960
you have to depend on yourself
because that's all you have.

505
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,896
But I think the beauty
that came out of that for me

506
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:28,934
was I became hyper-sensitive
to family connection

507
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,570
with people
that I'm not related to.

508
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,141
- So you're creating family
outside of your blood family.

509
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,409
- Yes.

510
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,911
- At what point did you have
this breakthrough moment

511
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,312
in this competition?

512
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,082
- Actually it was when you were
doing a walkthrough with me,

513
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,985
and you looked me
squarely in the face,

514
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,154
and you said,
remember who you are.

515
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,923
And I don't have any tattoos
or piercings,

516
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,191
but that was the first phrase

517
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,826
that I ever ran across
in my life

518
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,127
that I felt like

519
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,730
I could look at this on my body
for the rest of my life.

520
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,832
And, you know, in that moment,
you looked at me,

521
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,002
and it was more about
the silence after you said it

522
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,237
where I felt like
you were speaking to me

523
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,972
in so many different layers
and levels,

524
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,475
and you knew
everything about me,

525
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,876
both in and out of drag.

526
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,345
And now every decision I make,

527
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,116
both in my personal life
and in drag since that moment

528
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:20,419
revolves around the statement
remember who you are.

529
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,621
And that has opened up doors
for me

530
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,958
to do what I do best
and do it very well.

531
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:31,497

534
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,872
I think you're singing
way too low.

535
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,140
I think you'll notice.

- [sighs]

546
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,795
I won the last
singing challenge,

547
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,498
and of course the bar
is set very high for me.

548
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,866
Todrick is not going to take

549
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,568
anything less than amazing
for this,

550
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,103
and I have to give it to him.

551

- Other than my crack,
yeah, it was good.

558
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,757
- Fuck the crack.
- Yeah, okay.

559
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,093
- We can fix the crack later,
okay?

560
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,394
You can't fix emotion.

561
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,729
That's what you can't fix.

562
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,998
If you learn anything from this,

563
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,234
it's to really trust
and like believe in yourself,

564
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,669
because sometimes
I don't feel that.

565
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,371
- Thank you, guys.

566
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,077
- She's back.
- Yes. How'd it go?

567
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,346
- Really, really, really good.

568
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,549
- Good.

569
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,150
- I mean, that's how I feel.

570
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,518
- Well, tell us more about it.
Sing a little bit for me.

571
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,886
I want to know.
I'm so excited.

572
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,022
- Oh, no, I just sang it
like seven times.

573
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,356
I don't want to sing it anymore.

574
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,558
- We'll do ours for you.
- This is Eureka.

575
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:06,792
She's not going to take no
for an answer.

576
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,093
- Please.

577
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,296
- Why don't you buy the track
on iTunes when it goes--

578
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,398
- Hello.
- So how does it go?

579
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,201
I'm just curious.

580
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,604
- Eureka is hounding Kameron
to sing this part for her.

581
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,838
Leave this woman alone.

582
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,707
- I feel like as much as
she's fighting to get it,

583
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,042
I'm going to fight
not to give it now.

584
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,743
I feel like it's just--
- Okay, girl, that's fine.

585
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,979
I ain't got no time
for none of y'all right now.

586
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,314
- Kameron
has clearly made it clear

587
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,149
that she does not want
to sing her part for you.

588
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,650
- I also know Kameron,

589
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,953
and sometimes he just needs
a little encouragement.

590
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,922
- Oh, I didn't realize that
you were the Kameron Whisperer.

591
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,024
- Of course,
because I know Kameron,

592
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,426
I'm trying to be
her cheerleader,

593
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:43,028
and next thing you know,
Asia's like, oh, here's Eureka

594
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,197
going and forcing Kameron to do
something she don't want to do.

595
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,766
And I'm like, girl, shut up.

596
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,536
Okay, so sing me
a little bit of this.

597
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,937
- So just go on and sing it.

598
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,806
- Why? Cause I feel like I'm
really good at being silent.

599
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,840
- Oh, my God.

600
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,342
Girl, y'all
wear me the hell out.

601
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,377
- What? We're just minding
our own business,

602
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,478
and you're the one
forcing people

603
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,479
to do shit
they don't wanna do.

604
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,981
How are we wearing you out?

605
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,250
- Because you gotta be
dramatica.

606
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,552
You're always trying to make
a mountain out of a molehill.

607
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,987
- No, the thing is, Eureka,

608
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,755
you do not understand
that it is a mountain

609
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,023
just because
it's a molehill to you.

610
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,792
- Girl, bye, Felicia.
- [laughs]

611
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,928
- I know Asia
likes to be very motherly,

612
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,631
but sometimes I'm like, mama,
let the kids play.

613
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,867
Sit down
and tease your hair, bitch.

614
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,801
- Hey.

615
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,069
- Here we go,
here we go again.

616
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,138
- So for the maxi challenge,

617
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,539
we have to learn choreography

618
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,308
and perform it live
in front of the judges.

619
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,810
My favorite time of day.

620
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,747
Choreograph-ay.

621
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,415
- We've got to bring it

622
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,683
because this performance
is sponsored by Today Tix.

623
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:38,684
Y'all familiar with that?

624
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,119
- Yes.
- You know what it is.

625
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,787
- I got your tickets today.

626
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,022
- For those of you
who don't know,

627
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,490
these Tennesseans over here,

628
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,192
that's how you get the tickets
to see the good Broadway shows

629
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,861
for a more affordable price.

630
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,863
Y'all ready to get started?

631
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:51,997
- Yes, sir.
- Absolutely.

632
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,133
- Let's do it.
I have to just be honest.

633
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,301
This this
the most difficult dance

634
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,702
that I have ever given
to people,

635
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,871
and that's because
you all have raised the bar,

636
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,739
so I have to raise the bar
from my end.

637
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,508
I'm just gonna work
with just Aquaria for right now.

638
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,609
- Let's do it.

639
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,144
- You guys can take a seat
over there.

640
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:08,047
Is there a move that
is like your signature thing

641
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,381
that you would like to do?

642
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,516
- I love turning.

643
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:11,717
- Are you a left turner?

644
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,085
- I can turn either way.

645
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,153
- Oh, come on, bitch.

646
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,521
- Turning looks
and turning period.

647
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,555
- Okay.

648
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,594
- Of course, Aquaria is
turning it right from the gate.

649
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,029
- Turning looks.

650
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,064
Then you're going to go
like this.

651
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,899
Stunning, pretty.

652
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:28,600
Can we try all that
from the top?

653
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,769
- ♪ Turning looks,
stunning, pretty ♪

654
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,638
♪ I'm the bitch
from New York City ♪

655
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,808
- Oh, Mylanta.

656
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,509
- Killing it. Great job.

657
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,677
- Thank you.

658
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,813
- You're such a fast learner.
- Great choreo.

659
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,814
- Oh, thank you.

660
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,148
Don't be flirting
with me, okay?

661
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,451
[all laugh]
I'm a judge on this show.

662
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:48,354
All right, Asia,
you are up next.

663
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,193
- It's very surreal being
in rehearsal for this right now.

664
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,499
I'm like losing it right now.

665
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,702
I'm already starting to imagine
the finished product,

666
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,705
and I'm getting really gagged
and choked up.

667
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,643
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry. I'm really excited.

668
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,579
- Is that why you're crying?
- Yeah.

669
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,913
I'm just very excited

670
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,081
and like really grateful
to be here.

671
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,783
- What are you thinking
right now?

672
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:19,818
- About how fucking cool
this is.

673
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,587
- [laughs]
- I'm not joking. I'm sorry.

674
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:22,788
- Well, I love that.

675
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:23,989
- Thank you.
- Okay, as you were.

676
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,427
Asia O'Hara, bring it.

677
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,629
- The last time Todrick
taught the choreography to me,

678
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,797
it was terrible.

679
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,866
And I'm looking forward
to my second chance

680
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,168
to prove that I'm a star
in front of him.

681
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,469
- Okay, one, da-da-da.

682
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,738
Twist, twist.
Around, six, seven.

683
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,840
Hip, hip, and out
two, three, and four,

684
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,276
and five, six, up.

685
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,844
Oh, she came to fight today.

686
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,148
Point that finger like you're
ready to take a bitch down.

687
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,651
I see you, competition,
and I'm coming for that ass.

688
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,685
- Yes.

689
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,255
- I think Asia
is probably the one

690
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,557
that might be
my biggest competition

691
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,659
because she is so confident

692
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,429
and she knows what it takes
to win a crown.

693
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:04,997
- Kameron Michaels.

694
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:11,537
So you say,
we will not be silent

695
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:15,374
and I won't sit down.

696
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,976
Very fast.
Can I see you try to do that?

697
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,378
- Blah.

698
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,280
- Five, six, seven, eight.

699
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,150
We will not be silent
and I won't sit down.

700
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,719
- Oh, fuck.

701
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,588
- Can you handle this?
- I can.

702
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,390
It's just going to
take me a while to get it.

703
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,493
- For my top three,
as far as statistics go,

704
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,696
it would be me, Asia,
and Aquaria.

705
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,732
But this last challenge is gonna
determine where Kameron stands.

706
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,435
- And one, two, three, four,

707
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,838
five, six, seven, eight.

708
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:48,841
Just try to make it look swaggy.

709
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,309
That's all I can say.
- Yeah.

710
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,412
- When you get it,
it can't be like...

711
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,581
People should be like, oh,
she's coming for these hos.

712
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,815
You got a lot of work to do.

713
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,016
- Yep.

714
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,018
- The dancers
are gonna be like killing it,

715
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,286
and if you are not,

716
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,388
it will obviously be like
a make or break deal.

717
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,291
Eureka, are you ready?

718
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,493
- Never more.

719
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,094
- Let's make it happen.

720
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,697
Watch me smile
and watch me slay.

721
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,232
'Cause I'm living
for my true self.

722
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,634
So you're gonna go here,
cross, down.

723
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,669
- I'm living my own.
- Hip.

724
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,538
- Oh, living for my true self.

725
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,640
Living for my true self.

726
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,243
Is that right?
- Yeah, just go up, down.

727
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,244
Don't overthink it.

728
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,913
But if we come together
we can rise.

729
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,014
I came from nothing.

730
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,282
Made we wanna scream.

731
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,351
But I fought for my piece
of the American dream.

732
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:35,053
Just make sure
that you bring it to life,

733
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,356
because last time you knew
some of the choreography,

734
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,025
but without your face
and without your personality,

735
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,460
Eureka is not Eureka.

736
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,662
- Yeah. Oh, Mylanta.

737
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,398
Like, come on, come on, girl.
Clock in.

738
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,734
- With this number,
the most important thing

739
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,502
is that if you make a mistake,

740
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,237
it's gonna be
very, very noticeable,

741
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,639
because this
is all about precision.

742
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,643
Your arms are gonna go one, two,

743
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,711
you're gonna put your hand on
your heart and then a salute.

744
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:00,812
Cool.

745
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,814
And one, two, three, four,

746
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,217
and five, six, step out, eight.

747
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,853
So on seven, you're gonna
step out with your right leg.

748
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,621
- Okay.
- Eight. Cool?

749
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,490
- Here, here.

750
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,524
- But you're gonna step out
and then together.

751
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,693
- And Todrick is like

752
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,762
just do this right here
and step here.

753
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,230
And I'm like...

754
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:23,468
Okay. I thought I did.

755
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,637
- And one and two, three, four,

756
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,340
and five and six
and seven and eight.

757
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,575
Let's do this again.
- What's the foot--

758
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,443
the kick part one more time,
if you don't mind?

759
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,444
- Literally act like
you're going like this,

760
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,679
boom, boom, down.

761
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,681
Boom, boom, down.
- Boom, boom, boom.

762
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:36,848
And it's gotta be fast.

763
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,884
And one and two,
three and four,

764
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,653
and five, six, seven, eight.

765
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,290
- Literally, I'm in between
Aquaria and Asia,

766
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,225
and they're getting it
perfectly.

767
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,861
And I'm sitting here
looking like a crazy trollop

768
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:54,266
dancing around like
boop-boop-boop-boo-boo.

769
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:57,703
- Right, left, turn and pose.

770
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,237
Great. It seems like
the two of you

771
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,439
really know what's going on.

772
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,474
Eureka, are there any questions
on this part so far?

773
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,575
- Choreography is a weakness,

774
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,210
but I promise
I'm going to be strong

775
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,278
and I'm going
to fight through it.

776
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,546
- Okay.

777
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:10,115
- I want everybody
to look great,

778
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,484
so whatever you need to do--
- I know you do.

779
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,487
- If I were you,
don't sleep tonight.

780
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,723
Rehearse this.
Rehearse it, rehearse it.

781
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,725
- I can do this.

782
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,293
I can do this.
I can do this.

783
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,961
I can do this.

784
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:26,965
Big bitch gonna have to rehearse
her fat ass off and learn this.

785
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,166
Because I'm not going nowhere.

786
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,074
- Aah!
- Yay.

787
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,342
All: Top four.

788
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,478
[cheering]

789
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:40,646
- This is the last time

790
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:42,881
we will be entering the workroom
in Season 10,

791
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,617
and it's so emotional.

792
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,719
I can taste the crown.

793
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,721
It's metal-ly.

794
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,057
- Ooh, what is going on?

795
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,792
- But did I see cocktails?

796
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,560
There is always time
for a cocktail.

797
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,561
Oh, my gosh.

798
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,331
Thank you,
Micky's West Hollywood.

799
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,332
- Yeah.
- Hi, Micky's.

800
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,333
- I love Micky's.

801
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,369
- Cheers
to being in the top four

802
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,637
and making it this far.

803
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,106
- Top four
big, slutty whores.

804
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,742
- Bon jour.
- Mmm.

805
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,444
- Girl, we should have started
every day with a toast.

806
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,279
Maybe some of the people
would have still been here.

807
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,280
Let's do America proud.

808
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,448
Let's get ready
for the last runway.

809
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,817
- I think I'm gonna
finally move my stuff.

810
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,185
- [gasps]

811
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,353
- Are you guys
gonna be so offended

812
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,121
if I get ready with you today?

813
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,589
I'm used to
getting ready alone,

814
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,792
but it is the final day

815
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,860
that we will be getting ready
together in the workroom.

816
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,129
- Welcome, Kameron.

817
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,397
- Hi, girl.

818
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,099
- All it took was
for her to get to the top four

819
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,934
to be social with us.

820
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,107
- It is hot over here.

821
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:44,176
If I start sweating,
I can't do this.

822
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,813
Okay, so I came over here
to be nice.

823
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:49,081
I did not come over here
for this heat.

824
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,182
My makeup is melting off.

825
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,584
No matter how much
I love these girls,

826
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:55,187
it is a competition
and this is the final day

827
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,788
and I refuse
to look like shit.

828
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,262
- And...Kameron's gone.

829
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,800
- So I think my best memory
in this competition

830
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,336
was probably winning
Snatch Game,

831
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,472
like what an iconic
challenge to win.

832
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:14,973
- I know.
I was so jealous.

833
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,642
I really, really wanted
to win Snatch Game, too.

834
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,544
My least favorite moment

835
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,780
was when I thought
that I fucked up

836
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,849
on the choreography
for PharmaRusical.

837
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:25,484
And it turned out
that I was so in my head

838
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:26,785
that I missed my words.

839
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,353
And I was like, fuck.

840
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,688
- I guess my worst memory

841
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,557
is when Tisha Campbell
was a judge,

842
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,661
and I did so bad, and just
having to hear her tell me

843
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,763
you fucking blew it.

844
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:40,665
- I mean, I regret
that in the moments

845
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,034
that I know that I shouldn't say
what I'm going to say,

846
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,069
I still say it.

847
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,505
I regret not having a filter.

848
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,474
I'm so sensitive right now
with it being the end,

849
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,277
and I'm already
so terrified of this.

850
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:53,678
- ♪ I am terrified ♪

851
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,148
- You know, I've got some things
I'm shaking off,

852
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,450
but I know
I have to turn this out.

853
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,719
Nothing else matters.

854
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,554
Today is the day.

855
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,325
- Y'all can't take it.

856
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,995
I don't mean to be that girl,
but can y'all believe

857
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,963
that one of us
in this workroom right now

858
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,965
is going to be the winner
of Season 10?

859
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,133
- Yes. Oh, my gosh.

860
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,002
- I mean, I can believe

861
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,204
because you know
I'm crazy and I think it's me.

862
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:20,438
- Well, I think
you've done a lovely job

863
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,240
for a first alternate.

864
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,509
And you'll be a lovely
second alternate.

865
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,577
- Damn!

866
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:27,445
- And you'll be a lovely
third alternate.

867
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,347
- So Eureka has ranked us.

868
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,050
- I don't care what order y'all
are in, I'm just trying to win.

869
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,953
- To be quite honest with you,
I think it should be me,

870
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,990
but, I mean, I also do,
you know, kind of feel like

871
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,560
the odds may be stacked
against me.

872
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,495
- I'm paranoid that the odds
are stacked against me, too,

873
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,363
but are you all feeling
the same way?

874
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,499
- I mean, the odds are not
technically stacked against me,

875
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,835
but the fact that the odds
aren't stacked against me

876
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,604
stacks the odds against me,
you know what I'm saying?

877
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,606
- What about you, Kameron?

878
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:58,977
- Um...maybe I've never
wanted to say it

879
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,712
because I feel like
I don't want to be disappointed,

880
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,847
but I've worked really hard,

881
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,982
and I could see myself
with the crown.

882
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,217
- But you know who, above all

883
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:09,321
really should be the winner
of this contest?

884
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,589
Vanjie.

885
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,757
- Not Vanjie, bitch.
- Yes, honey, Vanjie.

886
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,826
Vanessa "Vanjie" Mateo.

887
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,063
This is really the last chance
to impress the judges.

888
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:20,866
More than ever,
there is no room for error.

889
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,267
Not one misstep.

890
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,636
Not one hair out of place.
Not one missed word.

891
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,505
We're this much closer to being
America's next drag superstar,

892
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,709

for fuck-ups.

very important question.

901
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:14,352
Who all is registered to vote

- I feel amazing
walking down the runway.

1031
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:52,523
I am wearing a nude illusion
lavender AB Stone gown.

1032
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,792
It is I think
the most glamorous thing

1033
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,461
that I've worn
the entire competition.

1034
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:59,597
And I feel sexy,
I feel beautiful,

1035
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,832
and it feels great.

1036
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,468
- Don't be fooled by the rocks
that she's got.

1037
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:04,535
- Uh-huh.

1038
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,137
- Still just Kameron
from Tennessee.

1039
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,305
- Yes.

1040
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,640
Eureka.

1041
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,074
- What's on her head?

1042
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,477
[all laugh]

1043
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:16,547
- This really is Eureka's
defining moment.

1044
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,549
- Ooh, I am going to read her.

1045
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,884
[all laugh]

1046
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:22,287
- When Thomas Edison
discovered the light bulb,

1047
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,222
he said, eureka!

1048
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,556
So that's what eureka means.

1049
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,492
I'm trying to show
the judges right now

1050
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:30,061
that I'm fierce
and I'm glamorous,

1051
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:31,796
but I'm also campy and fun,

1052
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,666
full of love and energy
and excitement.

1053
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,735
I'm feeling a little
light headed I look so fierce.

1054
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:40,805
- How many queens does it take
to screw in a dictionary?

1055
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,473
[all laugh]

1056
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,609
- Eureka, get to the point.

1057
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,578
[all laugh]

1058
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,415
- Back to the library.

1059
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:52,717
- Welcome, ladies.

1060
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:56,854
It's time for
your final four critiques.

1061
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,057
First up, Aquaria.

1062
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,159
- You look so phenomenal.

1063
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,794
Because
it's a classic silhouette,

1064
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:04,228
but you do it this Aquaria way,

1065
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,230
with the cutout,
with the jewelry on the face.

1066
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,267
It's just like
the next level of gorg.

1067
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,135
- I think all
of your fashion looks,

1068
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,771
the Hat's Incredible look
was amazing.

1069
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,039
The denim and diamonds,

1070
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,575
the Alaskan and Miami winter
and summer realness,

1071
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,845
every week you brought
amazing looks to the runway,

1072
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,914
and this one is no exception.

1073
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,283
- In "American,"
there were some lyrics

1074
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:27,752
that made me laugh because
they were very pure queenie.

1075
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,587
It was really fun
to see you be you,

1076
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,255
and your choreography
was perfect.

1077
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,490
- It was so awesome

1078
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,993
to work with such a young queen
who is so humble.

1079
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,228
You've clearly done your work

1080
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,230
to become this polished
at this young of an age.

1081
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,398
- Ru and I often say

1082
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,034
you couldn't tell us nothing
at 21 years old.

1083
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,069
And I want to congratulate you

1084
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:48,206
on being able to take criticism
and critique

1085
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,640
and handle it well

1086
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,477
and try to use it
to better yourself.

1087
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:53,778
And that's something
that's going to come in handy

1088
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,546
for the rest of your life.

1089
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,583
- Up next, Asia O'Hara.

1090
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,685
- This is like
such an eye-gasm for me.

1091
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,087
I'm looking at you,
and it doesn't even feel real.

1092
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,691
No one can rock a diamond beard
if they're not a true star.

1093
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,861
- The dance routine tonight,
you were so happy doing it.

1094
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,263
And I think
that's a big part of dance,

1095
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,765
being expressive
and being joyful

1096
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:14,932
and having a good time doing it.

1097
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,834
- What you wrote is poetry.

1098
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,102
It's beautiful.

1099
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:21,406
You really showed us
even more about who you are

1100
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,207
while making
a political statement,

1101
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,143
and that's a real artist.
- Thank you.

1102
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,111
- Overall, you've had
some great moments.

1103
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,281
Probably one of my favorite
looks of the entire competition

1104
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,816
was the Tweety Bird dress.

1105
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,852
- And you were the ugly girl
in the Buttrface commercial.

1106
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,220
- I mean, when you were
like on the beach

1107
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,489
with your Baywatch body
and your hurricane face.

1108
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,490
[all laugh]

1109
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,993
- You literally
were the funniest thing

1110
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:44,262
out of all of them.

1111
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:48,766
And even the times that you
may not have won the challenge,

1112
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,536
trust me, this has been such
a tight season so many times,

1113
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:53,504
and you were so close
many times.

1114
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,640
And you should be
really proud of yourself.

1115
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,275
- I am. Thank you.

1116
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,310
- All right, up next, Eureka.

1117
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,344
- Hey, girl.

1118
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,180
- You really light up a stage.

1119
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,581
[all laugh]
- I try.

1120
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,516
- Now could I read you
for just a minute?

1121
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,951
- Please.

1122
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:07,952
- I love this look tonight.

1123
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,554
I think it is so fun.

1124
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:12,023
When you left, I was like,
can she please come back?

1125
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,192
You're like a fun
like carnival ride

1126
00:43:14,192 --> 00:43:16,394
that you go on over
and over and over again.

1127
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,329
- I've heard that before.
- [laughs]

1128
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,498
- You have this spark
and this energy

1129
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:22,934
that it's impossible for
the people who are watching you

1130
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,268
not to be infected.

1131
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,504
That sounded really--
- Really horrible.

1132
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:28,673
Now, tonight
in the dance performance,

1133
00:43:28,673 --> 00:43:32,577
you chose the skinniest heels
of all heels to dance in,

1134
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,880
which was the dumbest idea,
but you turned it.

1135
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,318
You've had an amazing run here,
but you've worked at it.

1136
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,954
My personal favorite moment
was Big Baby.

1137
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,489
- Big Baby.
- [laughs]

1138
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:45,990
- You're standing up there

1139
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,626
because you found the Eureka
that we all fell in love with

1140
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,896
and you brought her
to a whole 'nother level.

1141
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,865
- Thank you very much.

1142
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,633
- Up next, Kameron Michaels.

1143
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,868
My goodness, what a knockout.

1144
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,069
- Thank you.

1145
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,704
- Tonight, you looked stunning
on the runway.

1146
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,540
This is different to anything
you've really done.

1147
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,908
- It's like something that,
I don't know,

1148
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:05,610
like J-Lo would wear this
in a Vegas show.

1149
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:06,878
- And the choreography.

1150
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:08,980
That was some rhythm-nation
shit right there.

1151
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,815
[all laugh]
- More than the choreography,

1152
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,484
and more than getting
to watch you come out on stage

1153
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,152
and shine like this tonight,

1154
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,756
my favorite moment was being
in the studio with you on stage,

1155
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,359
and watching you sing
and watching your face

1156
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,995
when you realized that
you had the gift to sing.

1157
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,464
- Your line in your song,
"kids called me names

1158
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:27,798
"and tried to tear me down,

1159
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:31,135
"but I had big old dreams,
bigger than my small town.

1160
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,572
Now I'm here with Mama Ru,
Americans just like you."

1161
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:37,642
You speak for so many of us.

1162
00:44:37,642 --> 00:44:42,747
I got so emotional listening
to you sing those words,

1163
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:44,482
thinking about
the people at home

1164
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,284
watching that in small towns,

1165
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,119
knowing exactly what
you're talking about.

1166
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,422
- And your ass almost went home,
what, three times?

1167
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,423
- Three times.

1168
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,758
- I did not think

1169
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,693
you could lip sync the way
that you lip sync, bitch.

1170
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,663
You can turn the party.

1171
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,231
- You are a true survivor.

1172
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,066
- Thank you so much.

1173
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,635
- Welcome back, ladies.

1174
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:08,506
I gotta say, you know,
whenever we do the final four,

1175
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:09,874
I always get very emotional,

1176
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,643
because I know,
I know the struggle.

1177
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,545
I know what you all
had to do to get here,

1178
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,848
not just in this competition,
but in your lives.

1179
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:23,754
You should be very,
very proud of yourselves.

1180
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,490
You really should.

1181
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,827
Now, so many
of our younger viewers

1182
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,697
watch this show
to find their tribe.

1183
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,832
That's why I ask each of you

1184
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:39,303
to take a moment
to look back and reflect.

1185
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:46,877
Aquaria, what advice do you have
for three-year-old Giovanni?

1186
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,079
- Aw. With a boa.

1187
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,680
- Well, for starters,
I would say

1188
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,881
get it the fuck together

1189
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,683
because those are
cheap feathers,

1190
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,018
a really shitty tutu,

1191
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:55,686
and we're going to need
a higher heel.

1192
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,755
[all laugh]

1193
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:02,026
You have so much opportunity
and privilege allotted to you,

1194
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,595
and you have so many talents.

1195
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,565
And don't hesitate
from exploring them

1196
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,200
and really reaching
for the stars.

1197
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,669
But also, when you're 21,

1198
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:15,306
there's gonna be a really,
really strange man in a wig

1199
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:18,209
calling you on the phone,
inviting you to come to L.A.

1200
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,910
Say yes.

1201
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,746
And from an early age,

1202
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,215
you have the charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

1203
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,817
And if you thought
you were interested in drag

1204
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,953
starting in the seventh grade,
you're wrong.

1205
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,088
It started when you were three.

1206
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,957
[all laugh]
So...

1207
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,359
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1208
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,831
- Asia O'Hara, what advice
do you have for little Antoine?

1209
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,834
- I would say that beauty
is going to come into your life

1210
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,137
so many different times
in so many different ways.

1211
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,507
And quite often, the beauty
is going to come into your life

1212
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,410
cloaked in darkness and despair,
but there is beauty there.

1213
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,778
There's beauty in everything.

1214
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:56,047
And there's going to be
a point in your life

1215
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,115
when you're going to discover
something magical.

1216
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:01,485
And, you know, they say magic
always comes with a price,

1217
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,720
and you're going
to question that magic.

1218
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,991
But please know that
the price is so worth it.

1219
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,560
And just remember
that your only job

1220
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,363
is improve the quality
of the people around you.

1221
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:13,898
- Thank you.

1222
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:16,367
- Thank you.

1223
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:21,939
- Eureka, what advice do you
have for four-year-old David?

1224
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,075
- It's nice to see you,
little guy.

1225
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:25,710
You're not going to stay
that way very long.

1226
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,279
It's gonna put you through
a lot of things.

1227
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,514
People are gonna
torment you a lot.

1228
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,050
But one of the things
that's gonna make you special

1229
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,620
is that thing that you actually
hate the most about yourself.

1230
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:42,026
And it's gonna bring so much
light and happiness to your life

1231
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,262
when you realize that
it's okay to be a bigger person

1232
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,565
and to be proud of it.

1233
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,835
And when you do
finally realize it,

1234
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:54,438
you're gonna be able to bring so
much happiness to your family

1235
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,240
and to the people you're around

1236
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,910
and to people all over the world
that are also lost.

1237
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,879
And you know what
that feels like

1238
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,448
and you get the opportunity
to give that back to them.

1239
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,517
So you stay strong,

1240
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:10,254
and don't throw scissors at
your sister when you're seven.

1241
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,590
I love you.

1242
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,326
Thank you.

1243
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:16,827
- All right, Kameron Michaels,

1244
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:21,265
what advice do you have
for three-year-old Dane?

1245
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,800
- You're such a happy child,

1246
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,071
and that's probably gonna change
in a couple years.

1247
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,673
You're gonna feel very lost
and alone,

1248
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:31,776
like you don't have a place
in the world.

1249
00:48:31,776 --> 00:48:34,912
Until you become the person
that you're meant to be,

1250
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,014
and then you'll know
that different wasn't bad

1251
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,249
and different is good.

1252
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,284
You have two loving parents,

1253
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:46,390
and one of them is not gonna
be here to see this moment.

1254
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,594
So hug him and tell him
that you love him.

1255
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,863
And don't hide around the corner

1256
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,732
with the karaoke machine
and sing

1257
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:57,034
because you don't want
anyone to watch you,

1258
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,103
because you belong
in the spotlight

1259
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,839
and you will find it one day.

1260
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,675
- Thank you so much.

1261
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,143
- Thank you.

1262
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,879
- One final question
of national importance.

1263
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:13,717
Why should you, and not
one of your fellow queens,

1264
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,220
be named America's
next drag superstar?

1265
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,956
Aquaria.

1266
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:22,092
- So I'm obviously up here
with three amazing girls

1267
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,029
that it's been such
a pleasure connecting with

1268
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:26,397
on a very deep level.

1269
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:29,233
I think I've really shown
that I can rise to the occasion

1270
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:32,970
and surpass
not only my own expectations,

1271
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,941
but the expectations
of you all and everyone at home.

1272
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:41,545
I think that I have such
a unique Aquarian take on drag

1273
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,481
and somehow
all the pieces that I have

1274
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,585
come together
to make something incredible.

1275
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:51,222
And I really appreciate
the opportunity to show America

1276
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,723
and the rest of the world that.

1277
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,625
So I could not be more grateful.

1278
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,594
- Thank you, Aquaria.

1279
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:58,662
- Thank you.
- Asia.

1280
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,665
- I humbly think that I could be
America's next drag superstar

1281
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,502
because I want to be
an ambassador

1282
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,872
and I want to do everything
that I possibly can

1283
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:10,140
to make drag
a better place for everyone

1284
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,611
and more accepted and more
loved and more widespread.

1285
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:14,812
The main thing I've learned here

1286
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:17,147
is that being America's
next drag superstar

1287
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,683
is not a crown that you get

1288
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,353
or a title that's placed
in front of your name.

1289
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,055
It's a way of life, and it's
the way that you carry yourself.

1290
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,291
So I give you my word

1291
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,959
that I will be America's
next drag superstar

1292
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,961
for as long as I live.

1293
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,796
Not just until the next girl
comes through the ranks,

1294
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,732
but for the rest of my life.

1295
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:35,933
- Thank you.

1296
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:38,002
- Thank you.

1297
00:50:38,002 --> 00:50:40,237
- Eureka, same question.

1298
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:44,074
- Drag gave me a place where
I felt like I belonged finally,

1299
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,110
where being loud and animated

1300
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,647
and all these things that I am
and weigh too much can be good.

1301
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:53,350
Because all of that makes me
this giant ball of beautiful joy

1302
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,019
and I love everything about it.

1303
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,421
As America's
next drag superstar,

1304
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:58,522
I can teach the world
how to be

1305
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,425
that same beautiful person
inside and out,

1306
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,927
regardless of what
other people think.

1307
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,161
And that's why I know

1308
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,797
that I will be America's
next drag superstar.

1309
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,966
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1310
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:10,968
- Kameron Michaels.
- [sighs]

1311
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:13,237
You know, no matter
how many times I've faltered,

1312
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,571
I've gotten back up,

1313
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,808
and I think that's
a great theme for life.

1314
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,710
And I want to be
a shining example

1315
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,146
to everyone that has
ever faltered in their life

1316
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:24,949
to know that you can get up
and keep going,

1317
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,885
and when you do,
you will find confidence

1318
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,453
that you never knew
you had in yourself,

1319
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,856
and you will feel like the star
in whatever field that you are.

1320
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,492
And that's what I plan to do.

1321
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:38,362
- Thank you.

1322
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:41,532
Thank you, ladies.
While you untuck backstage,

1323
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:44,134
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1324
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,837
All right, now, just
between us squirrel-friends,

1325
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:49,273
final four, here we are.

1326
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,507
What do you think?

1327
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,809
Starting with Aquaria.

1328
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,611
- What a gem
she has been to watch.

1329
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,414
I mean, I knew of her from
Instagram before she started,

1330
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,150
I knew that my expectations
were going to be high

1331
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,188
with her looks and her makeup,
and I feel like she delivered.

1332
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:05,622
- Sometimes
with younger contestants,

1333
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,292
they don't get
all the fashion references.

1334
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,927
She got all of them.
A couple times I was like

1335
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,929
are you just schooling me
on your hat right now?

1336
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,231
- In the history
of this competition,

1337
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,900
she goes down
as one of the top five girls

1338
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,037
who has brought the looks
consistently.

1339
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,138
- I would agree.

1340
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,473
- I'd like the list
of the other four.

1341
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,208
- Raja, Detox.

1342
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,043
- Violet Chachki.
- And Miss Vanjie.

1343
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:28,112
- And Miss Vanjie.
Of course.

1344
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,514
I've got to tell you,
during that dance challenge,

1345
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,350
I could not
keep my eyes off of her.

1346
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,885
I was getting Madonna.

1347
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:38,756
- She can sing, she can dance,
and she owns the runway.

1348
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,557
Check, check, check,
check, check.

1349
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,159
- And she's won
the most challenges

1350
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,361
and she's never been
in the bottom the whole season.

1351
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,864
- Mm-hmm. I think she's played
an incredible game,

1352
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:49,400
and I think she's a force
to be reckoned with.

1353
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,070
- Asia O'Hara,
our Texas pageant girl.

1354
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,972
Asia is quite the competitor.

1355
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,874
When she came
into this competition,

1356
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:59,143
she was ready to get to work.

1357
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:02,312
- Asia is just
a seasoned performer,

1358
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,481
and she has nailed
so many challenges.

1359
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,583
Whether she won or not,
she was always close.

1360
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,085
- Like good twin/bad twin.

1361
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:10,587
I thought she was very close
to winning that.

1362
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:11,822
- Oh, yeah.

1363
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,924
- And she's so darn likable.

1364
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,793
- Every single note I gave her,
she was so willing to take.

1365
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:18,862
- She knows the responsibility
that comes with the crown,

1366
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,097
and she's ready for it.

1367
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:21,498
- She is one of those people

1368
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:25,402
that without those people
in our community, we'd crumble.

1369
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,006
And that's so important
to the work that we do,

1370
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:31,341
not only in here, but out there.

1371
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,445
And I think Asia would be
an incredible representative.

1372
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:37,014
- Let's move on to Eureka.

1373
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:39,650
Does she have to spell it out?
[all laugh]

1374
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:43,153
- Eureka is what this
competition is all about.

1375
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:47,091
She came from nothing,
she is more than something,

1376
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:50,861
always has been, but now,
going through the breakdown here

1377
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:52,963
and rising from the ashes
like the Phoenix,

1378
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:53,931
she now believes it.

1379
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,265
- Yeah, we know, girl.

1380
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,434
- She gives us glamorous looks
with a sense of humor.

1381
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:01,638
- Her outfit on the runway
was my favorite of the night.

1382
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,740
Only Eureka could pull off
a dress like that.

1383
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,976
- 'Cause it said "Eureka."
- [laughs]

1384
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:09,179
- In the choreography,
my eyes didn't leave Eureka.

1385
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,416
She was so incredibly dynamic.

1386
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,051
- I just love the fact
that this bitch

1387
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,886
is bigger than the dude
from "Green Mile,"

1388
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:18,322
and dancing
in a Polly Pocket ass heel,

1389
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:20,424
and she's slaying it.
I loved it.

1390
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:24,628
- The competition forces you
to really die a thousand deaths.

1391
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,197
And then if you really have
what it takes,

1392
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:32,469
you are reborn into something
bigger and badder and better.

1393
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,972
And that's exactly
what she's done here.

1394
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,807
Let's move on
to Kameron Michaels.

1395
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:38,041
- Kameron Michaels
isn't somebody

1396
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,911
I thought would be standing here
in the final four.

1397
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,813
- Yeah.
- She has been down a few times,

1398
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:45,616
but at the end of the day,
she worked really hard.

1399
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,184
- And I just loved that fight,

1400
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:49,353
that even when it's this close
to the finish line,

1401
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,522
and you have a personality
like Eureka,

1402
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:52,823
and you have somebody
twirling around

1403
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:54,124
like they're at
a "Cats" audition,

1404
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,792
like Aquaria is over here,

1405
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,662
and Asia's doing floor work,
and she's like, no, bitch.

1406
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,198
I'm gonna fight until
the very, very last moment.

1407
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:02,933
And I love that so much.

1408
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:04,468
- She's given us
some fabulous looks

1409
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,536
throughout the competition.

1410
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,237
- From Alaska Miami Realness

1411
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:10,507
to Silver Foxy,
they're all good.

1412
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:11,575
- How great
did she look tonight?

1413
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:12,743
- Oh, the best
she's ever looked.

1414
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:15,279
- That was spectacular.
- Yeah, great.

1415
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:18,248
- I think her song lyrics
did wonders

1416
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,552
in opening those doors
to see where she came from

1417
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:23,720
and who she is
and what she has to say.

1418
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,790
I fell in love with her because
of what she sang tonight.

1419
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,459
- Another person emerges
when she's on stage.

1420
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,562
Confident person.
A sexy person.

1421
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:34,631
And I think that's where her
personality really comes out.

1422
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,934
- And he's fine.
- [laughs]

1423
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:41,171
- Well, as usual, none of you
were helpful at all.

1424
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,740
[all laugh]

1425
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,409
- Silence.

1426
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:49,112
I'll make my own damn decisions.

1427
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:51,081
Bring back my girls.

1428
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,216

your next song.

- Oh, good. How's it doing
on the charts?

1436
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,063
- It's number one already.
[all laugh]

1437
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:08,599
- Welcome back, ladies.

1438
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,868
All season long,
you've each fought fiercely

1439
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,138
to earn your spot
on this stage tonight.

1440
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:18,775
So before I make
my final decision,

1441
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:23,981
I need to see you all lip sync
one more time.

1442
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:27,951
Four fabulous queens

Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1444
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:36,093
and save yourself
from elimination.

1445
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,763
- The time has come...

1446
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,432

and it's slowly progressing
into a profession.

1459
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:13,030
People tell you your dreams
are just that, they're dreams.

1460
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,831
They're not.
They can become reality

1461

has to be willing to devote
their life for the sake of drag.

1469
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,286
I've sacrificed relationships

1470
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,089
and jobs
and opportunities for drag.

1471
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,326
What I'm going to do
is going to supersede

1472
00:57:42,326 --> 00:57:45,429

and I've been through a lot

1477
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,104
I've always known
I was different,

1478
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:57,207
that I was unique
and overly loud.

1479
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,276
And now I'm at
the end of the line

1480
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,778

1481
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,014

Tonight...

1509
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,417

1510
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,488
No one.

1511
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,797
All four of you
are moving forward

1512
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,599

of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

My top four queens,

1514
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:38,341
But the race ain't over yet.

1515
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,310
I want to hear from you,
the fans.

1516
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,113
Who do you think
deserves the crown?

1517
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:45,749
Are you Team Aquaria?

1518
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,784
Team Asia?

1519
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:50,020
Team Eureka?

1520
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,489
Or Team Kameron?

1521
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:54,524
Let your voice be heard.

1522
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:57,828

when all the queens come back

1523

00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,065
And then in two weeks

1525
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:06,036
is the grand finale of
"RuPaul's Drag Race Season 10,"

1526

a winner, baby.

Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1528
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,478
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

1529
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:16,379
Can I get an amen up in here?

1530
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:18,915
