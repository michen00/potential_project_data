1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,135
- Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:07,207
You'll be starring in
Cher, The Unauthorized Rusical.

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,709
The Vixen.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:12,045
- I felt no Cher at all.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,315
- Having a Cher reference that
wasn't instantly recognizable

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:16,783
I was very worried about.

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:20,020
- Well, that look
is instantly recognizable to me.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,723
Asia O'Hara.

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,725
- I wasn't getting
"Moonstruck" era Cher.

10
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:25,726
- Finally!

11
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,561
- Kameron Michaels.

12
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,630
- The Cher was the most
spot on Cher voice.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,864
- ♪ Could ♪

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,065
- Con-drag-ulations,
you're the winner

15
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,433
of this week's challenge.

16
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,868
[cheers and applause]

17
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,105
- Asia O'Hara, shantay you stay.

18
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,441
The Vixen, sashay away.

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,818
- [sighs]

20
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,621
What a day, what a day.

21
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,324
Oh, my God, I already see
is says "evil."

22
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,426
- What it say?
- "Evil triumphs?"

23
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,994
Is that triumphs?
- Trumps.

24
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,696
- That's a "i."
- Oh.

25
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,331
- Right?
- I guess, yeah.

26
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,599
- I can't see shit.

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,136
- "Evil triumphs
when good queens do nothing...

28
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,304
do nothing."

29
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,539
- I feel like that's
like a cryptic message

30
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,541
shaded towards Eureka
definitely.

31
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,777
The Vixen left
this like cryptic message

32
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,345
that no one really gets.

33
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,913
I'm like, girl,
just say what you mean.

34
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,683
I would have more respect
if it said "Eureka is a bitch.

35
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:23,884
I hate you."
Something like that.

36
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:24,918
You know what I mean?

37
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,820
- She obviously
doesn't like me,

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,821
which is what it is.

39
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,256
But the bitch was talented,

40
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,325
and she's going
to turn the world.

41
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:33,026
- I love that bitch.
- She'll figure herself out,

42
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,227
just like we all do.

43
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,762
- Yeah. They probably
had to call the police

44
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,631
to get her up
out of this building, but...

45
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,300
Honestly,
I needed to lip sync.

46
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,602
It's like recharged my battery.

47
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,773
My whole energetic
and spiritual connection to drag

48
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,475
has been reconnected.

49
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,511
And so my strategy
moving forward

50
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,647
is to always remember
what I do well,

51
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:56,450
and always find a way

52
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,919
to wiggle that in.

53
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,787
- Congratulations.

54
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,422
Yes!
- Very well deserved.

55
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,924
- It feels weird
even saying that I won.

56
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,394
I'm quiet because
I'm just mind blown.

57
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,929
So I'm not unhappy.
I'm very happy.

58
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,263
I'm just like
still processing that.

59
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,531
- I remember you said
that like

60
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,967
if you were going
to win a challenge,

61
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,402
you wanted it
to be the Cher challenge.

62
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,470
- I didn't want anyone to know

63
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,704
that I wanted
to win this challenge.

64
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,905
- Oh. Sorry.

65
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,174
- No, no, no. I mean,
like now it's fine.

66
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,876
- Why didn't you want
anybody to know?

67
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,380
- I feel like I am
a pretty good Cher impersonator,

68
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,281
and I just wanted
to concentrate on doing well.

69
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,617
I didn't want there to be
any expectations of me.

70
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,519
I've always been one

71
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,888
to let my actions
speak louder than my words,

72
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,690
and now that I won something,

73
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,760
maybe it puts me on the map
as a threat to the other girls,

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,495
because I don't think
they've seen me as a threat.

75
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,697
- I was confused that Aquaria
was in the bottom three.

76
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,765
I'm not gonna lie.

77
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,333
- I don't think
I was bottom three

78
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,601
out of this group, so...

79
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,837
- I'm like...

80
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,906
I don't even know
how to respond to that.

81
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,608
Honey, you were in the bottom.

82
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,309
- I think
it was just not announced

83
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,011
in any particular order.
- Oh, okay.

84
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,279
- I wasn't worried at all.

85
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,115
I know I did better
than bottom three material.

86
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:06,853
- Aquaria is so disconnected
from reality.

87
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,756
Of the Cher critiques,

88
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,091
you were in
the bottom three, my love.

89
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,993
- It seems like
you wanted to win.

90
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,995
- I mean, allegedly
that's all I'm here to do.

91
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,129
- What do you mean
allegedly, though?

92
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,465
- I think I'm just
getting too confident,

93
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,200
and it's clear that--

94
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,436
- Well, do you feel like
you're getting too confident,

95
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,570
or do you feel like
people think you're getting--

96
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,938
- No, I think
I'm confident just enough.

97
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,073
I want to fucking win.

98
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm not here
just so I can go home

99
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,608
like the rest of everyone has.

100
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,643
I'm absolutely here to win,

101
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,378
and I want all of you
to go home.

102
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,849
- Well, I don't really
want anyone to go home.

103
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,850
- I want enough of you
to go home

104
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,951
so I make the top three.

105
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,220
If you don't say that,
you're crazy.

106
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,556
I'm confident enough to say
that I want to fucking win this.

107
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,091
- I don't think
it's a matter of confidence.

108
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,392
But I think
you might be a little confused,

109
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,027
because it's not
a matter of confidence.

110
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,963
I just think it's a matter
of sportsmanlike conduct.

111
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,432
- Well, I'm sorry if I've
come off unsportsmanlike.

112
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,668
- Aquaria's
been extremely confident

113
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,269
this entire competition.

114
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,737
She does want to win.

115
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,040
She's made that very obvious.

116
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,741
But if she can't share
the spotlight

117
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,411
and she can't let other girls
have their moment

118
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,012
and be happy for them,

119
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,447
it could cause a problem.

120
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,519
- I can't get these off my hand.

121
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,454
I wish I had a friend to help.

122
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,725
- The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

123
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,393
receives a one year supply

124
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,796
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

125
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,433
and a cash price of $100.000.

126
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,535
With extra special guest judges

127
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,670
from "Broad City,"
Ilana Glazer

128
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,838
and Abbi Jacobson.

129
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,140
- ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race ♪

130
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,207
♪ May the best woman ♪

131
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,944
- ♪ Best woman win ♪

132
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,717
- Hook 'em, horns.
Hook 'em, horns.

133
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,119
It is a new day in the workroom,

134
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,354
and everyone
is definitely feeling

135
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:48,855
more competitive at this point.

136
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,558
Now that there's only six of us,
there's no middle ground.

137
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,960
It's either you're in the top
or you're in the bottom,

138
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,663
and anybody in here
could be the next to go home.

139
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,565
- This workroom is so empty now.

140
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,699
Isn't that so crazy?

141
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,134
- There's finally room
for all of us.

142
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,236
- [laughs]
- Well, for your ego.

143
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,071
[all laugh]

144
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,706
_ I still have
a couple personalities

145
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,241
that I haven't quite shown,

146
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,276
so I can't wait
for you to meet them.

147
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,744
- They're all boring.

148
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,445
[all laugh]
- Aah!

149
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,614
One of them should have some
good jokes, though, I think.

150
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,615
- That's the one
that comes around

151
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,616
when nobody else is looking,

152
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,984
when it's just you
and one person.

153
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,320
- Aquaria's like that frog
on the WB

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,988
that will only perform
when no one's watching.

155
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,192
- Michigan J--
Is it Michigan J. Frog?

156
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,027
- And the fool isn't even trying
to show it to people.

157
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,529
He be like, ribbit.
[all laugh]

158
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,797
- I'm a what?

159
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,966
- Nothing, girl. That's
way before your time, girl.

160
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,435
Long before your time, bitch.

161
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,637
[alarm]

162
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,273
- Uh-uh. She done already
done had herses.

163
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,008
- Wait. What?
- Who is that?

164
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,044
- Girl, that wasn't
Jan Michaels.

165
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,713
- My sickening queens.

166
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,847
[cheering]

167
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,050
'Tis I Stephen Colbert,

168
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,818
here to give you the T.
- Yes.

169
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,021
- Because, girl,
my T is silent. Mm-hmm.

170
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,691
Now I have
but one thing to say.

171
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,061
You better work.

172
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,697
Okay? [clicks tongue]

173
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,867
And that, ladies,
is what you call acting.

174
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,370
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

175
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,205
Someone untuck me, please.

176
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,975
- Girl.
- Oh, my God.

177
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,077
- Hello, hello, hello.

178
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,746
[cheers and applause]

179
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,147
Ladies.

180
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,483
- Hello.
- Y'all hungry?

181
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,684
- Yes.
- Yeah.

182
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,187
- I mean hungry
for some fresh man meat.

183
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,755
- Yes.

184
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,789
- Ravenous.

185
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,124
[all laugh]

186
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,893
Because your country breakfast
is ready.

[all laugh]

188
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,197
- Oh, Pit Crew.

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,035
- Okay.
- Aah!

190
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,937
- [laughs]
- Ooh.

191
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,473
- Oh, my God, they keep coming.

192
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,676
- The boys are gorgeous.

193
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,078
There's something
for every taste in the world,

194
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,079
and you know I love a buffet.

195
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,215
My mouth is watering.

196
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,850
- Howdy, fellas.

197
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,852
- Hi.
- Hi, Ru.

198
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,421
- Now, ladies,
for today's mini challenge,

199
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,191
we're playing a game
of pants down, bottoms up.

200
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,127
- Whoo! My favorite.

201
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,363
- First, you tell
one of these studs to drop trou,

202
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:14,701
and he'll flash
his Rounderbum underwear.

203
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:15,969
- Oh...

204
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,238
- Then you need to find
the matching pair.

205
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,608
In the end, the queen
that makes the most matches

206
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,577
with the fewest tries wins.

207
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,213
- It's a win/win situation.
- Yeah.

208
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,583
Let's play.
First up, Asia.

209
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,985
Welcome to the Ass-trodome.

210
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,953
- Googly-moogly.
- Yes.

211
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,588
Dive right in.

212
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,625
- I'm going to go with
my good friend number two.

213
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:43,263
- Ooh. Geometric designs.

214
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,065
Okay. Now--

215
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,034
- Sorry.
What are we doing again?

216
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,235
- [laughs]

217
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,570
- Number 16.

218
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,572
- Crack is whack.

219
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,374
[buzzer]
Not a match.

220
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,375
- 14.

221
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,177
- Turn around, drop trou.

222
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,412
Ooh, damn.
- Number one.

223
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,583
[ding, ding]
- Yes!

224
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,152
- It is like Christmas,
a Bar Mitzvah

225
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,188
your Quinceanera, sweet 16,
your birthday

226
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,656
all rolled up into one.

227
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,524
- 18.

228
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,394
- Ooh, damn.

229
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:18,665
I wish Prince was alive
to see this purple rain.

230
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,333
[buzzer]
- Ooh, not a match,

231
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,469
but a great choice.

232
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,971
- Seven.
- ♪ Yoo-hoo ♪

233
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,573
Bam!
- Number four.

234
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,541
[buzzer]
- Not a match.

235
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,810
You didn't miss no meals,
did you?

236
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,379
[all laugh]

237
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,047
- 17.

238
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:37,384
10.

239
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,020
[ding, ding]
- Yes, we have a match.

240
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,790
- I'm going to go
with number 17, please.

241
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,526
- Ba-donk-a-damn!

242
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,627
- Number four.

00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,729
[buzzer]
- Whoo. Not a match.

244
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,730
- Number 14.

245
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,433
- Ooh, 57 shades of grey.

246
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,069
- [laughs] Number five.

247
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,637
- Big money, big money.

248
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,305
[buzzer]
What a bummer.

249
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,808
Are you purposefully trying

250
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,076
to not make a match

251
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,145
so you can stretch this out?

252
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:08,548
- If I could see
number 16 and number eight.

253
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,816
- Wait. Just one at a time.
- I'm sorry.

254
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,951
- You're a bossy bottom,
aren't you?

255
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,253
[all laugh]

256
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,354
- Number 16, please.

257
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,123
- Ooh, you want some fries
with that shake?

258
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,025
- Number right, please.
[ding, ding]

259
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,594
- Oh, my goodness,
you got a match.

260
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,264
- Number three.
- Beautiful.

261
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,865
- What's better than 10 but 20?

262
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,268
- Turn around, drop trou.

263
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,937
[ding, ding]
Ooh-hoo! Yes!

264
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,540
All right,
now what's your pleasure?

265
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,209
- 19.
- Ooh.

266
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,346
I love how that model
wiggled out of those pants.

267
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,849
- Oh, he wigged and I jiggled
all the way on the inside.

268
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,819
- [laughs]
- Let me try seven.

- Oh, shucks.

00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,857

00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,426
- Ooh.
- Ooh, yay.

272
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,628
And then number five, please.

00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,766
[buzzer]
- Not a match.

274
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,101
Your short-term memory
is terrible.

275
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,271
- There's nothing but ass
in here right now.

[all laugh]

277
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,309
- Now, gentlemen,
standing in one place

278
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,478
can be bad for your health,

279
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,680
so for safety reasons only,

280
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,449
I'm insisting
that we take a moment

281
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,787
to shake
those Rounderbum asses.

282
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,821
Hit it.

286
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,498
This needs to be its own show.

[all laugh]

288
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,836
Ladies, you all did great,

289
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,039
but one of you has
a pornographic memory--

290
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,675
I mean, photographic memory.

291
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,812
Aquaria.

292
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,449
- Oh, yay! I think
I found my husband.

293
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,450
- [laughs]

294
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,318
Con-drag-ulations.
- Thank you.

295
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,555
- All right, ladies,
this week you need to use

296
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,758
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve and talent

297
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,894
to chew up the scenery

298
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:04,964
as we transport you
to a magical world

299
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,967
run by drag queen robots.

300
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,906
You'll be starring
in the new, edgy,

Here's the script
and character descriptions.

305
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:29,222
Aquaria, you won
the mini challenge,

306
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,724
so you get to assign the roles.

307
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,427
- Ooh, yay. When I hear
that there's a script

308
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,330
and some direction,
I'm so delighted.

309
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,699
I have to fight tooth and nail.

310
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,367
I have to bring home a win
right now.

311
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,270

312
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,140

- Should we maybe like
read 'em all out loud?

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,080
- Let's just read
what these little bits are

316
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,882
and see what we're feeling
just from that.

317
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,784
I think it seems to work well

318
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:02,155
when we all kind of find
what we're all comfortable with.

319
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,824
- I don't understand
what's even going on.

320
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,759
'Cause up until now,
Aquaria has been this

I wanna win, I wanna this,"

323
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,268

to let us choose our part.

- I feel Julie for me because--

00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,038
- Julie sounds like you,
kind of--

326
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,307
- Zinger landing
is something that I do.

327
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,443
- I can do
one of the conservative

328
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,644
or like right-wing ones,
so I don't mind--

329
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,179
- You wanna do Parah Salin?

330
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,213
- I'll do Parah Salin.

331
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,681
- Could I do Rosie,
the Bingo Bot?

332
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,984
- Sure. Ms. Monet,
what you feeling?

333
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,619
- I like Viv. I'm feeling Viv.

334
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,120
- And, Kameron,
what you feeling?

335
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,254
- I mean,
if she wants to do Viv,

336
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,757
I guess Muffy
is the other one, right?

337
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:42,228
- Okay. I guess I'll be Dyslexa
by process of elimination.

338
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,430
- Yeah. Cute.

339
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,165
Is everyone happy?

340
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,700
I'm beginning to be more aware

341
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,837
of how I may be coming across
to some of these girls,

342
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,106
and I figured the most
sportsmanlike thing to do

343
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,408
would be to see
what the girls thought

344
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,776
would be a good part for them

345
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,879
and just kind of feel out
what the group is interested in.

346
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,616

than I have bitten off
right now.

00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,125
- I'm already at page seven,
and I haven't found my part.

00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,094
It's not smart to pick a role
based on a description.

352
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,063
Do you think that
they call Nicole Kidman

353
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,431
and say, "We want you
to play this role,

354
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,967
"and it's a suburban housewife
set in the 1960s

355
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,135
and she drives a yellow car?"

356
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,703
- "Oh, my God,
I'd love to play that!"

357
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,471
No. They're gonna say,
"Send me the script.

358
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,173
"I'm gonna read through it.
See how much it is.

359
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,675
I'll let you know
in six months."

360
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,909
- Well, girl, watch.

361
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,079
I probably just done
fuck-ified myself over.

362
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,315
I fucked up!

363
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,150
I done gave myself

364
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,886
the worst part in
the entire script hands down.

365
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,422
All these things
I'm highlighting better be funny

366
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,591
because they're
few and far between.

367
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,128
And I don't...
I didn't realize that.

368
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,730
I'm the Joan of Arc
of this challenge.

369
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,132
I'm the martyr to "Breastworld."

370
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
- You can't leave

371
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,506
before you go play Drag Bingo
at Hamburger Mary's.

372
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,108
- For today's maxi challenge,

373
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:06,612
we are acting in the brand new
cable TV show "Breastworld."

374
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,248
How heavy is this?
Feel how heavy that is.

375
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,451
What is inside that,
a brick?

376
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,419
We start each week ranked.

377
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,988
The person that won last week
is number one,

378
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,826
the person that didn't go home
is the bottom rank.

379
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,762
And going into this challenge,
I'm the bottom rank.

380
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,898
So I feel like there is
legitimate pressure on me

381
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,201
to win this week.

382
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,571
- Hey, kitty girls!

383
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,774
- Hi!
- How are my drag bots doing?

384
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,709
- Great!
- Good!

385
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,678
- Well, hello, Aquaria.

386
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,779
- Hello, RuPaul.

387
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,147
- You won the mini challenge.
- Yes.

388
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,715
- So you got to assign
the roles.

389
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,951
- Yes.
- Were you strategic with it?

390
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,419
- Not necessarily.

391
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,121
- Not necessarily?
Is that smart?

392
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:52,225
- I strategically wanted
everyone to choose a part

393
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,428
that I think
that they would all excel in.

394
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,765
- Do you want them to like you
or do you want to win?

395
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,900
- I want to win.

396
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,735
- Did you choose
the best role for yourself?

397
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,970
- No, not necessarily.

398
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,807
It seems that I have
the least amount of words.

399
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,309
- Listen, we're down
to six girls.

400
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,112
How you gonna make sure
you make it to the finish line?

401
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,182
- Well, if I...

402
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:20,520
I'm definitely going
to make each line count.

403
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,854
- [chuckles]
- Because there's not too many,

404
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,556
so I'm gonna try
to be memorable in them.

405
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,657
- So that's the thing

406
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,859
is that you've got
to be able to stand out,

407
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,096
so this robotic role,
make it an Aquaria role.

408
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,099
That flair of what Aquaria is,

409
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,803
bring that to everything you do.

410
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,404
- I'm gonna try to my best.

411
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,639
- All right. You're funny.

412
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,840
- Absolutely.
- Just be funny.

413
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,142
- Thank you.
- All right.

414
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,444
Monet X Change.

415
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,746
- Hello, Ru.

416
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,781
- Monet, Monet, Monet.
- [laughs]

417
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,949
That your lace front?

418
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,083
- This is actually
the very first--

419
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,351
like before I even started drag

420
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,753
and I went to this store
in SoHo

421
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,188
and I found this wig

422
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,156
and I've never
parted ways with it.

423
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,291
- But have you worn it
in this competition yet?

424
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,458
- No, no, no. Never here.

425
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,027
- That is a mistake.

426
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,329
I know you love
them pussycat wigs,

427
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,298
but, bitch, you know what?

428
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,866
You need to wear
some big ass hair

429
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,935
because you got
that big fat juicy ass.

430
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,069
- Yeah.

431
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,337
- Six girls are left
in this competition.

432
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,772
Down to the wire.
- Yes.

433
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,208
- How you gonna make it
to the finish line?

434
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,510
- Well, I'm gonna slay
this acting challenge today.

435
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,778
I feel like I've been
on a steady upward climb

436
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:19,879
in the past couple of weeks.

437
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,947
- You haven't won
any challenges, though.

438
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,615
- I know.
- What's wrong with that?

439
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,183
- You know, I think it's just--

440
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,785
I mean, I'm doing well
in the maxi challenges,

441
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,954
but it's following through
on the runway

442
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,089
and really giving y'all
something to the gag over.

443
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,324
- You know, they say
you have lots of breaks

444
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,592
that happen in your life.

445
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,993
You just have to be prepared
for them.

446
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,094
- Yes.

447
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,297
- This is yours to go and get.

448
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,867
- Amen, Ru.
- Make sure you get this.

449
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,803
- Yes, I will. I swear I am.
I will, Ru.

450
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,471
- I'll see you out there.
- Thank you, thank you.

451
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,107
- Hey, Eureka.

452
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,075
- Hi, Miss Lady.

453
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,109
- What character
are you playing?

454
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,079
- I'm playing Rosie,
the Bingo Bot.

455
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,313
- Tell me about Rosie.

456
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,216
- The description was that
she was brassy and loud,

457
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,918
so, of course,
instantly I was like,

458
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,087
well, that sounds like
you're describing Eureka.

459
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,388
- Yes.
- So I want that part.

460
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,024
- It's important that
you really break through.

461
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,894
I don't care if you have
six lines or just six words.

462
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,429
You've gotta stand out.
Somebody's going home.

463
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,964
- Yeah. It can't be me.
- Exactly.

464
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,766
- So that's the thing.

465
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,301
- Know what your energy is.

466
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,170
Know how it
can fit into that script

467
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,872
and just make it pop.

468
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,308
I'll see you out there.
- Thank you so much, really.

469
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,409
- Thanks.

470
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,678
Hey, Kameron.
- Hello.

471
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:26,779
- You won last week.

472
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,147
- I did win last week.

473
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,649
- How do you think you won?

474
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,051
- I think I won because
I really committed to Cher,

475
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,053
her mannerisms, her voice.

476
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,455
- Well, it's interesting because
throughout this competition,

477
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,091
you're not the most
gregarious personality.

478
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,526
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,295
- Is there any place
in your personal life

480
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,463
where you're gregarious?

481
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,132
- I would say stage for me.

482
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,134
I'm usually very chill
and down to earth.

483
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,368
And when I get to step onstage,

484
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,636
I get to transform
into somebody else.

485
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,271
- You've been a slow grower.

486
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,073
You've stayed under the radar

487
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,876
the first half
of this competition.

488
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,477
This is the point where

489
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,848
if you were ever going to
break out and be the wild child,

490
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,684
this would be the time to do it.

491
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,685
- It would, yeah.

492
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,621
- I don't know how long

493
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,625
the judges
are going to feel inspired

494
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,528
by Kameron being so quiet.

495
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,898
She's such a fierce queen
aesthetically,

496
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:23,069
but there's just not a lot
of energy pouring out of her.

497
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,804
- All right, kiddo.
I'll see you out there.

498
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,639
- Okay.

499
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,674
- Hey, Asia.
- Hey, Ru.

500
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,742
- What character
are you playing?

501
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,477
- I am Parah Salin.

502
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,478
- Tell me about her.

503
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,846
- Parah Salin,
she's bombastic.

504
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,915
She's right wing, conservative.

505
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,149
- What are the similarities

506
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,385
with this character
and your own personality?

507
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:44,457
- I come from a very
conservative household,

508
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:48,728
and so a lot of this character
is my aunt.

509
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,998
It's not necessarily
personality traits that I have.

510
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,366
- Are you sure?

511
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:54,500
- I am a lot of times

512
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,670
the conservative voice of reason
in the room.

513
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,307
- All right. When we talked
before about your Snatch Game,

514
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,576
and you told me
you were gonna do Beyoncé,

515
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,846
and I mentioned to you
that perhaps you could do

516
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,782
one of the other girls who
used to be in Destiny's Child.

517
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,085
You know, you have to
make the character work

518
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,721
for what you already have
in your wheelhouse.

519
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,189
Because you were
in the bottom last week.

520
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,058
- Yes, ma'am.
- You came real close.

521
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,526
- Too close for comfort.

522
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,528
- To walking home with one of
them Tweeter heads back there.

523
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,996
- Yes, ma'am.

524
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,264
- You don't wanna walk away
with one of them Tweet heads.

525
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:26,265
- No, ma'am, no, ma'am.

526
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,633
- You're a champion, girl.

527
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:32,071
Remember who the hell you are.

528
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,707
Remember who you are.

529
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,176
- I'm 35 years old,

530
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,546
and I have never in my life
felt the way I felt

531
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,916
based off words that
came out of her mouth.

532
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,317
- Think of that.
- Yes.

533
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,919
- Put on a good show out there.

534
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,920
- Yes, ma'am.

535
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,255
- All right,
I'll see you out there.

536
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,823
- Thank you so much.

537
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,661
- Well, hello, Miz Cracker.

538
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,762
- Hello, Ru.

539
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,130
- What character
are you playing?

540
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,533
- Today I'm Julie,
and I'm the hostess

541
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,535
that sort of runs
this whole operation.

542
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:06,439
- Okay. Why do you think you
haven't won any main challenges?

543
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,908
- I think when I'm on the stage
talking to the judges,

544
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,943
I have the jokes
and the buh-buh-buh,

545
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,712
and it's all great.

546
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,782
But during the challenges,
I'm either blocking

547
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,584
or, you know, not allowing

548
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,987
that Cracker trademark
greatness to come through.

549
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,355
- Yeah, because
what I've noticed

550
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,858
is that it feels like
you've prepared in your head,

551
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,326
but it's not in sync

552
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,663
with what's actually happening
in the room at the time.

553
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:35,000
You have a sort of
kind of a canned comeback.

554
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,937
It feels like you're having
a conversation in your own head.

555
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,606
- Yeah.
- And you use your cleverness

556
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,077
as a way to keep people
from coming from any closer.

557
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,113
- In the past,
I would have been like,

558
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,415
oh, my God, that's
the biggest compliment.

559
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,585
So learning to reverse
that kind of thinking,

560
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,121
that is gonna be
a huge challenge.

561
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,755
- That's the challenge.
- Yeah.

562
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,525
- Sometimes it's
the most clever thing to do

563
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,160
is to just be human.

564
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,730
Vulnerability is power.

565
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,466
All right,
I'll see you out there.

566
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,301
- Thank you, Ru.

567
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,270
Okay.

568
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,205
- All right, ladies,
in a moment,

569
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,542
you'll be meeting with
Ross Mathews and Michelle Visage

570
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,779
who'll be directing you
in "Breastworld."

571
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:24,216
So good luck
and don't fuck it up!

572
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,218
- Thank you.
[applause]

573
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,755
- Oh, my goodness.

574
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,856
- Hey, ladies.

575
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,992
- For today's maxi challenge,

576
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:38,197
we're gonna be acting in the hot
new TV drama "Breastworld."

577
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,065
- Welcome to the set
of "Breastworld,"

578
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,202
with furnishing by Object.

579
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,005
- There is a pool,
a huge bar set.

580
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,008
Bitch, they are not playing
with this acting challenge,

581
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,976
so we better get our mother-
fucking shit together.

582
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,145
- Now, Michelle and I
are here

583
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,681
to help make your performances
the best they can be.

584
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,517
- But the final decisions
are yours to make.

585
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,618
- Okay.

586
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,986
- Let's take a trip
to "Breastworld!"

587
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,855
[cheers and applause]

588
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,123
- Places, ladies.

589
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,425
- Take one, and action!

590
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,594
- Surprise!

591
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:14,166
- Hello. I'm Julie,
your cruising director.

592
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,768
- Okay, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

593
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:18,571
I might be walking
into a wasp's nest here,

594
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,439
but are you familiar
with "The Loveboat?"

595
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,174
- I'm not familiar
with "The Loveboat."

596
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,876
- Of course, you're not,
because you're a fetus.

597
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,579
This cruise director is
the person who leads everything.

598
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,247
- Yeah.
- They are the fun buncher.

599
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:29,815
You need to bring
a lightness to it.

600
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,417
- Right.
- Okay, here we go.

601
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,285
And...
- Action.

602
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,486
- [gasps]

603
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,958
- You haven't met
our drag Bingo Bot, Rosie.

604
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,492
- Oh, she's big!

605
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,928
- B-12.

606
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,363
- Bingo!

607
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,469
- You win.
- He's dead!

608
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,072
- Cut. Hold on.
You jumped her line.

609
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:56,342
Let her get it done first,
then you come in.

610
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,877
Also, make it
like you're shooting him.

611
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,945
- Boom!

612
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,347
- Get into it.

613
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,082
- And action!

614
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,117
- Bingo!

615
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:11,590
- I already shot you, baby.

616
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,225
- [gasps]

617
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,728
- You--
- Heavens to Betsy, he's dead!

618
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,030
- Cut!

619
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,567
He didn't even know
you shot him.

620
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:22,901
- Bigger!
- Okay.

621
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,304
I mean, I'll get--
- That's it.

622
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,406
- Yes! That's great!

623
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,076
- Rosie, toot and reboot.

624
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,312
- Attitude adjustment
in process.

625
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:37,116
Dialing down to Ivy Winters.

626
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,183
- Can we just cut here?

627
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,619
Okay.

628
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,256
You know how to say
Ivy Winters, don't you?

629
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,624
- Ivy Winterrrrs.

630
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:47,393
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs.

631
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,161
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs, okay.

632
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,162
- Say it that way.

633
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,397
- A little more dramatic
with that.

634
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:52,965
- Well, how
it's supposed to be said.

635
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:57,036
- Dialing down
to Ivyyyy Winterrrrs!

636
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,070
- Okay, cut.

637
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,606
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs!

638
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,409
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs!

639
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,543
- Everybody!
- Everybody!

640
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:08,881
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs!
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs.

641
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:13,852
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs.

642
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,791
- Ivyyyy Winterrrrs...

643
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,259
Then you power down.
You know what I mean?

644
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:24,196
But I'm an actress,
and I know how to do my do.

645
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,165
But Eureka is not
getting this together.

646
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,201
- How's your head?

647
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,838
- Oh, perrr...

648
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:36,108
- And cut. Dyslexa?
- Yes, ma'am?

649
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,110
- Can you do the...
[trills tongue]

650
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,813
- I was making it like
the robot like r-r-r-r.

651
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:41,814
- Which you can do.

652
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,815
Let's try one take
the other way.

653
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:43,816
- Okay.

654
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,250
- Head? How's your head?

655
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,520
- Oh, brrrrrr.

656
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,690
- Dyslexa, I thought
it was much better.

657
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,691
- I thought
it was really funny, yeah.

658
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,227
- Thank you.

659
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,962
- I can't take it anymore!

660
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,131
[cries]

661
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:02,735
- Muffy? Just make sure
I can understand all the words.

662
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:05,337
- Okay.
- 'Cause the oh, oh was funny,

663
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,338
but I need to know
what you're saying.

664
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,907
- Okay.
Viv, I wanna go home!

665
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,110
[cries]

666
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,611
- Okay.

667
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,514
- I understand, sweetie,
but don't worry.

668
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,950
If you wait, it will grow out,

669
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,752
and then maybe you could
throw a hat on top of it.

670
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:20,919
- Cut, cut.
- Cut.

671
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,223
- I want you, Cracker,
to tell me the hair line

672
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,191
to make sure you have it.

673
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,960
- Okay. It's...

674
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,628
- This is terrible.
I can't take it anymore.

675
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,331
- Oh, sweetie, don't worry.
It'll grow out.

676
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,867
And maybe you could
throw a hat on it.

677
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,235
- Oh, honey, it'll grow out.

678
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,503
- Okay.
- It's funnier

679
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,804
if you're being sweet
when you throw the shade.

680
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,005
- Okay.
- Okay?

681
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,641
- Sweetie, I know,
but don't worry.

682
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,311
It'll grow out
or you could throw a hat on it.

683
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,014
- Cut. I still had a problem
with that line.

684
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,249
- The hat?

685
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,517
- What are you
not understanding?

686
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:52,718
- No, I think I do understand.

687
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,753
I'm just in the moment
not delivering it right.

688
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,388
- You know what you're doing.
- Yeah.

689
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,390
- You live in New York.
You know how to be patronizing.

690
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,925
- Cracker,
you did it perfect once.

691
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,959
You will do it that way again.

692
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,462
I don't know how many times

693
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:06,198
Miz Cracker is going to need
to repeat these lines.

694
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,766
- I will sell this house today.

695
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,535
- And yell at herself about it,

696
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:12,004
but let's hurry
the shit up.

697
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:15,340
- I wanna go home!
[cries]

698
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,311
- Well, you can't leave
before the big show!

699
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,213
- Okay!

700
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:23,315
- Dyslexa! Oh, my.

701
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,185
- Did something happen?

702
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:27,186
- What?
- What happened?

703
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,555
- My mistake. I apologize.

704
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,523
I thought that
I was starting too early.

705
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:35,060
- I'm a little worried
for my girl.

706
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,497
I don't wanna see her lip sync
for her life ever.

707
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,767
- Cock-a-doodle do me, daddy.

708
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,636
- Cock-a-doodle don't!

709
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,138
[laughs]

710
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,573
- Parah Salin!

711
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,308
- You betcha!

712
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,411
- Cut. Parah, that was good.
You're doing a great job.

713
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,513
- You have great energy
coming in.

714
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,982
It feels different the second
you walk in the scene,

715
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,550
and it should,
so keep that up.

716
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,551
- Thank you.

717
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,253
- [imitating Cher] Action!

718
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,955
- That makes no sense at all.

719
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,457
The party's over,
and you can't stop me!

720
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,792
- Says who!

721
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,164
- She's dead!

722
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,334
- Oh, Lord,
she getting back up. Uh-uh.

723
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:16,335
[both laugh]

724
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,737
- Monet is adding great adlibs

725
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,305
and interjections in there,

726
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,341
so she is
my biggest competition.

727
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:26,645
- I've never seen a place
where people, they just...

728
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,547
[groans]
- Embraces all kind of people.

729
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,650
- My whole life, I've...

730
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,986
My whole life, I've...

731
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,221
- Been wrong about gay people.
- What is it?

732
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,957
- I've been wrong about
gay people and drag queens.

733
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,058
- My whole life,
I've been wrong

734
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,827
about gay people
and drag queens!

735
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,028
- Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

736
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,330
Muffy,
this is a change of heart.

737
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,599
This is where you're realizing,
oh, my goodness,

738
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,101
you're just like me.
- Okay.

739
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,469
- And let us
see you realize that.

740
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,704
'Cause you've been out of touch
the whole time.

741
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,540
- Unless this set falls over,
this is our last take,

742
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,674
so let's get it right.

743
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,142
I don't wanna do this anymore.

744
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,877
- My whole life,

745
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,381
I've been wrong about gay people
and drag queens.

746
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,953
- All right, cut, cut, cut, cut.

747
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:09,254
Just cut.

748
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,890
- This acting challenge
was my chance at redemption

749
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,859
since Katherine from Fibstr
fucked it all up,

750
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:17,930
and my performance
was absolutely dreadful.

751
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,498
- Fingers crossed
we got everything.

752
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,639
- Slay the world!

753
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,142
- It's time to get ready
to hit the runway.

754
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,410
And it's the top six.

755
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,345
Nobody is just here because
of the luck of the draw

756
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,446
or because of chance.

757
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,883
That's what makes now
even scarier.

758
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,585
Who's excited to be an old lady?

759
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:41,753
- I'm ready to get old.

760
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,022
Today's runway theme
is Silver Foxy,

761
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,391
and I am very excited
about this look.

762
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,429
It is about what we are going
to look like in 50-plus years.

763
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,632
I'm hoping that my runway look's
going to give me that edge

764
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,401
and will help me
finally win a challenge.

765
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,136
- What type of Silver Foxy
are you doing?

766
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,305
- I'm going very
like "Downton Abbey."

767
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,141
Like upscale
goes to the opera old lady.

768
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,376
I was like, you know what?

769
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,544
Everyone else is probably
gonna do like campy,

770
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:08,380
and they might even
expect me to be campy.

771
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,351
So I just decided to go like
classic, legit Silver Foxy.

772
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,019
Plus, in case
I have to lip sync,

773
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,454
it'll be comfortable to wear.

774
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,723
This challenge should
have been so easy for me,

775
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,125
especially this tiny ass role.

776
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,995
The pressure is on
today more than ever.

777
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,133
Is anyone else terrified
of getting old? 'Cause I am.

778
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,069
I'm not necessarily like
afraid to be an older person.

779
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,640
I just fear like
my body's slowly messing up.

780
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,807
You know what I mean?

781
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,643
Like I can tell
such a difference

782
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,646
just from like 18 to 27.

783
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,515
- Also, drag just ages you
faster than a normal person.

784
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,150
We put our body's through it.

785
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,652
- Well, maybe in a sense,

786
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:50,355
but I feel like drag
keeps a lot of people young.

787
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:51,490
Like drag's one of the few jobs

788
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,958
where there's always
something new.

789
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,459
There's always
some new music to learn

790
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,794
or a new fashion trend.
- Right.

791
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,598
- I love learning things
from older queens,

792
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,400
because there really is
so much to learn.

793
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,970
I don't like really relate
to people my age that much

794
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,539
as much as I can
hold a conversation

795
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,741
with people
that are much older me.

796
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,977
- You work with Amanda Lepore
and other like legends,

797
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,647
- Yeah, I mean, Amanda has
so much energy and life in her.

798
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,315
She goes to yoga every day.

799
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,952
She is like one of the kindest
people you will ever meet.

800
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,487
Y'all can think I'm nice
or mean or whatever,

801
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:27,559
but 100% of like the way
I try to treat people

802
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,697
is inspired by how amazing
she treats everyone.

803
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,598
Being friends with people
like Amanda Lepore

804
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,835
has really helped shape
who I am creatively,

805
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,737
and also just opened my mind

806
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:41,640
to a whole 'nother part
of the world

807
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,508
that I was never even alive for.

808
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,977
It's so important
to respect our elders

809
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,646
and to honor them,

810
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,381
because they are the people

811
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,850
who paved the way for us
to get to where we are today.

812
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,519
- Monet, you were in Portland
for a while, right?

813
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,821
- I sure was.

814
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:58,490
- You remember that drag queen
that was like 96?

815
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,991
- Darcelle?
- Yes, ma'am.

816
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,827
- Yes. She is the oldest
drag queen I know.

817
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:03,662
- I think she's the oldest
drag queen in America.

818
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,896
- Right?
- Besides Shequida.

819
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,698
- It was so cool
to go watch the show,

820
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,667
'cause she was like
up there in her heels.

821
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,936
- Telling the jokes
that are exactly her age.

822
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,205
- [laughs]

823
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,141
- I just flew in from Portland,
and, boy, are my arms tired.

824
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:17,676
- [laughs]

825
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,978
You know, I see myself
doing drag forever, girl.

826
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm gonna be Miss Darcelle
one day.

827
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,982
Just me, but I ain't
wearing no heels, though.

828
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:24,983
I'll be in some good times

829
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,985
and a little kitten wave
for RuPaul.

830
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,487
- Is anyone else dating?

831
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,055
- Cracker, you have a guy,
don't you?

832
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,256
- I have a beautiful man.

833
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,624
- Aquaria's not.

834
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,792
- No, I don't.

835
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,994
- Kameron?
- Nope.

836
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,529
- You didn't ask me.

837
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,866
- Monet, sometimes
it's easier just to not.

838
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,534
- [laughs]

839
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,669
- But dating with drag,
as you all know,

840
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,371
is extremely hard.
- Is hard as fuck.

841
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:51,042
- I normally am very anti
meeting boys around drag

842
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,078
because they're falling in love

843
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,346
with a character
that you're playing

844
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,015
and not the real you.
- Exactly.

845
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,786
- I think Aquaria
is more real than Giovanni is.

846
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:03,221
- You feel more present
and comfortable as Aquaria?

847
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,256
- Yeah.

848
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,757
- I would say
the same thing, too.

849
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,860
- I will say like
having guy troubles

850
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,863
was a defining moment for me
in drag,

851
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:13,398
'cause that's
one of the first times

852
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,966
I really understood sisterhood.

853
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,537
'Cause, girl, when I very first
became a full-time cast member

854
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:21,072
where I worked,
I was dating this boy.

855
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,474
I won't even call him a guy.
This boy--

856
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:23,809
- Child, yeah.

857
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:28,079
- Yes, and he broke up with me
like via text message.

858
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,848
And I'm gonna add
another layer to it.

859
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,683
And he was also a drag queen.

860
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,851
- Ha!

861
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,220
- And he came to the club
that night.

862
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,788
And I'm telling you,
the girls in the show--

863
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,023
and I'm not exaggerating--

864
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,892
chased him out of the club
with a baseball bat.

865
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:41,893
- Yes, ma'am!
- They was like, no,

866
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,395
you're not gonna
just come up in here

867
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,630
and sit in the front row
at this bitch job.

868
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,399
No, get on up outta here.

869
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,567
Everything happens for a reason,

870
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,202
but at that point,
I was like, bitch,

871
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,636
these motherfucking
men and wigs in here

872
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,704
really do care about me.

873
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,872
- Girl, they do.
- Right.

874
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,741
- A lot of people come thinking

875
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,610
this is not
RuPaul's Best Friends Race.

876
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,981
And after doing this for
so long, you can't avoid that.

877
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,151
And that makes the reality
that somebody is going home

878
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,521
more and more difficult
to handle right now.

879
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,656
- It'd be nice
to find a husband finally.

880
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,959
Looking like this.

881
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,961
I'm single, I'm 31.

882
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,430

Michelle Visage, which

889
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,631
- Obviously, these two.

Now, Ross Mathews, did you enjoy
directing with Michelle Visage?

894

- Oh, so fun. We're like the
Coen Brothers, except sisters.

- Ru, I feel like
I've officially died.

00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,871

your clitoris isn't prolapsed.

- Nope.

I'm going to probably
still be doing drag,

00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,902
so I'm still trying
to live my showgirl fantasy.

[all laugh]

934
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,374
I've got my hair kind of
cornrowed over to the side,

935
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,908
'cause I'm gonna need
something easy.

936
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,410
My ankles are swollen
and hurting,

937
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,012
so I gotta put on house shoes.

938
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,179
And I got my potato chips,

939
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,981
'cause I been trying
to not eat potato chips

940
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,250
for the past 50 years,
and now I'm like fuck it.

- She's all that
and a bag of chips.

943
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,187
- Can't have just one lay.

[all laugh]
- Yeah.

945
00:35:57,722 --> 00:35:59,557

- Oh!
- Whoo!

949
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,766
- I feel like when I age,
I'm gonna be a mess.

950
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:09,467
I do not take care of myself.

951
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,036
I don't have health insurance.

952
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,204
But I'm still gonna
keep it up with drag.

953
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,006
So instead of having
the IV drip,

954
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,808
I have little bags of liquor
on there.

955
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,843
I'm playing hacky-sack
with my titties,

956
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,311
and I'm having a good old time
with this look.

957
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,915

[all laugh]

961
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,623
- Can I buy Birkenstock
in those shoes?

962
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,291
[all laugh]

963
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,960
- I'm inspired by fierce,
older ladies from New York City

964
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,797
that show you can stay
fashionable, hot and fun

965
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,265
at any age.

966
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,333
I've got head to toe tattoos.

967
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,635
My ear lobes are sagging

968
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:47,072
from years and years of
wearing lots of heavy jewelry.

969
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,607
I'm still a punk bitch
even at 71.

970
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,042
- Which way to Burning Man?

971
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,712
Oh, here she comes.
[all laugh]

972
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:58,516
- Eureka! Does anyone
have eyes on Renee Taylor?

973
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,785
- She belongs to AARPadding.

[all laugh]

975
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:05,924
- Usually, Eureka would be
this campy, crazy lady.

976
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,325
But this time,
I'm trying to give you

977
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,527
something polished and refined.

978
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,929
I've got my coat flowing.

979
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,497
It's in the wind, honey.

980
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,666
I am "Gone With The Wind"

She's that bitch.

982
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,836
- Grandmother,
may I sleep with danger?

983
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:19,904
[all laugh]

984
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,541
- Kameron Michaels!

985
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,009
- Game time at the Center?

986
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,811
- Let's go to Vegas
and play with your slots.

987
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,480
- Yes.
[all laugh]

988
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,081
- I am Gladys,
the hoarder granny.

989
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,084
When she gets her pills, she
gets a little boost of energy.

990
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,252
And then she just
wants to hop around

991
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,387
and have
a dancing good old time.

992
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,924
This is a chance to show
that I can be funny onstage

993
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,228
no matter how bad
I am at acting.

994
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,362
- I'll have what she's having.

995
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:45,997
[all laugh]
- Yes, honey.

996
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,600
Throw your hands in the air

[all laugh]

998
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,569
- Welcome, ladies.

999
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,937
Time to watch

1000
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,708
my favorite new binge-worthy
obsession, "Breastworld."

1001
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,813
- Tucked in the bosom
of a tropical island

1002
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:04,949
lies the gayest resort
ever created.

1003
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,653
Where your fantasies
come true

1004
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,022
and nothing is off-limits.

1005
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,128
- Attention, guests.

1006
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:22,700
Hands Down, Bottoms Up
will begin in 15 minutes.

1007
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,005
- Here are we, Muffy,
darlin'. Surprise!

1008
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,439
Oh, this is so cute!

1009
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,108
- Where are all the cowboys?

1010
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,543
- Muffy, darling,
this place is better.

1011
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,179
It's "Breastworld."
Ooh, look at that.

1012
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,881
- But why, Viv?

1013
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,483
- Well, "Westworld"
was all booked up,

1014
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,252
so it was either this place
or "Trumpworld,"

1015
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,887
and all they have
are Russian hookers,

1016
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,622
gold toilets and golden showers!

1017
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,291
[all laugh]

1018
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:50,662
Plus, look at all
the hot menses. Ooh.

1019
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:55,300
- Well, I'm Julie.
I'm your cruising director.

1020
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,805
And you are at "Breastworld,"
the gayest place on earth.

1021
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,375
- [gasps] Did she say gay?

1022
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,445
I've never seen
a gay person before.

1023
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,814
Even my hairdresser is straight.

1024
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,549
- Yeah, we can tell.
- Yeah, we can tell.

1025
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:14,852
- Who is real and who's a robot?

1026
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,921
- That's for me to know
and for you to find out.

1027
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,925
Well, can I interest you girls
in some cocktails?

1028
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,660
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

1029
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,831
Dyslexa?

1030
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,368
This is Dyslexa,
our state of the art hostess.

1031
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,004
Dyslexa,
what's the weather like?

1032
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:36,441
- The forecast for today
is [imitating Cher] sunny

Dyslexa,

1039
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:53,258
- Oh!

1040
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,195
- Okay, enough.

1041
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,563
Wonderful.

1042
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,365
Why don't you get our girls
their drinks?

1043
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,001
How about two Patio Punches?

1044
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,135
- Coming right up.

1045
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,639
- Ow!

1046
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,807
- Uh!

1047
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,175
- I just got punched
in the face, Viv!

1048
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,511
I wanna go home! [cries]

1049
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,046
- You can't leave

1050
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:20,385
till you've played Drag Queen
Bingo at Hamburger Mary's!

1051
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,919
- Ooh, she's big.

1052
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,122
- B-12.

1053
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,224
- Bingo!

1054
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,996
- [gasps]
Heavens to Betsy, he's dead!

1055
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,966
- You win, you die!

1056
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,435
- Now, don't worry.
It's not a real gun.

1057
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,839
It's just a hair dryer
set to stunning.

1058
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,944
Rosie, toot and reboot.

1059
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,614
- Attitude adjustment
in process!

1060
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,617
Setting: Bianca Del Rio.
Baloney!

1061
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:58,856
Dialing down
to Ivyyyy Winterrrrs!

1062
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,693
Adjustment complete.
Welcome, ladies.

1063
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:04,562
There's always time for bingo.
Wanna play?

1064
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,698
- I think we should quit
while we're ahead.

1065
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:09,200
- How's your head?
- I have not had any complaints.

1066
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,369
- Okay, girl.
- Okay, Mary.

1067
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,839
- Okay, Henny.
- Brrrrr.

1068
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,842
[all laugh]

1069
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,144
- Me, too.
They always get me.

1070
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,214
- This is so confusing!

1071
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,950
- I know, but it does
start to make more sense

1072
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,752
around the fourth episode.

1073
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:32,256
- This is terrible!
I can't stand it anymore!

1074
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:36,327
- Oh, honey, it'll grow out.

1075
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,297
Or you could just wear a hat.
- Yeah.

1076
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,932
- Not my hair!

1077
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:44,402
I wanna go home!
[cries]

1078
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:51,476
- Well, you can't leave
before the big show!

1079
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:55,046
- Welcome to "Breastworld's"
big cock contest!

1080
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,115
- Dyslexa?

1081
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,483
[all laugh]

1082
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,818
- Ooh, cocks!

1083
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,122
- Oh, for the love
of Michael Fassbender!

1084
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,957
- Wiener, wiener,
chicken dinner!

1085
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:08,092
Cock-a-doodle do me. Ooh!

1086
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,862
- Cock-a-doodle don't!

1087
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,398
- Now listen up,
you bunch of degenerates!

1088
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,466
I'm shutting this resort down!

1089
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,735
- Voice recognition.
Right wing poster girl

1090
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:21,606
and all around nutcase,
Parah Salin!

1091
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,207
- Parah Salin?
- Parah Salin?

1092
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,675
- You betcha!

1093
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,445
- Shouldn't you be on "Prancing
with the Stars" or something?

1094
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,513
- I was robbed.

1095
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:29,781
And this place

1096
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,649
is violating
all the decency laws!

1097
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,851
Next thing you know,
you'll be stuffing turduckens.

1098
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,455
- Parah Salin,
I voted for you a few years ago,

1099
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:38,923
but I heard you went bonkers.

1100
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,258
- Fake news!

1101
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,759
- Parah, lighten up.

1102
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,795
What happens in "Breastworld"
stays in "Breastworld."

1103
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,663
- There is nothing in the
Declaration of Independence

1104
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,731
about happy.

1105
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,900
- Well, actually, yes, there is.

1106
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,067
- Happiness leads to tolerance.

1107
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,436
Tolerance leads to empathy.

1108
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:54,305
The next thing you know,
we'll be raising minimum wages

1109
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,674
and giving everybody
free healthcare!

1110
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,809
It's anarchy!

1111
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,277
- No, no, no, no.

1112
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,578
Now listen.

1113
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,480
I've only been here
for a few minutes,

1114
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,949
but I've never experienced
a place like this

1115
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,151
that embraces people
of all cultures

1116
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:10,321
just in the spirit of love,
fun and acceptance.

1117
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,590
And I've been wrong
about gay people my whole life

1118
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,858
and drag queens.

1119
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,928
They just wanna eat chicken
like everybody else.

1120
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,429
- Atta girl, Muffy!

1121
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,298
- We need to celebrate
our differences.

1122
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,166
Hate is not a family value.

1123
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,802
- Yeah, yeah. So we need
more places like this,

1124
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,171
because love is love is love.

1125
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,240
And these Mary's
mac and cheese balls,

1126
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,908
these are delicious.

1127
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,611
- And just so you know, Parah...

1128
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,914
- And your children
will someday know...

1129
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:41,953
- That's the night the lights
went out in "Breastworld!"

1130
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,455
- [laughs]

1131
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,990
That makes no sense at all.

1132
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,659
The party's over,
and you can't stop me!

1133
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,061
- Says who?

1134
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:56,501
- You killed her!
She's dead.

1135
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,669
- Oh, Lord,
she getting back up again!

1136
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,571
- Surprise, everyone!

1137
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,607
I'm actually a robot, too.

1138
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:04,775
In fact,
"Breastworld" created me

1139
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,211
to show how dumb
and hypocritical people can be.

1140
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,280
- Well, I guess it worked.

1141
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,815
- Mission accomplished.

1142
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,950
Now, haven't we all
learned something today?

1143
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,886
- I've learned that this place
couldn't get any gayer

1144
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:17,021
than if you hired Randy Rainbow.

1145
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,189
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1146
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:21,559
please give a big "Breastworld"
welcome to...

1147
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,494
- Randy Rainbow!

1148
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,830
[cheers and applause]

1149
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,633
- All right, "Breastworld."
Let's feel that gay love.

1150
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,801
Everyone sing with me, okay?

1151
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,737
♪ Have you met a gay man ♪

1152
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,839

[cheers and applause]

1156
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:53,591
- I smell a CableACE Award.

1157
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:55,059
[all laugh]

1158
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,563
- All right, ladies. It's time
for the judges' critiques,

1159
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:01,866
starting with Miz Cracker.

1160
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,101
- I love the way you look.

1161
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,871
I feel like you're Upper
East Side, New York City.

1162
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,907
- And this really looks like
you're gonna become this person.

1163
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:10,908
You just killed the runway.

1164
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,711
- On the "Breastworld"
challenge,

1165
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,814
you came armed with an idea.

1166
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,550
And then when we asked you
to twist it a little bit,

1167
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,019
I started seeing
the wheels turning

1168
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,355
more than the performance.

1169
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,691
I think you get caught up
in the details,

1170
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,259
and that is good
when you're talking about

1171
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:29,660
a look on the runway.

1172
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,629
But when you're talking
about creating a moment,

1173
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,664
you have to let go.

1174
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:36,634
- Up next, Kameron Michaels.

1175
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:39,870
- Tonight on the runway,
this was so fun.

1176
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,206
- I think that's what
I am going to look like

1177
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,442
when I'm older.
[all laugh]

1178
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:48,112
You came with such a complete
presentation of an idea.

1179
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:49,113
Great job.
- Thank you.

1180
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,481
- But in the challenge,

1181
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,017
we were trying to get you
to give us different layers.

1182
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:55,553
And if you saw,
it kind of didn't happen.

1183
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:58,723
- Yeah, the hysteria
was a little one note.

1184
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:01,392
- You had the monologue that was
supposed to give us the feel.

1185
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,294
- Love is love is love.

1186
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,263
- And we kind of
didn't really feel

1187
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,430
what we were supposed to feel.

1188
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,966
- Also, I love your tattoos,

1189
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:12,737
but this character
maybe should have worn gloves.

1190
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:15,139
Because your hands are up here
so much, it took me out of it.

1191
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:19,610
- Up next, Monet X Change.

1192
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,412
- I thought you were wonderful
in the challenge.

1193
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:23,447
You brought this
really relatable energy to it.

1194
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,049
- I know that girl.

1195
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,851
She was trying to get
her friend to loosen up.

1196
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,119
And she was funny.

1197
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,688
Even your little adlibs
were on point.

1198
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:32,623
- And that's, I think,
the best compliment.

1199
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,325
I didn't know
there was a lot of adlibbing.

1200
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:36,294
Your delivery was incredible.

1201
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,995
- Tonight on the runway,

1202
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,232
I don't know if I believed
this could be you in 50 years.

1203
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:42,733
- I'm a mess. I'm a wreck.

1204
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,069
My body is falling apart.

1205
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:46,170
- I bought it.

1206
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,305
Joan Rivers
did eight million jokes

1207
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,940
about her boobs
dragging on the floor

1208
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,175
because it's hilarious.

1209
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,444
I think this is funny.
- Thank you.

1210
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:56,080
- Up next, Aquaria.

1211
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,182
- Tonight on the runway,
it's absolutely stunning.

1212
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:01,352
I'm just digging
for a 71-year-old woman.

1213
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:05,690
- I was going for
a Michele Lamy hardcore fashion.

1214
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,991
Very tatted up.

1215
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,694
- I love that you know
who Michele Lamy is,

1216
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:11,562
but I still see
beautiful Aquaria of fashion

1217
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,064
in a white wig.

1218
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,799
- Let me tell you
why I buy this look.

1219
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:18,969
Because in 50 years, I plan on
looking exactly like this.

1220
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,938
[all laugh]
- In the challenge,

1221
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,807
I think you might
have been my favorite.

1222
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:25,176
I just felt like you were really
great with the physical comedy.

1223
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,777
Even the way
you changed your voice,

1224
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:29,313
I could sense
how much fun you were having.

1225
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,917
- And I found the robot
to be relatable.

1226
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:34,251
You know what I mean?
[all laugh]

1227
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,153
It was great.
- Thank you.

1228
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,322
- Up next, Eureka.

1229
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,724
- Explain this look to me.

1230
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:41,092
- I just wanted to be fun
and flowy,

1231
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:42,626
and I loved the coat.

1232
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,995
It's just something
I love to spin in and be fun.

1233
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,398
And I didn't really
have a use for it

1234
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,033
except maybe this look.

1235
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:50,434
- And that's kind of
what it looks like.

1236
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,437
- "Breastworld," I felt
that you weren't connected.

1237
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,439
I don't know what was going on,

1238
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,941
but when we were
giving you directions,

1239
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:59,410
I felt you struggling,
which was odd,

1240
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,845
especially
in an acting challenge,

1241
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:03,147
because I feel like
you know what to do.

1242
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:05,583
But, nonetheless, when you
watch it, you still popped.

1243
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:06,884
- But it didn't pop

1244
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,687
like I thought Eureka would pop
in that kind of show.

1245
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:11,155
- Yeah.
- And that's frustrating,

1246
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,124
because I just know
how good you are.

1247
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:16,393
- Up next, Asia O'Hara.

1248
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,997
- Tonight it's a beautiful
outfit like on the top.

1249
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,966
I love this, I love the hair.

1250
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:24,802
- But I thought for sure
you would be this aged showgirl,

1251
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:26,370
but fully showgirl.

1252
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,773
I liked the glasses bit,
but the rest of it,

1253
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:31,642
I was trying to figure out
why you went that route.

1254
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,478
- This look is very me
50 years from now,

1255
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,180
a tired old showgirl

1256
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,082
running around a parking lot
at Drag Con

1257
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,817
begging people
to buy my fanny pack.

1258
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,385
[all laugh]

1259
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,121
- I really loved you
in "Breastworld."

1260
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,056
It was really joyful.
It was fun.

1261
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,424
- Yeah, I agree.

1262
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,760
I thought you were a burst
of energy towards the end.

1263
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,196
It was like a brand new
character we needed to see.

1264
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,665
- I would have attempted
to do an imitation.

1265
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,033
[imitating Sarah Palin]
You betcha. Sure thing.

1266
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,034
But you did it in a way

1267
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,805
that was very much Asia
doing this.

1268
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,006
I thought you were really good.

1269
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,408
- Thank you, ladies.

1270
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:06,043
I think we've heard enough.

1271
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,679
While you untuck backstage,

1272
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,015
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1273
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:14,285
All right, now just between

1274
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,086
the Broad City
Titty Committee...

1275
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,788
[all laugh]
- Whoo!

1276
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,558
- What do you think?
Miz Cracker?

1277
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,059
- Miz Cracker's look tonight
was stunning.

1278
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,728
- Yeah, and I thought
it was just so put together.

1279
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,831
It was just
really well executed.

1280
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:30,167
- But in the challenge,
it was all kind of stiff.

1281
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,535
- Yeah. I don't think
it would be

1282
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,371
the spinoff character
of the show

1283
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,706
that I'd want to see.

1284
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,941
- I'm curious.

1285
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,542
Who would be the spinoff
character of "Broad City?"

1286
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,711
- Marcel.

1287
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:41,812
- Good answer!

1288
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,081
- Hell, yeah. Whoo!

1289
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,383
- You know, when I spoke with
Miz Cracker in the workroom,

1290
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,785
I called her out on the fact

1291
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:50,955
that she's operating
what comes out of her mouth.

1292
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:51,956
And I could see
even in the challenge,

1293
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:55,659
she was producing herself.

1294
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,262
Kameron Michaels.

1295
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:01,632
- The runway character
tonight was amazing.

1296
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,033
- But in "Breastworld,"

1297
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:06,103
she just hit one level
of hysterical

1298
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,738
through the whole show.

1299
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,975
- And when she has
that kind of epiphany,

1300
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:13,744
that was the moment where you
were supposed to get the feels.

1301
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,045
I got nothing.

1302
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:18,649
- This is not the time
in this competition to choke up.

1303
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:19,783
- No, ma'am.
- No.

1304
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,286
Monet X Change.

1305
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,321
- I had the most fun
watching Monet in "Breastworld."

1306
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,591
She was giving us one-liners
that weren't in the script.

1307
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,592
- Because
she knew the character.

1308
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:31,428
- I loved
just watching her play.

1309
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,564
She is clearly a star.

1310
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:38,035
- The runway. Is it morbid that
she's walking around with IVs

1311
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,671
and has lost her hair
due to an illness? Of course.

1312
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,740
But, you know,
these are drag queens.

1313
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,708
They can tell any kind
of joke they want to tell.

1314
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,911
- I love swinging titties,

1315
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,178
but it felt more to me

1316
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,180
like a sketch I would see
at a comedy show,

1317
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,917
and I was missing
that level of glam.

1318
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:55,085
- You know, a lot of the girls
come from the nightclub world,

1319
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,120
and so a lot of the gags

1320
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,555
that they plan
for the runway here

1321
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,892
don't necessarily
pack the same punch.

1322
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,194
Actually, I want
to see her glamorous.

1323
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:07,598
If she'd put a big
gorgeous wig on and some heels,

1324
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,733
it would have amped it up
a little bit.

1325
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,436
All right, let's move on down
to Aquaria.

1326
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:17,007
- Aquaria was really funny
and lovable as a robot.

1327
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,242
- There's a moment

1328
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,277
where she walks up with
like the stuffed animals,

1329
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,480
and just like even the approach
is hilarious.

1330
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,350
- On the runway tonight,
she is the winner...

1331
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,718
of a different runway.

1332
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:28,852
- [laughs]

1333
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,287
- That didn't look like her
in 50 years.

1334
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,824
- Well, she was 11 years old
when this show premiered.

1335
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,759
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

1336
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,127
- So, you know,
for a 21-year-old,

1337
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,864
that is her idea
of what she's gonna look like.

1338
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,066
[all laugh]
- Right.

1339
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:43,600
- Eureka.

1340
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,970
- This runway look,
I don't know.

1341
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,972
She looked like Paula Dean
dressed up like a witch.

1342
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:49,373
- [laughs]
- There you go.

1343
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:51,842
- You know, tonight she said,
well, I want to wear this

1344
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,410
because I like the way it feels
when I twirl.

1345
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,479
Well, that's cute for you,
but what about us?

1346
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:56,580
- Yeah.
- Right.

1347
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,115
We're buying the tickets.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

1348
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,418
- And I feel like Eureka
had a little rough go of it

1349
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,987
in that "Breastworld" challenge.

1350
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:05,155
Because we all know
what Eureka can do,

1351
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,024
but I felt like
she wasn't there.

1352
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:09,960
And that meltdown moment
just wasn't working.

1353
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,730
And at the end, I still
don't think it really worked.

1354
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,864
- And at the end of the day,

1355
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,833
as funny as she is,
she has to deliver.

1356
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,935
- Right.
- Or it's not good enough.

1357
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:20,704
- She is one of my favorites
and I'm just like, ugh.

1358
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,007
But she has it in her
to deliver.

1359
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,042
- I feel like we're being
extra harsh on her,

1360
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,310
but it's because
we've seen her be so good.

1361
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,478
- Yes.
- That's right.

1362
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,580
- Asia O'Hara.

1363
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,548
- Have you ever watched a movie
that was really good,

1364
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:34,685
and then in the third act,
a supporting actress comes in

1365
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,487
and you go, oh, she's totally
gonna be nominated.

1366
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:38,689
- Uh-huh.
- That's how I felt about Asia.

1367
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:39,923
- She knows who she is,

1368
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,793
because she brought herself
to that character.

1369
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,094
And like you said earlier, Ross,

1370
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,864
I preferred that over
some Sarah Palin impression.

1371
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:48,565
- Tonight on the runway,
however, you guys,

1372
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,800
I'm really confused.

1373
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,268
I just didn't buy it.

1374
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,872
I'm buying the fabulous
always done pageant girl.

1375
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,106
- But, you know, hey,

1376
00:52:56,106 --> 00:53:00,210
she was fantastic
in the challenge and very funny.

1377
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,945
- She just has star power.

1378
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:05,315
- On that note, silence!

1379
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,951
I've made my decision.

1380
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:09,953
Bring back my golden girls.

1381
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:12,256
- Welcome back, ladies.

1382
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:16,326
I want to reiterate you all
did amazing work this week.

1383
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,129
But we're at that point
in the competition

1384
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:23,133
where the cuts
are deep and painful.

1385
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:29,907
Monet X Change.
On the runway, you served sag,

1386
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:33,444
and in "Breastworld,"
you had swag.

1387
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:35,679
You're safe.

1388
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:40,751
You may drag your IV
to the back of the stage.

1389
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:41,952
- Thank you.

1390
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,857
- Asia O'Hara.

1391
00:53:46,857 --> 00:53:51,595
Your Parah Salin
was hucking filarious.

1392
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:53,964
Con-drag-ulations.

1393
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,433
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1394
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,935
[applause]

1395
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,169
You've won a four-night stay

1396
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:03,474
at Vermont's Frog Meadow Farm
Bed & Breakfast,

1397
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:06,310
courtesy of My Gay Getaway.

1398
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,512
- Thank you so much.

1399
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,147
My second win,

1400
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:13,217
especially after
the catastrophe of last week,

1401
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:14,318
I couldn't be happier.

1402
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:15,953
I feel like I'm on
the upward slope again.

1403
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,525
- Aquaria, the judges
thought your runway look

1404
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,494
was not age appropriate,

1405
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:28,465
but your performance
in "Breastworld" packed a punch.

1406
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:30,968
You are safe.

1407
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,803
- Thank you.

1408
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,973
- Eureka. This week,

1409
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:40,310
your performance
needed a toot and reboot.

1410
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,114
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.

1411
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,084
Kameron Michaels.

1412
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:50,554
Your Silver Fox
gave us a kick,

1413
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:54,625
but in "Breastworld,"
you muffed your Muffy.

1414
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,696
Miz Cracker,
your Silver Fox rocks,

1415
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:04,268
but your "Breastworld" hostess
wasn't the mostest.

1416
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:10,140
Kameron Michaels,

1417
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,143
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1418
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:18,949
Miz Cracker, you are safe
and may join the other girls.

1419
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:25,455
Two old queens stand before me.

1420
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,762
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1421
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:36,667
and save yourself
from elimination.

1422
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,737
The time has come...
[thunder]

1423
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,140
for you to lip sync...

1424
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,612
[echoing] for your life!

1425
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:53,016
Good luck
and don't fuck it up.

You really freaked me out.

is going home tonight.
