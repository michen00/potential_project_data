1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,935
- Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race..."

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,704
We're playing the Snatch Game.

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,105
[cheers and applause]

4
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,940
- I drew a picture of a bunny.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,208
[all laugh]

6
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,176
- Russian hooker urine.

7
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,011
[all laugh]

8
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,679
- I'll bring it up in congress,

9
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,114
and then I'll bring it up
at "Draw Cam."

10
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,385
- The Vixen.

11
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,354
- Sorry, girl,
there was not much there.

12
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,823
It needs to be more
than just a few moments.

13
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,325
- Monique Heart.

14
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,262
- I was really excited
for Maxine Waters,

15
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,998
but you didn't really dig
into who she was.

16
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,399
- Okay.

17
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,270
- Who deserves to go home
tonight and why?

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,805
- Asia O'Hara because she's
my biggest competition.

19
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,074
- I have never seen such a level
of unprofessionalism

20
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,577
as I have watching Eureka.

21
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,179
- I can't let her sit there--
- Again.

22
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,180
- And literally
verbally attack me.

23
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,149
- You weren't attacked.
You're a grown man.

24
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,183
- Literally
verbally attacking me

25
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,351
in front of people

26
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,786
that I want to have respect
for my art.

27
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,989
- All right, Asia.
- I think The Vixen.

28
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,157
- I would have to say The Vixen.

29
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,226
- The Vixen.
- The Vixen.

30
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,196
- Aquaria, you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

31
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,165
[applause]

32
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,568
- Vixen, shantay you stay.

33
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,004
Monique, sashay away.

34
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,583
- Just keep swimming.

35
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,687
- Girl.
- Just keep swimming.

36
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,255
- I'm so done swimming.

37
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,790
- What's it say?

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,293
- "Always abide in love
and learn your words.

39
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,995
Facts are facts."

40
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,898
- Facts are facts.
- Miss Monique Heart, girl.

41
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,267
- See you soon, Monique.

42
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,768
Monique was just eliminated,

43
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:46,073
and I feel like my friend
in this competition is gone.

44
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,608
The workroom is not
going to be the same.

45
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,178
- Well, now y'all stuck with me.

46
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:54,348
At this point, I know I don't
have a friend in the room,

47
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,116
and it makes me happy,

48
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,385
because now I have no reason
to hold back.

49
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,753
The fight is on.

50
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,489
- It sucks to have to tell
who you want to go home.

51
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,492
Like, that is one of the worst
parts of this competition.

52
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,994
- I feel like one should
just give a true answer

53
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,029
whether people like it or not,
you know what I'm saying?

54
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,732
Like, and I feel like
unfortunately

55
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,734
Vixen, that everyone--
- But let's be clear for me.

56
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,270
I did not once, nor have I ever,
attacked your character

57
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,007
or anything about you
as a person.

58
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,341
- But you attacked my dream.

59
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,177
- It's all of our dream, baby.

60
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,579
- No matter what anybody's
reason for saying it,

61
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,214
it don't feel good.

62
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,016
- It doesn't,
but I'm not mad--

63
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,717
- So let me have my feelings.

64
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,719
- So The Vixen, Eureka,
are y'all cool now?

65
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,288
- I didn't have a problem
with Vixen to begin with.

66
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,057
You're like,
oh, I've just decided

67
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,726
I just don't like you period
for no real reason whatsoever.

68
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,761
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Except for the fact

69
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,095
that you annoyed me
in Snatch Game.

70
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,265
The Vixen says my character
was too much, and I know it was.

71
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,299
It was supposed to be.

72
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,502
And I made sure
not to cut anyone off.

73
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,003
I'm not the one to blame

74
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,072
if you did a bad job
in the Snatch Game.

75
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,907
She got upset
about everybody else,

76
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,442
and I just happened
to be the one

77
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,077
that pissed her off somehow

78
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,245
when I didn't do anything
specifically to you.

79
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,413
- That can't even be factual.

80
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:00,447
How can I be upset
about everybody else--

81
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,015
- What are you upset about,
though,

82
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,283
when I didn't do shit
- I just don't like you.

83
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,286
When you get asked
who deserves to go home,

84
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,588
my least favorite person
in the room is still you.

85
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,826
- The Vixen wants Eureka
to go home for personal reasons

86
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,094
just because
she doesn't like her.

87
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,896
Even it's so apparent now

88
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:19,099
because Eureka didn't even
say her name on the runway.

89
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,903
- Underneath this mask
you have a black moustache.

90
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:26,540
This LeVar Burton look
is going to be everything.

91
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,542
[all laugh]

92
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,078
- Haters gonna hate,
but y'all can't hate the body.

93
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,779
- Yes.
- Yes, we can.

94
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,047
- Love the body.

95
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,015
- You over there
sitting over there

96
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,850
shaped like a can of dog food.

97
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,085
[all laugh]

98
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,786
- Aquaria done won Snatch Game.
I did not--

99
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,121
- Oh, congratulations.

100
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,889
- Congratulations.

101
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,257
- Yeah.
- It's a real gag.

102
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,959
- Congratulations.
Now, you are my sister, girl.

103
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,061
I love you the house down, boo.
We kiki, we laugh.

104
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,264
I really thought that it was
gonna be Eureka or myself.

105
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,068
- I won Snatch Game,
which is a big game changer.

106
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,072
I have definitely a giant target
all over my body.

107
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,941
- And that sounds
so conceited,

108
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,042
but I didn't see you winning.

109
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,111
I am shocked that Aquaria won.

110
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,479
I'm happy that the crown

111
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,380
still goes to New York City
for Snatch Game.

112
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,850
But it should have been me.

113
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,185
I am thirsty for a win, honey.

114
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,322
I need a win in my pocket
like yesterday.

115
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,323
Let me show y'all
what glamour is.

116
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,324
This is glamour.

117
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,059
- You will never be glamour.

118
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,162
- Monet X Change
is rising to the top,

119
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,897
and I'm waiting
to take over, girl.

120
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,866
I'm giving you RuPaul, honey.

121
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,936
You're not into it?

122
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,071
- It's a different kind
of beauty.

123
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,173
- It's a different species.

124
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,377
- The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

125
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,879
receives a one-year supply

126
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,281
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

127
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,185
and a cash prize of $100.000.

128
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,121
With extra special guest judges
Andrew Rannells

129
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,157
and Billy Eichner.

130
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,324
- ♪ RuPaul's Drag Race ♪

131
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,826
- ♪ May the best woman ♪

132
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,062
- ♪ Best woman win ♪

133
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,634
- Good morning.

134
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,003
- I'm feeling
sponge-tastic. Oh...

135
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,804
- It's a new day
in the workroom,

136
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,173
and we are almost
to the halfway point.

137
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,207
- Lucky seven.

138
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,976
- The lucky seven. Yay!
- Lucky seven.

139
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,945
- It's a little surreal.

140
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,181
I can't believe
that I have been here

141
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,116
for as long as I have.

142
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:20,153
I'm feeling a lot better about
my place in this competition.

143
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,222
- What do y'all think
is next here?

144
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,691
- Let's dance.
I wanna dance with somebody.

145
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,992
- Do you wanna feel the heat,
though?

146
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,160
- Mm.
- Mm.

147
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,495
- Kameron, what do you
want to do next?

148
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,763
- Kameron wants to have
a weight lifting challenge.

149
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,199
Or arm wrestling.
Let's arm wrestle.

150
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,000
- No.
- Do it. Do it.

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,268
- Come on.
- Do it.

152
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,170
- Beat her ass, Kameron.

153
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,171
- I'm on Team Kameron.

154
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,372
I'm gonna cheerlead for Kameron.

155
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,707
- Okay, somebody--

156
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,543
[alarm]
- Whoo, girl.

157
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,611
- Saved by the bell.
- I won!

158
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,380
- She done already
done had herses.

159
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,382
- Hey, babes.
[cheers and applause]

160
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,351
Do you believe
in life after love?

161
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,519
- Yes!

162
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,120
- Well, you better
save up all your tears

163
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,156
because you haven't seen
the last of me.

164
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,259
After all, Cher-ing is caring.

165
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:05,966
Who books me on these
chickenshit gigs?

166
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,001
I mean, I'm Cher, bitch.

167
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,036
[all laugh]

168
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,839
[cheers and applause]
- Oh, no, Cher.

169
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,941
- Hello, hello, hello.

170
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,811
[cheers and applause]
Hi, ladies.

171
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,146
Now, America's
next drag superstar

172
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:24,851
needs to be able to take it
as well as she can give it.

173
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,620
Err!

174
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,654
[all laugh]

175
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,056
Starting with
the "Drag Race" staple,

176
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,892
the fake bitch slap.

177
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,762
Uh-huh.
You've seen the GIF of me

178
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,731
slapping the season two girls.

179
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,101
So for today's mini challenge,

180
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,205
we're going to play
a game of slap out of it.

181
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,240
[cheers and laughter]

182
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,443
Each of you will come up
with super sassy lines

183
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:55,882
that will motivate me to
fake slap the crap out of you.

184
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,117
[all laugh]

185
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,987
And the queen with the most
compelling reactions wins.

186
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,356
#DragRace.

187
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,692
All right, Eureka, come on down.

188
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,128
[all laugh]

189
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,629
Now, Eureka, I don't think

190
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,598
there's anything
you could say to me

191
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,267
that would make me
want to slap you,

192
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,836
you sweet, precious child.

193
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,605
- HD.

194
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,673
- [gasps]

195
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,609
- Oh!

196
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,144
[cries] Why?

197
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,379
- Get back in line
where you belong.

198
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,181
[all laugh]

199
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,017
- Why are standing
so far away, bitch?

200
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,553
- They call you mother,

201
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,055
but at your age,
shouldn't it be grand--

202
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,158
[all laugh]

203
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,493
- I don't like
the way that was going.

204
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:46,166
- The new host of "Drag Race,"
Lady Bunny Girl.

205
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,168
- Oh, my God,
there's a bird in here.

206
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,002
- Uh!

207
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:53,039
[all laugh]

208
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,107
- Goodbye forever.

209
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,108
- Ugh!

210
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,878
Et tu, RuPaul.

211
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,580
[all laugh]

212
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,050
- This is fun.

213
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,418
- You know what, Ru?

214
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,053
- What, darling?

215
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,955
- You wear it, eh...

216
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,690
[all laugh]

217
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,325
- That was so funny.

218
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,426
- I thought it was good.

219
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,928
- I can't slap you for that.

220
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,030
[all laugh]

221
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,769
- Vanjie.
- Vanjie.

222
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,138
Vanjie, Vanjie.

223
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,110
- Hey, bitch.
- Hey.

224
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,478
- You got something
to say to me?

225
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,513
- You hit like a girl.
Too bad you don't look like one.

226
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,348
[all laugh]

227
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,950
- Now, that was good.

228
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,886
- Oh, my God! Oh!

229
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,554
[cheers]

230
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

231
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,826
Oh, my God.

232
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,695
I'm so sorry.

233
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,897
- It's about to be
"Asia O'Hara's Drag Race."

234
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,166
I'm about to own
this whole building.

235
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,937
Can I go back to my spot?

236
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,839
- Yeah, you go on.
You better get on over there.

237
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,940
- Yeah, I'm gonna...

238
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,810
[applause]

239
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,612
- [laughs]

240
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:06,813
- My name's Aquaria,

241
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:12,786
and my birthday
is February 12, 1996.

242
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,554
- Asia O'Hara, come here.

243
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,790
You stand right there.

244
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,857
Slap this bitch for me.

245
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,858
- Yeah, slap her.

246
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,260
- Give me some.

247
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,830
- Aah-ha-ha!

248
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,931
Oh...

249
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,333
- Now get your skinny ass
back there.

250
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,436
[all laugh]
Thank you, Asia.

251
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:33,940
Ladies, you all
really made me slap happy.

252
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,542
[all laugh]

253
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:37,710
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...

254
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,980
Asia O'Hara.

255
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,315
[applause]

256
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,150
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.

257
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:50,089
- You've won a $2.000 gift card
from Sparkles Rhinestones.

258
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,226
You can put those
where your teeth used to be.

259
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,928
[all laugh]

260
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,363
Now that I've slapped
some sense into y'all,

261
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,265
it's time to pay tribute

262
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,735
to one of the greatest stars
of all time.

263
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:07,006
She's an Oscar-winning actress
who's had a number one hit

264
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:11,344
in every decade
for the past six decades.

265
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:15,181
And yet somehow, she never ages.

266
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,718
I am, of course,
talking about my idol,

267
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,654
the one and only Cher.

268
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,958
[cheers and applause]

269
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,659
So for this week's
maxi challenge,

270
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:31,397
you'll be starring in Cher,
the Unauthorized Rusical.

271
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:34,634
Each of you will portray Cher

272
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,570
from a different era
of her epic career.

273
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,240
And get this.

274
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,143
You're going to be singing live.

275
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,079
- Ooh.

276
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,181
- No lip syncing.

277
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,651
Kameron,
you'll play sixties Cher.

278
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,286
- Oh.

279
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,488
- Monet X Change and The Vixen,

280
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:01,227
you'll each play different
seventies variety show Chers.

281
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,996
Aquaria, Disco Cher.

282
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,164
- Whoo!

283
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,200
- Asia O'Hara, movie star Cher.

284
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,236
Eureka, rock star Cher.

285
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,205
- Ooh.

286
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,407
[imitating Cher]
Comeback tour.

287
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,042
- That was rotten.

288
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,211
[all laugh]

289
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,014
Miz Cracker, comeback Cher.

290
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,017
And you can all
top off your Cher fantasy

291
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,053
using wigs provided
by RockStar Wigs.

292
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,255
- Ooh.
- Oh.

293
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,624
- Gentlemen, start your engines,

294
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,994
and may the best woman win.

295
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,230
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you.

296
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,899
- Hey.

297
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,870
- This week's maxi challenge is
Cher, The Unauthorized Rusical.

298
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,939
And we're singing live.

299
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,107
I don't know
about everybody else,

300
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:49,576

306
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,591
The key to doing well
in this challenge

307
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,726
is to really getting
the essence of Cher,

308
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,761
and really portraying that

309
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,664
in your character
and in your Cher-isms.

00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,621
I see a bunch of queens
singing, dancing,

320
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,723
talking to themselves,
trying to be Cher.

321
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,359

- Aquaria, are you drunk?

327
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,007
- [laughs]

328
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,909

00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,713
- Hello, my gypsies, tramps,
and thieves.

330
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,649
[applause]
- Hello.

331
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,951
- Hey, Asia.
- Hey.

332
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,320
- So, Asia,
do you actually sing?

333
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,755
- I do not.

334
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,523
- Hey, listen,
that never stopped me.

335
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,991
- Well, you sing.

336
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,193
- I can talk,
therefore, I can sing.

337
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,529
Now, you've got eighties
movie star Cher.

338
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,864
- Yes.

339
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,867
- So tell me about your
interpretation of this role.

340
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,235
- Well, it's gonna
take some work

341
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,672
because it is
a less glamorous Cher

342
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,273
than a lot of people
are used to.

343
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,042
- Did you see any of
the eighties movies with Cher?

344
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,243
- Yes, I have.

345
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,412
But all those roles
are very different.

346
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,213
They're not her as Cher,

347
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,015
they're her playing characters,
or different people.

348
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:40,386
- Well, see, she doesn't
really lose who Cher is

349
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,088
when she's playing
these characters.

350
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,222
You see the rebel,

351
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,192
the no BS attitude
that comes through.

352
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,227
You have to embody Cher.

353
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,563
Any acting experience?
- None.

354
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,098
Well, last week's Snatch Game.

355
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,168
- Yeah, well,
let's not bring that up.

356
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,169
- Let's not.
- Yeah.

357
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,670
So let me hear you say

358
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,005
[imitating Cher]
"snap out of it."

359
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,475
- [imitating Cher]
Snap out of it.

360
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,111
- You're not getting the sort
of timbre of her voice,

361
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,346
the way that she speaks,
you know.

362
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,718
So get it together
and snap out of it.

363
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,486
- Oh.

364
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:15,254
I am literally "Moonstruck."

365
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,994
- Hello, Kameron Michaels.
- Hello.

366
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,931
- Listen, I am an encyclopedia
of Cher knowledge.

367
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,165
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

368
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,700
- Is there anything
you'd like to ask me?

369
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,535
- Well, if you have
any information for me

370
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,037
about the Sixties Cher.

371
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,072
- Well, listen,
throughout the decades,

372
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,675
Cher at her core is the rebel.

373
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,145
I met Cher
for the first time in 1996.

374
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,947
I met her in her dressing room.

375
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:44,350
It was just me and her,
and so charismatic.

376
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,120
I was like...
She just has it.

377
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,554
She has that "it" factor.
- Yeah.

378
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,591
- If you can capture
that "it" factor

379
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,093
and the rebel, you've got it.

380
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,062
So now so far
in this competition,

381
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,164
you've sort of been
flying under the radar.

382
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,966
- I like to think
I'm silent but deadly,

383
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,868
but that hasn't won me
a challenge yet,

384
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,871
so maybe I need to be
a little more on the deadly side

385
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,038
and a little less
on the silent side.

386
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,341
- Good. It's time
for you to show up.

387
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,511
Just remember,
Cher-ing is caring.

388
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,513
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, I'll see you later.

389
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,150
Monet X Change.
- Hi, Ru.

390
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,518
- Now, you sing opera,
don't you?

391
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,521
- I do. I went to undergrad
for opera performance.

392
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,855
But I'm like a bass,
you know what I mean?

393
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:23,890
- Sure.

394
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,691
- In opera,
I'm a basso profundo,

395
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,993
so doing this Cher thing

396
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,095
is not necessarily
something I would normally do.

397
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,696
I just have such a deep voice,

398
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,732
and doing like the Cher,
oh, I sound like--

399
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,301
it's like that whole--
- Cher has a deep voice.

400
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,003
- Yes, she does, but I'm like
a bass, you know what I mean?

401
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,104
It's like weird.

402
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,972
- I just don't understand
you kids today.

403
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,675
It feels like when you
come to the competition,

404
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:46,145
you compartmentalize
your talent.

405
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,949
Whatever you excel at,
fucking apply it to everything.

406
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,818
I hope these other bitches
are listening to this,

407
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,719
because this is
some good shit.

408
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,155
I had to pay thousands
of dollars to learn that.

409
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,858
Now, you are playing
which Cher?

410
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,892
- Seventies.

411
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,827
- Oh, right,
the variety show Cher.

412
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,128
- Yeah, variety show Cher.

413
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,162
- Who is your Cher?

414
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,164
- My Cher would have to be
Carol Burnett.

415
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,099
- Carol Burnett
does a mean Cher.

416
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,769
- Yeah. Carol Burnett
loves impersonating Cher,

417
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,004
so I'm going to try
to marry that with my Monet-ness

418
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,874
to give a very original
Cher performance.

419
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,644
It's gonna help me win
a goddamn maxi challenge.

420
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,645
- Hi, Eureka.

421
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,013
- Hi, Ms. Charles.

422
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,983
- Hey, listen, last week
you had some words with Vixen.

423
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,018
Have you guys reconciled?

424
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:29,055
- No. She's made it very clear
she doesn't like me.

425
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,190
Maybe we're not meant
to be friends.

426
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,992
When someone doesn't like me,

427
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,760
it's hard for me
to understand why,

428
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,963
so instead, let me
just not worry about that.

429
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,965
I have a lot to prove
and a lot of pressure.

430
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,499
I don't want to focus
on anything else.

431
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,368
- Exactly. Do you sing?

432
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,036
- For me, I get really nervous

433
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,539
whenever I have to sing live
in front of people.

434
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,641
- When you do a character
and it's not even you,

435
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,710
you don't have to be nervous.
You're being Cher.

436
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,313
I read years ago that Cher
grew up loving Elvis.

437
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,383
So a lot of her...
♪ almost sounds like Elvis ♪

438
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,985
- Hey, okay.

439
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:02,588
- So it's not you,
it's eighties rock Cher.

440
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,359
It helps, if you do forget,
it's...

441
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,794
- Yeah, okay.

442
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,363
- You got a little white thing
going on there.

443
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,298
- [laughs]
- Don't be nervous.

444
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,467
- I won't.
- And snap out of it.

445
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,935
- I'm snapping, Ru.

446
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,104
- [laughs]
That was Ethel Merman.

447
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,939
[all laugh]

448
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,807
If we were doing
an Ethel Merman challenge--

449
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,143
- I'd be spot on.
- You'd be right on.

450
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,811
All right, I'll see you later.

451
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,146
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.

452
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,015
Oh!

453
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,784
- Miz Cracker.
- Mother Ru.

454
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,519
- So you have
some history of Cher.

455
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,755
- I came from a family
where there was literally

456
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,691
no exposure to pop culture
at all.

457
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:42,295
So when I first saw Cher,
it was late in the game.

458
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:46,866
- Okay. So you have
nineties comeback Cher.

459
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,000
How are you going
to make her stand out?

460
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,369
- I want to add as many gags
about age as possible.

461
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,871
If I could have, at some point,

462
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,174
someone throw me a cane
and go for it on a cane.

463
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,811
- Okay, so now you're in
a little area

464
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,979
that's a little bit
touchy there,

465
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:03,449
because Cher is not old,
she's ageless.

466
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,217
Do want you want,
- You know, Ru,

467
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,387
when you didn't slap your thigh
at the cane thing,

468
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,956
it was already nixed.

469
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:12,091
- [laughs]

470
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:12,959
All right,
thank you, Miz Cracker.

471
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,261
- Thank you so much, Ru.

472
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,698
- Hey, Vixen.
- Hey, Ru.

473
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,433
- Do you sing?
- Yeah, sometimes.

474
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,968
- Oh, sometimes.
- Sometimes.

475
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,003
You know, I lip sync
for a living, so...

476
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,440
- Yeah. So do you do
a Cher impersonation?

477
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,475
- No, I've never
done a Cher impersonation,

478
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,777
but I've performed her music
as a lip sync.

479
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,647
It's not a big thing
doing a Cher song.

480
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:40,052
- Huh. You have a little bit
of a history of conflicts here.

481
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,655
- Yeah.
- Why do you think that is?

482
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,124
- I like to take things head on,

483
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,092
because I'm like,
no, be real with me?

484
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,526
What's going on?

485
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,162
- Yeah. How can you incorporate
that into your character?

486
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,998
- I guess
I'm gonna have to be feisty.

487
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,432
- Mm-hmm.
- You think so?

488
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,600
- I, uh--

489
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,002
- I think Cher
would throw a glass or two

490
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,470
every once in a while.

491
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,971
- Sure, sure.

492
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,706
- Cher, Cher.

493
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,209
- You had beef with Eureka.

494
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,911
Have you guys had
a "come to Jesus" moment?

495
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,880
- Not at all.
I feel like it's better

496
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,916
knowing who your friends are
and who your enemies are.

497
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,551
Apparently
I don't have a friend here,

498
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,321
'cause you see all the girls
want me to go home.

499
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,691
Last week, all of the other
girls said that I should home.

500
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,694
They don't think
I deserve to be here,

501
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,095
so fuck 'em.

502
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,864
- Why do you think
they want you to go home?

503
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,632
- I think they know
that I keep it real

504
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,934
and they can't
play phony around me.

505
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,304
Because I call bullshit
all the time.

506
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,044
- You can fight,

507
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,213
but ultimately the biggest fight
you have in this life

508
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,948
is with yourself, you know?

509
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,316
And diving in

510
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,487
and seeing what the root cause
of that conflict is.

511
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,588
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

512
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,390
So keep that in mind.
- Yes, ma'am.

513
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,926
- All right, Vixen.
I'll see you out there.

514
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,194
- Thank you.

515
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,164
- [imitating Cher] Aquaria.

516
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:58,998
- [imitating Cher]
Hey, RuPaul.

517
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,766
- [laughs]
- Which Cher do you have?

518
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,334
- I've got Disco Cher.

519
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,070
This challenge
I'm really excited for

520
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,338
because I've got a Cher
that is singing

521
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,275
in a range
that I'm familiar with.

522
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:12,044
There's like a warm five notes

523
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,379
that I can hit pretty well.
- Oh, I'd love to hear them.

524
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,548
- And these
are most of them, so...

525
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,549
- Let me hear them.

526
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,784
- ♪ TV's gone ♪

527
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,219
♪ Moving on ♪

528
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,490
♪ There's just one thing
that left for me to do ♪

529
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,093
- Aquaria seems really confident

530
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,327
about her singing ability.

531
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,263
She is clearly
not listening to herself sing.

532
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,266
- ♪ To my grave,
the wants-- ♪

533
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,267
Oh, pardon me.
I fucked that up.

534
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,203
- That sounds nice.
- Thank you.

535
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,904
- All you've got to do
is learn the words.

536
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,840
Well let me just say this.

537
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,210
I'm looking for you kids
to embody what Cher is.

538
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,377
- Right.
- She's an outsider.

539
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,213
- I feel like
I can relate to that

540
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,548
because I'm kind of
that like outsider queen

541
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,551
that does all the things,
and does them kind of well,

542
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,588
but isn't, you know,
always with other girls.

543
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,157
- Well, Cher and Cher alike.

544
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,325
- I can't wait
to Cher with you all.

545
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,227
- Thanks, Aquaria.

546
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,095
All right, ladies.

547
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,830
Good luck, and...

548
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,532
[imitating Cher]
don't fuck it up.

549
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,067
[cheers and applause]

550
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,402
- Whoo.

551
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,172
- Aquaria, are you nervous
after your meeting?

552
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,074
- No.
- Oh.

553
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:17,009
- Should I be?
Does it sound like I need to be?

554
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,613
- Aquaria is a cocky
little bastard, isn't she, girl?

555
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,181
She really
didn't sound that great,

556
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,116
so she is like
really delusional.

557
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,218
But she feels like
her walkthrough went amazing,

558
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,488
and in her mind, Aquaria
has won this challenge.

559
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,258
So we'll see how that all plays
out on the runway tomorrow.

560
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:36,829
- Hello.

561
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,665
- It is time to rehearse
with Todrick Hall,

562
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,934
the singing, dancing sensation.

563
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,203
You know, no pressure.

564
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,406
- Are y'all ready to rehearse
Cher the Unauthorized Rusical?

565
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,607
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

566
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:49,942
- So we're gonna go
one at a time.

567
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,710
Let's start with the sixties.
Who goes first?

568
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,513
Okay, bitch.
Don't let us down.

569
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,116
- I'm just gonna say
a little prayer.

570
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,451
- Can I have you on stage,
and everybody else,

571
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,554
you're free to go
just hang out for a moment.

572
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,022
Can I have the boys up here?

573
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,390
- Hi.
- Okay.

574
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,426
Now we need to hear you
sing the lyrics. Ready?

575
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,996
- ♪ Oh, we were

576
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,334

578

[laughs]

579
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,109
Wow, way to bomb.
Right in front of Todrick Hall.

580
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,511
Great first impression.

581
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,013
- You're very cute,
but it's gonna be like not cute

582
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,182
if you get on stage
and fuck it up.

583
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,620
- ♪ Born in Cali,

Sorry.

586
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,192
- You okay?

587
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,595
- Yeah, just nerves.
- This is really important,

588
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:45,364
because you set the tone
of the entire number.

589
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,999
You're going to have
to emote the entire thing.

590
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,167
That's what's gonna sell this.

591
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,535
No pressure.
- Yeah.

592
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,037
- So you're gonna start
facing this way,

593
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,740
and it's kind of like
a little homage to Beyoncé.

594
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,243
You're gonna go
sin-gle ladies.

595
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:59,745
Five, six, seven, eight.

596
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,213
And sin-gle ladies.

597
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,481
Dance all night.

598
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,049
Dun-dun. Great.

599
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,285
Can you try to put the words
on top of this,

600
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,553
because it's really important

601
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,021
that you're going to be singing
during this part.

602
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:10,055
- Yes.
- Okay.

603
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,191
Five, six, seven, eight.

604
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,828

607
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,371
- Okay.

608
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,873
I just want you to be aware
of what your face looks like.

609
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,309
With the other people,
I can see their Cher-isms,

610
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,011
but with you, I saw almost none.

611
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,047
- No, I do not see Cher.

612
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,448
I see Dennis Rodman, girl.

613
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,484
Remember when Dennis Rodman had
that song out in the nineties?

614
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,185
That is exactly
what she sounds like.

615
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,320
It does not sound good.

616
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,524
- So we have Miz Cracker
as Comeback Cher.

617
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,259
You got your vocoder?
- Yep.

618
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,727
- Okay, let's try it.
- Vocoder.

619
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,097
My part of the Rusical
involves a joke about auto-tune,

620
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,099
so I have to sell it
with the prop.

621
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,402
- Now, if that microphone
leaves your mouth

622
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:57,770
while you're doing
this choreography,

623
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,171
they won't really hear you.

624
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,873
So... ♪ for something
I can believe ♪

625
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,107
then you can take it away.

626
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,175
But the microphone
has to be here

627
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,443
until the word "believe"
is over.

628
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,045
- Okay.

629
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,479
- Five, six, seven.

630
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:12,685
- ♪ Vocoder,
something I can believe ♪

631
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:13,986

- ♪ Technology ♪

633
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,922
- But don't put
the mic to your mouth

634
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,091
when you're saying that,
because you'll still vocoding.

635
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,794
- Yeah. I have to put the mic
towards my face,

636
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,128
and away, to the beat,

637
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,763
and know my words
and know the steps.

638
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,999

639
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,868

642
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:39,445
This is going to be great.

643
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,713
- This is the whole
selling point of your number.

644
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,981
If you put that microphone
to your mouth

645
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,516
while you're saying
"technology,"

646
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,051
it will ruin the whole joke.

647
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,519
It's supposed to be funny.

648
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,855
Cool?
- It will be funny.

649
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,724
Ugh.

650
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,325
- Asia, Oscar Cher.

651

- Yes.
- Okay... ♪ sing it ♪ this time.

Okay. I got zero Cher
from that performance.

661
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,249
So you have to do this as Cher.

662
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,650
That's the most important part.

663
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,452
- Are you supposed
to be doing Cher?

664
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,587
You sound like Madea.

665
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,155
This is not Tyler Perry
Presents.

666
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,090
This is Cher the Rusical.

667
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,592
Get it together.

668
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:27,993

- I need you to remember them.

673
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,338
- Eureka, you're going to do

00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,774

"Say My Name" thing.

00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:45,110
One, two, three, four,

676
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,979
So five, six, seven, eight.

677
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:50,949
And boom, two, three, four,

Oh, I'm so sorry.

682
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,529
Is it okay if we work on
choreography for a second

683
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,798
without me
trying to sing it, too?

684
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:07,800
I'm struggling because
my nerves are so bad

685
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,967
about this whole singing thing.

686
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,503
- Do it again, and can you
try to say the words?

687
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,539
- Um...

688
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,707
Is it okay if I don't?

689
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,411
- If every other person
has done it, you have to do it.

690
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,879
- Okay. I mean, I can try.

691
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,048

I think I'm going to have
to focus on the choreography

695
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,091
if that's okay.

696
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,795
- Everybody has to sing their
part while they're rehearsing,

697
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,198
and Eureka's trying
to get out of it.

698
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,100
Girl, why do you think
you're so special?

699
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,369
- Eureka, everyone else
has done their lyrics.

700
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,004
You have to try.
You can't give up.

701
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,673
- Okay.

702
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,275
- Ready?
- Oh...

703
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,878
Yeah.
- Five, six, seven, eight and...

704
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:56,715
- ♪ Got tired of [mumbles]
the same old movies ♪

705
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,984
- Stop.
- [mumbles]

706
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,487
- I can't hear her.

707
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,656
- Sorry, I'm freaking it out.

708
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,824
- Don't keep doubting yourself.

709
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,125
- [scoffs]

710
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,627
- Don't huff.
I didn't at y'all.

711
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,262
- Child.

712
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,964
- People are looking at me
like I just don't wanna sing,

713
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:12,965
but what they don't know is

714
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,234
as a kid I had
a traumatizing experience.

715
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,269
My dad wanted me to sing
for his friends,

716
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,871
and I was just too nervous
to do it.

717
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,372
He got really upset with me

718
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,908
and it ended up being
a physical altercation,

719
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:27,646
and it put in my head
this anxiety with singing.

720
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,282
- But we're running really low
on time, so please practice.

721
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,283
Do not give up.

722
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,885
- I'm not.

723
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,219
But for the competition,
I gotta suck it up

724
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,821
and I gotta figure it out.

725
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,657
I don't know how I'm going to,
but I'm gonna have to.

726
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,327
- When you're in doubt, I want
you to think what would Cher do?

727
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,402
- ♪ Don't turn your back
on Cher ♪

728
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,637
- Oh.
- Oh.

729
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:53,071
- Today we are
going to be live

730
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,007
singing Cher,
the Unauthorized Rusical.

731
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,375
- If I could turn back time,

732
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:59,244
I'd give myself another day
of rehearsal for this.

733
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,212
Bitch, I don't wanna do this.

734
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,547
I don't wanna do it
worth a damn.

735
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,649
- Aquaria, what are you doing?

736
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,284
- Are you migrating
back with us?

737
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,285
- Yeah.

738
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,553
- Well, welcome back
to civilization.

739
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,787
- I wanna be distracted
while I get ready now.

740
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,522
- Well, welcome back, my dear.

741
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,825
- I'm not necessarily
a very social person,

742
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,495
and I wanna build a stronger
relationship with the girls,

743
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,698
so I moved my makeup station
a little bit closer,

744
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,333
just so we can kiki
a little more.

745
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,738
- Hi, honey.

746
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,373
- Hey, baby.
How are you?

747
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,608
- Good, how you doing?

748
00:28:29,608 --> 00:28:31,410
- I'm terrified.
- Are you?

749
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,780
- I know as soon
as that light comes on me

750
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,882
and I see people sitting there,
I'm gonna like freak out

751
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,584
and wanna go
into the fetal position.

752
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,218
- Well, you know what?

753
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,888
- I live for you.

754
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,423
I'm glad you're still here.
- I know.

755
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,591
I mean, I'm pretty fantastic.

756
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,059
- But you're also
a pathological liar.

757
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,227
[both laugh]

758
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,898
I'm talking with Monet, and
she's been very understanding.

759
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,466
She's really trying
to lift me up.

760
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,469
And it's nice to just kind of
have a sister by your side.

761
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,542
- [imitating Cher]
Oh, oh, oh.

762
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,743
- Girl, I am telling you,

763
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,245
you sound like Mr. Ed
every time you do that.

764
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
- What do you sound like?

765
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,248
- I sound like I've won
more challenges than you.

766
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,351
- Aah! You right, bitch.

767
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,585
- Well, I'm gonna need
one of y'all to trip and fall

768
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,088
so I can win a challenge.
Yeah.

769
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,389
I think I need to like
take it up an octave,

770
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,491
'cause like I'm singing
like baritone Cher.

771
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,959
- Monet, come over here
and start getting ready,

772
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,661
'cause you need to take
your makeup up an octave.

773
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,130
[all laugh]
- Yes!

774
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,999
- No, get over here, bitch.

775
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,467
[laughs]

776
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,336
Come on, my little dark lady.

777
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,271
- That got racial?

778
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,843
- Girl, she's giving me

779
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,612
one of them masks from
"The Lion King" from Broadway.

780
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,414
- Did y'all go to Broadway shows
in New York growing up?

781
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,416
- I grew up in Seattle,
and we were poor as hell.

782
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,952
We were not going
to any damn show.

783
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,854
When I was growing up,

784
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:52,457
we were allowed one hour
of television a week.

785
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,094
We really didn't have access
to pop culture,

786
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,730
so that meant no toys
from the outside world.

787
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,965
Everything that we had

788
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,568
was made by my mother
or by my sister and I.

789
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,004
And that moral stance

790
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:09,007
was helped by the fact that
we were desperately poor.

791
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,442
Really recently

792
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,810
when my mom started
talking about the shiners,

793
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,145
which are the cans

794
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:15,614
that you get really cheap
from the grocery store

795
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,649
because the labels came off,
you don't know what's inside.

796
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,951
It could be any fucking thing,

797
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,586
and you're like,
we're gonna find out today

798
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,523
if dinner is food
or dinner is a condiment.

799
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,458
Sometimes when
we would go to school,

800
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:28,393
we just had lunch boxes
with no food in them.

801
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,028
- What?
- We were very, very poor.

802
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,731
My mom--my mom
wanted us to be sure

803
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,300
to feel like we
looked like everyone else,

804
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,835
so we still had lunch boxes
and everything.

805
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,537
But there just wasn't always
food in them.

806
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:42,474
We were just desperate.

807
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,643
It was a really weird life.

808
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,845
But it made me
super creative, so...

809
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,417
- What you up to?

810
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,486
- Are you pressed for time?

811
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:57,055
- I'm not pressed for time.

812
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,490
Where we going?

813
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,425
- I want to talk
to The Vixen privately.

814
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,761
I want to give her some insight

815
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,062
in the terms
of her relationships

816
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,130
with some of the other queens.

817
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,965
I want to ask you a question.

818
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,167
Do you think
there's something we can do

819
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,837
to keep from like situations
we had last week on "Untucked"

820
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:12,904
with like Eureka?

821
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,073
- I do not let shit fly.

822
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,008
- Have you ev--

823
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,578
Something you said
a couple weeks ago

824
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,846
really struck a nerve with me.

825
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,482
- Yeah.

826
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,519
- Yeah.
- Maybe self-consciously

827
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,521
where you might go
to a place of anger

828
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,457
because Eureka
is a representation

829
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:36,528
of a lot of what you don't like
in the community.

830
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:40,332
I think The Vixen suffers
from what we call in Texas

831
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,567
the Angry Black Woman Syndrome.

832
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,470
Every time in The Vixen's life

833
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,706
that she's had to take
a back seat to someone

834
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,474
that had more privilege
than her,

835
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,978
all of that anger
has been bottled up,

836
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:54,946
and it is now directed
towards Eureka.

837
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,849
Is Vixen handling it
the wrong way? Yes.

838
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,086
Do I understand where
The Vixen is coming from?

839
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,721
Absolutely.

840
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,489
Whatever happens
between you and her,

841
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,292
I want to make sure it's
because of Eureka specifically

842
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,729
and not something bigger than us

843
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,330
that we really have
no control over.

844
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,599
Okay, nobody takes
your feelings from you

845
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,234
and tell you your feeling's
not valid.

846
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,804
But make sure you understand
why you're angry

847
00:32:18,804 --> 00:32:19,905
and what you're angry at.

848
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,507
- But the thing is
in a competition,

849
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,610
when somebody's blissfully
just sliding through,

850
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,913
it is very stressful.

851
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:28,980
- I'm with you.
I'm with you.

852
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,182
But what's--

853
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,584
- Yeah.

854
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,586
- And strength
doesn't have to be vocal.

855
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,189
The only people
that need to know you're strong

856
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39,457
are you and them judges
out there.

857
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,061
I see the hurt
in The Vixen's face,

858
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:45,197
and I have goosebumps
talking about this

859
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:49,034
because it is such
a real problem and an issue.

860
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:52,504
The Vixen is still that kid
struggling to prove

861
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:57,275
that she's worthy of being heard
and being loved.

862
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,011
And I want you to...

863
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,379
You might be mad at me
when I say this,

864
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:04,549
but I want you
to stop lying to yourself

865
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,952
that you don't care
what people think about you.

866
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,454
Sometimes to be strong

I am serving Barbie

were made of rhinestones.

- True.
- You're absolutely right.

- I know the other girls
are going to think of glitter

1152
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,856
as a craft project.

1153
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,326
My glitter
is a little bit crass,

1154
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:31,495
a little bit comedy,
a little bit drama.

1155
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,164
It's my most spectacular look.

I love the harem pant detail.

- Yeah, it felt very
Beverly Hills to me.

1166
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,225
A little like old school
Joan Rivers on the Tonight Show.

1167
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:02,994
You're too young
to know what that is.

the most spot on Cher voice.

00:46:07,999 --> 00:46:09,967
You embodied her.

1171
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,302
You even got the vibrato right.

and you really set the tone.

1175
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,275
- Yeah, you set the bar
very, very high.

1176
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,044
It was such
a great impersonation.

1177

- Tonight is a great night

1178
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,548
- Thank you so much.

1179
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,485
- Up next, Monet X Change.

1180
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,153
- Tonight on the runway,
the makeup is fun.

1181
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,189
I love that headpiece
with those big earrings.

1182
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,491
But part of the illusion
is gone.

1183
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:35,026
We see tape.

1184
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:36,360
- I know, girl.

1185
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,530
- Yeah, with a glitterific
challenge, I just want more.

1186
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,831
When you saw it close up,

1187
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,434
you're like, oh, I can see
like your nipple cover,

1188
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,236
and then there's some tape
on the side.

1189
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,504
It wasn't top notch.

1190
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:48,439
- But I loved your Cher.

1191
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:49,940
It was one of my favorites.

1192
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,375
Cher, to me, is about attitude,

1193
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,377
and your attitude's
exactly right.

1194
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,880
- And it really was like
you got her at her core.

1195
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,082
I just thought it was also
spot on and perfect.

1196
00:46:58,082 --> 00:46:59,383
I loved it.

1197
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,285
- Thank you, Monet.
- Thank you, Ru.

1198
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:04,021
- Up next, The Vixen.

1199
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,423
- I really like
this runway look.

1200
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,458
I love the explosion of color.

1201
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,693
- I think your hair is fun.

1202
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,094
It's very Thank God It's Friday,
if you guys remember.

1203
00:47:10,094 --> 00:47:11,362
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1204
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,164
It's not my favorite,
but I think it's fun.

1205
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,265
- When it comes
to the Cher part,

1206
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,433
it was a good performance.

1207
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:18,035
It just didn't feel
very Cher to me.

1208
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:21,772
- I felt no Cher at all.

1209
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,341
- My look, that specific look,

1210
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,444
is pulled from her performance
with the Jackson Five.

1211
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:27,344
- The Jacksons, yeah.

1212
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,479
- Having a Cher reference

1213
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:31,649
that wasn't like
as instantly recognizable,

1214
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,551
I was very worried about.

1215
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:36,487
- Well, that look is
instantly recognizable to me

1216
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,155
and to long-time Cher fans.

1217
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,225
It's an iconic moment when she
joined the Jacksons on her show.

1218
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,361
- With the hair that she had
in that performance,

1219
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:44,862
you couldn't do one of those.

1220
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,331
- There's still like she has
body movements that she does

1221
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,866
that are really Cher.

1222
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,368
Even when her hair was like
that, she would still do them.

1223
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:54,371
- Up next, our Lord
and Savior Aquaria.

1224
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,339
- This is so gorgeous.

1225
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,341
The details, the construction,
the makeup,

1226
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:00,044
and those panels
that are covering your eyes.

1227
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,712
That looks like
it would be a costume

1228
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,614
that razzle dazzled
"Jesus Christ Superstar."

1229
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:05,282
- Any time you can make
Catholicism sexy,

1230
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,317
I'm all for it.

1231
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:07,451
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

1232
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,653
- Praise the Lord.
- With your Cher,

1233
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,655
I didn't really get Cher
from it.

1234
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,657
What I got was Madonna
at the Brit awards

1235
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,059
or something like that.

1236
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,260
- I thought
you were really funny.

1237
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,529
You had the joke about
the clothes being cheap,

1238
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,397
and that felt very Cher to me.

1239
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,333
- Well, during the runthrough,

1240
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,102
I was having a lot of issues
with the cape.

1241
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,338
And I was like, to hell with
this chickenshit, you know.

1242
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:30,207
And Todrick loved it,
so thanks for noticing.

1243
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,375
[all laugh]

1244
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,878
- [imitating Cher] And that's
called showbiz, kids.

1245
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,279
[all laugh]

1246
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,047
Thanks, Aquaria.
- Thank you, RuPaul.

1247
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,717
- Up next, Asia O'Hara.

1248
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:43,053
- This look, I think, is so fun
and dare I say bold.

1249
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,421
Bold to come out
as a sexy clown.

1250
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,457
- The only part that
I don't love are the shoes,

1251
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:48,626
because it goes sparkle,
sparkle, sparkle, suede.

1252
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,895
- Let's talk about your Cher.

1253
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:53,664
I wasn't getting
"Moonstruck" era Cher.

1254
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:54,932
- Finally!

1255
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,634
- And there were like
several iconic bits

1256
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,636
that you just
weren't selling for me.

1257
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,704
- That was
a really pivotal role.

1258
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,339
She was, you know,
snap out of it.

1259
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,375
She was the--
that was the New York Cher,

1260
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,645
and it kind of was missing.

1261
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:10,114
- Up next, Eureka.

1262
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,016
- This runway look
I think is gorgeous.

1263
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,851
The embellishment with
the sparkles in the hair.

1264
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:15,886
Even the nails and the rings.

1265
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,488
It's just great attention
to detail.

1266
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:20,658
- I don't, however, love
the random stripes on your face

1267
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,394
because it kind of almost
wasn't necessary.

1268
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:26,397
- I liked the Cher
because it made me laugh.

1269
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:27,765
I thought it was bold.

1270
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,000
- But when you first came out,
you were a little temporary.

1271
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,436
You got there towards
the end of the song,

1272
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,405
and then you really went for it.

1273
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,107
But it kind of was a, you know,
a grower, not a shower.

1274
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:39,710
- Are you not super confident,
like, live singing?

1275
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,714
- Honestly,
I have a really crazy fear

1276
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,349
of singing in front of people.

1277
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,352
And it took a lot for me to
get to that comfortable place,

1278
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,387
so I'm just proud of myself.

1279
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,323
- Yeah, you got other things
to worry about.

1280
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,258
- Right, like cholesterol.

1281
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,160
[all laugh]

1282
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,163
- [laughs]
Thank you, Eureka.

1283
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:00,431
- Thank you all.

1284
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,333
- Next up, Miz Cracker.

1285
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,036
- This look is so beautiful
and scary,

1286
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,405
it's like very glamorous
performance art.

1287
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:09,506
- Yeah, this to me

1288
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,276
is very like McQueen
meets Phantom of the Opera.

1289
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:14,078
- I would have liked
to have seen a lash on that eye,

1290
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:17,348
but other than that,
I think it's really glamorous,

1291
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,183
and I think you look
really different

1292
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,551
to anything you've done before.

1293
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:21,852
- Your Cher, that was tricky,

1294
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,155
because the vocoder thing,
it didn't bowl me over,

1295
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,325
but I think you pulled it off.

1296
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:31,795
- There was so much
over Cher stuff going on

1297
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,264
that you took it
to the opposite end,

1298
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:36,100
where ♪ everything had her ♪

1299
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,068
and you couldn't
really understand it.

1300
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,603
- You nailed the moments
that we needed to get.

1301
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,738
You nailed the comedy.

1302
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,574
And you finished off
the whole number very strong.

1303
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:46,277
- All right, thank you, ladies.

1304
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:48,279
While you untuck,

1305
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:49,980
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1306
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,951
All right. Now just between
us squirrel-friends,

1307
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:56,420
I want to know what you think.

1308
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,521
Kameron Michaels.

1309
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,456
- I thought she was
one of the top of the night

1310
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,925
in both categories.

1311
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,192
- Yes.
She had to open the show.

1312
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,495
That's always a tough job,
and she nailed it.

1313
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:07,932
- The Cher voice, I thought
that was really well done.

1314
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:10,734
- We had the look of Cher,
the makeup of Cher, the sound.

1315
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,536
- She had a great night.

1316
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,405
- Monet X Change.

1317
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,240
- That was my favorite Cher.
It was funny.

1318
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,574
It was very confident.

1319
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,910
- That performance was
very committed to that vibe,

1320
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,278
that Cher vibe.

1321
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,213
- That's my favorite Cher-a.

1322
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,916
I love the 1970s--

1323
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,451
- I think you need Cher-apy.

1324
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,452
[all laugh]

1325
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,720
- She really embodied Cher.

1326
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,121
That's hard to do

1327
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,290
when you don't really
look like Cher necessarily.

1328
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,658
Necess-Cher-ily.
- Uh-huh.

1329
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,894
- [laughs] The Vixen.

1330
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:38,662
- In terms of the Cher,
I wasn't feeling it.

1331
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:39,797
I didn't see it.

1332
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,799
- Out of all the performances,

1333
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,767
I felt like she had
the least amount of Cher.

1334
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,502
It was probably
the worst for me.

1335
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,172
- That wasn't my worst Cher
for me.

1336
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,307
I thought the choreography
was well executed.

1337
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,443
I'm giving her a lifeline
with her dancing.

1338
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,744
- I thought the biggest problem

1339
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:57,614
was that she was so disconnected
from the audience.

1340
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,084
You could see that she was
working it out in her head,

1341
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:02,353
but she didn't really let us,
the audience,

1342
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,721
in on the performance.

1343
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:05,489
Aquaria.

1344
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,657
- The Cher wasn't that Cher-y.

1345
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,158
- She nailed her choreography.

1346
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:09,326
I just wish there was more Cher.

1347
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:12,496
- Yeah, maybe not
the best of the night,

1348
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,999
but I like that she took
something that was a negative

1349
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,000
and made it into a positive.

1350
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,568
She had a costume

1351
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:18,836
that was kind of
a little bit cumbersome,

1352
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,538
and then she worked it
into a funny line

1353
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:22,940
where she said, oh, I'm tired
of these cheap clothes.

1354
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,274
- I like that she also knew

1355
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:27,211
to tell us the story of
about how that was her line.

1356
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:29,546
I thought that was
pretty savvy, actually.

1357
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,448
- I really enjoyed
her Cher performance

1358
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,450
because it was captivating.

1359
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:34,451
Say during Vixen's performance,

1360
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,452
it gave me an opportunity

1361
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,554
to look at the dancers' asses.

1362
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,323
- Oh, my God.

1363
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,591
- Asia O'Hara.

1364
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,159
- It was during this number

1365
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,762
that I checked out
the dancers' asses.

1366
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,830
- You guys were checking out
the dancers' asses.

1367
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,500
I actually left, had a whole
Grindr hookup, and came back.

1368
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,001
[all laugh]

1369
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,604
- Definitely seemed
the least prepared.

1370
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:56,774
- When she came out as Cher,
I was just befuddled.

1371
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:58,409
I was "Moonstruck," if you will.

1372
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,678
- This was not her strong suit,
like singing and dancing.

1373
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,013
When she was performing,

1374
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,348
it looked like she was
thinking more about like,

1375
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,682
okay, what comes next?

1376
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,951
- She is a seasoned queen,

1377
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:11,021
and I'm surprised
at this misstep.

1378
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,489
Eureka.

1379
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,826
- Only half of her Cher
was kind of good.

1380
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:17,561
- Half a Cher?
- Half a Cher.

1381
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,329
- She came out,
she was a little temporary.

1382
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,231
- You said temporary.
Did you mean tentative?

1383
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,567
- That, too, but temporary means
it wasn't gonna be forever.

1384
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,169
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

1385
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:26,870
- Yeah, I was just
sort of taken aback

1386
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,405
by her stage presence
in general,

1387
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,541
because she really like
locks eyes with you

1388
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,543
and like takes
a piece of your soul.

1389
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,677
- My wallet is missing.

1390
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,380
- Wait a second.
So is my kidney.

1391
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,182
- I enjoyed her Cher,

1392
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,683
and I didn't mind the temporary
nature of her performance.

1393
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:43,353
- Shut up.
[all laugh]

1394
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,322
- Miz Cracker.

1395
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,623
- The Cher,
it didn't necessarily

1396
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,059
feel like Cher to me,
if I'm being totally honest.

1397
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,428
- Yeah.
- But, you know, it was okay.

1398
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,996
- It's a bit of
a mush-mouth situation.

1399
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,666
I couldn't really understand
what she was saying.

1400
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,935
- I think part of that was
the gag with the auto-tune.

1401
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,570
I really like Miz Cracker.

1402
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,004
She's always
a little bit whacky,

1403
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:03,474
and I thought that made
for a good performance.

1404
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:05,509
Can we critique
the dancers now?

1405
00:54:05,509 --> 00:54:06,510
[all laugh]

1406
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,678
- Silence.

1407
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:10,147
I've made my decision.

1408
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:11,482
Bring back my girls.

1409
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,650
- Welcome back, ladies.

1410
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,853
I've made some decisions.

1411
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:23,093
- Monet X Change, you were
truly great singing live,

1412
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:28,332
but your glitter bodysuit
came off as pre-taped.

1413
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:31,502
You're safe.

1414
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:38,942
Kameron Michaels, bang, bang.

1415
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,913
This week
you hit the bull's eye.

1416
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,851
Con-drag-ulations, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.

1417
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,119
[cheers and applause]

1418
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,823
- You've won
a luxury VIP get-away

1419
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:55,859
at the Sofitel Los Angeles.

1420
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,394
- Thank you.

1421
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:59,496
- You may step
to the back of the stage.

1422
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,435
- Eureka, you're safe.

1423
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,436
- Thank you.

1424
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:12,342
- Asia O'Hara, we were down
with your glitter clown,

1425
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:17,481
but your movie star Cher
was not Oscar worthy.

1426
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:21,151
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.

1427
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,055
- Miz Cracker...

1428
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:28,825
You're safe.

1429
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,862
You may join the other girls.

1430
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:33,096
- Thank you, Ru.

1431
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:39,770
- The Vixen.
Your glitterific was terrific,

1432
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,539
but your Cher
didn't top the charts.

1433
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:47,444
Aquaria, on the runway,

1434
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:50,380
your glitter look
was immaculate,

1435
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,517
but your disco Cher
didn't take me home.

1436
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,720
The Vixen.

1437
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:02,526
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1438
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,364
Aquaria, you're safe.
You may join the other girls.

1439
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:12,469
Two queens stand before me.

1440
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:17,674
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1441
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:21,311
and save yourself
from elimination.

1442
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:25,649
The time has come...

1443
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:28,118

1445
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,427
- The Vixen and I
have really connected this week,

1446
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,430
but I'm very confident
in my ability

1447
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,366
to outperform any of these hos.

1448
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:47,504
- Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

1449
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:51,108
- We're going to dance
and have some fun, fun, fun.

But you know what?

00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,554
I don't need a crown
to know that I'm a queen.
