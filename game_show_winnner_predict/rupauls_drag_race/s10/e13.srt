1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,904
- Tonight, from the Ace Theater
in downtown Los Angeles,

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:07,374
it's "RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 10 Reunited."

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,910
All the queens
have gathered to catch up.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,345
- Vanjie.
- Vanjie.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,780
- Vanjie
is a multipurpose thing.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,982
- It's like gay "aloha" now.

7
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,717
It's like "hello," "goodbye,"
and "thank you."

8
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,419
[all laugh]
- Watch unseen moments.

9
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,754
- You are so hot.

10
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,456
- Wow. I changed my mind.

11
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:23,957
Your panel was great.

12
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,660
[all laugh]
- And break it down.

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,961
- When you gonna find out

14
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,863
when to shut
the fuck up sometime?

15
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,466
- You made a mistake, fine.

16
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,134
Not next time, bitch.

17
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,737
- Honey, things
are about to get real.

18
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,839
- It feels like you don't care.
That's what it is.

19
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,774
- You said yourself
that you were attacking me.

20
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,409
- No, I never said "attack,"
darling.

21
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,677
- There's a camera.
That's what happened.

22
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,846
- There is a camera,
and I never said "attack."

23
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:46,847
- So it is my fault?

24
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,883
- It's a reunion
unlike any other.

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,418
- Nobody wanted
to fucking help her.

26
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,853
- Look at me, look at me,
goddamn it.

27
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,089
I come from the same goddamn
place she comes from.

Now, if you think you know
everything about Season 10,

00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,702
child, you got
another thing coming.

46
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,971
Ladies, are you ready

00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,440
the whole T,
and nothing but the T?

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,241
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

49
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,244
Now, "Drag Race"
trends on social media

50
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,648
across these United States
and around the world.

51
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,283
#DragRace.

52
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:01,355
But one Season 10 queen
was a true viral sensation.

53
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,389
Take a look.

54
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,558
Sashay away.

55
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,892
- Miss Vanjie.

56
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,128
Miss Vanjie.

57
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,431
Miss Vanjie.

58
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,301
- Bye, girl.
- Work, sister!

59
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,741
- Miss Vanjie.
- [stifles laugh]

60
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,909
- Vanjie.
- Vanjie.

61
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,811
- Vanjie.
- Vanjie.

62
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,812
- Vanjie.

63
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,014
- Vanjie?
- Vanjie!

64
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,448
- Vanjie!
- Vanjie!

65
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,616
- Miss Vanjie.

66
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,285
- [laughs] Don't you
start with me, Michelle.

67
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,287
Vanjie.
- [laughs]

68
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,256
- Vanjie.
- Miss Vanjie.

69
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,558
- [laughs]

70
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,261
- Miss Vanjie.
- Yes, mama!

71
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,698
- Miss Vanjie.
- Miss Vanjie.

72
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,901
- Miss Vanjie.
- [laughs]

73
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,937
- Miss Vanjie.

74
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,177
[cheers and applause]

75
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,779
- Oh, my goodness.

76
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,682
Now, Vanjie, what were you
thinking when you were exiting?

77
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,984
What was going on in your head?

78
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,686
- Truth be told, girl,

79
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,255
in my head
I was not gonna go home,

80
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,990
so I did not prepare
no message to leave.

81
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,226
- Okay. Had you ever used
"Vanjie" before

82
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,429
to exit or to say hello or--

83
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,365
- Right. Well, "Vanjie"
is a multipurpose thing.

84
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,399
You could use it for whatever.

85
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,101
- It's like gay "aloha" now.

86
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,036
It's like "hello," "goodbye,"
and "thank you."

87
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,206
- People even sent me videos
of them intercoursing,

88
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,707
and it said,
"I'm getting Vanjied."

89
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,143
- "Intercoursing?"
Is that what you said?

90
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,812
- Intercoursing on Instagram.
- Intercoursing?

91
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,747
- Yeah. So now I've been scared
to open up my DMs.

92
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,283
But they sent me one that says,
"I'm getting Vanjied."

93
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,018
[all laugh]

94
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,920
- So where has this taken you?

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,522
Have you traveled the world?
Have you made lots of money?

96
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,723
- Well, originally I was like,

97
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,859
well, I need to get
all my bookings quick.

98
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,993
- Wait, get the bookings quick

99
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,962
because you thought
you would be forgotten?

100
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,031
- Right, because
I got sent home first.

101
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,233
So I was like, girl,
this is my little 15.

102
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,303
So take your 15
and act like it's, you know,

103
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,637
you was there the whole time.

104
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,039
So when the promos
and everything came out,

105
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,041
I said, "Yeah, I'm in the show.
Do you want to book me?"

106
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,977
Like I didn't--you know,
there was no ifs, ands, or buts.

107
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,145
I said, "I'll be there."
- Right.

108
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,413
So where were you

109
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,616
when you realized this thing
had really blown up?

110
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,551
- I was in Denver, Colorado
with Dusty.

111
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,153
We were doing a booking.

112
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:16,022
- The audience just
started going "Vanjie!"

113
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,458
The cookies they threw at her
on the stage.

114
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,727
- Yeah!
- Chips Ahoy.

115
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,696
- Yeah, I was ducking
and dodging the cookies.

116
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,131
But I felt the love

117
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,333
even though I felt like they
might be trying to attack me.

118
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,069
But it was--
I knew it was all with love.

119
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,371
- I heard you met Lil' Kim.

120
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,773
- Yeah.
Lil' Kim came up to me

121
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,207
and said,
"Miss, Vanjie, Miss Vanjie,

122
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,408
I know who you are."

123
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,544
I know my face hit the ground.

124
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,545
I'm trying to come out
with a single with her,

125
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,213
'cause if we come out
with one,

126
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,715
it's gonna be a shutdown.

127
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,049
And they don't even want us
to do a video together

128
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,217
'cause that--
we really gonna be--

129
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,119
I'm gonna go viral again
for the wrong reasons.

130
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,054
- Yes!
- Now, Kalorie,

131
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,557
Kalorie, you were standing
right next to her

132
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,425
when this whole sensation
started.

133
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,962
You claim responsibility for
the whole Vanjie phenomenon.

134
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,966
- Oh, honey, I own 20%
of this company, okay?

135
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,436
- I see. So had you
not sent her home,

136
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,772
the Vanjie thing
would have never happened.

137
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,041
- Exactly. Exactly.
- Right. Thank you, Kalorie.

138
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,176
- I love Vanjie.

139
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,343
It was heartbreaking
to send her,

140
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,312
but I couldn't be more happy
for her success.

141
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,413
- Yeah. Well, Vanjie,

142
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,782
you have given everyone
around the world

143
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,417
so much to be excited about,

144
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,386
and I have
a very special message

145
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,522
to your drag mother,
Alexis Mateo.

146
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,024
Bam!

147
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,159
- Nice, girl.
[cheers and applause]

148
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,228
- Next week at the grand finale,

149
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:32,432
a lip sync smackdown will
determine who wins the crown,

150
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,768
but all season long,
our queens delivered

151
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:39,072
some of the most epic lip syncs
in "Drag Race" herstory.

152
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,143
Let's start with Monet X Change
and Dusty Ray Bottoms.

153
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:46,846
- ♪ Sexy and hotter,
let's shut it down ♪

154
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,481
- Come on.

155
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,417
- ♪ Pound the alarm ♪

156
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,418
[cheers and applause]

157
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,353
- ♪ Pound the alarm ♪

158
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,688
- Oh, my goodness.

159
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,623
Oh, my goodness.

160
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,525
Dusty, what was going through
your mind at that time?

161
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,794
- Going into this lip sync
knowing that Nicki Minaj

162
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,330
is something that
is in Monet's wheelhouse

163
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,299
that she does maybe seven,
eight times a week,

164
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,034
was very intimidating.

165
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,604
I mean, I do, like,
weird musical theater

166
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:13,073
and punk rock
and classic rock music.

167
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,709
So I stood up all night
memorizing that rap,

168
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,743
and you know what?

169
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,045
I gave it everything
I had that day.

170
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:24,484
- Now, Monet, your fake
death drop was legendary.

171
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,086
Did you know you were
gonna do that fake out?

172
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,154
- I did not, I did not.
- It was just in the moment.

173
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,189
- It was just in the moment.

174
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,223
I was like,
who knows what Dusty--

175
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,424
Dusty might do
some crazy ass shit

176
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,093
and send my raggedy ass home.

177
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,630
And I'd have to roll my three
broken suitcases across LAX,

178
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,899
so I was like, I need
to really turn it out

179
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,868
and do something crazy
to make RuPaul laugh.

180
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,703
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

181
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,805
Up next, Monique
versus The Vixen

182
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,408
when they cut to the feeling.

183
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,710
- Really?
Didn't we watch this already?

184
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,813
- ♪ I can't make it stop ♪

185
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,048
♪ Give me all you got ♪

186
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,116
- She don't know the words.

187
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:59,619
- ♪ I wanna cut to the feeling ♪

188
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,122
- Girl, why didn't you know
your words?

189
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,391
- 'Cause I stayed up
working on that damn costume.

190
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,525
- On that costume right there.
- That costume.

191
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,161
- Was the outfit worth not--

192
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,096
- Clearly it was not.

193
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,266
- So in that moment, what
was going through your head?

194
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,935
- The hardest thing on
"Drag Race" is how you go home.

195
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,804
- Right.
- To get to this competition

196
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:22,008
and then to eff up
the very thing that you do,

197
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,412
how you pay your bills,
and I tried to do a cartwheel,

198
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,080
and then it was like,
oh, don't kick her,

199
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,715
so let's pull those legs in.

200
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,083
- Yeah, but your wig
fell off, too.

201
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,519
- That--hey.

202
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,387
- Have you had a wig fall off
in a performance before?

203
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,955
- Multiple times.

204
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,091
- Multiple times?
- Multiple times.

205
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,492
- But it doesn't bother you?

206
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,227
- To be perfectly honest,
America--camera man, zoom in.

207
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,130
- This bitch is forever
editing and directing

208
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,765
this motherfucking show.

209
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,101
- Did you keep going?
America saw me, I kept going.

210
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,703
Was the song over? No.

211
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,538
[all laugh]

212
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,674
- Next, Eureka
versus Kameron Michaels,

213
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:58,144
which ended
in a rare double save.

214
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,015
- ♪ Never knew I had
such a lesson to learn ♪

215
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:05,118
♪ I'm feeling good
from my head to my shoes ♪

216
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,555
♪ Know where I'm going
and I know what to do ♪

217
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,857
[cheers and applause]

218
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,828
- Oh, my goodness.

219
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:20,066
- Ladies, that is what you call
a lip sync for your life,

220
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,836
and that is why
no one is going home tonight.

221
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,073
Oh, my goodness.

222
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,742
Eureka, what was that moment
like for you?

223
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,777
- The moment when you gagged
the fudge outta me?

224
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,213
- Uh-huh.
- That was scary as hell.

225
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,781
In that moment,
I was like, girl,

226
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,750
I gotta show the judges that
I'm not gonna fuck up again,

227
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,685
and I can't and had
to get out of my head

228
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,387
and just be like, you can do it.

229
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,454
- So you got a new attitude
after that?

230
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,722
- Baby, I had a whole new

231
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,158
motherfucking attitude
after that.

232
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,094
- Aquaria, you were upset
that there was a double save

233
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,064
because you felt that bitches
need to be peeling off

234
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,033
to make more room
for your ascendance.

235
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,302
- Well, I definitely--
[all laugh]

236
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,172
As far as I know
like there's never been

237
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,175
like two double saves
in a season before,

238
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,245
so I'm like, well, crap,
what if, you know,

239
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,815
this was a week I thought I was
going to do poorly potentially.

240
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,651
What if next week is the week
that I actually do poorly,

241
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,988
and, you know, it's me against
someone's who's turning it out

242
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,357
just a little bit more than me
and now Aquaria's time.

243
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,592
- We've already used
the double save. Yeah, yeah.

244
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,628
I want to talk about
another lip sync right now.

245
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,930
This one
is between nasty girls

246
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,666
Kameron Michaels
and Miz Cracker.

247
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,601
- Disgusting girls.
- Take a look.

248
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,871
- ♪ Dance, nasty girls, dance ♪

249
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,206
- ♪ Everybody ♪

250
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,041
♪ Uh, it's time to jam ♪

251
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,876
- Hey, bitch!

252
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,413
- ♪ Nasty girls,
dance, dance, dance ♪

253
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,984
- Kameron, was this a pivotal
moment for you, this lip sync?

254
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,985
- I think you could
see it on my face

255
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,153
that I was very surprised.

256
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,555
- 'Cause most girls
don't get past three.

257
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,857
- Most girls
do not get the third one,

258
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,892
and at the same time,
I'm a performer,

259
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,828
and that's what I do best,
and for me to give up,

260
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,729
it wouldn't be
who I am as a person.

261
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,433
- For people my age, we know
that song is a super sexy song,

262
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,703
and you chose to do it
as a super sexy song.

263
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,272
And you chose to do it
as a comedic song.

264
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,607
- Oh, absolutely.

265
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,808
- Do you regret doing that?
- No.

266
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:09,876
- Not at all?

267
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,878
- Because I have found
when I perform

268
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,414
that when I try to be sexy
and serious,

269
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,016
it looks even more ridiculous.

270
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,018
I am built like R2D2.

271
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,887
I just have--I'm like
a trash can on wheels.

272
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,355
My legs are this long.

273
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,325
If I tried to do what Kameron
did, I would've lost harder.

274
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,426
Do you know what I mean?

275
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,560
- Yeah. Well, you made it
to the top five.

276
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,761
- Dammit.
- Dammit.

277
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,864
- Yes. Yes.
- Bottom 10, everybody.

278
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,232
I'm fine with that.

279
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,034
- Now, after the break,
we'll talk to The Vixen

280
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,437
about her most
confrontational moments.

281
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,438
Stay tuned.

282
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,975
Welcome back.

283
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,910
"Drag Race" is a microcosm

284
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,146
of what's going on
in the world today,

285
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,015
and when people
don't see eye to eye,

286
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,984
things can get real.

287
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,687
Now, The Vixen,
you said you came to fight,

288
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,022
and fight you did.

289
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,323
Let's take a look.

290
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,858
- Someone brought up the fact

291
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:03,596
that Cracker and my face
looked very similar today,

292
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,433
may have had some situations
like that in the past.

293
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,503
Like, it doesn't bother me,
it's not like--

294
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,739
- No, too vague.
So what happened was--

295
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,474
- Yes!
- Oh!

296
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,543
- She said--
- This is what happened.

297
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,611
- No. Excuse me,
this is what happened.

298
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,847
- I obvious--well,
I kind of felt like--

299
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,348
- Excuse me.
- No, this is what happened.

300
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,651
We all know that these two
heifers look alike.

301
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,654
You was bothered that she was
doing the same face as you.

302
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,556
You was mad. Be mad to her face.

303
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,357
- Vixen, shut the fuck up.

304
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,625
This is what had happened.

305
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,328
You interjected and you got
everything all fired up.

306
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,297
- So why did it take me speaking
up right now for you to say it?

307
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,965
- I guess you did need
your moment to pop off,

308
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,934
'cause you're not gonna
have too many more.

309
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,536
[all laugh]
- Ooh! Ooh!

310
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,039
I am over it.

311
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,074
This is none of The Vixen's
fucking business.

312
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,843
- You done ran across
the whole room, girl.

313
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,179
Scared. Sad.

314
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,016
- Do you regret bringing that
up, that whole confrontation?

315
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,151
- No, absolutely not.

316
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,887
In "Untucked,"
the girls had convinced me

317
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,923
to believe that Cracker
was this monster--

318
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,592
- Okay, don't say "the girls."
Don't say "the girls."

319
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,626
- Okay.
- That's too vague.

320
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,927
- Even better. Even better.

321
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,264
At the time, Monet and Aquaria
had convinced me

322
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,733
to believe that Cracker

323
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,436
had worked her way
into this competition--

324
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,537
- Monét convinced you

325
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,939
that Cracker
worked her way into what?

326
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,207
Please be clear,

327
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,776
because that was never
my point of view on that.

328
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,511
I was very vocal in saying
that I never felt

329
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,847
that Cracker faked her way
to "Drag Race,"

330
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,282
because I knew that Cracker
was a very successful queen

331
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,651
in New York City,
and Cracker is fucking fierce.

332
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,720
I want to make that very clear.

333
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,788
- So as it showed in television,
because it did air,

334
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:41,361
Monet and Aquaria said that this
has been going on for years.

335
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:45,231
So based on what Monet
and Aquaria said,

336
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,535
I felt that Cracker had faked
her way into the competition.

337
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,772
So when Aquaria wasn't
copping up to what she said,

338
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,607
I felt bad
because now I believed

339
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,042
all these bad things about her,

340
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,210
and now she's backing away
from the story.

341
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,278
- But why did you bring it up?

342
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,346
Were you trying to stir the pot

343
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,015
to sort of throw them
off their game?

344
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,416
- Not at all.

345
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,452
I kind of felt like, girl,
I need to tell you the truth.

346
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,920
- Mm-hmm. So, Aquaria,
why did you run away?

347
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,924
- I realized that I wouldn't be
able to say what I meant to say.

348
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,727
I was very overwhelmed,
and I didn't have the words

349
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,563
to describe that
I didn't mean to be vague

350
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,499
just to bullshit Miz Cracker.

351
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,933
This was something

352
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,203
that I didn't want to disrespect
Miz Cracker with to her face,

353
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,304
and I can understand--

354
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,673
- Only behind my back.

355
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,675
[laughs]
- No, no, no.

356
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,143
I think--I think--
I can see why--

357
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,377
- That is the truth.

358
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,246
- How casually I said it
behind her back.

359
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,981
- Facts are facts.

360
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,683
- How I wanted
to take care of it

361
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,284
in front of her face.

362
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,554
- Did you ultimately have that
conversation with Miz Cracker?

363
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,755
- We did at the end of the day

364
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,590
after we were done
getting out of drag.

365
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,460
Really quickly,
I was like, that was a lot.

366
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,829
Let's just move on.

367
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,432
You be
the best Cracker you can be,

368
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,034
I'll be the best Aquaria
I can be, and--

369
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,136
- Aquaria and I
are like real sisters

370
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,706
in that we resent each other.
[all laugh]

371
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,141
- I think what we agreed
was that was ugly.

372
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,044
And, you know, we didn't
go back and heal things

373
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,247
or sort things out
or Vixen our positions,

374
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,950
but--do you know
what I mean?

375
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,719
- Oh, is "Vixen"
an adjective like "Vanjie?"

376
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,487
- Yes.
- Yeah.

377
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,955
- Get the popcorn.

378
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,324
- Like, if somebody doesn't
give me everything in my order

379
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,492
when I open the bag, I'm like,

380
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,827
I'm about to go back
and Vixen this bitch,

381
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,663
do you know what I mean?
[all laugh]

382
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:24,797
So we didn't Vixen it out,

383
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,433
but we, you know,
we agreed that that--

384
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,436
we did not want this
to be a part of our story.

385
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,438
- Sure. Now, Aquaria
wasn't the only one

386
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,140
who poked the bear.

387
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,508
Let's take a look at this.

388
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,809
- Do y'all hear me?

389
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,211
- I'm getting tired
of hearing you talk, honestly.

390
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,345
Can I go smoke?

391
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,581
- If you need to go smoke,
just say that.

392
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,449
- Thanks.
I ain't even arguing.

393
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,451
I'm big as hell, and I want
to go smoke a cigarette,

394
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,687
and I'm gonna go smoke me
a cigarette.

395
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:49,055
I just feel like
you have more respect

396
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,189
for other people than me.
- I don't think it's fair

397
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,457
that you get to say that
and then walk away.

398
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,625
- I don't think it's fair

399
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,627
that you get to be respectful
to other people

400
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,929
more than you are me, and I've
been nothing but nice to you,

401
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:57,964
and even get ready
beside you, girl.

402
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,432
- When have I been mean to you?

403
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:00,900
- Girl, she can say or do

404
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,902
the exact same thing
that I say or do,

405
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,237
and you act like
she didn't shit.

406
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,505
- First of all,
I am not your mother.

407
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,906
- What the fuck
you talking about, bitch?

408
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,141
You ain't my mama.

409
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,275
- Because you acting like
I have to baby you.

410
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,210
- Oh, bye, sis.
- You're a grown ass man.

411
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,445
- Really, girl? Really, girl?

412
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,746
- I don't owe you
any more than anybody else.

413
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,781
- You just want someone
to fight with.

414
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,449
- I don't need
to fight with you.

415
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,351
You are picking this fight
right now.

416
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:19,519
This is my problem with you.

417
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,187
You and Aquaria
are in the same fucking boat.

418
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,755
- You're the same way.

419
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,358
- You are exactly the girl
that I did not like on Season 9.

420
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,759
- You don't know me, girl.
- And see the good in you.

421
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,662
But you know what?
You are another bitch

422
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,098
who doesn't know when
to let somebody else talk.

423
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,633
You think that your problems
are the only problems.

424
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,867
- Really? Okay.

425
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,602
- Bitch, get your shit
together. Fuck you.

426
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,204
- Somebody says
one negative thing

427
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,672
and you want to flip
the fuck out?

428
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,274
- Fuck you.
Clean the fuck out.

429
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,376
- Really? Really?
Can't fuck me, bitch.

430
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,677
- No, fuck that.
- I do like you as a person.

431
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,579
- Go have your cigarette,
bitch!

432
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,980
- No, I'm not going.
- Because it's done.

433
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,483
- Oh, my goodness.

434
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,320
Vixen, Eureka, what was it like
watching all that back?

435
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,562
Oh, now you silent?

436
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,997
Now you ain't
got nothing to say?

437
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,599
- Now that I've seen it
a hundred times,

438
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,834
it's a lot easier,

439
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,603
but seeing it at first,
it was very hard to watch.

440
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,704
- Why?

441
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,573
- Because honestly
in my whole life

442
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,609
I've never seen myself
that hurt or upset.

443
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,078
- Would other people
say the same thing about you?

444
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,547
- Yes. My boyfriend
of three years

445
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:26,252
said that that was
the most bothered in any way

446
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:27,286
that he's ever seen me.

447
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,354
- Really?
What about you?

448
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,989
- I was getting
a lot of tensions

449
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,824
from several people
up to that point,

450
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,593
but most specifically
The Vixen,

451
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,561
and I just didn't feel like

452
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,663
I was being allowed
to be a part of the group

453
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,232
with a couple of the girls.

454
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,400
And it was like
when I had opinions,

455
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,003
I would be cut off
and what I was saying

456
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,172
didn't seem like
it came across important,

457
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,875
and so I got a little defensive.

458
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,276
- That's a little defensive
for you?

459
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,546
- Oh, well, so I got
really motherfucking defensive.

460
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,915
- Yeah. Do you stand
by what you said?

461
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,550
- "Go have your cigarette?"

462
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,319
- You said a little bit more
than, "Go have your cigarette."

463
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,521
- Well, okay, so every time

464
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,923
there was a little awkward thing

465
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,458
that happened
between me and Eureka,

466
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,227
I tried to push it away, pay it.

467
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:14,033
So by that point, I had like
tried as hard as I can

468
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,868
to be non-confrontational.

469
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,771
So all the fives were
out the window and 10 was here.

470
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,139
And so I can't regret it,

471
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,375
because I know that I did
everything I could to avoid it.

472
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,243
- Do you stand by what you said?

473
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,412
- I--I--yes.

474
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,880
- All right. All right.

475
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,282
Do you stand by what you said?

476
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,616
- Not completely, no.

477
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,451
I don't stand by
the direction I went

478
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,953
about talking about it.

479
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,522
You know, maybe I could've been
like, "Girl, what's going on?"

480
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,659
You know, maybe instead of
being immediately defensive.

481
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,128
But as far as like
defending myself in the moment,

482
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,196
I stand beside
what I said in that case.

483
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,766
- But I don't think you should
say that it's defending yourself

484
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:48,768
because you weren't
defending yourself.

485
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,170
You said yourself
that you were attacking me.

486
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,808
So you poked at me until
you got me upset enough

487
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,843
to make you look like
the victim.

488
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:58,978
- No. My decision
was never to attack you.

489
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,646
- No, that's what happened.

490
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,881
- No, I never said "attack,"
darling.

491
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:03,482
- There's a camera.
That's what happened.

492
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,451
- There is a camera,
and I never said "attack."

493
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,320
- You said it from your mouth.

494
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,155
- No!

495
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,456
- You said "testing."

496
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,691
- This is exactly what I said.

497
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:12,992
"I just wanted to test her

498
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,360
because I tell that she
had something against me,"

499
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,761
blah blah blah blah blah.

500
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,397
- When you walked away from
the argument, you were smiling.

501
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,365
- It wasn't fair
that I did that to you.

502
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:20,566
- You were happy
that you got me.

503
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,600
- And it wasn't okay.
- And you did got me.

504
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,835
Listen, you got me.

505
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,437
- Do you feel differently now
than you did?

506
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,805
- About what?

507
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,707
- About your relationship
with Eureka.

508
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,710
- No. Because I sat at home
for months

509
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,511
believing that
I made that happen,

510
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,181
that it was my fault
that all of that happened.

511
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,817
And so I had to sit with that

512
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,452
and think that,
oh, I'm this monster.

513
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,154
It's gonna come out that
I'm like just this testy bitch

514
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,923
who can't keep it under control.

515
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,659
And then I find out that
she wanted me to go there.

516
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,694
She took me there on purpose.

517
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,929
Even before that, I knew

518
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,431
that I had issues
in my own mind with Eureka,

519
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:56,602
and I was trying every day
to make it--to keep it cool,

520
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,305
but you took it to
the worst possible level.

521
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,007
- Yeah, but that's
like saying, you know,

522
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,174
"Eat the cake, Anna Mae."

523
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,377
- Oh, so it's--
so it is my fault?

524
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,379
- You had a choice to react--
- Wait, how is this--how--

525
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:08,481
I don't get the "Eat the cake,
Anna Mae," thing at all.

526
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,950
- It's like saying,
"You made me do that."

527
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,652
- I think what Ru
is trying to say

528
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,654
is that you do not
have to accept the goad

529
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,756
when you are goaded.

530
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,858
- Yeah, but I think
the problem is

531
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,092
there's now five of us
talking to The Vixen

532
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,795
telling her why
you didn't have to do that.

533
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,597
- Yeah, everybody's tell me
how I should react,

534
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,298
but nobody's telling her
how to act.

535
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,367
- And, listen, you're not off
the hook either, Eureka.

536
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:33,806
Everybody has choices to take
the bait or to poke the bear.

537
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,074
- That's the truth.
- Yeah.

538
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,409
- And I'm doing my best not to.

539
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,877
- But you admit
that you have a problem

540
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,780
being able to not say anything?

541
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,949
If somebody says anything to
you, you're gonna respond to it.

542
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,618
- Yeah. It's honestly--

543
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,319
It really is something
I've tried to work on

544
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,155
as far as like the thinking
people all have to like me.

545
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,322
- It's not something
you have to work on,

546
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,158
it's just something
you just have to do.

547
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:54,894
- Yeah.

548
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,629
Can I say
what I wanted to say?

549
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,164
- What else do you want to say?

550
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:00,332
- We talked about it,
and I thought that we moved on,

551
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,368
and that's all I want
ultimately.

552
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,072
I did apologize for that because
I acted like a foolish bitch,

553
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:09,475
and I tried to come at you
because I was feeling sensitive,

554
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,311
and it wasn't cool that we ended
up in a heated, nasty argument.

555
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,846
But the next day
we talked about it.

556
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,848
You told me that
we were okay to move on,

557
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,516
and that's really what I want.

558
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,018
- There was a lie in there.

559
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,786
The next day--

560
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,389
I remember getting to the studio
the next day

561
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,890
and you pulling me to the side

562
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,893
and saying, "Girl, so how
do we wanna handle this?"

563
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,361
And that was the moment
that I knew

564
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,797
that everything
you had done was intentional

565
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,567
and that you were also
gonna produce how we fixed it,

566
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,702
and that is why
throughout the competition

567
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,970
I never trusted you again.

568
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,872
I never wanted
to deal with you again.

569
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,873
- But you came into
the competition

570
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,441
saying, "I came to fight."

571
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,210
And, you know,
it's not like you were--

572
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,711
- I came--okay,
so I came into the competition

573
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,480
saying that I came to fight.

574
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,516
Never once in this competition
did I start a fight.

575
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,817
- Wait, is that true?

576
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,652
It looked like you were
instigating things, and even--

577
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,421
- What did I instigate?

578
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,423
- Well, this thing between
Miz Cracker and Aquaria.

579
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,525
- It's not instigating
to tell someone the truth.

580
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,026
It's not instigating to tell--

581
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,595
- You can also not say anything.

582
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,464
- You could, but what's wrong
with telling someone the truth?

583
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,966
- Well, if you're
gonna tell the truth

584
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,534
and it's gonna create
tension in the room,

585
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,302
then that is creating a fight.

586
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,938
You also have a choice
to not say anything.

587
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,643
- Okay, so I came here
to thank my fans

588
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:20,646
for the love and support
that they gave me,

589
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,183
for all the wonderful people
who relate to me,

590
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:26,485
understand me and appreciate me.

591
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,788
And now that I've done that,
y'all can have a good night.

592
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,822
- Wait, wait, wait, Vixen, wait
Vixen, can I say something?

593
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,056
- No, I'm done. No.

594
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,858
- Okay. Well, Vixen...

595
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,467
- Welcome back to
"RuPaul's Drag Race Reunited."

596
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,938
Now, unfortunately, The Vixen
has decided to not rejoin us,

597
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:49,275
but before moving on,
does anyone have anything

598
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:52,244
they'd like to say
about this situation?

599
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,846
- I don't think
it was the best thing to do,

600
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:57,116
but I do think
her getting up and leaving

601
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:00,152
was her way of separating
herself from a situation

602
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,521
where either A, she was
gonna either have to fight

603
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,456
or leave the room.

604
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,758
- I disagree. I really do.

605
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,493
There's still a way
to have a conversation

606
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,828
without having
to do that, though.

607
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,531
- Agreed. Agreed.
But that's the--

608
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,700
- If she would just sit there
and just say, you know what?

609
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,603
Let me take a moment, breathe,

610
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,572
think about
what I'm about to say

611
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:22,274
so that I could get
my message across,

612
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,110
everyone at home
can understand her more.

613
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,512
- She walked out of the room

614
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,781
because she does not know
what else to do,

615
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,683
and it's our job as people

616
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,451
to try and help her
through a situation

617
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,620
that it's clear that
she's struggling through.

618
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,988
- Listen, as a community,

619
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,489
we do have responsibility
to each other,

620
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,025
but each of us,
we are all adults.

621
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,996
At one point you gotta say,
there is nothing else I can do.

622
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,265
And each of us have had
people in our lives

623
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:51,036
who you realize I can't do
anything for this person

624
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,273
unless they want
to meet me halfway.

625
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,343
- Valid. But I also feel like
earned authority is real.

626
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,111
- Accepting love is something
that's really important

627
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,279
just as much as giving love.

628
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,814
- But what
I don't understand is,

629
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,082
why do we just automatically
expect everybody

630
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,516
to understand that?

631
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,153
I don't agree with everything
that The Vixen says or does,

632
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,256
but I understand
where it comes from,

633
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,324
and I think...

634
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,128
The Vixen seems to me

635
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,796
like a person
that's crying out for help.

636
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:22,201
And it's like everybody else
is like, girl, that's on you.

637
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,637
You gotta figure it out,
and I just...

638
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,140
That's just unfortunate to me.

639
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,209
Like, I feel like
our sole purpose here

640
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,511
is to, you know, enrich
the lives of other people,

641
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,215
and even if I'm met
with controversy or whatnot,

642
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:39,551
I can do that every day
because 20 years down the road

643
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,221
we've got something, then
it's because, you know,

644
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,923
I was persistent in trying
to make your life better.

645
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,358
- Listen, I love the girl.

646
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,860
In fact, I invited her on
in the first place

647
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,462
because I felt her voice
needed to be heard.

648
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,298
But at one point,
and you've seen this

649
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,966
with your friends back home,

650
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:56,502
at one point sometimes
you gotta let people go

651
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:59,905
whether it's anger
or whatever the issue is,

652
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,909
because it's not
a two-way street.

653
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,944
It's one-sided.

654
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,480
And that's where we are.

655
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,416
It's a one-sided conversation.

656
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,318
She decided she's gonna get
the last word and walk out,

657
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,552
so there, it's done.

658
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,055
- It's just ridiculous.
It's just ridiculous.

659
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:20,759
Like it's ridiculous that our
thought process about people

660
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,931
is so self-centered that if
it's hard to help somebody,

661
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,067
well, just let them struggle.

662
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,602
We're not drag queens,
we're people,

663
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,372
and now we've got
one of our people outside.

664
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,240
Here were are filming
during Pride season,

665
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,777
and we let one of our sisters
walk out the fucking room

666
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,046
'cause nobody wants
to fucking help her.

667
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,049
And we're the first people--
we are the first people

668
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,152
to say that people
aren't treating us right.

669
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,888
- Do you think there's anything
we could have said to The Vixen

670
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,256
to make her stay?

671
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,625
- It's not about what we say,
it's about what we do.

672
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,027
- What could we have done?

673
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,695
- If I had of got up
and walked to that door

674
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,565
and said, "The Vixen,
we need you to stay."

675
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:03,268
But the fact that we, including
myself, let her walk out,

676
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,970
she--that door
closed behind her

677
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,241
and she said, yeah, I guess
I'm making the right choice.

678
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:13,612
- When Vixen decided to say,
"Thank you, but I'm leaving,"

679
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,681
do you believe that she had
already made up her mind?

680
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,218
Clearly you don't believe
she had already made up her mind

681
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,352
that this is it.

682
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,721
Because I believe
when she said that,

683
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,123
she was done

684
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,491
and there was nothing
anyone could do to stop her.

685
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,826
I mean, you've had
discussions with her.

686
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,096
In fact, we saw you have
a lovely discussion with her,

687
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,432
where we actually got to see
the sweetness in him,

688
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,968
and I saw the fear,
and I saw all of that,

689
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,670
and I understood
why that wall was put up,

690
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,239
because I have that wall,
you have it,

691
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,707
you have it, we all have it.

692
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,610
And it's coming
from a hurt place. It is.

693
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,346
But I can't teach her that.

694
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,647
I can teach her
through my own example.

695
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,048
- Of course you can.

696
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,683
- What, am I gonna go back
and follow her

697
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,985
and go say, "Come here,
let me tell you something."

698
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,987
- I mean, not at this moment.

699
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:58,290
- Can you explain to someone
who cannot be spoken to?

700
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,426
- No. I don't expect you
to do that, but--

701
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,727
- But look at me,
look at me, goddamn it.

702
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:05,464
I come from the same
goddamn place she comes from.

703
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,633
And here I am,
and you see me walking out?

704
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,001
No, I'm not walking out.

705
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,437
I fucking learn
how to act around people

706
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,172
and how to deal with shit.

707
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,706
I'm not fucking walking out

708
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,475
and saying,
"fuck all y'all," you know?

709
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,111
That's disrespectful
to each of you.

710
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:22,881
And I know you feel for her
because you see yourself in her,

711
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,950
'cause we all have
that same frustration.

712
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,952
Let me tell you something.

713
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,721
I have been
discriminated against

714
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,591
by white people for being black,
by black people for being gay,

715
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,760
by gay people for being too fem.

716
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,230
Did I let that stop me
from getting to this chair?

717
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,732
No. I had to separate
what I feel

718
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,635
or what my impression
of the situation is

719
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,637
to put my focus on the goal.

720
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:49,007
You can't just make excuses

721
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,377
for bad behavior
or for inconsiderate behavior.

722
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,513
I invited each of you back here

723
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,216
to my house, into my home,

724
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,117
and if I'm invited
to someone's home,

725
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,252
I'm not gonna disrespect
their home.

726
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,622
I'm not gonna just disrespect
the invitation.

727
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,891
You know, the world is hard.

728
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,026
It's hard to live
on this planet.

729
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,363
But we all have to learn
how to deal with it,

730
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,432
but you gotta ask
for help first.

731
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:17,035
Listen, at the end of the day,
we are all a drag family,

732
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,173
and as you can see here tonight,
it doesn't always come easy.

733
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,608
I want you take a look at this.

734
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,477
- My mom knocks on my door
and says,

735
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,046
"Your dad just found something
on your computer."

736
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,549
They lost it.
They took me to church.

737
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,519
They got me exorcised

738
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,687
because they thought
I was possessed by a gay demon.

739
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,222
- Really?

740
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,992
- I was so confused after
the whole thing went down

741
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:45,497
because was I straight now?
Like...

742
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,066
I had to go through therapy.

743
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,368
- Oh, my God.

744
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,703
- And I was on a track
to go to straight camp.

745
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,605
I was meeting
with these pastors,

746
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,542
and he was like,
"In a homosexual relationship,

747
00:27:56,542 --> 00:28:00,212
you'll never find success,
you'll never find love."

748
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,081
[sobs]

749
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:07,119
And I stopped him and I went
upstairs and I packed my car.

750
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,154
I said,
"I can't do this anymore."

751
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,763
- Oh, my goodness.

752
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,898
You know, Dusty,
I watched this at home,

753
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:24,136
and I busted out crying
when I saw this.

754
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:28,407
And you went through this thing
that's so horrific.

755
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,375
If you don't mind,
would you tell us,

756
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,977
what is conversion therapy?

757
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:35,714
- Conversion therapy
is a cleanse and a confession.

758
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,149
You go through this process

759
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,984
where you have to literally list

760
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,420
every person you've had
a sexual experience with,

761
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,991
and it's literally just this
very humiliating process.

762
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,459
It was really rough,

763
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,095
and I just had to have a day
where I said, enough.

764
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:52,998
- How did you find the strength
to do that?

765
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,833
- I've gone through
some hardships as a kid,

766
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:59,071
and I've always told myself that
this moment is just for now.

767
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,207
What I'm experiencing right now
cannot last forever.

768
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,643
So I know
that there is a tomorrow,

769
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,778
and it will get better.

770
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,213
I found creative outlets

771
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,749
to immerse myself in
for distractions,

772
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,517
and the people who saw me shine

773
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:15,354
that needed to be there
for me became my tribe.

774
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,789
- And did that also mean
leaving your family behind?

775
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,024
- I had to, yeah.

776
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,659
- And do you speak with them?

777
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:24,062
- Since that day,
they've apologized.

778
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:28,100
We do not see eye to eye
on homosexuality still,

779
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,869
but we have moved on
past that day.

780
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,138
The things
that we don't talk about

781
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,441
is because we don't see
each other as equal humans.

782
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,746
- Is it enough for you
to just have your chosen family?

783
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,414
Is that--would that
be enough for you?

784
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,182
- You know, it...

785
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,721
I love my chosen family.

786
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,523
I'm so very lucky.

787
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,891
But...

788
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,064
It's just really hard
to have strangers come up to you

789
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,633
and say that I look up to you,
I'm so proud of you,

790
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,701
I'm cheering you on,

791
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,504
and then you don't have
those people

792
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,139
that you wish were there
the most

793
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,740
saying, we are proud of you.

794
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,375
We are wearing
the Dusty shirt.

795
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,444
We are posting you
on our social media.

796
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,445
We are there.

797
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:17,049
And I'm good.
My life is good.

798
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,317
It could just be better
that way, that's all.

799
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,919
- You are fabulous, girl.
- Thank you.

800
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,154
- Fricking fabulous.

801
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,855
- Come on to the Bottoms family.

802
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,058
- Well, thank you
so much, Dusty,

803
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,626
for your courage
to tell that story.

804
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,495
It's really helped
a lot of people.

805
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,833
Now, when we talk about queens
with deep spiritual connections,

806
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,069
we can't leave out
Monique Heart.

807
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,271
More with her when we return.

808
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,744
Welcome back to "RuPaul's
Drag Race Reunited."

809
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,846
Now, Dusty wasn't the only one

810
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,383
who struggled with faith
and family. Take a look.

811
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,585
- Being here and knowing

812
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,420
that my mother can potentially
watch this show,

813
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,956
and me being
my most authentic self

814
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:00,025
makes me very
like uncomfortable

815
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,094
because I'm like
she's gonna watch and like--

816
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,228
- Oh, yes.

817
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,230
- I am seriously--
like seriously fruity,

818
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,565
you know what I mean?

819
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,167
- Is there no feeling
of liberation in that at all?

820
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,472
- No, because I know my mother
and I have to deal with her,

821
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,308
and I'm trying to build
a relationship with her

822
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,143
at this point that
she knows that I do drag.

823
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,716
- Monique, how old are you?

824
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,951
- I'm 31.

825
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,219
- Wait, your family
doesn't know you do drag?

826
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,821
- No, she knows, but like
I'm grown and I don't--

827
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:33,692
like, my mom is my everything,
you know what I mean?

828
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:34,960
- I hear that.

829
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,829
- And I didn't talk to her
for like four years

830
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:42,634
because you can't
be black and gay.

831
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,536
Like, you just can't.
You just can't.

832
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,471
- Hello. Hello.
- You know what I mean?

833
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,473
And then when you have
such a strong--

834
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,209
I'm fifth generation
full-time ministry.

835
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,312
This is like heresy,
you know what I mean?

836
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,218
- Wow, that's deep.

837
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:04,322
So, Monique,
you can relate to Dusty.

838
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:08,293
- Yeah. The day that Dusty,
Blair, Eureka, and Asia

839
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,594
opened up
about their spirituality,

840
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,631
I really didn't 'cause,
like, I still kind of love

841
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,300
this one that we call God
and, you know,

842
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,902
go by the name of Jesus,
whatever.

843
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:20,605
But to hear again the BS
that you go through

844
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,009
just trying to become
your most authentic self,

845
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:27,312
thinking that if I just pray
it away or confess this name,

846
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,981
like, I'll finally be free,

847
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:33,218
but to be 100% honest,
it wasn't.

848
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,953
It really wasn't.

849
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,621
It really was not until

850
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,358
I put on a wig and a dress
and I grabbed that mic

851
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:44,930
and I saw this kid
sitting across from me,

852
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,732
and like we had this dance party
at Hamburger Mary's,

853
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:48,900
and he wanted to go up

854
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,837
and I said,
know that you are loved

855
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,039
and you are so worth it
and go twirl,

856
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,207
like go give it to 'em.

857
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:56,241
- Twirl, bitch.

858
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,076
- And I knew that in that moment

859
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,446
that, like, yo, black
gay youth come up to you,

860
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:05,483
because I wanted to be that boy,
but I couldn't be that boy.

861
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,153
So to be in a day and age
where they can,

862
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,255
that means so much.

863
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,324
Like, it was all worth it.

864
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,625
- It was all worth it.

865
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,894
All the pain,
it was all worth it.

866
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,362
Have you spoken
with your mother?

867
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:24,035
- I did, but she wasn't
like happy.

868
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,971
And so I felt very alone,

869
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,440
and to come back
to your room every night

870
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,812
and just you have friends, but
you just like God, I'm alone,

871
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,080
and there wasn't nobody
but me, Jesus,

872
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,550
and glitter and rhinestones.
That was it.

873
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,419
Like Psalms 110 says, he wraps
himself in a garment of light.

874
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,822
Dolce can't do that,
Versace can't do that.

875
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,259
Like the aah, he lives
for the ooh-ah-ah sensation.

876
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,562
So when you know that,
you're free, and I'm sorry.

877
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,863
- No, this is right.
This is it.

878
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,965
This is it right here.
This is it right here.

879
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,701
Because what you're saying
is you,

880
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,070
through this journey
of a lot of pain,

881
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,741
you have found
what the true meaning is.

882
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,175
You just quoted the Bible.

883
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,078
You just interpret it
through your own path.

884
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,581
You've understood
what those words really mean,

885
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:10,982
and you're absolutely right.

886
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:12,684
- Amen.
- Dress yourself up

887
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,653
and go out there and celebrate.

888
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,623
And your ministry helped
this kid in Hamburger Mary's

889
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,559
come into the light,
walk into his own beauty,

890
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,161
into his own light.

891
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,665
But this is why this ministry
of drag is so powerful.

892
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,234
We can speak from so much pain

893
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:33,538
and so much heartache
and so much still frustration,

894
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,675
but we can walk that walk,
and you're doing it.

895
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,176
You are doing it.

896
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,079
We'll be right back.

897
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,886
- Welcome back to "RuPaul's
Drag Race Reunited."

898
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,588
Now, there's something
about the main stage

899
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,091
that makes queens
bare their souls.

900
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,359
It's like a truth serum.

901
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,896
But nobody was prepared
for the startling confession

902
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,498
of our dear Blair St. Clair.

903
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,133
Let's take a look.

904
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,603
- Um...

905
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:13,545
My first sexual experience,
I was raped at a college party,

906
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:20,652
and from that I have looked
to find pretty things.

907
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,857
It's something
I need to get over,

908
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:32,297
but I've tried
to turn positive the best I can.

909
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,432
[applause]

910
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:37,002
- So, Blair, in "Untucked,"
you share

911
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,804
that this was the first time
you had spoken about that.

912
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,907
What made you decide
to do it on this forum?

913
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,310
- You know...

914
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,313
sometimes your heart knows
when you're ready to talk

915
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,481
before your brain does.

916
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,849
- Mm-hmm.

917
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,350
- And I don't even think
my brain

918
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,252
was fully capable of what
I was doing at the moment.

919
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,221
- Yeah. When did you tell
your mother?

920
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,690
- I had a conversation
with my mother

921
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,060
a few weeks after I got home
from "Drag Race."

922
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,328
We sat down
and we talked about it,

923
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,630
and that was probably harder

924
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,833
than talking about it
to the world.

925
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,168
Telling the people
that you love the most

926
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,070
something traumatic about you
is really difficult,

927
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,005
and that's why
I've held it in for so long,

928
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,807
'cause I didn't even want
to admit it to myself.

929
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,375
- Yeah. And in all the years

930
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,678
before you revealed it
on television,

931
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,614
how had you been coping
with that pain?

932
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,486
- You know, everyone has
a different way of coping,

933
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,321
and everyone has a different
mechanism in what they do,

934
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,956
and whenever I found pain

935
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:33,858
and whenever I found hurt,
frustration, anger

936
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,193
or anything that was like
a negative emotion,

937
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:41,199
I would turn to alcohol,
and I would drink in excess.

938
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,301
It's something that
I didn't realize was a problem

939
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,769
until after coming home
from "Drag Race"

940
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,339
and recognizing that might be
something that I can't control

941
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,208
because I use to mask the pain.

942
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,110
Now I've been living
a sober life

943
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,746
since coming back
from "Drag Race."

944
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:58,583
[applause]

945
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,918
And I can tell you

946
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:03,521
that from what I've experienced
in my spiritual growth

947
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:09,060
is that I am a more humbled,
caring, thoughtful person,

948
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,262
and it has truly
changed my life.

949
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,397
- How have fans reacted?

950
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,898
- Fans have been incredible.

951
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,367
They've just been--
and so have my sisters.

952
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,069
You guys have just been
so wonderful,

953
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,370
and I think the best way
to describe it

954
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,140
is that I have gone through
something so painful,

955
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,075
so haunting and hurtful,

956
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,878
but it's only been received
back to me

957
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,947
in so much love
from everybody else,

958
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,449
and it's just been so amazing
for me to embrace that back.

959
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,485
- Thank you so much, Blair,
for being so brave,

960
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:36,387
and for inspiring
so many people.

961
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,823
Opening up is always hard,

962
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,559
especially when it comes
to family.

963
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,694
Let's take a look at this.

964
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:46,731
- In 2014, I won
a small pageant in Brooklyn.

965
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:47,799
The pageant was on Saturday.

966
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,900
I wake up Monday morning

967
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,802
with like 27 missed calls
from my mom.

968
00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:52,871
I'm like what happened,
what is going on?

969
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,639
They sent an article
back to St. Lucia

970
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,042
with me in drag
on the cover of the newspaper,

971
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,811
the only newspaper
on the entire island.

972
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,480
She called me, she was like
what is going on?

973
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,882
Are you trans? Are you gay?

974
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,383
What is all this shit?
I'm like no.

975
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,418
I was just doing it
for a movie thing

976
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,320
and it got misconstrued.

977
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,158
It was the craziest thing
in my life, girl.

978
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:15,960
In retrospect,
I should have just said,

979
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,195
hey, I'm a drag queen,

980
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,797
but I like lied about it,

981
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,131
and there's a small sliver of me

982
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,300
that thinks that
they might reject me,

983
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,636
and that is why
I don't want to say it.

984
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,105
It's very scary.

985
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,543
- Now, you talked about
your Caribbean upbringing.

986
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:32,610
- Yeah.
- Tell me about that.

987
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,112
How did that affect you?

988
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,282
- Growing up in a small island
like St. Lucia,

989
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,583
there aren't lots of gay people.

990
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,951
You don't see gay people on TV.

991
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,119
You don't see gay people
at the store.

992
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,021
So when I moved back to America,

993
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,123
and I was thrust
into New York City

994
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,292
where going to school
on the 2 train,

995
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,060
I was seeing drag queens
coming off their shift from work

996
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,094
at 7:00 in the morning.

997
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,996
It is like--
it was a shock to me.

998
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,499
And me knowing that
there was a small part of me

999
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,867
that identified with that,

1000
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:59,804
and it was like a very haunting
and daunting fear of mine

1001
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,707
to realize that, hey, I'm gay,
but not just gay,

1002
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:05,343
I'm like the highest form
of gay, I'm a drag queen.

1003
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,879
- The highest form of gay.
[laughs]

1004
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,281
- It was like the Megazord
of being gay.

1005
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,816
I am a drag queen.

1006
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,152
- [laughs]
Have they seen the show?

1007
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,354
- I mean, she's still
very wary about it.

1008
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,989
She won't say
that I'm on "Drag Race."

1009
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,325
She's like, so that show you're
doing, how you doing on it?

1010
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,260
Are you still on it?

1011
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,430
And I'm like, yeah, Mom,
I'm still on it.

1012
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,632
This was episode eight,
I was still doing well.

1013
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,435
And I was like, yeah, Mom,
I'm still on there.

1014
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,437
She's like, well, I hope
you go far, but she has not--

1015
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,805
- Why do you think that is?

1016
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,807
Why do you think
she is reluctant

1017
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,775
to watching you on the show?

1018
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,945
- I think just from
an afro-black perspective,

1019
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,280
like being gay

1020
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,048
and saying that you're
homosexual and all those things,

1021
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,051
it's hard for black women
and black moms to reconcile with

1022
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,355
because it is--
it often is demonized

1023
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,690
because she's at church
every Sunday morning,

1024
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,359
and like that is her devotion.

1025
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,563
So seeing that her son
is amplifying all those fears

1026
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,064
that she's been preached at

1027
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,566
every Wednesday night
in Bible study

1028
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,301
and every Thursday
at choir practice,

1029
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,436
it's hard for her to--
- Amen.

1030
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:08,072
- To accept that her son
is that thing

1031
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,842
that she's been told to fear,
and is not--

1032
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,844
- Yeah.
Because at some level

1033
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,313
she'd have to deconstruct
her whole belief system

1034
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,748
to accept what you're doing.
- Right.

1035
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,917
- Is there still a part of you
inside that is--

1036
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,588
that sort of demonizes
being a drag queen to yourself?

1037
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,124
- Yeah. You know, I feel
old habits die hard.

1038
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:30,061
I went to church every Sunday
morning and I was in choir,

1039
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:33,464
and I still do sing
at a choir in drag.

1040
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,832
Every Wednesday night
I'm in choir in full drag.

1041
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,535
- Yes.
- Ooh, praise Him.

1042
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,537
- It's a very loving place,

1043
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,574
but the fact that my mom
still can't say

1044
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:48,012
my son is a drag queen,
I think it is that part of me

1045
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,315
that I know
that she is still probably

1046
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:53,117
really wary
any airing of that fact.

1047
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,752
- Yeah, yeah. All right.

1048
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,020
One last question about that.

1049
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,357
Does your whole family
wear a pussycat wig?

1050
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:03,728
[all laugh]

1051
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,297
- Ru, I come from
a very long lineage

1052
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,399
of the pussycat wig ladies.

1053
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,568
My grandmother,
my great-great-grandmother,

1054
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,904
and my great-
great-great-grandfather, okay?

1055
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:15,506
- Miss Hattie May X Change.
- Miss Hattie May X Change.

1056
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,743
He was a drag queen girl,
and he had a pussycat wig.

1057
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,044
- I love it.

1058
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,846
Now, Yuhua, you have
an interesting relationship

1059
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,047
with your parents,
is that correct?

1060
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,282
- Yes. Yes.

1061
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:27,452
I grew up in a very,
very conservative family.

1062
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,020
I am original from China,

1063
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,457
and in China we view drag queens

1064
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:35,593
as someone who is mentally ill,
unstable, and crazy.

1065
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:36,961
- Well, that's true.
That's true.

1066
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,498
- So when I was growing up,

1067
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,934
I used to be very, very,
very, very scared of drag

1068
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,502
until I discovered
what drag was.

1069
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,937
And I put a wig on.

1070
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,706
I tried to play with all the
colors on the makeup palette,

1071
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,608
and it made me so free,

1072
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,310
and made me
so much more happier.

1073
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,511
It gave me confidence
and determination,

1074
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,980
and it saved me as a person.

1075
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,181
- And did you do it in secret?

1076
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,550
- I did it in secret.
I was 16 at the time.

1077
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,818
- Where would you put
the clothes on?

1078
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:04,288
- I would sneak out
and put the clothes on

1079
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,624
in the basement of the apartment
that we lived in

1080
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:08,593
near the garbage cans.

1081
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,628
- Do your parents know
that you do drag now?

1082
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,697
- They've seen pictures
when I was younger,

1083
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,900
but they don't know
where I am with drag right now.

1084
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,502
- Yeah.
Do you still see them?

1085
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,337
- Yes, I still see them.
We don't talk about it.

1086
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,873
I think it's very common
in Asian culture

1087
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,875
that you don't talk
about stuff like that

1088
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,712
where it's looked down upon,
it's shameful,

1089
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,414
so it is best
that we don't talk about it.

1090
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,748
Because if we talk about it,

1091
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,184
then we would distance ourself
further away from it,

1092
00:42:33,184 --> 00:42:34,786
and I think a lot of Asians
out there

1093
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:36,654
can relate to the same
situation as well.

1094
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,624
- Do you ever see a day
where you tell them?

1095
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:40,758
- I don't know.

1096
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,360
I mean, till this day
they still ask me,

1097
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,996
when are you gonna bring back
home a Chinese girlfriend?

1098
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:48,065
But don't they know that
I am the girlfriend already?

1099
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,867
[all laugh]
- Yuhua.

1100
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,469
- After the break,

1101
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,705
the queens read each other's
runway looks to filth.

1102
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:55,706
Stay tuned.

1103
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,547
Welcome back.

1104
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,082
Now, we are only one week away

1105
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,651
from crowning America's
next drag superstar

1106
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:10,087
in an epic lip sync
smackdown for the crown.

1107
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:14,892
But first, let's play a game
of what we call Toot or Boot.

1108
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,195
- Ahh.
- Yes.

1109
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,197
- If you love an outfit,
toot it,

1110
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,466
and if you don't, boot it.

1111
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:25,303
All right. First up,
Kameron's feather couture.

1112
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,839
- Toot.
- That's a shoot, honey.

1113
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,340
When Kameron came in,
I was like,

1114
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,875
oh, this bitch
is going home tomorrow.

1115
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,443
Like, she is done.

1116
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,845
Episode 3, you came out in this,

1117
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,380
I said, to quote
Monique Heart, "Okay!"

1118
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,182
It was like everything.
- Okay!

1119
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,350
- I was like,
oh, this is, like,

1120
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,284
one of the best looks
of the season probably.

1121
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,419
- She looked like she came

1122
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,221
straight out of
a "Lord of the Rings" book.

1123
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,455
- [laughs]

1124
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,092
- Up next, we've got
Miz Cracker's silver foxy.

1125
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,527
Toot or boot?
- Toot.

1126
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,295
- Toot.
- I'm gonna say boot,

1127
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,430
'cause this bitch
put on bigger lips

1128
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,631
and just turned out to be

1129
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,833
a fatter lipped version
of herself.

1130
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,136
- And Michelle said
that she really believed

1131
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,004
I would be that wrinkle free
at that age, so...

1132
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,406
- All right.

1133
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:05,243
So up next we've got
Monet's sponge dress.

1134
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,812
- Boot.
- Boot.

1135
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,981
- Really?
- [laughs]

1136
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,649
- I'm gonna toot it because
when she was making it,

1137
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,619
I was watching her and
I was like, this is a good idea,

1138
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:16,020
and I was like, okay,
I'm feeling it,

1139
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,955
and I still like it to this day.

1140
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,724
- But her silhouette.
- It's just unshapely.

1141
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,092
- But Monet,
tell me about the choice

1142
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:24,829
to put the sponges on top
over the bottom part.

1143
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,998
- I wanted to mimic
a loofah on a stick.

1144
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,499
- Does the dress still exist?

1145
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,901
- The dress still exists, Ru,

1146
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:32,203
and actually,
I have a surprise for you.

1147
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:34,605
- Uh-oh.

1148
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,674
- A little birdie told me
that you liked it so much.

1149
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,376
- Uh-huh.
- So I brought you--

1150
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,244
I made one for you.

1151
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:41,679
- Oh, my goodness.

1152
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,880
I'm surprised
you still have them on there

1153
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,316
because every week
you were dabbing yourself

1154
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,918
with more of the sponges.

1155
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,586
- Ru, can I get a toot or a boot
finally from you?

1156
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:49,754
- You can get a toot.

1157
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:50,855
- Yes!
- Absolutely.

1158
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,557
For nerve, for nerve.

1159
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:53,558
[all laugh]

1160
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,794
It did take nerve.
[laughs]

1161
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,664
Now, you bitches
were so extra this season,

1162
00:44:59,664 --> 00:45:01,832
it rubbed off on the judges.

1163
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,968
Check out these
never-before-seen moments

1164
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:05,369
from the judges' panel.

1165
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,238
If you can't love yourself,

1166
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:08,973
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1167
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,174
Can I get an amen in here?

1168
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:12,376
- Amen!
- Amen!

1169
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,312
- Can I get an amen, Christina?

1170
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:16,614
- Amen, Christina!

1171
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,382
[all laugh]

1172
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,252
- Now, Shania, have you worn
assless chaps before?

1173
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,887
- Um, yes, I have.

1174
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,722
- She's wearing them
right now actually.

1175
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,457
- Oh.

1176
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,193
- Let's go to Alex Trebek

1177
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,029
and hear what he has to say
about Asia.

1178
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,598
- No T, no shade,

1179
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,434
but she was not serving
lemonade.

1180
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:38,436
- Ooh!
- Ooh, all right, Alex,

1181
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,204
for the Beyonce quote.

1182
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,572
Alex is part of the beyhive.

1183
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,674
- [laughs]
- Can I just say,

1184
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,543
I know it's your husband,
you are so hot.

1185
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,211
- Isn't he so hot?
- Oh, my God.

1186
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,647
- I know, right?
- I'm--okay.

1187
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,248
- Wow. I changed my mind.

1188
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:55,152
Your panel was great,
really amazing,

1189
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,220
and you really showed them up.

1190
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,189
- I am in love with you, girl.

1191
00:45:58,189 --> 00:45:59,657
- That's very nice.

1192
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:01,058
- I remember walking to school

1193
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,060
right around "Spring Awakening"
when you were there,

1194
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,763
and kids, like, sleeping outside
the theater for like days

1195
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,199
to hopefully get a ticket, and
you would sometimes pop in there

1196
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,200
and bring them
coffee and donuts.

1197
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,635
- That was Jonathan Groff.

1198
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,703
That wasn't me, but it's fine.

1199
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:13,771
It's totally fine.

1200
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,006
- I'm thinking
of "Book of Mormon."

1201
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,407
"Book of Mormon," that was you.

1202
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:19,110
- Look, we're gay and we're
white and we sing high.

1203
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:22,680
I am on board for all of it.

1204
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,383
- Courtney, have you ever used
a dating app?

1205
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:26,784
- Yes.

1206
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,186
- Are you single?
Because so is Carson.

1207
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:32,056
- Yes, and we would make
a fantastic couple.

1208
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:36,527
- Oh, my God, we could share
makeup and clothes.

1209
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,195
- We put you together
for a reason.

1210
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,463
- [laughs]

1211
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,466
- So Alex, is there anything
more you'd like to say?

1212
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:46,303
- Okay, that's it.
I've had it, officially.

1213
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,372
- Okur.
[all laugh]

1214
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,740
- Aah!

1215
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,743
- All right, after the break,
more drama, mama.

1216
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:53,811
Don't go anywhere.

1217
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,014
Welcome back.

1218
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:58,916
Now, after
the evil twin challenge,

1219
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,752
I asked the queens
the classic question,

1220
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,821
who should go home and why?

1221
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,589
- North Korea.

1222
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:08,225
- The person that I do not think
is a star in this lineup

1223
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:11,295
is Miz Cracker or Miz Crumbs.

1224
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,965
- How'd that make you feel,
Miz Cracker?

1225
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,435
- Asia, you hurt my feelings.

1226
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:24,842
I took that phrase
and I beat myself for months

1227
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,544
till I couldn't get out of bed.

1228
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:30,614
And the reason that that
happened for me, I think,

1229
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:32,717
is because
I come from New York City,

1230
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,753
and there is an infinite amount
of love in the world,

1231
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:38,089
but there are so many bars
in New York City,

1232
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,958
and I fought for a place
in all of them.

1233
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,894
And all year before "Drag Race,"

1234
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,896
people were like,
girl, are you ready

1235
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,998
for Monet X Change
to be on "Drag Race?"

1236
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,067
Girl, are you ready for Aquaria
to be on "Drag Race?"

1237
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,236
I was always not a star.

1238
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:56,340
I came here only to be a star,

1239
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:02,079
to show people
that I was not less than.

1240
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,548
That was something
I was already telling myself.

1241
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,651
You opened it in me
that that's the story.

1242
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,821
- Do you still stand
by saying that she's not a star?

1243
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,023
- That was wrong, and it was
hurtful for me to say that,

1244
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,527
and, you know, I would never
want to discredit anybody's work

1245
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,796
or let somebody feel like,
you know, they're less than,

1246
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,765
because, I mean,
you are more than.

1247
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,066
You proved that by being here

1248
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,068
and as far as you've made it
in the competition.

1249
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:26,437
So I'm really sorry
from the bottom of my heart.

1250
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,939
I knew as soon as the words
left my mouth

1251
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,375
that that's not something
you say about somebody else

1252
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,277
that's in the same, you know,
line of work as you.

1253
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,579
- Right.
- Do you believe her?

1254
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,081
- Do I believe her--
this apology?

1255
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,749
Yes, I believe that.

1256
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,987
What I will say is this time
you made a mistake. Fine.

1257
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:45,022
Not next time, bitch.

1258
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,058
- All right, let's move on.

1259
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,527
Now, we are just one week away

1260
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:52,329
from crowning America's
next drag superstar.

1261
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,432
Now, ladies, I've been asking
a lot of questions,

1262
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,435
but now I'd like
to give you the chance

1263
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,937
to ask questions to each other.

1264
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,305
It's the last call.

1265
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,340
Now, if you have anything you
want to get off your chesticles,

1266
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,910
now is the time.

1267
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,679
Oh, okay.

1268
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,747
- Okay, Mayhem.
- Mayhem.

1269
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:11,115
- Mayhem.
- [laughs]

1270
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,017
- Okay, so here's the thing.

1271
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:16,687
This one's directed
to Asia and Aquaria.

1272
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,088
Now, on "Untucked,"

1273
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,791
you guys have both had
a discussion about me,

1274
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,762
saying that my drag
didn't have a wow factor,

1275
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:31,235
and at home watching that,
I was completely blown away,

1276
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:33,370
because I was like,
wait a minute.

1277
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,040
They never said anything to me
about that.

1278
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,276
Every time we had
a design challenge,

1279
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,247
like the first episode
that I won for my look,

1280
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:45,783
everyone said, oh, my God,
wow, that was great.

1281
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:48,519
And then
when it came to the ball,

1282
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,355
my Martian look was sickening,

1283
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,390
and you guys sat there
in "Untucked"

1284
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,259
and said that about me,
and I was very hurt by that,

1285
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:56,694
because I was like,
wait a minute, what?

1286
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:58,095
I would have thought
that you guys

1287
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,397
would have been like, girl,
what are you wearing? Like--

1288
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,702
But I thought every time I hit
that runway I was put together.

1289
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:07,705
I was like, okay,
fuck my drag all of a sudden.

1290
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:11,375
- If I may, first,
I came into this competition

1291
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,110
a very huge Mayhem fan,

1292
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,447
because I think you're just
so freaking cool and so fierce.

1293
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,884
And I think for me, you were
giving me fabulous drag,

1294
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:22,386
but I didn't see you stand out

1295
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:25,890
the way that I wish that
I could see you stand out,

1296
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:27,524
and I think that's more
what I meant,

1297
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,527
rather than, oh,
fuck your drag, you know?

1298
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,263
So I'm very sorry

1299
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,899
if I made you feel that way
watching especially.

1300
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,668
- For me, prior to "Drag Race,"

1301
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,470
you were always
the girl to beat.

1302
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,239
And the first episode,
the design challenge,

1303
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,540
I mean, I stood right there
with Eureka

1304
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,975
and told you
how fabulous that was.

1305
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:47,678
I did not not personally care
for your Martian looks,

1306
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:48,746
but I wasn't just
gonna go over there

1307
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:50,180
and say,
girl, I don't like that,

1308
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,683
because you and I don't have
a friendship like that.

1309
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:56,320
I'm not a judge, and, I mean,
I respect you enough as a person

1310
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,055
to not like
rain on your parade

1311
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,457
with my opinions that
a lot of times don't matter.

1312
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,426
But there was never a time
where I said, you know,

1313
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:03,894
oh, Mayhem, I love this,

1314
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,397
and then went in "Untucked"
and said something different.

1315
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,499
- Okay, that's a valid point.

1316
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:09,967
Let's--anybody else want--

1317
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:15,506
- Okay, I have one.
Kameron, you stunt queen,

1318
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:18,642
strategizing the house down,
faces of many.

1319
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:22,880
You on social media
have all of this mouth,

1320
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,684
and I go--
now I understand strategy.

1321
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:27,918
I just don't understand like

1322
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,421
where's this girl
that claps back, pops off,

1323
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:34,291
and then this one over here
was just very like,

1324
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,126
I don't say anything,
I don't do--like who--

1325
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,729
I'm just asking only
because it seems very like,

1326
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:40,698
oh, she played
a completely different game

1327
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,633
and we don't know you at all

1328
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:45,336
or you're just completely
like fake.

1329
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,037
- It wasn't really
even a strategy.

1330
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,906
I was just intimidated
by you guys.

1331
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,674
You guys were all--

1332
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:52,977
I think all of you working
as professional drag queens.

1333
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:55,879
I was not.
I was a hairdresser.

1334
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:59,016
I stopped doing drag and
concentrated on my hair career,

1335
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:02,353
and then I auditioned
for the show and I made it,

1336
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:06,790
and then in that moment,
I realized, oh, shit.

1337
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,625
What did I get myself into?

1338
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,761
And so I had to come and compete

1339
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:12,129
in a competition
where I didn't think

1340
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,597
I would make it where I made it,

1341
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,265
and that was why I was so quiet.

1342
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,868
It wasn't a strategy, it was me
doubting myself the whole time.

1343
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:20,638
But you come to my shows,
when you come and see me live,

1344
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,973
I'm the same way
that I am on social media

1345
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,510
as I am in person at my shows.

1346
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,279
- You know,
it's very heartbreaking,

1347
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,382
because when I see your
personality on social media,

1348
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:32,916
that hurts my feelings,

1349
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,453
because like I don't have
a relationship with you.

1350
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,690
I don't know if many girls
have relationships with you,

1351
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,425
but it's almost like
you don't want it at all,

1352
00:52:41,425 --> 00:52:43,460
and like press week, mama,

1353
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,730
we were together in each other's
faces for a whole week.

1354
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,432
I would walk into the room.

1355
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:50,300
I literally
had to sit on your lap

1356
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,937
and grab your face and say,
hi, Kameron, hello.

1357
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,506
And then after that weekend,

1358
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:59,209
I told myself I'm not
wasting any more energy--

1359
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,310
- Why, because the response--

1360
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,146
You wouldn't get a response
from Kameron?

1361
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,715
- Listen, everyone here
will walk into the room

1362
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:05,949
and say hello to each other.

1363
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,451
Sis, how you been?

1364
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:10,721
I can't even turn Kameron's head
when I walk into the room.

1365
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:12,523
- Is that true, Kameron?
Why is that?

1366
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,591
- I'm sure some girls
feel like that.

1367
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,828
I don't have a close
relationship with everyone here,

1368
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:20,097
but I--
when I walk into a room,

1369
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:21,765
maybe I didn't do it
on the show,

1370
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,101
but events
that we've done together,

1371
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,136
I feel like I walk up
and say hello to you guys.

1372
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,237
I feel like I say hi.

1373
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,605
I feel like I say
that you look great.

1374
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,908
- Sis, I love you,
but you will clear into a room

1375
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:33,277
and just go...

1376
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:35,546
And I--you will.

1377
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:36,847
So it feels intentional.

1378
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,549
It feels like you don't care,
that's what it is.

1379
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:42,152
So it's not like you gotta be,
"Oh, Boo, woo, woo, woo."

1380
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:45,222
No. Just, hey, fish,
keep it pushing, that's it.

1381
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,256
- I have to disagree.

1382
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,158
I feel like I comment

1383
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,493
and tell you guys
that you look good.

1384
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:51,261
Maybe I didn't do it--
- When we activate with you.

1385
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,464
- Maybe I didn't do it
back then, but I do it now.

1386
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:55,999
- But also I feel
actively on the show

1387
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,203
you said to us often
that I'm not talking

1388
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:02,106
because I don't want to say--

1389
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:05,976
I don't want them
to put shady clips up of me.

1390
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,411
But it's like, it you don't
have something shady to say,

1391
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,512
then that's not gonna happen.

1392
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:09,713
- See, that girl right here.

1393
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:13,383
This girl, who's she?
That one right there?

1394
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:16,186
You just said...
Who's she?

1395
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,821
- Oh, did you just make a face?
- That's what I'm saying.

1396
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,156
No, she just clicked.

1397
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,591
Who--that's what I'm saying.

1398
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:21,825
That's what I'm saying.
- She clicked out, not clicked.

1399
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:23,360
- She just clicked over,
you know what I'm saying?

1400
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,662
It's all in, like,
body language and everything,

1401
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,831
you know what I'm saying?
And so I'm going like--

1402
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:30,334
- She's here with us.
- You're here with us.

1403
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:31,735
- To put a Band-Aid on that,

1404
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,338
I'm not saying that you were
maliciously trying to ignore us.

1405
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:35,606
It's just that when
we hear you say that,

1406
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,374
oh, I'm not gonna
say nothing on camera

1407
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,709
'cause I don't want
to say nothing shady,

1408
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,110
that gives me pause,

1409
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,179
like, okay, what does Kameron
really think about Monet?

1410
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:43,814
What does Kameron
really think about Monique?

1411
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:46,250
I think that's what
is the disconnect for me.

1412
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,551
- I just think
you're so fabulous.

1413
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,353
I just want you
to be my fucking friend.

1414
00:54:49,353 --> 00:54:51,355
- [laughs]
- Aw.

1415
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,924
- Thank you, ladies, for getting
it all off your chests.

1416
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:56,994
After the break, I'll ask
which of our Top Four

1417
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,563
should take the crown,
so stick around.

1418
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,867
Welcome back.

1419
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,869
Now, ladies,
before you drag-uate

1420
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,437
from "RuPaul's Drag Race,"

1421
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:11,041
let's take one last trip
to the library.

1422
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,209
- Ooh.

1423
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:14,912
- All right, bitches,
the library is open.

1424
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,346
Who wants to go first?

1425
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,015
- Me!
- Okay.

1426
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,185
- I went to public school, so I
might not be very good at this.

1427
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:23,387
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

1428
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:24,855
- What, bitch?

1429
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,323
- How does it feel
to have a catch phrase

1430
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,425
last longer on "Drag Race"
than you did?

1431
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,928
- I'm glad
I have a catch phrase.

1432
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,229
Who are you again?

1433
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:35,365
Okay, bitch?
[all laugh]

1434
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:37,100
- The bitch that sent you home.

1435
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,535
The bitch that sent you home.

1436
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:42,673
- Eureka, they say,
eureka, I found it, right?

1437
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:43,941
But when you gonna find out

1438
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,576
when to shut the fuck up
sometimes?

1439
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:48,745
[all laugh]

1440
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,480
- When you come put
that dick in my mouth.

1441
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,450
- Aah!
[all laugh]

1442
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,518
- You know, this season

1443
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,253
we thought that The Vixen
and Eureka

1444
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:58,622
was one of the biggest fights,
but no.

1445
00:55:58,622 --> 00:55:59,823
I enjoyed watching Yuhua

1446
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,259
fight the English language
the entire season.

1447
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:03,393
[all laugh]

1448
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:04,494
- What kind of fish?

1449
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,530
- Clearly she talking to Monet.

1450
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,232
- What kind of fish is that?

1451
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:11,235
[all laugh]

1452
00:56:11,235 --> 00:56:14,071
- Aquaria is smart!

1453
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,540
- Eureka, I know you seem
to have gotten close

1454
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,209
to Miss Kameron Michaels,
and that's really surprising

1455
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,212
because no one gets close to her
without a $50 meet and greet.

1456
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,480
- Ooh.

1457
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,349
- And I know

1458
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,517
maybe it's because of
Kameron's ego is so big

1459
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,052
it makes you feel dainty.

1460
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,722
And feeling dainty,
Miss Blair St. Clair,

1461
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,825
I know you like to claim
you're a professional actress,

1462
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,593
but being a decoy
on "To Catch a Predator"

1463
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,962
is not a legit credit.

1464
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,864
[all laugh]

1465
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,734
And Michelle Visage,
never loved you.

1466
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:47,237
[all laugh]

1467
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,476
- Well, thank you, ladies.

1468
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:56,246
The library for Season 10
is closed officially.

1469
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:59,149
Aquaria, Asia O'Hara,

1470
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,551
Eureka and Kameron Michaels,

1471
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:02,953
in one week,

1472
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:07,024
one of you will be crowned
America's next drag superstar

1473
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:08,959
and win a year's supply

1474
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:11,962
of Anastasia of Beverly Hills
cosmetics

1475
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:16,199
and a cash prize of $100.000.

1476
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,670
Next week, the Top Four
get to plead their cases,

1477
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,139
but now I want to ask
the rest of our queens

1478
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:25,842
who they think should be
America's next drag superstar.

1479
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:30,013
Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1480
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,081
Mayhem.

1481
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:34,318
- God, it's a hard choice
for me.

1482
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,321
I really feel Aquaria

1483
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:41,591
has shown how strong
of a competitor she is,

1484
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,461
and I feel she has
the future of drag on her.

1485
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,462
- Kalorie.

1486
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,064
- Eureka.

1487
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:48,465
I think it's time
for a big girl to win.

1488
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,800
- Dusty.

1489
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,903
- I would have to root
for my New York queen Aquaria.

1490
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:54,171
She is someone who came in

1491
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,673
and had the biggest
transformation as a person.

1492
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,242
She's so kind,
she's so generous now.

1493
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,111
I would even give her
Miss Congeniality

1494
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,479
with the crown, really.
- Amen.

1495
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,314
- Thank you, Dusty.
- Yuhua.

1496
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,682
- I would have to pick Eureka.

1497
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,317
She's fucking fierce.

1498
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,685
- Monique.

1499
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,554
- I said everybody
black and Aquaria,

1500
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:12,022
so I want Asia O'Hara to win

1501
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:17,260
because we need the example
of what she is as a person.

1502
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,629
She's the queen I wanted to be,
and she's my queen.

1503
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,031
- I love you.

1504
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:22,366
- Miz Cracker.

1505
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,968
- Came for me, came for me,
sent me home, Eureka.

1506
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,904
Eureka, you win
by the process of elimination.

1507
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,106
- [laughs]

1508
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,540
- Blair?

1509
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,009
- I think Asia O'Hara has such
an amazing voice behind her,

1510
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,312
and I would love
to see her take that crown.

1511
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:36,513
- Monet.

1512
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,015
- I would have to pick
Asia O'Hara.

1513
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,885
She's someone who did this
competition with her heart.

1514
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,186
- Vanjie.

1515
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,621
- I'm gonna pick Eureka,
'cause she is someone

1516
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,057
who's been checking on me
all the time constantly.

1517
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:48,158
She's a good sister to me,

1518
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,527
and I think
you deserve it as well.

1519
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,628
- I love you.

1520
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,331
- All will be revealed
in one week

1521
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,967
at the grand finale
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

1522
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,202
Now I wanna hear from the fans.

1523
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:03,039
This is your last chance
to let me know

1524
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,010
who should be crowned
America's next drag superstar.

1525
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,380
Are you #TeamAquaria,

1526
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,449
#TeamAsia,

1527
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:14,851
#TeamEureka,

1528
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:18,321
or #TeamKameron.

1529
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:21,792
Get posting on all your
social media and let me know.

1530
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,960
Ladies, I want to thank
all of you

1531
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:28,064
for sharing the love,
strength, and wisdom.

1532
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,633
I may be the host of this show,

1533
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:32,469
but you, all of you,
are my teachers.

1534
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,538
Thank you.

1535
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:38,875
I'll see everyone in one week
at the grand finale.

1536
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,710
Now, if you can't love yourself,

1537
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,746
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1538
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,181
Can I get an amen up in here?

1539
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,182
- Amen!
- Amen!

1540
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:46,917
- Now let the music play.
