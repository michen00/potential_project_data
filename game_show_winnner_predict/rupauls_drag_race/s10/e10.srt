1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,869
- Previously
on "RuPaul's Drag Race"...

2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:05,339
You'll be starring
in "Breastworld."

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,541
- Cock-a-doodle do me, Daddy.

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,843
- Cock-a-doodle don't!

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,111
[both laugh]

6
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,114
- I've been wrong about
gay people and drag queens.

7
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,287
- Kameron Michaels.

8
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,656
- We were trying to get you
to give us different layers,

9
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:25,392
and if you saw,
it kind of didn't happen.

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,027
- Eureka.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,295
- I felt that
you weren't connected.

12
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:29,863
- And that's frustrating,

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,833
because I just know
how good you are.

14
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,301
- Asia O'Hara.

15
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:36,637
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

16
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,938
[applause]

17
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,307
Kameron Michaels, Eureka.

18
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:45,779
That is what you call
a lip sync for your life,

19
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,949
and that is why no one
is going home tonight.

20
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,083
- Thank you so much.

21
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,618
- Thank you.

22
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,921
[applause]

23
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,498
- Whew!

24
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:07,568
Couldn't get rid of us,
could they, Kameron?

25
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,703
We said, nope, not today.

26
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:11,004
- We are the top six again?

27
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,339
I mean, I was really hopeful

28
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,141
that going back
into the workroom

29
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:15,609
that it would
just be five of us,

30
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,044
but not so lucky.

31
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,779
- I'm tired of being ugly.

32
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,115
- Girl, I'm tired
of being terrified.

33
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:26,086
Oh, my God, that was so much.

34
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,522
Me and Kameron survive.
We're hear another week.

35
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,524
Thank motherfucking God.

36
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,626
- Congratulations to you two.
- Congratulations.

37
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:35,028
- That was a lip sync
for your life.

38
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,363
- We did that, bitch.

39
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,464
- Two country bitches

40
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,066
on a whirlwind adventure
to the top, bitch.

41
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,500
- Didn't we hit the splits
at the same time?

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,536
- I think we did.

43
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,137
- I mean,
it's that part of the song

44
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,739
where everyone would do a split.

45
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,741
- Wow.

46
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:48,742
- [laughs]

47
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:49,876
- Aquaria of course

48
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,712
wants to take everything
straight to negativity.

49
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,314
You seem really upset
about this.

50
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,849
- I guess I am.

51
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,518
I don't know.
I've never liked in past seasons

52
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,020
when they've kept two people.

53
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,155
And especially putting
my effort in yesterday,

54
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,491
I wish that we could
keep rolling along

55
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,993
with the competition.

56
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,996
I just think that how we've been
throughout the whole competition

57
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:11,098
should have some--

58
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,833
- Girl, I am so lost.

59
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,469
- I know. I've been kicking ass
all fucking competition,

60
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,671
and I'm mad that I can't
go on to the top five now

61
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,440
because there's people
who've been--no shade--

62
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,042
but people who've been
skating by.

63
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,210
- So who do you think
should have went home?

64
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,848
- I know that she's
talking about me.

65
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,683
I find that funny

66
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,120
because I won
last week's challenge.

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,956
But to my knowledge,
Cracker hasn't won,

68
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,624
so I don't need
to sit on this couch

69
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,893
and defend myself.

70
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,695
- I just...
The last two episodes--

71
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,398
- Girl, I'm sorry,
but that is so narcissistic.

72
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,500
For you to correlate
them two staying

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,368
from you being further away
from the crown,

74
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,137
And it's so irritating to me

75
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,972
that you turned it
into something about you

76
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:53,807
when this
has nothing to do with you.

77
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,208
It's just ridiculous.

78
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,977
A bitch can't even get
a second chance around here,

79
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,012
but some salty ass ho
trying to make it about her.

80
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,149
And then on top of that--
I'm not done.

81
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,018
And then on top of that,
if you do think that,

82
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,687
bitch, have the decency
to keep that shit to yourself.

83
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,589
- I mean, I've skated by
the last, like--

84
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,691
- According to Aquaria,
you have skated by.

85
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,060
- I've heard that from a lot
of girls in this competition.

86
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,294
- Like who? Who?

87
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,662
Say names.
Don't say a lot of girls.

88
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,298
- I know that I'm not
the only person who's said that.

89
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,334
I don't want to bring
other girls into it,

90
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:22,869
but y'all can rewind the tapes.

91
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,539
Kameron's been playing
an extremely safe game.

92
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,941
- Well, regardless,
me and Kameron

93
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,643
are both extremely happy
to be here.

94
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,812
- I'm happy to be here.

95
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,246
- And I'm happy
for y'all to be here, too.

96
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,581
Unlike other people.

97
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,116
- My only thing to you

98
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,285
is like let's say that this
was like Miss Continental,

99
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,854
and your top two both
like turned it out.

100
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,589
Somebody still has to win.
You see what I'm saying?

101
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,858
So that's where I can see
from Aquaria's side.

102
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,126
- Part of it is, you know,

103
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,096
you only have that
one lucky save a season,

104
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,730
if there is one.
- Says who?

105
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,766
I feel like
your perception of drag

106
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:56,403
is limited to what
you have seen on "Drag Race."

107
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,838
- I don't think
that's true at all.

108
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,807
- Who says there's only
one magic double save?

109
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,309
Like they could do that again.

110
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,911
- I'm just frustrated
that I might not have

111
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,281
that type of mercy
in the future.

112
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,218
- Aquaria, you are doing
a great job up until this point.

113
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,486
Keep on doing that,

114
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,954
and then you won't have
to worry about lip synching.

115
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,122
Just keep on doing you,

116
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,156
and we're all going
to keep on doing us,

117
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,390
and I'll keep on
not winning challenges,

118
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,892
and Asia's just gonna
keep on winning them.

119
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:23,096
- Girl, I'm gonna be the first
winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race--"

120
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,397
- To never win a challenge.
- To never win a challenge.

121
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,066
I'll be like, bam!

122
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,200
- [laughs]

123
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,301
Anyway, let's go de-drag.

124
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,436
- Bitch, y'all gonna be over it

125
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,670
when two Tennessee bitches
are top three.

126
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,805
- Girl.

127
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,007
- I will fight tooth and nail

128
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,576
before I let the top three
be all from New York.

129
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,112
Team Tennessee will fight
to the bitter end.

130
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,714
I do think that it's time

131
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,883
for either Aquaria or Cracker
to be in the bottom two.

132
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,117
- Ow.

133
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,186
- Girl, I'm sending
one of y'all asses home.

134
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,558
- Titties. Titties.

135
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,594
- The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

136
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,263
receives a one-year supply

137
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,431
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

138
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,335
and a cash prize of $100.000.

139
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,639
With extra special guest judges
Miles Heizer

140
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,240
and Lizzo.

141
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,542

142
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,943

- Team Tennessee.
- Team Tennessee.

147
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,023
- It's a new day.

148
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,258
It's very surreal
to still be here.

149
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,160
My goal coming
into this competition

150
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,496
was I didn't want
to go home first.

151
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,166
But I feel a lot more optimistic
about my chances

152
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,368
now that there are less girls.

153
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,770
I want to make it
as far as I can.

154
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,606
- I feel like this looks
awful similar to last week.

155
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,441
- I'm just happy to be here.

156
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,610
- If I may, I was, you know--

157
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,445
this competition is so like
mentally and emotionally

158
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,613
and physically draining.

159
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:50,483
And top five is like--
was a very goal for me.

160
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,887
But my apologies for making
y'all feel whatever way.

161
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,524
To get to be the top six
for another week is just as fun.

162
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,027
I just realized that,
you know, what I said,

163
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,963
whether I think it's true

164
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,097
or whether other people
agree with me,

165
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,633
I just wish
I could have like expressed

166
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,802
how I was feeling about that

167
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,104
without hurting
people's feelings.

168
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,773
And Asia, thank you
for checking me

169
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,075
and putting me in line.

170
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,211
And let's slay today.

171
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,846
- Yeah.
- Let's slay today.

172
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,082
[alarm]
- Ooh, girl.

173
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,352
She done already
done had herses.

174
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,921
My queens, do over others

175
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,856
as you would have them
do over you.

176
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,726
Better to have tucked and lost

177
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,894
than never
to have tucked before.

178
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,431
And a wig in the hand
is worth two in the bush,

179
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,035
because technically
a wig in a bush is a merkin.

180
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,137
Don't Google that.

181
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,873
- Oh, Lord Jesus.

182
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,208
- Hello, hello, hello.

183
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,442
[cheers and applause]

184
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,944
Hi, ladies.

185
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,979
Now, we all know
that you're experts

186
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,482
at serving some serious womana.

187
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,686
But how good are you at
taking it to the other extreme?

188
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,321
[all laugh]

189
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,757
Now, for today's
mini challenge,

190
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,028
I want you to create
a super macho character,

191
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,297
and then you'll pose

192
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:14,034
for a manly body spray
I'm calling...

193
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,268
[deep voice] Trade.

194
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,304
[laughter]
- Holy fuck.

195
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,572
- It's made from essential oils

196
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,108
found exclusively
at truck stop restrooms.

197
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,543
[all laugh]

198
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,712
Mm.

199
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:26,813
- [laughs]

200
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,449
- [deep voice] So, bros,
let's do this now.

201
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,717
[bell dings]

202
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:31,751
- Go.
- Oh!

203
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,991
- Girl,
I'm gonna look like Mario.

204
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,460
- Oh.
- Nippies.

205
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,598
- Trade is non-feminine, butch,
like attractive males,

206
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,233
like, ooh,
that's a boy that's fine

207
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,202
that I want to get
all up in my buttercups.

208
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,236
You know what I mean?

209
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,639
- Okay, dudes.
Time's up.

210
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,708
First up, Kameron Michaels.

211
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,177
[laughs]

212
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:59,479
- Been chopping wood?
- [deep voice] Chopping wood.

213
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,349
- [laughs] So I'm gonna
have you say taglines

214
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,617
that we're testing out
for this body spray.

215
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,020
- Can you smell me coming?
Trade.

216
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,421
- Very good.

217
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,789
- Can I take it off
for the ladies?

218
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,491
- Sure, yeah, why not? Yeah.

219
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,592
That'd be great.

220
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,994
- Do you wanna see
all the wood? Trade.

221
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,697
- [laughs]
- Smell all this wood.

222
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,798
Trade.

223
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,700
- Nice, nice.

224
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,669
All right.
Thank you very much.

225
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,972
Hey, maybe we can go chop
some wood together sometime.

226
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,407
- I believe that's doable.

227
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,275
- [laughs]

228
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,478
I believe that's doable?

229
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,947
[both laugh]
- I can't.

230
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,349
- Trade. Spray it
all over your face.

231
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,284
Just don't get any in your eye.

232
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,020
- [laughs] Can you get
a deeper voice there?

233
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,789
- Trade [snort snort].

234
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,592
- [laughs]

235
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,394
- You like that?
- All right, bro.

236
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,295
Thanks a lot.
What's your name?

237
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,530
- Randy.

238
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,998
- Are you randy?
- I am.

239
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,100
Randy the Woodchuck.
- [laughs]

240
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,536
- All T, all Trade.

241
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,938
- Yeah, you've got a little
twist in your hip there.

242
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,173
- No.
- Can you take that out?

243
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,575
- All T, all Trade.

244
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,311
- [laughs] You're giving it
a little twist at the end

245
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,980
that's kind of like, hey.
- Oh, no.

246
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,281
- Shit. Gotta slap
that shit out me.

247
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,883
- Yeah, yeah,
get that out of there.

248
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,818
- All T, all Trade.

249
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,987
- Can you put one hand on--
between me down there?

250
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,955
- Down here?
It's real long.

251
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,690
- All right. [laughs]

252
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,760
I think you could be
America's Next Chopped Model.

253
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,228
What's happening, man?

254
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,064
- All right, I'm feeling good.
How about you?

255
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,366
- I'm doing real good.
What's your name?

256
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,334
- I'm BJ.
- What does that stand for?

257
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,804
- Well, it stands
for being a jokester.

258
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,173
- [laughs]
Here we go.

259
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:37,577
- I don't think y'all are ready
for this smell. Trade.

260
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,746
- [laughs] Nice.

261
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,548
- Yeah, you like that?
- Yeah, that's nice.

262
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:42,916
- Yeah, the wife likes it, too.

263
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,884
[all laugh]

264
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,386
- I want you to try on
another tagline.

265
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:47,787
Say it with it
with a deeper voice.

266
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,389
- Deeper?
- Yeah.

267
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,257
- [deep voice] Deeper like this?
- Yeah. There you go.

268
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,026
- All right, all right,
all right.

269
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:56,362
Pull my finger. Trade.

270
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,764
- [laughs]

271
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,199
- Told you I'm a jokester.

272
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,402
- The future belongs to those
who can smell it coming.

273
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,536
[all laugh]

274
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,706
- If you're looking
for Trade, I'm it.

275
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,675
- [laughs] Think butch.

276
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,911
This is for manly men
who love manly things.

277
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,848
- Smell me. Trade.

278
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,316
- Can you go any deeper?

279
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,785
- [deep voice] Is this deeper?
- [laughs] Yeah.

280
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,253
- Smell me.

281
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,888
That's Trade.

282
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,090
- The Trade of it all.

283
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,626
- Trade, spray it
all over your face.

284
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,094
Just don't get it in your eye.

285
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,163
- Yeah, I want you to say it
really butch, like--

286
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,965
- Really butch?
I ain't butch enough, dude?

287
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,399
- Yeah, no, not butch enough.
- All right.

288
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,069
Trade. Spray it
all over your face.

289
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,570
Just don't get it in your mouth.

290
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,572
[all laugh]

291
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,374
- Very close.
Say it sexier.

292
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,610
- Trade. Can you smell me?

293
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,445
- Yeah. Lick your lips
like LL Cool J.

294
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,646
- All right. All right. Cool.
- And then say it, all right?

295
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,816
- Trade, can you smell me?

296
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,018
- Yeah, that's it right there.

297
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,286
- So I got the job or what?

298
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,420
- We'll call you.

299
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,456
- All right, I ain't got
no phone, though.

300
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:00,059
- Dang, y'all
some real rough Trade.

301
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:05,098
But one of you really put
your stank on this challenge.

302
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,868
BJ. I mean Eureka.

303
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,071
- Oh! Old Smelly Trade.

304
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,809
- [laughs] You won a $2.000
gift card from MuLondon.

305
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,145
- Ooh.
- Hey.

306
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,781
- You know, they say that social
media is taking over the world,

307
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,485
but this week,
"RuPaul's Drag Race"

308
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,621
is going to take over
the whole internet.

309
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:33,459
Say hello to some of today's
hottest social media stars.

310
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,965
- Tyler Oakley.

311
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,633
[cheers]

312
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,602
- Chester See.

313
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,803
[cheers and applause]

314
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,371
- Kingsley.

315
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,539
[cheers and applause]

316
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,641
- Anthony Padilla.

317
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,742
[cheers and applause]

318
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,277
- Raymond Braun.

319
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,179
[cheers and applause]

320
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,014
- Frankie Grande.

321
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,316
- Oh!
[cheers and applause]

322
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,017
- Oh, my God.

323
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,954
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

324
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,155
We're doing
a makeover challenge.

325
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:10,863
- Ladies, you'll be transforming
these kings of social media

326
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,100
into flawless drag queens.

327
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,636
[cheers and applause]

328
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,739
- Y'all need to put the glam
in their Instagram.

329
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,174
[all laugh]
- All right.

330
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,009
- Some glitter on their Twitter.

331
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,811
[all laugh]

332
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:28,815
And strap on
some big old boobies

333
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,183
on their YouTubies.

334
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,884
[all laugh]

335
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,121
So, Eureka, you won
the mini challenge.

336
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,323
You get to match the queens...

337
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,491
- Oh.

338
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,461
- With the social media kings.

339
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,163
- RuPaul has mentioned
that he wants to see us

340
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,766
pushing strategy,
making decisions

341
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,501
that pushes us
to the front line.

342
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,269
- So you got you assigned
the roles.

343
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,338
Were you strategic with it?

344
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,973
- Um, not necessarily.

345
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,408
- Not necessarily.
Is that smart?

346
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,878
- If you're not gonna work
every win to your advantage,

347
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,180
then you're not
playing the game.

348
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,916
And that's coming from
the horse's mouth herself.

349
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,786
- Who gets Tyler Oakley?

350
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,988
- I think I'm gonna
give Tyler to Monet.

351
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,491
- Yes, girl.

352
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,459
Tyler Oakley.

353
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,861
- Who gets Chester See?

354
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,998
- Chester, I think
I will give to Cracker.

355
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,733
- Hi, darling.
Come here.

356
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,734
[applause]

357
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,569
- Who gets Kingsley?

358
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,905
- Kingsley is going to go
to Aquaria.

359
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,440
I'm gonna give Aquaria someone

360
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,375
that might be harder
for her to do makeup on.

361
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,644
I know the looks
are gonna be on point,

362
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,813
so maybe she'll struggle
with his makeup.

363
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,348
- Anthony I'm gonna give
to Kameron.

364
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,551
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.

365
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,453
- Just 'cause I feel like
I would watch that video.

366
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,655
[all laugh]

367
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,257
- Who gets Raymond Braun?

368
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,059
- I'm gonna give him to Asia.

369
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,627
- Come on over.
- Asia. How are you?

370
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,463
- How are you?

371
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,465
- That means Frankie
goes to Eureka.

372
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,500
- Oh. Yay.
[applause]

373
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,870
And I choose Frankie Grande.

374
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,441
She looks like she has too much
energy for her own good,

375
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,410
and I say clearly
that is my partner.

376
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,145
Perfect.
We can do lips, we can--

377
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,580
- I know. We can.

378
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,849
- Mayday, mayday, man down.

379
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,351
Eureka O'Hara, bad choice, girl.

380
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,121
Frankie is a big personality.
Frankie's very loud.

381
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,889
Frankie is like bouncing
all over the room.

382
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,559
I feel like it's just
a recipe for disaster.

383
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,130
- Now, you can use materials
from the Mood fabric wall,

384
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,867
Fierce! drag jewels,
and of course, your own drag.

385
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,871
Just make sure there's a strong
drag family resemblance.

386
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,707
Gentlemen, start your engines,

387
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,810
and may the best woman win.

388
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,179
[cheers and applause]

389
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,648
- I am beyond excited
to be your sister.

390
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,083
- Oh, my God.
- We're gonna make this happen.

391
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,752
I'm here to do
whatever you want.

392
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,588
- Makeovers are not my favorite.
I'm not going to lie.

393
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,457
However, I am
a great pageant coach.

394
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,960
So the first thing we do
is open up some dialogue,

395
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,027
see where we're at.

396
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,496
What do you know about drag?

397
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,797
- I've seen every episode
of "Drag Race."

398
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,699
- Great.
- Some of them a couple times.

399
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,900
- Great.
- "Untucked."

400
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,102
It's like walking
into a dream right now.

401
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,005
- So who are some of your
favorite past "Drag Race" stars?

402
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,373
So I kind of get an idea.

403
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,876
- I think that my ultimate
favorite is Latrice Royale.

404
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,044
- Done. We're good.

405
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,614
- For me, it's about the heart,
and I think that drag queens

406
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,982
are like saints
in our community.

407
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,250
- Absolutely.
- They give us hope,

408
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,452
they make us feel happy,
they make us feel inspired,

409
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,653
and it's about the way
that you make people feel

410
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,721
while you're in drag.

411
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,756
- It's a match made in heaven.

412
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,491
It's a match made in heaven.

413
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,093
Hope the other bitches
hear that.

414
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,295
Raymond's
a perfect partner for me.

415
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,632
Our energy instantaneously
is connected.

416
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,300
I like body suits.

417
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,102
I like things that are stretchy,
that form to the body.

418
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,136
- I feel like I should
put something on right now

419
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,204
that reflects you.

420
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,172
- I feel like
you definitely should.

421
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,941
- Ooh, I love this.

422
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,678
- So Raymond sees this sequined
jacket, and his eyes light up.

423
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,114
- [gaps] Oh, my gosh.

424
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,587
I see you, Eureka.
I see you looking.

425
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:57,990
[laughs]

426
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,058
You nervous?
- Uh-huh.

427
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,326
- You should be.

428
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,528
- He is shining in this garment,

429
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,863
and I want him to be in
what he wants to wear.

430
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,399
So I'm going to have
to make our coat.

431
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,967
Not where I was going with this,

432
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,869
but that's where
we're gonna go now.

433
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,507
- I'm so happy that you're here.
- Thank you.

434
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,309
- I'm happy that
I get to make you over

435
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,810
into a fabulous drag queen.

436
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,614
- Like, this is legitimate
bucket list shit.

437
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,850
- [laughs] I'm like really
happy that I get Tyler Oakley.

438
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,453
He's very like free spirited.
He's like down for anything.

439
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,555
So I need to know.
Have you ever done drag before?

440
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,257
- I have never performed,

441
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:32,792
but I've gotten
like my face done.

442
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,126
- Have you ever walked in heels?

443
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,395
[both laugh]

444
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,496
So you know my name
is Monet X Change.

445
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,865
You're Tyler Oakley,
you're short.

446
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,400
And what do you think of--
I'm just throwing this out.

447
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,969
I just thought about it,
Short Change.

448
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,170
- Short Change?
[both laugh]

449
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,404
I love it, I love it,
I love it.

450
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,507
- I'm the only X Change
that exists in the world.

451
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,776
My tubes have been tied
up until this point,

452
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,212
so he should feel very lucky
and privileged

453
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,016
that he's part of
the awesome X Change, darling.

454
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,184
- I love it.
- Do you?

455
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,685
- Yes.
[both laugh]

456
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,156
- Monet and Tyler
are doing a lot of laughing,

457
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,326
a lot of giggling,
but I'm not sure

458
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,830
Monet is going to be able
to pull this one off.

459
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,900
Let me tell you, girl,
Monet is a hoot, but--

460
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,368
- You're going to tell me
exactly what's happening.

461
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,702
- Monet's drag,

462
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,671
it's a little peculiar
from time to time.

463
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,273
- This is when
we just take our cup of tea

464
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,607
and we say I can't wait to see
how this turns out.

465
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,608
- Yes, yes.

466
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,378
- How do you feel about drag?

467
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,879
- I haven't seen
a lot of the show.

468
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,880
I know of the show.

469
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,848
- Right.

470
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:29,949
- My ex-girlfriend loved it,

471
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:30,883
and it was always on
in the background.

472
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,585
- Oh, so you're a heterosexual.

473
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,420
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't worry about it.

474
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,855
This is an accepting
environment.

475
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,990
I accept your lifestyle.

476
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,292
Do you love drag?

477
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,893
Do you want to find out
more about it?

478
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,229
- Oh, yeah, well,
that's why I'm so excited.

479
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,097
Because you're gonna
teach me everything.

480
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,465
- Okay. All right.
- I assume, right?

481
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,401
- Are you familiar with tucking?

482
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,604
- I mean, I think the word
is sort of--

483
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,772
- Yeah.

484
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,006
- I think I get it, yeah.

485
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,475
- Well, just to put it in
the baldest terms,

486
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,078
so what I do
is I just take duct tape

487
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,481
and I pull everything back...
- Oh, wow.

488
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,884
- Between my legs
so I look like a lady.

489
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:08,821
- Okay.

490
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,724
- I feel like I have a bigger
challenge than everyone else.

491
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,893
Chester looks like
he should not do drag.

492
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,062
Chester is straight,
he has a beard,

493
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,564
and on top of it,
he seems super shy.

494
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:23,603
For me, I'm a lady that likes
big hair and making jokes,

495
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,439
but most of all, I like
making people happy with drag.

496
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,308
But I think if there's anyone
that can be an ambassador

497
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,212
for what makes drag wonderful,
it's me.

498
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,915
- What can you already do?

499
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,249
You've walked in heels.

500
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,185
- Yeah, well, I've--
definitely heels.

501
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,787
I played a woman in a show
called "Pageant the Musical."

502
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,022
- Tell me a little bit
more about that.

503
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,624
- Okay.
- About you, too.

504
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,325
Like, let's hear about you.
- Okay, perfect.

505
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,494
I love talking about myself.

506
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,729
[both laugh]

507
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,197
I started on Broadway.

508
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,365
I was in "Mamma Mia"
on Broadway.

509
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:57,069
Then I moved out to LA
to pursue the dream,

510
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,771
and the dream was not coming,

511
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,007
so I decided to start
a YouTube channel.

512
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,075
Two and a half years
I posted two videos a week,

513
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,412
and then eventually
I got "Big Brother."

514
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,849
- Frankie is known
for being on "Big Brother."

515
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,985
He's actually
Arianna Grande's big brother,

516
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,654
and his sister has even
been a judge on the show.

517
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,590
- This is the best day
of my life.

518
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,791
I'm not lying.

519
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,227
- What does she think
about you doing this?

520
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,361
- She's ecstatic.

521
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,996
She knows like
it's been a dream of mine.

522
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,765
Listen, I watch the show a lot.
I'm like a huge fan.

523
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,433
Like I've always wanted
to compete on the show,

524
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,402
but I don't--
I can't do anything myself.

525
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,404
I can't sew.
I can't do my face.

526
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,606
So now I get to compete
on the show and not do anything,

527
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,041
'cause you have to do it for me.

528
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,542
[both laugh]

529
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,144
- I love that.

530
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,979
- So you are famous on...

531
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,847
- On YouTube.
- Do you watch the show?

532
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,016
- I have watched it
occasionally.

533
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,119
My girlfriend is a huge fan.

534
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,522
So, yeah, I watch it
over her shoulder.

535
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,790
- Cool.
- Yeah.

536
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,526
- I'm really apprehensive
around straight men,

537
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,395
just because when I was younger,
I was made fun of and bullied,

538
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,565
and a lot of that
was by straight men.

539
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,167
So it should be interesting.

540
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:04,236
My drag is like hyper feminine.

541
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,472
- What's hyper feminine mean?

542
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,742
- I want something
kind of sparkly and flowy.

543
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,777
- Right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

544
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:22,221
- I just see Kameron and Anthony
just, yeah, bro, oh.

545
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,590
- Well, we have our work
cut out for us, I think.

546
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,724
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

547
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,226
- Cool.
- Yeah.

548
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,861
- So I think that is not going
to fare well on the runway,

549
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,963
because it's going to be
very transparent

550
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,431
that they have no chemistry
together.

551
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,301
- Yeah.

552
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,836
- Today's maxi challenge

553
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,740
is to do drag makeovers
on social media influencers.

554
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,642
I want to get
a little bit to know--

555
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,144
get to know you a little bit.

556
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,579
I'm also horrible
at speaking, so...

557
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,248
- It's okay.
I am from Missouri.

558
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,183
I started making videos

559
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,487
because I couldn't find
anyone around me

560
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:58,023
that cared about like
Britney and Madonna

561
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,558
and like pop culture
and award shows.

562
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,093
And it was like the internet
was just this place

563
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,662
to find people
that have similar interests.

564
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,731
And I just built
this career out of it.

565
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,333
- Kingsley is a YouTube star,

566
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,002
and he has like
a bajillion YouTube followers

567
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,438
and almost as many
Twitter followers,

568
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,273
and he makes lots of videos.

569
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,175
- I've never been
put in drag before.

570
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,676
- Have you really?
- No, like, never.

571
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,479
- I definitely have
a good eye for makeup.

572
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,148
- Do you have my shade?
Like are you nervous?

573
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,315
Is this going to work out?

574
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,717
- Oh, I'm very comfortable

575
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,252
with putting other people
in drag.

576
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,554
And it's like the least
of my worries.

577
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,390
I think Eureka
was trying to be strategic

578
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,526
by pairing me
with a person of color,

579
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,195
but I've done makeup
on people of color before,

580
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,598
so this is not something
that scares me whatsoever.

581
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,801
- Would you be into trying on
a pair of heels right now?

582
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,470
- Yeah. Are they
supposed to hurt this way?

583
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,105
- Yeah. Oh, absolutely.
- Ow!

584
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,773
- The first thing we tackled
is walking in heels.

585
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,341
Raymond's not too bad.

586
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,110
- Oh, fuck.
- He can use a little work,

587
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,580
but he's not as bad
as some of the other guys.

588
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,315
- I wanna see this walk.
Let me see what--

589
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,483
- No. You can't make me do that.

590
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,218
- Oh, no, oh, we're taking you

591
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,619
all the way out
of your comfort zone.

592
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,189
Tyler has never really
worn heels before,

593
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,425
and he is trying his best.

594
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,360
I believe in you, Short Change.

595
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,864
Careful. You are walking
down Fifth Avenue.

596
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,233
I think actually, hello.

597
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,502
All right, Miss Short Change.

598
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,172
For the most part, he has it
somewhat together.

599
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,774
You're gliding, oh.
- [laughs]

600
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:24,009
- Girl. Whew...

601
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,811
- [laughs]

602
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,746
- Any guy who starts walking
in heels for the first time,

603
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,481
they always do
like the fierce face.

604
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,716
They do like...

605
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,518
And you try to do that
in the heels,

606
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,286
and I'm like, no, girl,
do not do all that.

607
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,721
Being sexy on the runway
and having fun

608
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,756
is what's really going
to give the essence

609
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,793
of the X Change family secret.

610
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,095
- Hi-ee.

611
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,763
- Hi!
- Hello.

612
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,199
- How are my internet
sweeties doing?

613
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,934
- Good.
- Great.

614
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,836
- Well, hello, Cracker.
- Hello, Ru.

615
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,271
- Chester See, when you
walked in the workroom,

616
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,539
my first thought was,

617
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,608
well, that one right there
won't need no padding.

618
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:56,875
- [laughs]
- Oh, I know.

619
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,077
She's shapely.

620
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,144
- Are you talking about
down here?

621
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,279
- Oh, yeah.

622
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,114
- I'll take it.
[laughs]

623
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,750
- Why do you think the universe
or Eureka--same thing--

624
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,051
paired you two together?

625
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,187
- I think Eureka was only
thinking about herself,

626
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,356
and she chose the one
that was already in drag.

627
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,025
- [laughs]

628
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,860
So what is your biggest fear
in this challenge?

629
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,895
- This is actually my fear
right here.

630
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,731
I've never walked in heels,

631
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,932
so I don't know how
to walk in those,

632
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,367
and that's a big part of this.
- No, no, no.

633
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,269
You need to go over there
and try some shoes on.

634
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:27,273
And try some ones on
that make you want to go, hey.

635
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,742
I'm a woman, baby.

636
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,443
Yeah!

637
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,711
You know, because you are
a little bit reserved.

638
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,013
Where does that come from?

639
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,247
- This is all
a new experience for me.

640
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,082
So it's a lot of excitement.

641
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,984
There's just like
a lot going on.

642
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,788
- You're looking at a person
that has a reserve to them,

643
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,490
and a little trouble opening up.

644
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,091
- I know you do,
but what about him?

645
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,660
- [laughs]

646
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,528
I think that there's--
we have a similar vibe.

647
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:50,562
I'm the same way.

648
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,697
- Why do you think that is?

649
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,299
- I want to do everything
perfect,

650
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,067
and the wheels
are always turning.

651
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:58,437
- I think that you are on the
outside looking at yourself,

652
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,973
making sure
that people see you

653
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,575
the way that you're comfortable
with them seeing you.

654
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,011
- Right.
- And you've got to let that go.

655
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,747
I saw "Dear Evan Hansen"
on Broadway

656
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:12,718
and Ben Platt, who plays Dear,
he gave everything.

657
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,953
You could see spit coming out,
and he was--

658
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:19,091
there were tears,
and he gave everything he had.

659
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,660
Drag allows you to be that free.

660
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,329
You'll learn who you are.

661
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,831
You'll see
the other side of Chester.

662
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,032
Oh, that's your book title.

663
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,600
- The other side of Chester?
- Pay me later.

664
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,803
- I like it.
- The back cover is your butt.

665
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,706
- Yeah. No, the front cover
is that ass.

666
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,275
All right, so you bitches
put on some heels,

667
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,344
and go snap some
motherfucking trophies.

668
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,146
"Dear Evan Hansen" in the
motherfucking house, bitch.

669
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,915
- I'm gonna spit on your face,
you're gonna spit on my face.

670
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,583
- All right, I'll see y'all
asses out there.

671
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,617
- Thank you, Ru.
- See you.

672
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,619
- Well, hello there.

673
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:48,787
- Hey, Ru.
- Hi, Ru.

674
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,788
- Monet and Tyler.

675
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,023
- Yes.
- Hi.

676
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:54,393
- So, Tyler, what makes
a great social media star?

677
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:56,428
- I think a lot of what makes
a good social media star

678
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:57,763
makes a good drag queen,

679
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,099
because you have to play
a lot of different roles,

680
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,867
and you have to connect
with people.

681
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,402
I think it's always
about connection.

682
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,537
- Tyler, you have a fat ass,
don't you?

683
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,539
- Ma'am!

684
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,475
- No, you're with two black men.

685
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,610
That's a good thing.
- Thank you.

686
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,146
I will say
I have no complaints so far.

687
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,681
- Yeah, because
that will actually

688
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,150
help you in this challenge.

689
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,151
You're turning beet red now.

690
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,452
- I feel my face.

691
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,487
- Ru, you keep on
calling him Tyler.

692
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,955
He has a name.

693
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,190
- Oh, oh,
what is Tyler's drag name?

694
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,191
- Short Change.

695
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,860
- I love that.

696
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,829
Now remember, when you say
Short Change, do not use the T.

697
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,931
- Shor Change.
- Shor Change.

698
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,366
[all laugh]

699
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,736
- Now, I asked for
a strong family resemblance.

700
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:38,837
So what do you have in common?

701
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,006
- I think that
we are both New Yorkers.

702
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,307
- I'm from LA.

703
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,509
- But I'm saying--

704
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,377
[all laugh]

705
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,446
- Okay, more will be revealed.

706
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,415
Well, you're both Americans.
- Yeah, we're both American.

707
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,484
- Now, you've come under fire
about your esthetic.

708
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:53,786
- That's why we've got
some big hair today.

709
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,355
We gonna get some
big hair up in this gig, Ru.

710
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,956
- No pussycat wigs.

711
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,124
- No pussycat wigs.
- Uh-uh.

712
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,527
You save that for Sunday
and Sunday service.

713
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:02,728
- [laughs]

714
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,029
What is with Ru
and my pussycat wig?

715
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,063
I don't get it.

716
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,298
He gonna get it
when I come out

717
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,734
with my own line
of sponge pussycat wigs.

718
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:11,003
Available on iTunes.

719
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,271
- All right,
I'll see you out there.

720
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,305
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thank you, Ru.

721
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,040
- Shor Change.
- Shor Change.

722
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,276
[both laugh]

723
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,677
- Kameron Michaels.
- Hello.

724
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,979
- You've got quite a challenge
on your hands, don't you?

725
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,214
- I do.
I have a straight man.

726
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,515
- You certainly do.
- Am I challenging?

727
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,516
I'm excited, though.
- You are excited.

728
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,751
- Yeah.

729
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,152
- You've never done drag before.
- Never done drag.

730
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:31,089
- Have you walked Anthony
through what drag is all about?

731
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,991
- I think we talked about,
you know,

732
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,760
what it takes to do drag,
and it's not--

733
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,595
- You think you talked--
Bitch, are you in a coma?

734
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,729
[all laugh]

735
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,765
- We definitely had,
you know, a conversation

736
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,034
about everything that goes into
drag, and it's not easy.

737
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,969
- Okay. What do you two
have in common?

738
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,938
- Well, he's very attractive.

739
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,539
I wouldn't call myself
attractive.

740
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,507
- Imma slap you, bitch.

741
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,842
- You're attractive.
Come on.

742
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,376
He was prancing around
without a shirt on over there.

743
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,511
He knows he's attractive.

744
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,579
- Yeah.

745
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,547
- Well, we're both
a little reserved.

746
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,883
We're kind of like
the same personality type.

747
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,351
- I want you to be prepared

748
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,753
for what's gonna happen
once you get into drag.

749
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,589
- Okay.
- It is so liberating.

750
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,791
You get to do all the things
you ever wanted to do

751
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,060
with none of the repercussions.

752
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,329
Except maybe some STDs.

753
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,763
[all laugh]

754
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,899
Those are easily rectified.

755
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,634
God, did I just say rectified?

756
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,104
When men into drag,
it's like getting boozed up.

757
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:23,542
You never know if you're gonna
be a fun drunk, a mean drunk.

758
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:31,350
Sometimes they become coy,
or sometimes they become, hey!

759
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,019
Now, have you chosen
a drag name for Anthony?

760
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,287
- You know, we were trying
to think of a K or a C name,

761
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,388
and I was having trouble.

762
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,156
- Do you have any ideas
for a drag name?

763
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,158
- Kelly, because it also starts
with a K, and it's androgynous.

764
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,894
- Kelly Michaels.
- I like that.

765
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,530
She's the kind of girl in high
school you'd absolutely hate.

766
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,298
- Yeah.
- Key that bitch's car.

767
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,466
- She sounds like a bitch.

768
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:50,636
- Are you going to the dance,
Kelly Michaels?

769
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,538
- That's an impression of me
as my drag.

770
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,139
[all laugh]

771
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,241
- I'm gonna say that.
I'm gonna say that.

772
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,310
- Being paired with Anthony,

773
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,379
I was a little apprehensive
at first.

774
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:04,850
But I'm learning that
even though he is straight,

775
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,385
he's very sweet and very open

776
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,687
and I can already tell
that we're getting along great.

777
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,022
- All right,
I'll see you out there.

778
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,256
Bye, Kelly.

779
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,991
- Bye.
- Bye.

780
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:13,992
[both laugh]

781
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,029
- Yeah, girl.

782
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,463
- Hey, Asia.
- Hi.

783
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,332
- Practicing your drag
on your friend?

784
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,634
- Yes, ma'am.
- [laughs]

785
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,504
Now, you are
a social media expert.

786
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:26,605
What do you guys have in common?

787
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,273
- We had that instant connection

788
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,008
of wanting to do
so much more with drag

789
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:33,212
than just get on stage and walk
the runway in something sparkly.

790
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,546
- When people think
about social media,

791
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,648
they often think just
me, me, me, what's my viewpoint?

792
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,250
I really like to talk about
messages of empowerment

793
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,618
on social media.

794
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,219
I like to encourage people
to get involved politically,

795
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,355
to speak out about issues
that they care about,

796
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:46,491
and to just really try to foster
community among LGBTQ people.

797
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,293
- That's lovely.
That's wonderful.

798
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,195
Now, I'm seeing
a lot of closed toes

799
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,331
up here on the way.

800
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:55,601
Now, you know there's certain
tricks for first timers.

801
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:59,705
You know, it's always smart to
wear a vinyl shoe that expands.

802
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:00,872
- We call them acrylic shoes,

803
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,541
and you used to heat them up
with a blow dryer

804
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,642
before you put your foot in it

805
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,810
because it would expand
and hug your shoe.

806
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,811
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

807
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,913
- If it's expandable--
trust me,

808
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,481
if you're standing up
for a long time,

809
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,716
you will thank me later.

810
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:12,117
And I hope these other bitches
are listening.

811
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,752
- Are listening to that.
- Mm-hmm.

812
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,420
- And for the camera people,
operators,

813
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,756
when you go home
and prance around the apartment,

814
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,658
get shoes with expandable--

815
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:20,826
Bitch, you better turn it out.

816
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,327
- Bitch, I'm ready
to turn it out.

817
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:24,296
- Because this one here,
she's a fierce ass queen.

818
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,465
- I want to make
the O'Hara family proud, Ru.

819
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,133
- Good. All right. Well,
I'll see y'all out there.

820
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,234
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Ru.

821
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,769
- Thank you.
- Bye.

822
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,740
- Hi, Eureka.
Where's--oh, my goodness.

823
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,907
My, how you've grown.

824
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,643
- I'm so excited.

825
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,379
This is the most excited
I've ever been in my life.

826
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,880
I've always dreamt
of being here.

827
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,215
I can't believe
this is happening. Anyway...

828
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,383
- Oh, I love it.

829
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,218
Eureka is a big girl.

830
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:50,689
How are you gonna have a strong
family resemblance with Frankie?

831
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:53,859
- I'm gonna have her bodied and
proportionized out of her mind.

832
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,560
- Oh, I love that.

833
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,329
- And she's gonna have on
a little baby loaf.

834
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,098
She is going to be
a little tiny twin Eureka.

835
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,433
- All right.

836
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,503
What are you most afraid of
with this challenge?

837
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,872
- Ooh, expectations.

838
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,775
- Because a lot of people around
the world know who you are,

839
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:12,778
and they're looking for you
to excel at this.

840
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,546
- Right. And I want to,

841
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,915
but, you know,
it's a lot of pressure.

842
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,517
- Yeah. Now tell me this.

843
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,786
What was your strategy
for pairing up the girls?

844
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:25,257
- I paired them up with who
I assumed would be their demise.

845
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:26,558
[all laugh]

846
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,293
- That's the answer
I wanted to hear, bitch.

847
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,761
You know what I'm saying?

848
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,830
- Well, okay, I just can't
come close to that bottom again.

849
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,365
I don't want to be there.
- No.

850
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,400
- I'm here to win.
- Oker.

851
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,536
- So I hope you enjoy
your partners, ladies.

852
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,637
- [laughs]

853
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:39,738
- 'Cause I am loving mine.

854
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,506
[all laugh]

855
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,076
I'm not trying to be shady.
I'm trying to win.

856
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,044
- Well, I can't wait
to see y'all out there.

857
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,112
Make it happen.

858
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:48,213
- All right.
- We will.

859
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,414
- All right.
- Just say make it work.

860
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,383
- I'll say you better work.

861
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,752
[cheering]

862
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,088
- I love you, you crazy psycho.

863
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,222
- I'm so excited.

864
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,057
- Well, hello, there.

865
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,993
Now, I know Aquaria,
bitch, you're fierce.

866
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,862
You know how to put
some shit together.

867
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,263
- Yes, ma'am,
this is very up my alley.

868
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,533
I'm comfortable
doing makeup on others.

869
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,568
- You're versatile.

870
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,970
- The only verse I am
is Versace,

871
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,207
but besides that,
I think I am capable.

872
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,775
- Have you done drag before?
- I have not.

873
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:19,411
- I'm surprised you haven't
been tempted to do it before.

874
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,447
- No, I've been tempted.
I guess maybe fear is the word.

875
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,548
- What's the fear?

876
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,917
- I guess looking dumb.
- Dumb.

877
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,487
- Looking like not
exuding the confidence.

878
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,655
Like drag queens
are some of the most confident

879
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,524
and just fearless figures.

880
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:34,226
It's a lot to live up to.

881
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,461
- You know, in our culture,
men have this thing

882
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,264
about being feminine,
and there's little hang-ups.

883
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,365
And it's in all of us.

884
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,566
Actually even
when I started drag,

885
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,101
I had to go through it
with myself,

886
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,036
to go, oh, my God,
am I going too far?

887
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,138
Let me tell you something.

888
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,206
Life is a banquet,

889
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,710
and most poor suckers
are starving to death.

890
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,180
Get in there
and put some heels on.

891
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,516
Put some false eyelashes on.

892
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,885
- I know, I know, I know.
I need help.

893
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,854
- Listen, bitch, this is
your opportunity to work it.

894
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,056
I am it. Hello.

895
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,726
Imma serve
all of this right here.

896
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,895
Show these bitches.
All right?

897
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,963
- Thank you, Ru. See you.
- All right.

898
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:14,533
All right, ladies.

899
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,935
Now, remember,
the judges will be looking

900
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,039
for a strong
drag family resemblance.

901
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,308
Oh, one more thing.

902
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,377
Almost slipped my mind.

903
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:29,481
Each pair needs to make
a homemade video

904
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:33,385
of my song, "Charisma,
Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent."

905
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,687
Mm-hmm. Yes.

906
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,324
All right, gentleman-ses,
start your engines-ses,

907
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:44,196
and may the best woman-ses
win-ses.

908
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,263
See you later.

909
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,300
- Oh.

910
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,468
- So you try this on,
and just put it on backwards,

911
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,903
and it'll just kind of
hold your stuff down.

912
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,471
Instead of the pussy
in the front,

913
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,940
you put the butt in the front.

914
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,009
And then it kind of like
shapes your cannolas and stuff.

915
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,045
Oh, God,
your balls are enormous.

916
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:03,215
I was like, girl,
you got elephantitis?

917
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,983
What is happening?

918
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,785
Girl, why do you have
two bowling balls

919
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:09,254
in that bag right there?
[laughs]

920
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,655
Pull it all the way up.

921
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,526
Aah! Girl's got more nuts
than face.

922
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:15,660
Okay, that's perf.

923
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,696
So we're just gonna
pull those suckers back,

924
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:20,498
and pull her acorn back,
honey, and be good.

925
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,766
I love that you have big balls.

926
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,335
I think that's a beautiful thing
to tell the world.

927
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,336
- It's my last name,
you know. Yeah.

928
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,337
Frankie Grande.

929
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,672
- Frankie Grande
Big Balls For Days.

930
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,808
- Big Balls For Days.

931
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:31,309
- Okay, here we go.

932
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,811
Are you ready?

933
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,346
[scat singing]

934
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,649
- Would everyone
mind your damn business?

935
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,418
- Reveal, reveal, reveal.

936
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,855
- Yay!

937
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,657
- Raymond, yes, Raymond.

938
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,359
[scat singing]

939
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,627
Category is...

940
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,695
- Turn around and give it
to them one more time.

941
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,931
Let it simmer.
You ain't go the--there you go.

942
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,833
- Out. Aah!

943
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,636
- Watch out for Posh Spice.
- Oh, here we go.

944
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:58,870
- Watch out for Posh.
- Here we go.

945
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,307
- Give it one more.

946
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,642
- God, these shoes are high.

947
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,043
- Whoo!

948
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,145
[all talking at once]

949
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,481
- Oh, my God,
thighs across the board.

950
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,182
Thighs across
the board.

951
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:13,151
[laughing and shouting]

952
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,186
- I feel like everyone
is screaming

953
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,588
and running around
with their partners.

954
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:17,756
There's a lot of excitement,

955
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:19,457
but is there real connection?

956
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,593
I'm having fun with Chester,

957
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,128
but for people
like Chester and I,

958
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,796
fun is pretty subdued,

959
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,666
so we're both trying to break
out of it as much as we can.

960
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,767
- Is that
what we should be doing?

961
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,669
- Let's just enjoy ourselves,
and go.

962
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,171
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

963
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,973
- Oh, I almost fell out.

964
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,810
- There you go.

965
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,246
That's my daughter.
She did such a good job.

966
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,616
My partner and I
really get each other.

967
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:46,851
If we can show that
on the runway,

968
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,286
then we could win,

969
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:49,287
and I deserve a goddamn win.

970
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:56,761
- The time has come.

971
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,897
Yes, yes!

972
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:04,603
- Honey, it is time to turn all
these mens into women-seses.

973
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,838
- You're gonna be a lovely lady.

974
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,641
- Everyone is scrambling,

975
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,243
running around like chickens
with their heads cut off

976
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,647
trying to get these men's
eyebrows tweezed, shaved.

977
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:16,848
It's a lot.

978
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,383
- Beep-beep, y'all.
Pink box--

979
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:21,086
Aah, my big pink box
is getting caught everywhere.

980
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,954
- Aquaria
and that fucking cart.

981
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,356
- She's like damn
flight attendant.

982
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:26,091
[all laugh]

983
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,326
- Do you feel kind of secluded

984
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,229
being over here away
from everyone else?

985
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,630
- I get ready at home by myself.

986
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,265
I don't get ready at the bar
with like the other people.

987
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,367
- Right.

988
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,168
- So this just feels
comfortable to me.

989
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,104
I mean, I love talking
to other girls and stuff,

990
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:40,772
and I'll talk to them
when they walk by,

991
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:44,142
but like I just like
painting by myself.

992
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,845
It's like a ritual of mine.
It's comfortable.

993
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,047
- I was gonna say
they're having so much fun,

994
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,416
but you need to focus
on being diligent.

995
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,351
- Yeah.

996
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,154
- What is like your biggest fear
going into this?

997
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,522
Do you have one?

998
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:01,026
- I just have always kind of
like feared body stuff,

999
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,161
and like showing body.

1000
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,063
Like, that was my biggest fear
on "Amazing Race."

1001
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:06,498
- I didn't know
you did the "Amazing Race."

1002
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,899
- Yeah. I was like petrified

1003
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,634
that they were gonna
make us do something

1004
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,270
like in just our underwear
or something.

1005
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,640
Like that on TV
feels stressful.

1006
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,576
But coming in, I was like,
this will for sure be my fear,

1007
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,745
and it's not, because I saw
what you did to my body,

1008
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,514
and I'm like, work.
- [laughs]

1009
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,115
- I'm like I'm excited for it.

1010
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,316
- Coming here to do this,

1011
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,818
it was a very big fear
for me going in, too.

1012
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,854
I was like, uh, some troll
online is gonna be like

1013
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,824
did y'all see Monet and blah,
blah, bloobity, bipity bop.

1014
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,726
[both laugh]

1015
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,529
- I'm starting to get scared.

1016
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,932
Like I know people from home
are going to watch this

1017
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,367
and what they're gonna think.

1018
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,402
- They're gonna think, bitch,
Aquaria did such a good job.

1019
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,638
Thank God--
thank goodness they won.

1020
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,674
- What was your strategy
with the assignments, Eureka?

1021
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,977
- To lead anyone I could
possibly lead to their demise.

1022
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:54,379
- Including yourself.

1023
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,714
- Aah!

1024
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,949
[laughter and cheering]

1025
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,385
- Yeah!

1026
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,088
- Oh, Monet,
don't even try it, bitch.

1027
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,723
- Yeah, I love it.

1028
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,028
- It worked.

1029
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,763
I'm having a good time.

1030
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:15,500
I almost forgot
that my reputation as a queen

1031
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,235
is on the line today.

1032
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,471
I could not be happier
with Cookie's makeup.

1033
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,739

Yeah, Short Change

She is feeling it,

00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,948
that is all that matters period.

1167

[applause and laughter]

1208
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,134
- All right. You bitches
are bringing it this season.

1209
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,302
So let's get right to it.

1210
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,004
Time for the judges' critiques.

1211
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,073
- Welcome, ladies.

1212
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,875
Time for the judges' critiques.

1213
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:43,681
First up, Asia O'Hara
and America O'Hara.

1214
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,782
- First off,
the video of you guys,

1215
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,384
I love everything about it.

1216
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:49,220
I didn't know who was
the contestant on the show

1217
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,489
and who was the influencer.

1218
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,258
- So did you make these?

1219
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:55,526
- I came with this one,

1220
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,296
and she saw this one hanging,
so I made her one.

1221
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,631
- Could you whip up a third,
darling, just real quick?

1222
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,133
- Yes.
[all laugh]

1223
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,368
- It's stunning. And you know,
with the family resemblance,

1224
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,270
it's transcendent above color.

1225
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,706
It's capturing the essence
of the family member.

1226
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,341
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1227
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:13,311
- Up next, Eureka and Eufreaka.

1228
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,347
- You're both really
dominating personalities

1229
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,482
that some could call extra.

1230
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:22,320
So I was concerned that
it would be all over the place.

1231
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,655
What you did was fantastic.

1232
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,557
- Thank you.
- Yay.

1233
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,859
- The look is just great.
You look like family.

1234
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,795
You told a story up there.

1235
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,229
- And with the video
and on the runway,

1236
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,832
it seems like you guys
have been working together

1237
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,500
for a very long time.

1238
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,868
- That was amazing.

1239
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,170
Y'all fucking--oops.

1240
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,938
[all laugh]

1241
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,341
- Y'all freaking worked--
Eufreaka worked it out.

1242
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:46,110
[all laugh]
- Boom! Hashtag.

1243
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,348
- Up next, Aquaria
and Capricia Corn.

1244
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,983
Oh, my God, that tiny waist.

1245
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:54,785
- This is my favorite makeup
up here.

1246
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,154
I'm here
for the ruby slipper lip.

1247
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,723
- And Capricia Corn
looks beautiful.

1248
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:02,026
But the storylines are telling
me something totally different,

1249
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:04,328
because you're coming out
like the Queen of Hearts,

1250
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,465
and Capricia Corn is
Little House On The Prairie

1251
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:09,200
on indigenous day.

1252
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,736
- I just wanted to, you know,

1253
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:14,605
embody all the regality
and royal--

1254
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,509
I think the word is royalty
of a queen and a princess.

1255
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,411
- When you guys came out,
I didn't quite get that.

1256
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,813
- Honestly, transferring
a little bit more confidence

1257
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,749
over to your partner
would have made us forget

1258
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:28,285
that you look like a fabulous
Little House On The Prairie.

1259
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:33,190
- Up next,
Miz Cracker and Miz Cookie.

1260
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,191
- How is your headpiece?

1261
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,093
- So many complaints.

1262

[all laugh]

1263
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:38,996
- Well, none from me.

1264
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:42,199
It was just fun
and there was a story there

1265
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,467
and I got it.

1266
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,636
- And Cracker,
you did such a great job

1267
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,071
on the hair and the makeup.

1268
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:48,372
The family line is there.

1269
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,207
- And the detail is ridiculous.

1270
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,043
- You look like Marilyn Mon-ho.

1275
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,886
that she's a straight male
out of drag.

1276
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:05,156

a straight female whore.

I would date me,

Down with the thickness.

1289
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,253

1290
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,689
to tell you, Monet,

1291
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,726
how stunningly beautiful
you look tonight.

1292
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:45,129
Why would you ever go back
to your pussycat wig?

1293
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:47,298
- Pussycat wigs.
Jesus Christ.

1294
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,767
- And I really adored
seeing Tyler,

1295
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,069
because he was having
a good time.

1296
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,104
- I had the most fun.

1297
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:54,271
- But it doesn't mean

1298
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,006
the job that you were
supposed to do was done,

1299
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,442
because there is
no family resemblance

00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,777
apart from a pair of glasses.

1301
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:04,081
I felt like you were
taking like your coworker,

1302
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,517
who never gets out,
and you dressed her up,

1303
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,853
and you're like, come on, Stacy,

1304
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:11,055
we're gonna go out
to the local gay bar,

1305
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,556
go see a drag show.

1306
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,860
- I was thinking like you just
met working the same car show.

1307
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,828
[all laugh]
And you're like, oh, my God,

1308
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,631
we both look great
in the uniform.

1309
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,932
Let's go spend
some of our money.

1310
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,868
- Her makeup's not the best,
either, Monet,

1311
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,503
like, her brows
are a little crazy from here.

1312
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,637
- I feel beautiful.

1313
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,172
- I'm glad you do, darling.

1314
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,940
- God bless.

1315
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,543
- I mean,
zero family resemblance.

1316
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:38,382
- Up next, Kameron Michaels
and Kelly Michaels.

1317
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,018
- Are you straight?
- Yes.

1318
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,687
- You like big girls?
[all laugh]

1319
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,256
- Come here,
let's see what you got.

1320
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,357
- Oh, grrrrr.

1321
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,125
[all laugh]

1322
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,827
- The family resemblance thing,

1323
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:53,030
I know not every sibling
has the same color hair,

1324
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:54,632
but when you take it so far

1325
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,801
on the opposite end
of the color spectrum,

1326
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,903
and then with the hair, too,

1327
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,070
and then you've got
these giant white earrings

1328
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,972
and her black earrings fade in,

1329
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,574
that it takes us further away.

1330
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,444
- I would say the rest
of these looks on stage

1331
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:11,315
are giving me so much storyline,
so much extraness,

1332
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,516
and y'all are a little muted.

1333
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,518
- Yeah. This is really
too simple

1334
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,921
for this far in the game for me.

1335
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,357
- Ladies, I think
we've heard enough.

1336
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:23,160
And to our social media queens,

1337
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,298
thank you for sharing with us
the miracle of drag.

1338
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,766
[applause]

1339
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,868
- Yay!

1340
00:49:30,868 --> 00:49:32,803
- You're all a bunch of whores.

1341
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,572
[all laugh]

1342
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,574
You may leave the stage.

1343
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,609
Now just between
us squirrel-friends,

1344
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:39,944
what do you think?

1345
00:49:39,944 --> 00:49:42,813
Asia O'Hara and America O'Hara.

1346
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,381
- What I loved the most
about the two of them

1347
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,783
is you could tell
there was a family look,

1348
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:47,618
but there was a family
relationship going on there

1349
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:49,086
between the two of them.

1350
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,221
- It really was so impressive

1351
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:52,056
that Asia whipped together
that coat.

1352
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:54,892
That was kind of crazy
in the time allotted.

1353
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:57,962
- If I could critique anything,
I think Asia's original jacket

1354
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,097
is better than the one
she whipped up for her sister.

1355
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,600
And I think Asia's makeup
was better

1356
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,002
than the makeup
she whipped up for her sister.

1357
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,337
- But I do that for my sister
all the time.

1358
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,339
I make myself look better, so...

1359
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,841
That's a family relationship
if I ever seen one.

1360
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,077
- Eureka and Eufreaka.

1361
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:15,412
- Two big bold flavors
don't always mix.

1362
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,447
- Correct.
- Like you can't mix

1363
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,616
a bleu cheese and a Thai peanut.

1364
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:19,850
- Yeah.
- Right?

1365
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,121
But a hot wing sauce
and a ranch is heaven.

1366
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:28,158
And these two bold flavors
mixed perfectly tonight.

1367
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,394
- They were performing and
they didn't even say anything

1368
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,762
and I could hear dialogue.

1369
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,531
- They really were
a complete package.

1370
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,666
- You mean a total package?
The TP?

1371
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,967
- Uh-huh, exactly.

1372
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,303
- Aquaria and Capricia Corn.

1373
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:41,405
- The makeup was stunning
on both of them.

1374
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,607
Everything else
just didn't tell a story.

1375
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,942
- I don't know
that there was a story.

1376
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,878
The princess queen thing,
I didn't buy it.

1377
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,513
- I didn't mind the outfits.

1378
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,349
Capricia Corn looked gorgeous,
you know.

1379
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:54,985
I just felt that it was more
of the personalities.

1380
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,253
But with Kingsley,

1381
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:59,390
it was less of that sort of
internal transformation,

1382
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,661
and maybe that would have
sold the relationship more.

1383
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:06,997
Let's go to Miz Cracker
and Miz Cookie.

1384
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:10,100
- Cracker has been
through it lately,

1385
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,036
but tonight, she showed up.

1386
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:14,538
Cracker needed a Cookie
to get out of her head.

1387
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,241
- Their partnership
worked flawlessly.

1388
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,409
Their looks were great.

1389
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,344
You could definitely see
the family resemblance.

1390
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:22,479
- Miz Cookie fully transformed.

1391
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:23,781
She was fully in character.

1392
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,016
And we were all
putty in her hands.

1393
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:30,921
- Yeah, that bitch
was feeling the fish.

1394
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,257
- But you know
who got her there? Cracker.

1395
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,026
- Monet X Change
and Short Change.

1396
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,861
- They were enjoying themselves
and having fun

1397
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,763
in a way that made me like them.

1398
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,931
- But at the end of the day,

1399
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,367
it was like Beyoncé
and a Vegas show girl.

1400
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:45,869
- You know, their outfits
were both green.

1401
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,974
- The end.
[all laugh]

1402
00:51:49,974 --> 00:51:52,710
- I also had a little issue
with the reveal.

1403
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,044
It was just itty bitty.

1404
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,045
If you're going to do a reveal,

1405
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:56,480
you've got to kind of wow me.

1406
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,082
It's like telling everyone,
oh, my God, I've got a secret.

1407
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,750
I'm a homo.
- [laughs]

1408
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,486
- Right? Like nobody's jaw
is on the floor.

1409
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,054
- Monet, however,

1410
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,056
looked the most beautiful
I've ever seen her.

1411
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:08,559
- Kameron and Kelly Michaels.

1412
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:14,098
- Whereas Monet and Short Change
were work friends,

1413
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,633
Kameron and Kelly
were best friends.

1414
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:19,970
- But Kameron has this
very specific taste level.

1415
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,872
It's very much lady.

1416
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,508
What she did is she brought
her sister into her family

1417
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,909
by giving her that look.

1418
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,345
- I am going to have
to disagree with Ross here.

1419
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,214
I'm sorry.

1420
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:32,416
Ultimately, I feel like
it didn't go together.

1421
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,918
I definitely wasn't getting
much of a family resemblance.

1422
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,354
- Even though I believe
that they were sisters,

1423
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:38,689
I didn't really believe
anything else.

1424
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,759
And it felt like
a small transformation

1425
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,060
compared to
all the other queens.

1426
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,095
- I can't explain it further
than they sold to me,

1427
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,230
and I bought a ticket.

1428
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,564
- You'll be the only one
at the show.

1429
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,699
[all laugh]
- Ooh.

1430
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,100
- Well, that means
I've got a good seat.

1431
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,136
- Silence.

1432
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:54,471
I've made my decision.

1433
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,107
Bring back my girls.

1434
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,376
- Welcome back, ladies.

1435
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,378
I've made some decisions.

1436
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,315
Asia O'Hara, thanks to you,

1437
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:09,253
America's got Charisma,
Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent.

1438
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:11,889
You're safe.

1439
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,257
- Thank you.

1440
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:15,025
- Congratulations, Asia.

1441
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:20,597
- Eureka, you and Eufreaka
were on fleeka.

1442
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:22,332
- [laughs]
- Oh!

1443
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:23,634
- You're safe.

1444
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,035
- Thank you.

1445
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,036
- Safe.

1446
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:30,741
- Miz Cracker.

1447
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:33,811
You served up one smart cookie.

1448
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,346
And we ate it up.

1449
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:38,882
Con-drag-ulations.

1450
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,684
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1451
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,886
[applause]
- Yay!

1452
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,421
Yes!

1453
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:50,727
- You've won a $2.000 gift card
from Jane Doe Latex,

1454
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,998
and Chester has won
a $2.000 gift card

1455
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:59,937
from Klein, Epstein & Parker,
suits made to measure.

1456
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,872
- Oh!
- Wow.

1457
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:05,342
- But Chester,
if you want to swap prizes,

1458
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,578
talk to Miz Cracker.

1459
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,480
[all laugh]

1460
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,483
You may join the other girls.

1461
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:14,618
Kameron Michaels.

1462
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:19,223
Your disco queens
did not scream we are family.

1463
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:24,394
I'm sorry, my dear, but you
are up for elimination.

1464
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,499
- This is hard.
- Yeah.

1465
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:31,201
- Aquaria.

1466
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:35,105
When it came to
your Capricia Corn makeover,

1467
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,241
the stars did not align.

1468
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:44,414
Monet X Change, when it came to
creating a family resemblance,

1469
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,751
the judges felt short changed.

1470
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,024
Aquaria...

1471
00:54:58,162 --> 00:54:59,396
You're safe.

1472
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:00,831
- Whoa.

1473
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:04,535
You may join the other girls.

1474
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,672
- That ain't right.

1475
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:13,944
- Monet, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1476
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:17,147
- I feel so, so bad

1477
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,416
that I am here
for the third time.

1478
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,451
But I am not a give-up gal.

1479
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,420
I am a fierce performer
and a fierce entertainer,

1480
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,555
and I'm not giving up.

1481
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:27,591
- Two queens stand before me.

1482
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:29,927
Prior to tonight,
you were asked

1483
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,929
to prepare
a lip sync performance

1484
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:35,566
of "Good as Hell," by Lizzo.

1485
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:40,437
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1486
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:44,174
and save yourself
from elimination.

1487
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,245
- The time has come...
[thunder]

1488
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,480
for you to lip sync...

1489
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,885
[echoing] for your life!

1490
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:57,921
- Performing is my passion.

1491
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,090
This is my time to shine
and do what I do best.

1492
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:07,164

and don't fuck it up.

- Ladies, I've made my decision.

1545
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:11,655
- Oh, my God.

1546
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:15,125
- Kameron Michaels,
shantay you stay.

1547
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,099
- Thank you.

1548
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,903
- Monet X Change, freaky money
don't make no money.

1549
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:29,873
But Monet Money sure do.

1550
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,544
Now sashay away.

1551
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,213
- Thank you.

1552
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,851
[applause]

1553
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,920
- Cha-ching, motherfucker,
cha-ching.

1554
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,455
[all laugh]

1555
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:46,723
[applause]

1556
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:49,025
Today was just not my day.

1557
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,895
And even though I'm leaving,
my story's not done.

1558
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:53,897
I'll be on
to chapter three, girl.

1559
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,800
[laughs]

1560
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,769
- Oh, God,
this fucking sponge.

1561
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,704
This sponge is hard.

1562
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,439
My love drag daughter.

1563
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:04,341
You're the only one.
I've been barren ever since.

1564
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:06,476
This is the immaculate
conception, girl.

1565
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,911
- Fertile for a half a second.

1566
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,980
- [laughs]
- That's life.

1567
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,785
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1568
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:17,187
Final five.

1569
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:20,190
Now remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1570
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,993
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1571
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,327
Can I get an amen up in here?

1572
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,663
- Amen.
- That's the truth, honey.

1573
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:28,465
Now let the music play.

1574
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:31,835

1575
00:59:31,835 --> 00:59:34,004
