1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,902
- Previously
on "RuPaul s Drag Race..."

2
00:00:01,902 --> 00:00:05,405
You need to create
million dollar looks

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,776
using a bunch of junk
from the 99 Cent Store.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,112
- So I feel kind of confident
with my look,

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,816
but I cannot believe
we re doing the same makeup.

6
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,284
- [gasps]

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,120
- Kalorie Karbdashian Williams.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,655
- I wanted more impact.

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,626
- Vanessa Vanjie Mateo. Bam.

10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:28,262
- It s literally
a head and legs,

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,763
and the rest is flowers.

12
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,665
- Mayhem Miller.

13
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,600
- The creativity
is off the charts.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,636
- Con-drag-ulations.
You re the winner

15
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,371
of this week s challenge.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,973
- Kalorie, shante, you stay.

17
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,575
- [sobs]

18
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:45,112
- Vanessa Vanjie Mateo,
sashay away.

19
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,981
- Miss Vanjie.

20
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,792
- One down.

21
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,128
- 13 to go.

22
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,530
- "Ladies, I love you."
- Dot, dot, dot.

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,134
- The Vanjie way, baby. Bam!

24
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,902
- The first elimination s over.

25
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,405
- We re gonna miss you, Vanjie.

26
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,673
- Vanjie.

27
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:16,944
- Vanessa keeps going,
Vanjie, Vanjie.

28
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,746
So now everybody is getting
that stuck in their head,

29
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,249
even Mama Rue and Michelle
on the runway.

30
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,185
- Miss Vanjie. Miss Vanjie.

31
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,054
Miss Vanjie.

32
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,457
[cheers and applause]

33
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,998
- Miss Manjie. Miss Manjie.

34
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,666
- [stifles laugh]

35
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,269
- Miss Manjie.

36
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,670
Bam.

37
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,639
- [stifles laugh]

38
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:48,608
- Vanessa may be gone,
but Vanjie lives on, honey.

39
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,711
Vanjie!

40
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,079
- The girls of you
that were saved,

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,381
you guys feel like that was
a safe call, or do you guys--

42
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:55,482
- Being safe, you don t know

43
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,217
if you re like safe bad
or safe good.

44
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,318
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

45
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,654
- I think I should
have been at the top.

46
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,456
- This bitch is turning
all the way around.

47
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,024
[all laugh]

48
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:06,593
- Girl, no. No.

49
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,161
Monet is delusional.

50
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,162
You cannot possibly--

51
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,365
- I am giving you--
I was a sponge.

52
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,666
- Oh, my God, girl.
- I was a sponge.

53
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,002
This is the dirt.
These are the soap suds.

54
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,703
- But did anybody get that?

55
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:17,938
- No.
- No.

56
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,639
- No.
- No.

57
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,641
- I m like child, please.
I looked good.

58
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,477
Aquaria, how d you feel?

59
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,145
- I thought
I was delicious looking.

60
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,681
It s very
my style of drag so--

61
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,717
- I heard that y all guys had
a very creative conversation

62
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,786
while we were on main stage.

63
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,222
- It seems like Cracker s
trying to do Aquaria.

64
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,391
Ala tonight when I was painting,

65
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,792
and then I turned around

66
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,628
and then
it was smudgy sad eyes.

67
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,629
- So you re over it.
You re not angry.

68
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,797
- I m kind of over it,

69
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,234
because every look
is somehow suspiciously similar.

70
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,502
- Aah!

71
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,138
- What did you say?
What happened?

72
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:53,573
- Oh, um,
someone brought up the fact

73
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:57,911
that Cracker and my face
looked very similar today.

74
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,581
May have had some situations
like that in the past.

75
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,851
Like, it doesn t matter to me.
It s not, like, it--

76
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,087
- No. Too vague.
So what happened was--

77
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,822
[cheering]

78
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,557
- She said--
- This is what happened.

79
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,858
- No, no, no.
- Excuse me.

80
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,959
This is what happened.

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,195
- All this, well,
I kind of felt like so--

82
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,730
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- No. This is what happened.

83
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,099
We all know these two
happen to look alike.

84
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,069
You was bothered that she
was doing the same face as you.

85
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,937
- Aquaria, I would never do

86
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,306
something like that to you
on purpose.

87
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,707
- You was mad.

88
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,443
You was mad.
Be mad to her face.

89
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,710
- Vixen, shut the fuck up.

90
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,446
This is what had happened.

91
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,182
You interjected, and you got
everything all fired up.

92
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,184
- So why did it take me speaking
up right now for you to say it?

93
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,785
- I guess you do need
your moment to pop off,

94
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,754
because you re not
gonna have too many more.

95
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,755
[all laugh]

96
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,457
- Ooh. Ooh.

97
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,892
- I am over it.

98
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,994
This is none of The Vixen s
fucking business.

99
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,863
- When we were doing our makeup,
you were bothered about it.

100
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,031
Were you not bothered?

101
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,333
- I m not that bothered.
- You were bothered.

102
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,168
Why you done ran
across the room?

103
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,105
You done ran across
the whole room, girl.

104
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,540
Scared. Sad.

105
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,509
- Watch out, bitch.
The Vixen has a wanted poster

106
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,444
with your head
and your name on it.

107
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,579
- I really felt that.

108
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,848
I thought I was gonna
have peace in California.

109
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:11,384
- Once upon a time, Aquaria
and I were close friends.

110
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,453
I learned makeup skills
from her

111
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,622
when she did my face
for a photoshoot

112
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,557
that was about us being twins.

113
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,627
But now, I ve been accused
on national television

114
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,395
of stealing looks from Aquaria.

115
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,297
But I just did a look

116
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,800
that I know for a fact
she s never done.

117
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,202
It s called being on top.

118
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,771
- In this competition,
the stakes are high

119
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,208
and The Vixen is going to be
the whistleblower of the season

120
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,676
and I m here for it, girl.

121
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,847
- Hey, let me help you.
Let me help you.

122
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,282
Let me help you.
Give me that.

123
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,051
- Get off!
Get off my garment!

124
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,288
- The winner
of "RuPaul s Drag Race"

125
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,756

and a cash prize of $100,000.

Going forward, I need
to do something to stand out,

138
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,156
because if RuPaul
doesn t superstar me,

139
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,726
that means that
I m not showing him my star.

140
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,431
Does that make sense?

141
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,367
[alarm]
- Aah!

142
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:38,138

My queens,
one doll makes you dizzy,

144
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,710
One doll makes you tall.

145
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,446
But the one from Mama Ru

146
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,982
leaves them gagging every ball.

147
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,118
But, and it s a big but,

148
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,820
is there an anal option?

149
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,322

[cheers and applause]

153
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,932
- Say hi to my partner
Andy Cohen.

154
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,934
- Hi, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

155
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,904
- Now, Andy, I love me
some country music.

156
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:11,905
How about you?

157
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,106
- I love country music.

158
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,075
I love some of
the first ladies of country.

159
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,543
- Ooh, like Dolly.
- Dolly. Reba.

160
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,045

today s mini challenge,

163
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,785
because we re gonna have
ourselves a little hoe-down.

164
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,188
[cheering]

165
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,258
- And we re calling it
"Hay, Girl, Hay."

166
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,159
- Hay.
- Hay.

167
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,730
- Most entertaining dancer wins.

168
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,964
Now, Andy, I ve always wondered

169
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,067
how long does it take
for the average housewife

170
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,637
to get ready
for one of your reunions?

171
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,705
- It takes about
I m gonna say, three hours.

172
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,675
- Well, I m only gonna give
my girls 20 minutes

173
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,777
to get into quick drag

174
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,812
and put the charisma,
uniqueness,

175
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,016
nerve, and talent
back into country.

176
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,917

177
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,987

and join Kalorie on Asia s team.

299
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,791
- Eureka, why?

300
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,493
Eureka talks a lot.

301
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,295

[cheers and applause]

309
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,451

311
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,422

00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,267

319
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,402

323
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,642

Miss Street Fighter 2016.

324
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,809

325
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,811
- Can we talk about
like what we want?

326
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,381
- That s actually
the role I like.

327
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,449
- Wait, I feel that s
the most fun one.

328
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,484
- I really like Tinderella,

329
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,752
but I also really love
the Fairy Godmother.

330
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,620
- That is so cute.

331
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,456
Y all really think that
I m gonna leave it to you?

332
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,358
Just so you know, I m not
listening to any of y all.

333
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,626
I m probably gonna agree
with y all,

334
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,627
but I might not
just to be a bitch.

335
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,329
No shade.

336
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:17,330
- All right.
- Ooh.

337
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,666
- Okay.

338
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,967
So you re not taking
any opinions.

339
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,402
You re like I m just
making decisions?

340
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:25,538
- Well, I trust my judgment.

341
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,639
- All right.

342
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,941
- The Vixen wants things
that are her way only.

343
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,610
If our team is going down,

344
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,011
you are the captain
of the ship, girl.

345
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,212
You re gonna go down if we sink.

346
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,881
So get ready and eddy.

347
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,150
- All right, so....

348
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,086
And then Fairy Godmother
I think should be Monet.

349
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,922
Done.
- Okay.

350
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,857
- There you are.

351
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,059
- The key to doing well
in this challenge

352
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,327
is keeping
your lip sync straight,

353
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,096
your choreography gay,

354
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,598
and your characterization
bi-curious.

355
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,867
- Can we come up
with a name for our team?

356
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,936
- I don t think a team name
is important right now.

357
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,471
- May I suggest something, Asia?
- Yes.

358
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,706
- Do you think maybe

359
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,175
we could just read through it
out loud one time maybe?

360
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,811
- I think let everybody read
through it first by yourself.

361
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,746
- Okay.

362
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,216
- Ha-ha!

363
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,385
- Ah!

364
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,686
- Asia, when we do
go get our clothes,

365
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,954
can we just come back here
so we can look at them together

366
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,656
versus being scattered
all over place?

367
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,224
- Yeah, girl, everything we re
doing, we re doing together.

368
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,659
- Then I m just suggesting

369
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,794
us come together
and look at the outfits.

370
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,130
- [sighs]
As predicted,

371
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,965
Eureka is just
running at the mouth.

372
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,034
So do y all wanna put together
a little piece of choreography?

373
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,269
- Listen, we re having time
with the choreographer,

374
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,005
so I would wait and see what the
choreographer says, you know.

375
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,874
- But I d rather go out there

376
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,075
with too much material
and have to edit it--

377
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,076
- Than not have enough.

378
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,177
- Than be out there

379
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,245
and say okay, what are
y all gonna do here?

380
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,580
We don t have an idea.

381
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,181
- Okay, so, yeah, I want
to do the choreography.

382
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,916
- Let s do it.
- Yeah.

383
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,718
- So let s go over here
and just have something

384
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,187
and then if we get out there and
we don t need it, then great.

385
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,922
- Asia.

386
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,390
- Ugh.

387
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,259
- Maybe like welcome
to Ruco Labs or something.

388
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,761
- Fuck. Let the dancers
do the choreography.

389
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,529
Come on over here, everybody.

390
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,530
- Well, I m still a dancer,
Miss Thing.

391
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,831
Don t cut me off.

392
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,633
Just don t cut me down.
You know what I m saying?

393
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,101
- I m not cutting--
I m not cutting you down.

394
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:05,538
- Asia is getting snippy
with Eureka.

395
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,673
Eureka s getting snippy back.

396
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,276
- She can show you how to do it
appropriately as the dancer.

397
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,410
- Ugh.

398
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,579
- So everybody,
whichever way she starts to go,

399
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,881
we ll just like--

400
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,182
- Sit in the left.
- Yes.

401
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:17,316
- In chorus line,
it s always to the right.

402
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,484
- Let s keep it
to the right then.

403
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,819
- Okay. It s always
to the right in theater

404
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,554
is all I m saying.

405
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,822
- Hush!

406
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,059
- Let s look at our stuff.
- What do I have?

407
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,063
- That is the exact outfit.
- Okay.

408
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,398
- Well, we re set.
- Yeah.

409
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,566
- The other team s kind of
working on some choreography

410
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,334
and some moves.

411
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,273
- My team is excited that we re
done planning our costumes

412
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,742
until we see
the other team rehearse.

413
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,913
- Cute. So cute.

414
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,548
It s like that scene
in "Bring It On"

415
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,249
when you walk in and
the other team is performing,

416
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,584
and you re like, oh, shit.

417
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,787
They just seem like leaps
and bounds ahead of us.

418
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,624
- Hey, kitty girls.

419
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

420
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,829
- Well, hello, Team Asia.

421
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,197
- Hello.

422
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,331
- Hello, Ru.

423
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,000
- Are there any lip sync
assassins in the group?

424
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,335
- All of us.
- Really?

425
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,536
- That s why we re all
on the same team.

426
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,704
- All right. Now, Aquaria,

427
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,739
did you get the role
that you wanted?

428
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,641
- Yeah, yeah.
She s a bitchy old lady

429
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,944
who s stuck up,
and she has to loosen up.

430
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,111
- Now, you re very young.

431
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,414
How are you gonna portray
a bitchy old lady?

432
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,984
- I m serving a little bit more
conservative of a look,

433
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,386
and at the end,
she metamorphosizes

434
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,388
into a beautiful millennial,

435
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,290
so who better to fit that role?

436
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,859
- Okay.
[all laugh]

437
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,660
- Are you a millennial?

438
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,295
- Yes, ma am. 1996.

439
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,564
- Oh!
- Oh. I remember it well.

440
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,166
[laughs]

441
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,768
And now, Eureka, there s
a lot of choreography here.

442
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,004
I have to ask, how is your leg?

443
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,772
- No complaints.
- Oh, good.

444
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,541
[all laugh]

445
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,344
- I m back to walking, running,
sucking, fucking.

446
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,445
[all laugh]

447
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,381
- On the outside,
I m like, I am fine, Ru.

448
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,651
But on the inside,
I m freaking out.

449
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,021
- Now, Kalorie, you were in
the bottom last week.

450
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,590
What are your plans
to stand out this week?

451
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,993
- Well, my character,
we re gonna do the badonkadonk.

452
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,761
- If you have a flat ass?
- Yeah.

453
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,529
- You should put extra junk
in the cushion.

454
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,999
- Ooh, that s a drug
I can get behind.

455
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,333
- Word.
[all laugh]

456
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,235
- Kalorie s known for
her ass-shaking ability.

457
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,403
- Uh-huh.
- So I don t think

458
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,305
I m gonna have any problem
in that department.

459
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,040
- [laughs]
- All right.

460
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,442
Now, there s a lot of you,
so to stand out,

461
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,778
it s gonna take
a little extra work.

462
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,613
So I m very excited about it.

463
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,181
- Thank you so much.
- So are we.

464
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,182
- All right.
Well, knock  em dead.

465
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,018
- Bye, Mama Ru.

466
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,986
- Well, howdy Team Vixen.

467
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,221
- Hi.
- Hey.

468
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,024
- And so Blair St. Claire,
what role are you playing?

469
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,358
- I m playing
the Fairy Godmother.

470
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,260
- Oh. Now,
you re a Broadway queen?

471
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,595
- Yes, ma am, I am.
- All right.

472
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,030
- I m really excited to show Ru

473
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,798
my experience
with musical theater.

474
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,968
- Is there anybody on the other
team that you re worried about?

475
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,170
- I d keep an eye on Monique.
Monique is a very big and very--

476
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,272
- Oh, yeah.
- She s very extra.

477
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,640
- I know she s gonna--
- Extremely extra.

478
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,008
- She s gonna bring
all the drama.

479
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,145
- I do know that Dusty is also
kind of a Broadway queen.

480
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:02,682
- And which one among you
is a dancer?

481
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,550
Are there any dancers?

482
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,219
So, Vixen, are you handling
the choreography?

483
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,157
- Well, I mean,
we haven t rehearsed yet,

484
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,326
but I definitely will make sure
that we look good.

485
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,827
- Okay.

486
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,397
This is a great challenge,
so do me proud.

487
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,468
- Oh, my God.
We have nothing.

488
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,971
I m a comedian
and my job is words.

489
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:30,343
I have no words
for how condemned we feel.

490
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,511
We re like...

491
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,217
- So it s time for us
to learn our choreography.

492
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,052
We walk on stage
and who do we see?

493
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,655
- Aah! It s Alyssa Edwards!

494
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,024
- Hey.
[cheering]

495
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,326
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

496
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,096
- [clicks tongue]
It s showtime, folks.

497
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,263
All right, ladies.

498
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,667
I am going to be choreographing
the Pharmarusical.

499
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,802
- She s choreographing
this shit?

500
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,972
She is very intimidating.

501
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,974
- I m gonna treat y all
like I do the kids over there,

502
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,275
Beyond Belief in Mesquite.

503
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,344
- She has a dance studio
of her own,

504
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,879
so I know
she s gonna let us have it.

505
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,081
- Okay, Eureka, welcome back.

506
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,916
And how are we doing?
Are we healed?

507
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,585
- I m doing well.
- Okay. Good.

508
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,853
How about have y all
had a chance

509
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,554
to kind of prepare
something on your own?

510
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,889
- Yes.
- Yeah.

511
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,890
- Do y all wanna show me
what y all have first?

512
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,891
- Yeah.
- Okay.

513
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,193
- Deejay, cue the track.

514
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,729
Full out.

515
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,131
[music plays]

516
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,133
- ♪ Welcome to Ruco Labs ♪

517
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,502
♪ We have tablets, drops,
patches and shots ♪

518
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,871
- Relax and breathe
through the movements.

519
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,107
- ♪ Handful of promises,
even though they re hollow ♪

520
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,043
- That s all we have
as far as choreography.

521
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,411
- Oh, okay, okay.

522
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,479
This group is ready.

523
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,848
I m so glad we didn t have
no Charlie Hides in this group.

524
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,950
Y all gonna slay.

525
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,386
So the opening of this

526
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,190
will be a kind of
"Big Spender" moment.

527
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,526
You re gonna go this way,
this way.

528
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,028
And a down and a down
and a knock and a knock.

529
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,131
Take it all the way
to Nicki Mina-na-naje, okay?

530
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,801
Here we go. Aquaria,
five, six, seven, eight.

531
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,835
Da-da-da, da-da-da.

532
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,937
One, two, three,
there you go baby.

533
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,806
And we re moving on.
And a one and a two

534
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:07,807
and a three and a four
and a five.

535
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,642
Hit six. Hit eight.

536
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,410
Go one, go two, go three,
go four, shake it.

537
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,678
♪ Do-do-do-do-do-do ♪

538
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,947
- Aquaria is doing great,
like me.

539
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,383
Everything Alyssa tells us
to do, we re there.

540
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,052
We are prime dance students.

541
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,987
- Five, six, seven, music.

542
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,722
Boom, badonkadonk.

543
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,991
Kardashian.

544
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,992
- Karb-dashian.

545
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,461
- Karb.
- Mm-hmm.

546
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,463
- You think you re clever,
don t you?

547
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,131
[all laugh]
- Miss Kalorie,

548
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,500
you can just really work
on the steps.

549
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,635
Show me something.
- Oh, hold on, girl.

550
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,472
- Maybe give me a little ha!
Show me what you got.

551
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,806
Girl, don t fall over now.

552
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,943
Again, one more time.
Five, six, seven, eight.

553
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:44,944
- Fuck.
- Bigger.

554
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,412
This is a drag show.

555
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,848
Don t give me heh-heh-heh.

556
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:52,084
- Kalorie.

557
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,387
America, my face is saying

558
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,455
everything
that you need to know.

559
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,590
Dot com.

560
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,762
- I think we definitely have
some good theater queens here.

561
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,564
- What was your strategy
picking teams?

562
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,766
- Yeah, girl, why d you
pick me first, girl?

563
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,168
Me of all people.
- That s a good question.

564
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,503
- I m the quiet one.

565
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,738
- Yeah, you are the quiet one,
but that s what I needed,

566
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,006
because these bitches
talk too much.

567
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,608
[all laugh]

568
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,010
- I would have fully gagged
if you picked Aquaria.

569
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,579
- Oh, I was gonna pick
both of you.

570
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,181
- I was like, I m ready

571
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,617
to be the last bitch
standing over here.

572
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,784
- I don t have a problem
with you.

573
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,720
Aquaria has a problem with you,

574
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,388
but she don t wanna
bring it to you.

575
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,056
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That was the issue.

576
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,258
- I wish I was in "Untucked"
when you guys were in there,

577
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,627
so I could have really
heard what was going on.

578
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,195
- No, she spelled it all out,

579
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,164
the whole history,
the yellow dress.

580
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,033
- I did a party
in a yellow latex dress

581
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,469
with a poofy sleeve
with a heart cut out here.

582
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,471
Two weeks later,
Cracker shows up

583
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,873
yellow vinyl dress,
circle cut out.

584
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,910
That s not a coincidence.

585
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,378
- I don t know
about no yellow dress.

586
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,579
I don t know about that at all.

587
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,183
I would never steal
from somebody else on purpose.

588
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,051
I think the pressure
of the first challenge

589
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:01,320
kept me from paying
close attention

590
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,024
to the magnifying glass that s
going to be on me and Aquaria.

591
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:08,527
But that s gonna be my
first priority going forward,

592
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:12,765
because I wanna win with
my face, not with Aquaria s.

593
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,901
- Moving on, Yuhua,

594
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,536
can you show me
what you re going to do?

595
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,672
- Oh, hey, Sandy.

596
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,140
Sandy, I mean, no.

597
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,008
- Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

598
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,777
It looks like you re timid.
Can you do this?

599
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,545
Now look at me.
Hey, Sandy, girl.

600
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,680
I see you over there.

601
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,782
- Oh, Sandy, I mean, no.

602
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,051
- Bigger!
- Oh, Sandy, I mean, no.

603
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,319
- Keep acting, keep acting.

604
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,520
There we go.
Okay, here we go.

605
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,755
Keep going, keep going,
keep going. Faster.

606
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,291
Faster.
- Aah!

607
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,361
- Better. All right,
thank you. Moving on. Dusty.

608
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,297
- Restless tuck syndrome.

609
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,999
- Okay. I think
you can amp that up.

610
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,769
- Restless tuck syndrome.

611
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,338
- Now bigger eyes.
Like Aubrey O Day.

612
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:54,640
- Restless tuck syndrome!

613
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,908
- That s good.

614
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,276
Okay, Eureka, show me
what you re going to do

615
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,611
for your performance.

616
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,614
- It s just very like
pharmaceutical rap.

617
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,648
- Right, I get that.

618
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,450
- I m just gonna
kind of like walk

619
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,818
and like here at Ruco Labs.

620
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,253
- If you re gonna do this walk,

621
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,921
why don t you give me
a slide. Here.

622
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,156
- Okay.
- Okay? So da.

623
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,092
Hands and push.
- Here.

624
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,393
- Yeah, don t just walk.
Make it more theatrical.

625
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,427
- Okay.

626
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,096
- No walking.
There s no walking.

627
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,998
We re not in
the preschool class.

628
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,099
It s Season 10.

629
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,102
- Rehearsal
instantly reminded me

630
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,571
that last year, the second
episode is when I hurt myself.

631
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,306
And I m in my head,

632
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:29,575
and like I m literally
afraid to do anything.

633
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,277
- All right, ladies.
Thank you. Good luck.

634
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,212
- Thank you.
[applause]

635
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:35,047
- Eureka, are you okay?

636
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,117
You just seem shaky.

637
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,819
- I m not doing that well,
but I m trying.

638
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,521
I ve got like a little...
I don t know.

639
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,024
- What have you got?
- It s the PTSD, I think.

640
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,060
So I m just having
to work through it.

641
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,261
- You know, just really
take your time.

642
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,463
I ve watched Eureka on the show.

643
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,599
She is a fireball.

644
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,701
She s given a second chance
and an opportunity,

645
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,704
and I hope her nerves
don t get the best of her.

646
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,073
- Aah! Shut up.

647
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,808
- Aah!
- [laughs]

648
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,109
- Alyssa!

649
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,744
- Hey!
- Yes, girl.

650
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,713
- It s Alyssa.

651
00:24:07,713 --> 00:24:08,781
[clicks tongue]

652
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,349
- So before we start,
can you guys show me

653
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,017
have y all worked
on anything backstage?

654
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,018
- No.
- No.

655
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,189
- Well...

656
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:20,959
[clicks tongue]

657
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,127
- We did characterization.

658
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,362
We pulled
our costumes together.

659
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,397
- Because we knew there
was a choreographer.

660
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,832
And we worked on ideas

661
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,268
as far as like
interacting with each other.

662
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,803
- Okay, let s do that.
Here we go.

663
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,338
Vixen, go ahead
and start off with your lines,

664
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,806
and let me see.

665
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,308
- I don t just sit
at the dinner table anymore.

666
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,811
I flip them.
Thanks, Conflama.

667
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,112
- I think you can do that
a lot more.

668
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,880
That s something
for you to work on.

669
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,248
Miz Cracker,
let me see what you ve got.

670
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,851
- I haven t had a sip of wine
in three years.

671
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,053
- Bigger, baby.
Broadway, darling.

672
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,956
I haven t had a sip of wine
in three years.

673
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:51,957
- Yeah.
- No standing.

674
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:52,958
- Yeah.
- Okay?

675
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,194
- And why? Because--
- No, no.

676
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,995
And why?
- Yeah.

677
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,397
And why?

678
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,932
- The bigger, the better, baby.

679
00:24:59,932 --> 00:25:02,368
- I haven t had a sip of wine
in three years.

680
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:03,902
- Okay. That s okay.

681
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,004
Let s do Mayhem and Monique.

682
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,740
- All right, M-Squared,
hit it.

683
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,708
- Go back to Party City
where you belong.

684
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,477
- Bitch, the song is over.

685
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,179
- So this is what
y all worked on, though?

686
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,381
This is what y all worked on,
the lines, too?

687
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,715
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

688
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,417
- I just wanna be clear,
because you guys are saying

689
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,586
that you said you worked on
characterization.

690
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:21,587
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

691
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,589
- That to me was very shaky.

692
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,623
Middle of the road.

693
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,959
- Alyssa is laying us out.

694
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,394
We re literally giving her
nothing.

695
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,729
It is so embarrassing.
It s terrible.

696
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,631
- Moving on.

697
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,900
And five, six, seven, eight.

698
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,835
One, two--Blair,
hold on, Blair. Hold on.

699
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,003
You okay?
- Yeah, I m good.

700
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,071
- You look very nervous.

701
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:40,139
- I m good. I m happy.
I m good.

702
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:41,640
- Ready? And go.

703
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,109
One, two, three, four.
Come on, Blair.

704
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,744
Da.

705
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,547
One more time.
One, two, three, four,

706
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,483
five, six, seven, eight,
one, two.

707
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,318
Okay. Miss Blair.

708
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,622
The legs are rickety,
like Pinocchio.

709
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,724
She has no strings
holding her up.

710
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,293
- And what did Tinderella
say when she got to the ball?

711
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:03,862
- Can you do a pirouette turn?

712
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,731
Lift the leg up.
No, but--

713
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,232
- Uff.
- Just center that, okay?

714
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,634
Get on the platform
of your foot.

715
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,269
- I thought Blair
was gonna be

716
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,870
one of my strongest
team members.

717
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,174
She s wobbling around the stage
like a deer in headlights.

718
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,042
Girl, get it together.

719
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,945
- What did Tinderella say
when she got to the ball?

720
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,346
- Close.

721
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,481
Can you just really work
on that?

722
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:23,482
- Yeah.

723
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,985
- This group has...

724
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,086
some work.

725
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,622
Look, I ve done this,
you know, twice.

726
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,791
I ve been kicked off "Drag Race"
three times.

727
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,760
I know how all you guys
are feeling right now,

728
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,628
cause trust me,
I ve been in your pumps.

729
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,232
Don t be afraid to fall
and pick your damn self back up.

730
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,667
You know what you have to do.

731
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,969
- My team is beat down.

732
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,538
We need to get it together
real quick,

733
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,207
or we ll be going home
real soon.

734
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,612
- One thing that we really need
to remind ourselves is

735
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,913
at the end of the day,
this is selling.

736
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:55,948
- We have to keep
our head in the game

737
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,983
and know, I mean, why we re here

738
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,051
and what we re capable of.

739
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,720
- I wanna jump in there
and do it.

740
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:10,662
- I did not plan to come here
and to falter.

741
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,831
Right now, I m feeling like
the weakest link.

742
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,500
Now I m like sitting here

743
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,936
getting in my head,
like, struggling,

744
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,037
and that s not me.

745
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,138
- What s the matter, Eureka?

746
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,707
- Are you okay?

747
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,509
- I m going to through--
I just feel stupid.

748
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,043
- Why?
- Why?

749
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,778
- Don t.
- Girl.

750
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:27,779
- Sister.

751
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,249
- What s the matter?

752
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,519
- I don t know.
I just don t wanna be a mess.

753
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,653
- You re not gonna be a mess.

754
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,455
- But seeing
Alyssa d be like, girl,

755
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,456
what is wrong with you?

756
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,790
You re not even going
full force.

757
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,226
I don t even know this person,
and I don t need her.

758
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,162
I feel bad that
I m even on y all s team.

759
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,497
- But it s--no, stop.

760
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,498
- No.
- You re part of our team.

761
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,467
- You re part of our family.

762
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,969
- Guys, you re making me cry.

763
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,337
- Not only
do we have to deal with

764
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,641
all the stresses of
the logistics of this challenge,

765
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:59,945
we also have to try
to wrangle Eureka back in.

766
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,780
- Okay, now, bitch,
it s time to rehearse.

767
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,283
- The stress level at this point
is very high.

768
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,121
- [humming]

769
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,456
I just took
my once a monthly Aquaria.

770
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,759
- ♪ Ya-ha ♪

771
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,227
- Here we go day.

772
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,130
This week our challenge
is choreographed lip sync.

773
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,300
We have to perform live
in front of the judges today.

774
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,535
- Miss Eureka,
how you feeling, girl?

775
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,971
- Grovel fat.
- [laughs]

776
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:30,042
- If we were a sports team,
what sport would we be?

777
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,410
- A winning one.

778
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,011
- That s not a sport, girl.

779
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,479
- The only game I know
is winning.

780
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,282
- Our group stayed up all night
working on the choreography.

781
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,817
We are all so excited

782
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,787
to just get out on the stage
and hopefully win.

783
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:42,888
- How y all feeling?

784
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,756
- I feel nervous as fuck
right now, girl.

785
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,291
- I m still pretty nervous,

786
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,726
cause the other team,
they look amazing.

787
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,629
I just don t want them to feel
like we re just so sloppy.

788
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,663
You know what I m saying?

789
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:52,664
Someone is going home today,

790
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,166
and I really feel like our team

791
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,268
is probably gonna be up
for elimination.

792
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:57,669
- I know we don t suck.

793
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,770
- That s where we were at
yesterday.

794
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,472
- Yeah, we were sucking.
- We sucked yesterday.

795
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,174
- Yesterday
we were at ground zero.

796
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,710
- Now we re like, you know,
we re in the mezzanine.

797
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,111
- Yeah,  cause that s
a great place to be

798
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,046
in a 29-story building.

799
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,748
- If we don t look our best,

800
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,483
it s gonna come down on me,

801
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,752
because at the end of the day,
I m team captain.

802
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,056
- Aye-yi-yi.

803
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,725
- Look at Dusty right now.
Look at his face.

804
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,460
I think
that s your trademark, girl.

805
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,328
- I really think Michelle s
gonna like this.

806
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,330
[all laugh]

807
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,065
- I can t.
- Your dots.

808
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,333
Are you gonna do them again
this week?

809
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,869
- Girl, we re not there yet.

810
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,438
I m really, really debating

811
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,474
whether or not
to do my dots on my face,

812
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:39,344
because Michelle is like, you
can t do dots every single time.

813
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,581
But Dusty does do dots
every single time.

814
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,349
That s my signature look.

815
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,484
So I m just like

816
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,152
I feel like I shot myself
in the foot last week.

817
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:50,389
[sighs]
I don t know what to do.

818
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:53,058
I don t want her
looking like anyone else.

819
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,960
That s why I have spots, girl.

820
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,164
- When I was in high school,
I used to be 340 pounds.

821
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,166
- What?
- Yeah, girl, I was huge.

822
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,367
- Wow.

823
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,836
- And my confidence
was just like at its lowest.

824
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,905
And it s so crazy, because
like being from a small town,

825
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,206
I would have thought

826
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,308
that would have been picked on
for being gay.

827
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,644
But I was picked on
for being fat.

828
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,513
I d walk home from school

829
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,282
and I d have people
throw food at me.

830
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,184
- No.
- Like I d literally be walking,

831
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,020
and one of the worst days
was they had got a Coke,

832
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,557
and they threw the Coke at me,
and I swear to God it was piss.

833
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,758
- What?
- Yes.

834
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,294
And I literally just cried
all the way home.

835
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,296
- No.
- Yeah, it was the worst.

836
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,698
- I m so sorry.

837
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,732
- And so then like

838
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:34,733
it was "RuPaul s Drag Race"
Season 2,

839
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,035
and I remember seeing JujuBee.

840
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,472
And I was just like oh, my God,
like, she looks so confident.

841
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,907
And I m like,
I wanna be that girl.

842
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,675
I want to do that.
- I wanna have that confidence.

843
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,711
I wanna feel regal.
- Kalorie taught me that.

844
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:47,979
Like, you can be any size
and be beautiful

845
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,648
and, you know,
have this confidence.

846
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,583
And I just,
I appreciate her for it.

847
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,785
Or I guess I appreciate myself.
[laughs]

848
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,388
- You should appreciate
yourself, girl.

849
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,291
- Do you ever look at yourself

850
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,929
and just be like damn, bitch,
I look good.

851
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,364
- I love doing makeup
for that exact reason.

852
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,834
This is like my skin.
- Uh-huh.

853
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,702
Them bitches is quiet.

854
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,873
- I m just trying to figure out
what y all looking at.

00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,874

00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,610

Well, see you later.

00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:39,103
- And one of your performances
was absolutely habit-forming.

1215
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,774
The Vixen, as team leader,
you are the winner

1216
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,243
of this week s maxi challenge.

1217
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,778
[applause]

1218
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,380
- I m the winner, bitch.

1219
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,948
I won the mini challenge

1220
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,551
and the maxi challenge
in the same week.

1221
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:55,319
Now these girls know
not to fuck with me.

1222
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:00,191
- You ve won a suite of jewelry
from Fierce! Drag Jewels

1223
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,895
and a $2,000 gift card
from Nailed by Christie.

1224
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:05,997
[applause]

1225
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,798
- Oh, my God.

1226
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,334
- Team Vixen, you are safe.

1227
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,636
You may leave the stage.

1228
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,676
- Team Asia O Hara.

1229
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:23,280
I m sorry, my dears, but you re
all up for elimination.

1230
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,952
- Welcome, ladies.

1231
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,354
Now it s time
for the judges  critiques.

1232
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,058
Starting with Asia O Hara.

1233
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,826
- I m going to start
with your performance.

1234
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,728
You did your choreography,
you knew your lyrics,

1235
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,764
and you stayed in character.

1236
00:46:39,764 --> 00:46:41,499
I think tonight
is a beautiful look for you.

1237
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:44,168
You know exactly
what your skin tone is.

1238
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,904
You have perfectly matched
your legs to your arms.

1239
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,139
It s seamless.

1240
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,775
- You were one
of the most eye-catching

1241
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:51,842
on the runway tonight.

1242
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,146
- This color is just so perfect.

1243
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,581
Could you save this
and after the competition,

1244
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,151
we enter the 2020 Olympics
as pair skaters?

1245
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,619
[all laugh]

1246
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,621
- You in?
- Yes, absolutely.

1247
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,389
- Yuhua Hamasaki.

1248
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,358
- I loved you
during the performance.

1249
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,093
You were so animated.

1250
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:13,531
- Your energy was distinctly
different from everyone else,

1251
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:14,932
and that s why I noticed it.

1252
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,967
- Thank you so much.
- Tonight on the runway,

1253
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,870
I m finding this hard to believe
that that s your best drag.

1254
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,740
That s a spangled bodysuit
with some fishnet tights.

1255
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,741
- I had a better option

1256
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:24,842
that I was going to wear
for the runway.

1257
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,177
It was yellow and black,

1258
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,713
and I didn t want to wear
the same colors as last week.

1259
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:30,214
- I m gonna expect more
than this from you,

1260
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,382
and I know you ve got it.

1261
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:32,516
- I just didn t want
to repeat the same color.

1262
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,985
I have a whole look planned out
for this runway.

1263
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:36,687
- Well, this runway is now done.

1264
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,391
- I hate hearing
I have something better,

1265
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:42,293
but I chose this instead.

1266
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,095
If it s in the closet--

1267
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:45,296
I haven t been in a closet
in a while.

1268
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:46,797
- [laughs]
- I hear ya, I hear ya.

1269
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,166
- But if it s in the closet,
it s not gonna help you.

1270
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,634
And there s no "take two" here.

1271
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,237
- Up next, Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1272
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,740
- I loved your performance.

1273
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,177
Your movements had
a very clear point of view.

1274
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,345
- Yes.

1275
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,280
- As far as the runway,
I think you look awesome.

1276
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,182
- Tonight is a great example

1277
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,384
of you still
allowing yourself to be you

1278
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,519
without dots on your face.

1279
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,587
- Just a couple.

1280
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:10,621
- Can t see  em.
That s works.

1281
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:11,956
[all laugh]

1282
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:14,291
- I love that you chose
a polka dot ascot

1283
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,726
to go with that blazer.

1284
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,261
- I love this jacket.

1285
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,530
- I want to fistfight Michelle
in the parking lot

1286
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,531
for that blazer later.

1287
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:21,899
- There s someone else

1288
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,501
who s gonna fight you guys
for that jacket.

1289
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,370
- Up next, Monique Heart.

1290
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,505
- I love this.

1291
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,106
Even though it s a bodysuit,
it s fun.

1292
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,742
It s different.
It s filled with personality.

1293
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,744
You got big ball eyes
on your head.

1294
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,814
- Then you ve got this
whole other thing going on

1295
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:40,151
that was never really explained
or worked into your routine.

1296
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:43,821
- In the musical performance,
I can t remember you.

1297
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:45,923
- I noticed you,
but the problem was

1298
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,992
I think you could have known
the words a little bit better.

1299
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:51,262
- I will attest to that.
It was a struggle.

1300
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,830
- Yeah, it shows.

1301
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,866
- Up next, Kalorie.

1302
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,003
- In the musical, you were
the one who disappeared for me.

1303
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,806
- And then the moments
that I was focusing on you,

1304
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,674
sweetheart,
you didn t know the words.

1305
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:07,278
- I wanted to see more
imagination, more creativity,

1306
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,880
and I think that s why
a lot of us lost you.

1307
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,216
- Your best drag tonight
is this,

1308
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:14,585
and this is something that
any girl would wear to a club.

1309
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:16,954
I want to see more.

1310
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,123
- How would you describe
your drag?

1311
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,058
- Kalorie s all about body,
you know.

1312
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,460
She s a big girl that just
loves to show off her curves.

1313
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,729
I used to be 340 pounds,

1314
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,665
and I ve finally
come to a place

1315
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:30,201
where I m just all about
being sparkly and glamorous.

1316
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,735
- You do look beautiful,

1317
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,871
but it s not telling me
who you are,

1318
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:36,674
what your contribution is
to drag.

1319
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:40,177
- Up next,
our returning queen Eureka.

1320
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,812
- I do wanna say
across the board,

1321
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,148
I feel like we saw
a lot of bodysuits tonight.

1322
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,584
Best drag for you, Eureka?

1323
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:49,453
- There are a lot
of bodysuits out here.

1324
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,956
I think yours is the best.

1325
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,791
- But in your performance,

1326
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,960
there was not one word
that came out of your mouth

1327
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,195
that matched that lip sync.

1328
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,730
- It broke my heart
to watch you tonight.

1329
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,832
And when I saw you back
for Season 10,

1330
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,735
I was ready to strap on...

1331
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,370
the Eureka Express.

1332
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,606
- This is not
that kind of show, Ross.

1333
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,207
- Let me finish.

1334
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,878
The Eureka Express,
and ride you all the way home.

1335
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,045
[all laugh]

1336
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,647
- Still.

1337
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,148
- Well, I guess
it is that kind of show.

1338
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,985
[all laugh]

1339
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,987
- What happened, Eureka?

1340
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:26,323
- I m just... [sobs]

1341
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,692
I didn t realize
that I was still so...

1342
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,794
Oh, my goodness.
I m sorry.

1343
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,496
[sobs] I didn t realize

1344
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:36,033
I was still so emotional
over what had happened to me.

1345
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,370
Coming back
kind of freaked me out.

1346
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,239
- What I m seeing tonight is you
completely blocking yourself.

1347
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,209
- Your knee
sent you home last season.

1348
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,610
If you don t
get out of your head,

1349
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,579
your head s gonna send you home
this season.

1350
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:51,181
- Thank you, Eureka.

1351
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,717
Up next, Aquaria.

1352
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,287
- This look tonight on
the runway is so fantastic.

1353
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:58,555
- It s young, it s fresh,
it s fashion, darling.

1354
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,392
- You re obviously
a fantastic dancer.

1355
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,395
- But I think your character
was an old biddy,

1356
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:06,430
read more
like Linda Evangelista

1357
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,032
than it did Blanche Devereaux.

1358
00:51:08,032 --> 00:51:10,701
- You could have gone
for a more aged look.

1359
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:12,403
- I knew that if I went too far

1360
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,506
on the wrinkly
old side of things

1361
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:17,808
that this would be a little
impossible to achieve.

1362
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,277
- But you even could have done
stuff with your body.

1363
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,779
- Yeah.
- Like, hunched over.

1364
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:22,780
Glasses.
- Glasses.

1365
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:23,781
- And still done
the choreography

1366
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,215
so the transformation
was like, bam!

1367
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,017
It doesn t necessarily have to
be drawing lines on your face

1368
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,153
like a high school production
of "Arsenic and Old Lace."

1369
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,554
[all laugh]

1370
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,723
- That I may or may not
have done.

1371
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:36,393
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we ve heard enough.

1372
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,696
While you untuck backstage,

1373
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:41,265
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1374
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,600
All right.

1375
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,602
Just between
us squirrel-friends,

1376
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,137
what do you think?

1377
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,806
Asia O Hara.

1378
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,874
- The performance was good,
but not great.

1379
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,576
I wasn t like, wow,
what a superstar.

1380
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,211
- I will say this, Ru.

1381
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,246
I don t think I know her at all.

1382
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,514
- It s early with Asia.

1383
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,549
I ve seen the trailer.

1384
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,351
I m ready for the full length.

1385
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:01,585
Uncut version, preferably.

1386
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,454
- Okay. You got it.
- Of course.

1387
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,723
- Yuhua Hamasaki.

1388
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,025
- Tonight s look
let me down tremendously.

1389
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:10,594
- What she lacked in the runway,

1390
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,797
she more than made up for
in the musical.

1391
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,532
- Another thing that
I m watching with Yuhua

1392
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,401
is she likes to clap back.

1393
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,903
- She could take a cue
from the pageant girls

1394
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,974
who know how to take critique
and not clap back.

1395
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,642
- Clap on.
- Clap off.

1396
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,077
- Thank you.
- [laughs]

1397
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,179
Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1398
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,348
- Dusty Ray Bottoms
rose to the top.

1399
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:34,985
- I thought it was really risky
of her to choose a blazer

1400
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,355
because then you have to know
that you can bring a sexy energy

1401
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,923
to a look that s so masculine.

1402
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:42,359
- Monique Heart.

1403
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,928
- I didn t remember her
in the performance,

1404
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,697
but I remembered her
on that runway.

1405
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:48,565
- She literally said
all eyes on me.

1406
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,566
- Yes.
- Yes.

1407
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:50,801
- On the con side,

1408
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:53,404
for me, if you re going
to go through the trouble

1409
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:56,040
of doing that elaborate
of a costume,

1410
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,474
I need to understand
what the narrative is.

1411
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:00,944
It was all set design,
no substance.

1412
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:04,048
- Kalorie Karbdashian Williams.

1413
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:07,184
- Listen, we started
last week out not so great,

1414
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,720
and then tonight
was unfortunately

1415
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,288
still not so great.

1416
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:12,956
- Her appearance
didn t stand out,

1417
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,591
and neither did her performance.

1418
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,195
- My sense is that she s really
out of her league here.

1419
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,631
- Some queens
take a second to rev up, right?

1420
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,466
- If they stick around.

1421
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:23,901
- If they stick around.

1422
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:26,637
- All right, let s move on down
to our returning queen Eureka.

1423
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:27,771
- When she was in that musical,

1424
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,573
all she was singing

1425
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,443
was pineapple, pineapple,
pineapple, pineapple, pineapple,

1426
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:34,278
and it was painful to watch.

1427
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:38,348
- But the worst part of it
is she just looked sad.

1428
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,583
- Defeated.
- Defeated.

1429
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:43,887
- Defeated. And that s not
the Eureka we know.

1430
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,155
- But she don t get
no free pass.

1431
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,256
- That s right.

1432
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,659
- She s her own worst enemy
at this point.

1433
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,060
- Aquaria.

1434
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,262
- In the production,
she lost me.

1435
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,664
- Is she hilarious?
I don t know yet.

1436
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:55,732
I know that I m interested.

1437
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,067
It s like if you re dating,
you know what I mean?

1438
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,069
You ve gone on like two dates,

1439
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,337
but you re not ready
to go all the way yet.

1440
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:02,106
You re like,
I ll go on a third date.

1441
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,607
- I have no idea
what that s like.

1442
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,641
[all laugh]

1443
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,310
- It s future forward drag.

1444
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,811
She s very exciting.

1445
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,481
- I don t think that Aquaria
understands her power.

1446
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:14,518
I think that she is going to be
a force to be reckoned with.

1447
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:16,553
[clap clap]
- Silence.

1448
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,489
I ve made my decision.

1449
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:19,923
Bring back my girls.

1450
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,025
- Welcome back, ladies.

1451
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,660
I ve made some decisions.

1452
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,900
Asia O Hara.

1453
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,101
You re safe.

1454
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,438
You may join the other girls.

1455
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,008
Aquaria.

1456
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,844
You re safe.

1457
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,012
- Thank you, RuPaul.

1458
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:47,651
- Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1459
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:48,785
You re safe.

1460
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:49,920
- Thank you.

1461
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,390
- [sighs]

1462
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,791
- Yuhua Hamasaki.

1463
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,494
You re safe.

1464
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,595
- Thank you.

1465
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,003
- Kalorie Karbdashian Williams.

1466
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:09,673
You are a fierce,
curvaceous queen,

1467
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,409
but tonight,
you fell a little flat.

1468
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,012
Monique Heart.

1469
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,714
On the runway,
all eyes were on you,

1470
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:20,817
but in the challenge,
you got a little lost.

1471
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,589
Eureka.
I wish there was a pill

1472
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:28,759
to make you believe in yourself
as much as we do.

1473
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:34,364
Monique Heart...

1474
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:37,000
you re safe.

1475
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,871
You may join the other girls.

1476
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:50,914
- [sobs]

1477
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,349
- Come on, girl.

1478
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,951
Come on.

1479
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:57,387
- Kalorie, Eureka,

1480
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,457
I m sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

1481
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,493
- It just sucks that I have
to lip sync against Eureka.

1482
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,630
That s my big girl sister,
but I have to send her home.

1483
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,666
- Two queens stand before me.

1484
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:13,870
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1485
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,341
and save yourself
from elimination.

1486
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:22,079
The time has come...

1487
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,248

[echoing] for your life.

1489
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,388
- I m the comeback queen,
and the second challenge,

1490
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,489
I m in the bottom two.

1491
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,824
All I can think of

1492
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,827
is how embarrassing
it would be to go home.

1493
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:39,663
I m gonna fight harder than
I ve ever fought before.

1494
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,999
- Good luck,

1495
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:42,999
and don t fuck it up.
