180
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,516
- Come on, "Brady Bunch."

181
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,783
- [laughs]

182
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,687
- I can pick it up,
- But I can't say what it is.

183
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,422
Girl, I'm Jewish.
Am I sitting on ham right now?

184
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,224
Is this ham?
- [laughs]

185
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,526
The secret is marshmallows.

186
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,161
What does your butt say?

187
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,664
- Definitely smooth.

188
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,866
- Work it out, girl.

189
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,467
- Ah, spaghetti?

190
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,503
- Use your tuchus.

191
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,037
Yeah, move it around.

192
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,139
- Just gotta get in there now.

193
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,673
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

194
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,675
Are they marshmallows?

195
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,878
- Yes! Lady Columbo.

196
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,381
The secret is a real fish.

197
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,450
- It's like squishy.

198
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,287
- I can't tell
- If it's cold or wet.

199
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,889
- [gasps]
- Is it a slab of bacon?

200
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,725
- Feel anything?

201
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:40,693
- I'm doing my kegels.

202
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,294
- [laughs]

203
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,363
- Is it an Easter egg?

204
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,199
- This is flat
- And a little cold,

205
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:47,733
so I want to say Aquaria.

206
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,134
- [laughs]

207
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,670
The secret is a cake.

208
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,273
Back your booty up.

209
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,408
- Oh, my God.

210
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,345
- Oh, she's weird.

211
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,680
- [laughs]

212
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,882
- Oh, I don't want to.

213
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,752
- Oh, my God!

214
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,221
What is this?

215
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,157
- Would it be
- A chocolate cream pie?

216
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,425
- It smells like cake.

217
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,060
I can already smell it.

218
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,663
- I'm sitting in cake.

219
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,398
- Oh, is this cake?

220
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,567
- It certainly is.

221
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,635
- Aah!
- [laughs]

222
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:25,237
Ladies, you did
such a great job,

223
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,873
but one of you
really kicked butt.

224
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,645
- The queen who guessed the most
- Objects is Asia O'Hara.

225
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:35,348
- Con-drag-ulations.
- [applause]

226
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:42,554
You've won a $2,000 haircare
package from Art Lab Salon.

227
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,456
[applause]

228
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,826
Now, four years ago
I created RuPaul's Drag Con,

229
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:53,031
a magical event for young
and old, gay and straight,

230
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,903
to come together to celebrate
love, laughter, and diversity.

231
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:02,642
- Now, for a queen, it's a chance
- To entertain and inspire

232
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:06,479
- as she shares
- The art and power of drag,

233
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:09,348
and make a few coins
on the side if she wants to.

234
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,216
[all laugh]
- Aah!

235
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,719
- So for this week's
maxi-challenge,

236
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,223
you need to create
your own Drag Con panels.

237
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,493
- Ooh!
- Oh, wow.

238
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,195
- Now, working
in groups of three,

239
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:26,099
- you need to prepare
- A panel discussion, a demo,

240
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,734
and be prepared
to answer questions

241
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,270
in front of a live audience.

242
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,839
Now, one group
will focus on body,

243
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,111
- one on face,
- And another on wigs.

244
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:40,446
Now, in the spirit of Drag Con,

245
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:43,983
- I'll let y'all pick your own
- Groups and panel topics.

246
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,087
- When Ru says that
- We can pick our own teams,

247
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,220
I'm like, all of these girls

248
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,790
are gonna avoid me
like the plague, girl.

249
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,226
- They're gonna be like, we do not
- Want this tainted bitch.

250
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,861
So I'm just mentally
preparing myself.

251
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,996
- Ready? Go.

252
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,733
- Wigs.
- Face. You wanna do face?

253
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:03,235
- I think Monét having been
in the bottom twice,

254
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,139
- and because I am
- One of the quieter ones,

255
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,340
we were just kind of
frozen in the moment,

256
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,942
like I hope somebody picks me.

257
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,644
- I wanna do body.
- I wanna do body, too.

258
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,913
- I look at Monét and Kameron,
and no one's rushing at them.

259
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,016
- So I say, hey, do y'all
- Wanna work with me?

260
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,017
Let's do this together.

261
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,952
- Work.
- Yeah.

262
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,755
- All right, Blair, The Vixen,
Miz Cracker, you're a team.

263
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,160
- Monét, Kameron,
- And Eureka, you're a team.

264
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:32,632
- And Asia, Monique,
- And Aquaria, you're teammates.

265
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:36,335
- Eureka's team,
that is an interesting group,

266
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,337
because this is
a speaking challenge.

267
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,340
Kameron doesn't talk a lot
and Eureka talks too much.

268
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,077
- And then Monét
- Was in the bottom last week.

269
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,879
- So all of them have issues
- That they're battling,

270
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:49,147
so we'll see how that goes.

271
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,650
- Gentlemen, start your engines,

272
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,487
and may the best woman win.

273
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,955
- Aah!

274
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,091
- All right, all right,
- Body it is.

275
00:10:58,094 --> 00:10:59,224
- Okay.

276
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,860
- Oh, damn.
- Okay, okay, it's a party.

277
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,128
- For today's maxi-challenge,

278
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,697
- we'll be doing
- Our own Drag Con panels,

279
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,865
focused on face, body, and hair.

280
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,666
- So I'm gonna let y'all
open and look in that,

281
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,634
and I'm gonna take notes.

282
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,904
- In this challenge,

283
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:13,973
- you have to call upon
- Your skills to own a room.

284
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,543
- So you need personality, banter,
- And drag knowledge.

285
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,778
- Obviously
- I've been to Drag Con

286
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,246
and I've been on panels before,

287
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,881
so we need to make sure
that we have a direct plan.

288
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,251
- Now, they say who's gonna be
- A moderator.

289
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:27,586
Basically that's just someone
that starts it

290
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,023
- and someone
- That pushes questions.

291
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:32,225
- Which I don't mind doing that,
- If y'all don't mind.

292
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,626
- Yeah, I think since
you have the experience.

293
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,728
- I am putting my trust
- In Eureka

294
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,263
- because I think she knows
- What she's doing.

295
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:41,066
- I'm basically focusing on
how to shape the big-girl body.

296
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,134
- Yeah.

297
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,169
- Getting the body
you want in drag,

298
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,637
- no matter your shape
- To begin with.

299
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,406
- If you can proportion
- Your body out,

300
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,007
that's when sexy
comes into play.

301
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,777
- So that's what
- I'm gonna be focusing on,

302
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,245
is just, like,
proportionizing a big figure.

303
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,614
- Branding the word
"proportionizing"

304
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,950
I think will be really genius.

305
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,750
- Girl, is that even a word?

306
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,085
- It is today.

307
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,254
- Proportionizing.
- Proportionizing.

308
00:12:01,255 --> 00:12:03,523
- Creating
- The perfect silhouette.

309
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:05,491
- Yes.
- That's everything I live for.

310
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:06,758
- Light bulb!

311
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,361
Now, all y'all Webster
dictionary-holding mofos,

312
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,729
don't get crazy.

313
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,265
But we've created a word,
and it's "proportionizing."

314
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,502
Today we will be discussing
proportionizing.

315
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:21,474
- Eureka's team,
- They have that awful tag line.

316
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:22,941
- ♪ Proportionizing ♪

317
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,477
- ♪ Proportionizing ♪

318
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,812

319
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,180

00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,416
- All: ♪ Proportionizing ♪
- [all laugh]

321
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,517
- [sigh] Oh, God.

322
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,219
Stop!

323
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,723
- Hey, cutie-girls.

324
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,393
- Who's ready
- For RuPaul's Drag Con?

325
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:42,562
- [cheers and applause]
- Yeah!

326
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,596
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey, RuPaul.

327
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,565
- I'm excited about your panel.

328
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:47,900
It's all about makeup, right?

329
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:50,336
- Correct.
- Now you're an Instagram queen.

330
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,504
Where'd you learn?

331
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,673
- I just learned
- From practicing in my bedroom.

332
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:56,441
- Uh-huh. Now, Asia, what are
you gonna bring to this panel?

333
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,511
- I used to do makeup
- For Chanel,

334
00:12:58,514 --> 00:13:01,046
and I wanna talk about some of
the technical aspects of makeup.

335
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,615
- But just remember
a lot of times

336
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,282
when people go into a situation

337
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,185
where they think, oh,
I'm the authority,

338
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,955
- out the window goes all the fun
- And all the joy of it.

339
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,690
You have to convey
the joy of makeup.

340
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:12,724
- Yes, ma'am.

341
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,627
- You know,
- People always ask me,

342
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,595
can you give me a makeup tip?

343
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,832
- People want fast things
- That they can use immediately.

344
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,965
How do you contour a nose?

345
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,368
How do you put on
a false eyelash?

346
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,936
- Ru dropped little nuggets,

347
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,939
and I surely picked up them
little chicken nuggets, honey.

348
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,842
Dipping sauce, hot mustard.

349
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,680
I'm gonna get 'em,
because I'm not going home.

350
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,149
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey, Ru.

351
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,484
- Now, who's been to Drag Con?

352
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,052
- I have.
- You have?

353
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,888
- Yes.
- You two are fired.

354
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,423
What is your panel
gonna be about?

355
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,458
- Wigs.
- Yes.

356
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,693
- Synthetic or humanoid?

357
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,462
- Synthetic.
- I prefer synthetic.

358
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:52,064
- Something to match
your personality.

359
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,998
[all laugh]

360
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,266
Now, you do hair.

361
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,469
- Yeah, we all work with hair.

362
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,171
- What do you think
- In your panel

363
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,472
- you could teach people
- About wigs

364
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:00,873
that they don't already know?

365
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,042
- For me,
- People ask me all the time

366
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:05,911
what to do underneath the wig
to make sure the bitch stays on.

367
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,512
- I actually teach wig classes.

368
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,050
- I work full-time, besides drag,
- With a theater company,

369
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:12,218
working on wigs.

370
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,354
- I love that.
- Now, there are three of you.

371
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:17,389
Is there someone
who's gonna run the show?

372
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,558
Who's gonna moderate the panel?

373
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,496
- We're really gonna take turns,
- Like, teaching the class.

374
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:24,731
- You know, I think Drag Con

375
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:26,832
is really just an excuse
for queens to hang out,

376
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,435
- so we're gonna put that
- At the forefront.

377
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:32,638
- It's a great opportunity
- To hang out also,

378
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:36,074
but over the years, I have
branded every damn thing I can.

379
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,077
And you know, that's what
you should be doing, too.

380
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,278
Just make sure you're funny.

381
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,281
Life doesn't have to be
so darn serious.

382
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,717
Now, I said "darn"
because of you, Blair.

383
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,587
- I just didn't wanna cuss
- In front of you.

384
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,620
[all laugh]

385
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,356
- I am so happy
that we have wigs.

386
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,158
Our plan is to focus
on having a lot of fun

387
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,427
and keeping it light-hearted.

388
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,862
- Hey, ladies.

389
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,363
- Hi, Ru.
- Hello.

390
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,798
- So this body-ody-ody.

391
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,033
You guys are all known
for your bodies.

392
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,471
- Now, Kameron,
- You have a man's body.

393
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,939
- I work out
about six days a week at home.

394
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,240
- Wow.
- I feel like

395
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,743
- there's not a lot of bodybuilder
- Drag queens out there,

396
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:13,478
so I think that's something
that I need to bring to light,

397
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,813
is the muscle queens.

398
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,014
- And that's the topic
of your portion of the panel?

399
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:18,050
- Yeah. My portion is gonna be

400
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,152
how to feminize
a masculine body.

401
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,721
- There's a lot of padding
- Going on there.

402
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,589
- There is, yeah.
- I don't even wanna know

403
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,824
- what your couch at home
- Looks like.

404
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,825
- Torn apart to pieces.

405
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:30,295
- Ms. Monét, last week,
you were on the talk show

406
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,532
- as someone who is addicted
- To eating her...

407
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,133
- Eating her pads.
- Hip pads.

408
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,601
- But you didn't wear
- Any hip pads.

409
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,771
- You were in the bottom
- Last week.

410
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:39,871
- I was.

411
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,739
- So I'm assuming
you won't be making

412
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,842
those kind of mistakes again.

413
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,009
- I shan't.

414
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,312
- Monét is gonna
- Have to find the direction

415
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:48,680
that she wants to shine
with this panel.

416
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,515
I know she can do it.

417
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,585
- Please, dear Lord God,
- Let her do it.

418
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,485
- Well, listen,
going into this panel,

419
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,455
it's important
to be entertaining,

420
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,058
learn what your own rhythm is,
and have fun.

421
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,194
Well, I will see you out there.

422
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,729
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thank you.

423
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:05,230
- All right.

424
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,532
All right, gather round,
ladies, gather round.

425
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,302
Now, tomorrow on the main stage

426
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,672
you'll be presenting
your Drag Con panels

427
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:17,276
- in front of our
- Extra-special guest judges.

428
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,411
The husband-and-wife team

429
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,314
- behind the Oscar-nominated movie
- "The Big Sick,"

430
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:24,916
Kumail Nanjiani
and Emily Gordon.

431
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,552
[cheers and applause]

432
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,588
Oh, right, and one more thing.

433
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,626
Drag Con is your chance to make
the fans fall in love with you,

434
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,231
- which is super important,
- Because tomorrow,

435
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:43,568
the audience will be rating
each panel and each queen.

436
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,337
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

437
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,508
- So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

438
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,614
- I'll go, Aquaria,
tell them the why behind the...

439
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,315
on why they highlight
and contour, and you can say...

440
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:01,921
- I can... like,
- I have other, like...

441
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:04,589
there's more elements
than just the...

442
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,825
- Aquaria, I want you to think

443
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:08,995
- so that way you can
- At least say it right now,

444
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:13,465
and that way you're not trying
to think of it in that moment.

445
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:17,102
The weak link in this
whole chain is Aquaria,

446
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:21,072
because just in conversation
she fumbles, which is fine.

447
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,476
- Everyone doesn't do well
- In public speaking.

448
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,044
But I'm nervous
that she'll get lost

449
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,248
- and not be able to complete
- And execute.

450
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,549
- I would have talked more about

451
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,587
how I use more highlight
onto the side of my nose...

452
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:40,759
Um, not as much as, like,
this is how this is done.

453
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,594
Like...

454
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:47,532
- I don't know how I feel about
Aquaria's communication skills.

455
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,434
Does she look great? Yes.

456
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:54,172
Would I wanna sit and listen
to her on a panel? No.

457
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,276
I's worried. I is worried.

458
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,348
- Painted for what?
- Filth.

459
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:07,218
- Honey.
- Filth. Filth.

460
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,788
- I feel good about today,
- Honestly.

461
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,957
- Drag Con's the most incredible
- Experience I've ever had.

462
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,024
- Organic, organic.

463
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,259
Today we're doing
a Drag Con panel

464
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,629
- in front of a live audience
- And the judges.

465
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,264
I really wanna shine
and really do well today.

466
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,733
- After the past two weeks
- That I've been through here,

467
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:21,733
I'm nervous.

468
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,033
- Don't even worry about that.

469
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,704
Fuck those days,
you know what I'm saying?

470
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,738
That don't even exist anymore.

471
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,674
- Your accent, you just make
everything sound so sweet.

472
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,275
And your accent's
making it all okay.

473
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,179
And I'm like, I believe
what this bitch is saying.

474
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,612
- [laughs]

475
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,815
- Eureka is a legend

476
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,617
for being very loud
and very boisterous,

477
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,618
but I fucking like working
with Eureka. She's fierce.

478
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,287
I think those are the hos
with a problem, really.

479
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,588
- Well, we're gonna do good.

480
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:45,624
- Yeah, I think so, too.

481
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,726
- We are.
- I'm excited.

482
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,761
- Ru said that one of
the most important parts

483
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,830
of this challenge
is that the audience

484
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,166
is also going to pick, like,
someone that they really liked,

485
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,201
or they're kind of
almost like a fan favorite.

486
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,470
- Right.
- So I think

487
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,505
- one of the most important parts
- Of this entire challenge

488
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,140
that a lot of people
are forgetting...

489
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,575
- they're really focused
- On content...

490
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:04,377
- is to be super likeable.
- Yeah.

491
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,112
- I always like to try and plan
things out before I do them,

492
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,880
and I'm like, what can I do?

493
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,615
So this is my stats notebook

494
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,418
that has everything
from cast challenges

495
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,322
to statistics of things that
we can possibly be doing,

496
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,425
because I am so completely anal
and OCD.

497
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,926
I think we need to have fun.

498
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,662
- It's just talking
- Like normal girls would,

499
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:25,296
like a Sunday brunch.

500
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,599
- Yeah, exactly.

501
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,369
- Today's runway theme
is Hats Incredible.

502
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,339
America, every single one
of these runway looks,

503
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,810
- I am having to put together
- At the last minute.

504
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:39,412
I'm just trying to figure out
what should I do for the bottom.

505
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:42,515
- Should I make
- Like a dress-gown?

506
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:44,483
- Yeah.
- Where other queens

507
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:47,452
have a large repertoire of
drag to choose from, I don't.

508
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,655
A lot of my looks are having
to be made in the workroom,

509
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,024
and it's because
of the lack of money.

510
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,927
I can just put elastic
around the waistband,

511
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,294
just to make it fast.

512
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,997
- Honey, I am the MacGyver
- Of drag.

513
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,564
I will jimmy-rig that bitch

514
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,566
right before it is time
for me to get onstage,

515
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,203
- whether it is hot-glued,
- Safety-pinned, bobby-pinned.

516
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:06,805
- That's gonna be very Naomi
from "Mama's Family."

517
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,373
Remember the daughter-in-law

518
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,811
- that always had the off
- The shoulder ruffle tops? No?

519
00:20:11,814 --> 00:20:15,213
- I came to this competition
with glitter and Jesus,

520
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,583
- and, bitch,
- I'm making it work, okay?

521
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,784
[laughs]

522
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,886
- How you feel about your panel?

523
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,255
- I feel great about my panel,
girl, but...

524
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,923
- Who is this?

525
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:25,925
- That's me, bitch.

526
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:28,460
- Wait, what? Oh, my God.

527
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,729
Was that a conscious decision
you made to look like that?

528
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,531
- Yeah, so I started going
to the gym with a boyfriend.

529
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,801
- Did you do drag here
- At this point?

530
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:38,270
- No. There's a running joke
- In Nashville

531
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,239
that if I'm not doing drag,
I'm in a relationship.

532
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,741
- And he was one of the people
- That was like,

533
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,310
- you're never
- Gonna do drag again.

534
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:47,112
And I threw half my drag in
the dumpster when I dated him.

535
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:50,648
And then we broke up and I
wanted to come back to drag.

536
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,684
I couldn't leave it.

537
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,587
- And now I have muscles
- And tattoos,

538
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,022
and it's a whole 'nother world
from what that first picture is.

539
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,490
So it's like...
- Girl.

540
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,059
- Yeah. In the beginning,
I really struggled

541
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,529
finding a balance
between my new body

542
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,332
and the drag that I was used to.

543
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,499
It was a challenge

544
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,933
when I came back
and started doing drag again,

545
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:12,404
because the girls were like,
oh, now you look like a dude.

546
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,206
- You look like a boy,
- You look like a man in...

547
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,540
like a man in a dress
because your arms are so big.

548
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,977
So it made me self-conscious.

549
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:20,312
- You know, I didn't show my arms,
- And that's challenging.

550
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:21,680
- I mean, in drag,
- I can't wear spaghetti straps,

551
00:21:21,683 --> 00:21:23,581
can't wear halter tops.

552
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,684
So, you know, I kind of threw
that away when I came here.

553
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,586
- It doesn't matter
- What your body shape is,

554
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:30,355
you should be able to, you know,
put on a dress and put on a wig

555
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,191
and go get your life
and perform for people.

556
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,293
- I'm so inspired,
I'm gonna go on a diet.

557
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,328
- Girl. [laughs]

558
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,397
- I'm just joking, just joking.

559
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,433
- You said that your parents

560
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,636
don't even know
that you do drag?

561
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,206
- So what it is is that I wasn't
raised by my biological parents.

562
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,209
- I was raised
- By my aunt and my uncle.

563
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:51,976
- Right.

564
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,043
- They don't know I do drag,

565
00:21:53,044 --> 00:21:54,613
but everyone else
in my family does.

566
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,548
I grew up in St. Lucia.

567
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,716
I'm from the West Indies,

568
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:00,018
and people just don't
live out in the open

569
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,455
- as being homosexual or gay,
- Lesbian, trans, bi,

570
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,291
- anything in the Caribbean,
- Period.

571
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:08,560
The islands are not the most
welcoming to homosexuality,

572
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,230
- so I won the Ms. Gay Caribbean
- Pageant, you know that.

573
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,864
- Oh, yes, I do, girl.

574
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,367
- In 2014, I won
a small pageant in Brooklyn,

575
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,367
and at the end of the pageant

576
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,435
they're taking
all these pictures.

577
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:19,672
- I'm like, I'm the winner,
- Of course.

578
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:20,704
Please take my picture.

579
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:21,905
The pageant was on Saturday.

580
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:23,042
I wake up Monday morning

581
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:24,910
- with, like, 27 missed calls
- From my mom.

582
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,979
- I'm like, what happened,
- What is going on?

583
00:22:26,982 --> 00:22:28,747
- They sent an article back
- To St. Lucia

584
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,217
with me in drag
on the cover of the newspaper,

585
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,919
the only newspaper
on the entire island,

586
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,587
and it's me talking about

587
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,989
St. Lucia's first gay
pageant winner

588
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,624
wins this thing.

589
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,327
- She called me, she was like,
what is going on?

590
00:22:41,328 --> 00:22:43,962
Are you trans, you're gay, what
is all this shit going on?

591
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,531
I'm like, no, I was just
doing it for a movie thing

592
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,433
and it got misconstrued.

593
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:52,238
- It was the craziest thing
- In my life, girl.

594
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:56,241
In retrospect I should have just
said, hey, I'm a drag queen.

595
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,210
But I, like, lied about it,
and there's a small sliver of me

596
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,312
that thinks that
they might reject me,

597
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,649
- and that is why
- I don't want to say it.

598
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:06,118
It's very scary.

599
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,724
- What is your hat look
inspired by tonight?

600
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,793
- It's like a broad-brimmed hat,
- And it's covered in hair.

601
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:16,060
- Work.

602
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,830
- I'm hoping that
it doesn't look too homemade.

603
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,731
- Girl, that's what I'm hoping,

604
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,533
because I had to rework
my complete hat.

605
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:23,802
- I watched her make that
- 30 minutes ago.

606
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,004
I cannot believe...

607
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:28,006
- I'm just hoping that
Michelle lives for it.

608
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,742
- Every time
- We're out on the runway

609
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,908
you are passing your outfit
through the sewing machine

610
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:34,311
one more time, and then the
judges, they tend to like it.

611
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,514
- You know, truthfully,

612
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:38,182
outside of that so-called
brown-cow-giraffe,

613
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,584
they really did live.

614
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,288
- I brought
- Some constructed looks,

615
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,522
and then I brought
a lot of fabric.

616
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,592
It is something that
I have been struggling with.

617
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,994
- However, there have been
- A lot of bitches

618
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:52,765
- that had a lot more shit
- Than me that have gone home,

619
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:54,366
and that's a fact.

620
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,568
- Vangie.

621
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,071
- Vangie.

622
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,388
- ♪ Cover girl,
- Put the bass in your walk ♪

623
00:24:16,391 --> 00:24:19,692
- ♪ Head to toe,
- Let your whole body talk ♪

624
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,127
- At what?

625
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,431
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

626
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm her number-one fan,
Michelle Visage.

627
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,035
- Um, stalker.

628
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,104
[all laugh] Security!

629
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,040
- From the talk show
- Bossy Rossy,

630
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:36,574
it's Ross Mathews.

631
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,010
- Thank you for watching.
We'll be right back.

632
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,378
[all laugh]

633
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,380
- And the super-talented couple

634
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,851
- behind the smash hit movie
- "The Big Sick,"

635
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:49,253
Kumail Nanjiani
and Emily Gordon.

636
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,690
Now, Kumail, what do you think
of Michelle's silicone valley?

637
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,092
[all laugh]

638
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,595
- Exquisite.
- It's very hard to not look.

639
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:58,129
[all laugh]

640
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,933
- And Emily, who's the bigger
"Drag Race" fan, you or Kumail?

641
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,335
- That would have to be me,
- But to be fair,

642
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,003
I'm probably the biggest fan
in the universe,

643
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,171
so it's not really
a fair comparison.

644
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,307
- Thanks for the warning.

645
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:10,308
[all laugh]

646
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,177
- Now, this week,
- We challenged our queens

647
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,779
to create RuPaul's
Drag Con panels

648
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,048
that make you go, whoa.

649
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,583
[all laugh]

650
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:23,555
- And later on the runway,
- Category is Hats Incredible.

651
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,555
- [laughs]

652
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,424
- Gentlemen,
start your engines,

653
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,960
and may the best woman win.

654
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:34,366
- This is an extra-special edition
- Of RuPaul's Drag Con.

655
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,567
Please welcome to the stage

656
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:39,670
Eureka, Monét X Change
and Kameron Michaels.

657
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,140
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

658
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,908
- Hello, y'all.

659
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,543
- Looking live.

660
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,611
- Yes!

661
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:47,677
- Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

662
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:48,981
My name is Eureka O'Hara.

663
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:51,784
- I'll be doing a little
- Moderating today for our panel.

664
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:52,818
Proportionizing.

665
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,254
- All: Creating
- The perfect silhouette.

666
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:56,721
- Ooh.

667
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,057
- We're gonna start with the
beautiful Ms. Kameron Michaels.

668
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,059
- We all have
- Different proportions

669
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,327
that we need to adjust

670
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,729
when going from boy
into female drag.

671
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,962
I am the body-builder Barbie.

672
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:07,833
I have an upside-down
triangle shape

673
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,067
- because I have
- Really broad shoulders.

674
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,334
- Isosceles.

675
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,336
- Girl, the only triangle
- I know about

676
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:13,171
is the food pyramid.

677
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,740
- You know, I've tried
to proportion my body

678
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,809
after superheroes
in comic books,

679
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,143
just that nice big bust,

680
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,046
- that tiny little waist,
- And big old hips.

681
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,581
So these are my hip pads.

682
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,984
In case you've never seen one,
this is what they look like.

683
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,920
- And then
- When it comes to my bra,

684
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:29,755
- I just sew
- The little bra inserts

685
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:30,956
from the craft department

686
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,324
so I can literally
strap it on and go quick.

687
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,425
- All right.

688
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,727
- So that's how I create
- My perfect shape,

689
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:36,728
because we are what?

690
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,563
All: Proportionizing!

691
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,898
- Yes, girl, There you go.

692
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,167
- Now Ms. Monét,

693
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,769
- I have to create my shape
- On the bottom

694
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:45,771
- because I am a flat pancake
- In the back,

695
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,437
but you've got a big old booty
back there, girl.

696
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:48,640
- Oh, doesn't she?
[cheers and applause]

697
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,107
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

698
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,044
- Well, listen, I come from
a long line of big-booty Judys.

699
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,913
- My grandmother,
- My great-great-grandmother,

700
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:57,182
- my great-great-great-great-great
- Grandfather.

701
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:59,618
- [all laugh]
- And, yeah, so we do have

702
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:01,587
- very nice, plump bottoms
- In my family,

703
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:03,587
but not all of us got titties
and hips and stuff like that.

704
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,590
- So I had to figure out
- How to, like,

705
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:05,923
make my body look good

706
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,993
so that I can get the menses,
you right there, sir.

707
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,295
[all laugh]

708
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,430
So what I would do is
I would take these old tights,

709
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,400
when they ripped, instead of
throwing these in the garbage,

710
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,569
- what you do is you fold them up
- About three or four times

711
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:19,204
- and you safety-pin it
- So that they all stay together.

712
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:22,139
Then what you wanna do
is pull your titty fat,

713
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,976
your man-boobs, and put it
right here in the pocket,

714
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:25,976
you know what I mean?

715
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,412
So you still get
a nice cleavage.

716
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:28,714
- Can we see that?
- Girl, she has tricks for tits.

717
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:29,748
- Yes.
- Tricks for tits!

718
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,682
[all laugh]

719
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,751
- Because we are what?
- Proportionizing!

720
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:34,785
- Amen?

721
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,954
[cheers and applause]

722
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,723
- Now, speaking
- Of proportionizing,

723
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:40,892
we all know Eureka O'Hara
is the big-body beautiful.

724
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,860
You're all about it, girl. Ow!

725
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,363
Ow, my eye. That hurt.

726
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,932
- But, yeah, so I remember
- When I was younger

727
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,267
I was made fun of for being big.

728
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:50,067
So when I started doing drag,

729
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:53,704
I didn't want to add a lot
of padding to my body shape.

730
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,206
I didn't want to look bigger.

731
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,309
But what I learned
is that as a female,

732
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,178
you want to have a tight waist,
a big hip, and a big breast.

733
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,548
Girl, I wear a 52H bra.

734
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,117
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- A what?

735
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,450
- 52H.

736
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,353
- That is eight letters in,
- Bitch, okay?

737
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,655
- She can count and do her ABCs.

738
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:11,923
[all laugh]

739
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:13,458
But if you proportion
your body as a female,

740
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,327
- it actually
- Makes you look thinner.

741
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,596
- So as a boy, I look like
- A cup of pudding.

742
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,696
[all laugh]

743
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,600
And as a female,
I look like a diva.

744
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:23,702
[cheers and applause]

745
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,105
- And I'm giving you cinch
- And hip and butt,

746
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,907
and I'm sweeping every hallway
as I walk through it.

747
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,975
You know what I mean?

748
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,377
So what I learned
how to do was...

749
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,111
- Proportionizing.
- Proportionizing.

750
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:36,682
- Say it with us.
One, two, three.

751
00:28:36,683 --> 00:28:38,416
All: Proportionizing!

752
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,351
- [laughs] That was good!

753
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,087
- Do we have anyone in the
audience who has any questions?

754
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,856
- Yeah, do you guys
have anything for us?

755
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,390
- Hop on up.

756
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:51,096
- In today's political climate,
- Why is drag so important?

757
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,698
- I think in this
- Political climate right now

758
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:54,065
we're all afraid.

759
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,468
And for us to escape maybe
the trials and tribulations

760
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:59,037
that we've went through
through our lives,

761
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,074
we do drag to celebrate
ourselves, our femininity.

762
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,709
People celebrate drag with us

763
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,678
- because it's a way for them
- To escape,

764
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,447
and it's a way for them
to feel like they belong

765
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:10,615
in a political climate
where right now

766
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,449
none of us feel like
we belong, truly.

767
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,452
- Amen.
[applause]

768
00:29:13,453 --> 00:29:14,819
- Oh!

769
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,921
- Sit down, sit down.

770
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,222
[cheers and applause]

771
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,358
- [laughs]

772
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,794
- ♪ Oh, pit crew ♪

773
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,597
- Talk amongst yourselves.
I'm gonna be busy back here.

774
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:26,965
- Y'all just...
- Well, I think that

775
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:27,997
you should explain
your shorts real quick.

776
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:29,232
- Okay, I guess I can.

777
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,134
You're trying to distract me
so I can't watch.

778
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:32,237
- I know, because you nasty.

779
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,206
- Focus, girl, focus.
- Girl.

780
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:36,975
- I am trying to focus...
- On that D.

781
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:38,709
[all laugh]

782
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,312
Okay. [laughs]

783
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,882
- So what I have
- Is I have these pad shorts,

784
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,817
and it's a pair of shorts
that pads are built into.

785
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,785
And it makes it real easy.

786
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,588
- So let's put the shorts on him.
- Put the shorts on him.

787
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:50,821
- Yeah.

788
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:51,923
- And here we go.
- There you go, baby. Good.

789
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:53,825
- All right,
- Slide them on up. Yeah.

790
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:55,359
- Now step in front of this

791
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,828
so we can see what
your body look like.

792
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,329
- Get yo ass around here.

793
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,331
- There we go, look at that.

794
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:00,998
- Uh-oh. Okay.

795
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,034
So next we're gonna
have to do the bra.

796
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,037
- Like we talked about,
- It's all about proportion.

797
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,706
- So he has a big shoulder,
- A big chest,

798
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,741
- so we give him big hips
- And butt,

799
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:13,144
and a big breast to make that
waist look as small as we can.

800
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,379
- There we go.
- That's pretty good.

801
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,647
You did so good.
- That's good. That's good.

802
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,050
- [laughs]
- Wanna do a little more?

803
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:20,352
- Gotta put this dress on.
- Over her head, girl.

804
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:21,420
- Some of you girls
know about that.

805
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:24,088
[all laugh]

806
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,190
Pull, baby, pull.

807
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,893
- [cheers and applause]
- Yeah!

808
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:29,159
[cheers and applause]

809
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,762
- We have enjoyed
having your time.

810
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:32,396
Love you guys.
Thank you, Brian.

811
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,131
- Thank you.
- You look amazing.

812
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,600

painted for the cheap seats,
and painted for the VIP, okay?

823
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:03,294
Bringing out
first my dear sister.

824
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,629
- You've seen her probably
- In a pageant.

825
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:07,932
She probably beat you with
her Danny Glover illusion.

826
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:10,234
Ms. Asia O'Hara.

827
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,536
[cheers and applause]

828
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,838
- Hey.

829
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,706
- Bringing out

00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:19,944
hit unfollow,

832
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,879
Ms. Aquaria.

833

[cheers and applause]

834
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,616
- Hi, guys.

835
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,585
Ooh! Hi.

836
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,521
- Asia, would you go ahead and
give them a little background

837
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,923
- of how you fell in love
- With makeup?

838
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:34,860
- Sure. Well, drag was
- The first time I ever saw makeup

839
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,228
or was interested in makeup,

840
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,563
- and then I became
- A Chanel makeup artist.

841
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,598
And day-in and day-out in Dallas

842
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,300
I was putting rouge on
70-year-old white women,

843
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:46,438
- and now I am
- A 70-year-old white woman.

844
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,874
- So here we are.
- [laughter and applause]

845
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,675
- Stunning, right?
She looks good.

846
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,810
- Ms. Aquaria,
- Go ahead and tell us

847
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:53,378
- how you fell in love
- With makeup.

848
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:54,611
- So back in the day,

849
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,581
I used to, when I was in,
like, seventh grade,

850
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,951
- do makeup at home
- And take pictures on my webcam.

851
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:01,553
My parents were very liberal,
all right?

852
00:32:01,554 --> 00:32:04,256
- They named me Aquaria.
- [all laugh]

853
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:06,424
- But, yeah, so I would
- Take pictures on my webcam,

854
00:32:06,427 --> 00:32:07,959
- and because I was good
- At computers,

855
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:10,562
- I would Photoshop
- My eyebrows in different places,

856
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:13,731
and the next time I would do
my makeup I would apply that.

857
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,334
- So through trial-and-error,
- I got here.

858
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:18,035
- Boom.
- Nice.

859
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,471
- And she looks good,
she looks good.

860
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,940
Well, just a little background
about myself.

861
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,609
I got started in makeup
when I started drag.

862
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,178
One of my friends said, look,

863
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,314
- instead of staying up late
- At night jerking off,

864
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,448
paint your face.

865
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,385
- [all laugh]
- And, bitch, it worked, okay?

866
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:35,019
She looks stunning, right?

867
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,386
- And sometimes
you can do both.

868
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,556
- At the same time.

869
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:39,290
- Huh?
[all laugh]

870
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,692
- Get some hand sanitizer,
- You know,

871
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,761
- make sure you, you know,
- Yum, yum, yum.

872
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:44,194
All right, do we have
any questions out there

873
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,628
about makeup or anything?

874
00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:47,566
Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi, I have one.

875
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:51,202
What could a woman like me
learn from a drag queen?

876
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,638
- Don't be afraid to try
new and different things.

877
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,440
- If it's a Saturday night
- And you're not going anywhere,

878
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,409
- try a different eye
- Or try a different color

879
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,641
or try a different lipstick.

880
00:32:58,642 --> 00:32:59,911
So try new things.

881
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,379
- I think
- What we all need to take

882
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:03,414
from makeup being
such a creative thing

883
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,884
- is that there really is
- No rules.

884
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,317
Do whatever makes you happy,

885
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,552
and if you look like a clown on
the street but you feel great,

886
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:10,920
that's what's most important,

887
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,490
because, you know,
fuck everyone else.

888
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,657
- I agree.

889
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,494
[cheers and applause]

890
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,498
- Make some noise for Ms. Bri.

891
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,001
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

892
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,637
I am going to demonstrate
the shimmer highlight,

893
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,239
one of the trending trends...

894
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,540
Yeah, I said that right.

895
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,809
- Okay. [laughs]
- To make sure

896
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,845
- you don't have a dry,
- You know, cake-dusty face.

897
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:37,015
- Now, what a lot of people
- Are doing, ladies and gentlemen,

898
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,283
is they're just putting on
their shimmer highlight

899
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:40,384
and they're going,
why isn't it giving me

900
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,386
the ooh-ah-ah sensation?

901
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,421
- [laughs]

902
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,521
- Are you wearing foundation?

903
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:46,625
Yeah, you are.
Okay, good.

904
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:47,958
Hee hee hee hee hee.

905
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,927
- [laughs]
- Okay.

906
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,830
You wanna dip your product.
One, two, three.

907
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,431
Knock, one, two.

908
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,470
- And then right here
- On the high point of his cheek,

909
00:33:58,471 --> 00:33:59,938
that's where you want
to apply your product.

910
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:02,473
One, two, three.
And ladies and gentlemen,

911
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,143
- we call this
- A sickening shimmer glow.

912
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:07,611
From side to side... boom, boom.

913
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,580
- Ahh.

914
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,349
- Asia, go ahead and show us
how to put on a lash.

915
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,450
- Okay. I'm just gonna
take this one off.

916
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,353
- I hope I can
- Get this back symmetrical.

917
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:16,421
- Come on, Patti LaBelle.

918
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,289
- When I apply my lash glue,

919
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,557
on the outer end of my lash

920
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,795
- I put the glue
- On the top of the lash.

921
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:24,996
- While she's working on that,

922
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:26,898
- I'm gonna give you
- A quick little instruction

923
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,900
- on how to achieve
- A gorgeous red glitter lip.

924
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:31,136
- Using the glue that you
- Would use for your eyelashes,

925
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,071
I'm gonna just apply it with
the back of a brush to my lips.

926
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,443
- Keep it thin, because otherwise
- It's gonna be too cakey.

927
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:39,945
- And while she's doing that,

928
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:42,112
my secret weapon with lashes
is a blow-dryer.

929
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,282
Whenever I see it hit
where I want it to,

930
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,352
- I just hold
- The blow-dryer there.

931
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:49,653
- And today I've got
a holographic pink glitter,

932
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,523
- and I'm just gonna
- Pat that on.

933
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:53,857
- And then you're gonna have

934
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,027
- a little bit of disconnect
- Under that.

935
00:34:56,028 --> 00:34:57,760
Just fill that in
with your black liner,

936
00:34:57,761 --> 00:34:59,929
and if you feel like somebody's
trying to spook your lash,

937
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,297
you know, just when
you're in their face,

938
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:02,999
you just always kinda give them
different angles or whatever.

939
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,836
Don't sit still and they
won't be able to clock it.

940
00:35:04,837 --> 00:35:06,203
[all laugh]

941
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,872
- And I am all good
and glittered up.

942
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:10,007
- We wanna say thank you so much

943
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:13,712
- for coming on out to Drag Con
- On tonight.

944
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:14,746
- Yeah.
- [cheers and applause]

945
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:17,782
- Bye, guys.
[cheers and applause]

946
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:20,884
- Hello!

947
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,621
- Hi!
- Oh, my goodness.

948
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,658
- Thank you guys so much
- For being here.

949
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:28,760
- This is such a pleasure.
- We're so excited, am I right?

950
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:31,128
- I am gagging.
- Oh, my gosh.

951
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,698
- I'm just here for a check,
- But whatever.

952
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:37,301
- We are Wigs Anonymous today,
and our hope and goal

953
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:42,039
is to maybe turn your wig woes
into wig wows.

954
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,675
- She's corny.
- You can say it. She's corny.

955
00:35:43,678 --> 00:35:46,678
- I know. I'm from Indiana.
- We love corn.

956
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,913
- We are here to make
your wig life better.

957
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,648
Now, who the fuck are you?

958
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,519
- My name is Blair St. Clair,
and I'm a wigaholic.

959
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,192
- Okay. My name is Miz Cracker,
- And I am... a wigaholic.

960
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:03,594
- I am The Vixen,

961
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,530
and I'm a wigaholic.

962
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,033
- You wouldn't know
by looking at you.

963
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:09,967
- Ooh.

964
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:11,334
- Imma get you later, bitch.

965
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,704
- She's dry.
She's thirsty.

966
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,005
- She needs
- A little extra help.

967
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,372
- This is her moment.

968
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,841
- I've come to terms
- With the fact

969
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:19,710
that I'm not a natural blonde.

970
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,112
- Oh.
- [scattered laughter]

971
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,580
Not everyone's able,
you know what I'm saying?

972
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,816
- Fuck you, bitch.

973
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:26,784
- Oh, really?

974
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,386
- So...
- But you know what?

975
00:36:28,389 --> 00:36:31,155
- I am ready to turn
my wig woes into wig...

976
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:33,023
what'd you say? Wows.

977
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,024
- There we go.

978
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,726
- So who here has maybe

979
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:39,064
- ever thought about wearing
- A wig before?

980
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:41,232
- Oh, you've thought about it.
- Okay.

981
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:44,201
[all laugh]
- Who's wearing a wig right now?

982
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,636
- Lies.
- Really?

983
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,004
- I see a few liars.

984
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:48,206
- Come on, come on,
- You can tell the truth.

985
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,706
- I actually smell a merkin.

986
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,875
- Oh, you know what?

987
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,743
I'm African-A'Merkin, so...

988
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,112
- Oh, oh,
- That's what it is, okay.

989
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:57,549
- All right, so we have
- Some desire for wig knowledge,

990
00:36:57,552 --> 00:37:00,118
- and what we have to do is
- Let them know why we're experts.

991
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:02,186
What connects you to hair, okay?

992
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,621
- Well, girl,
- To become an expert,

993
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:05,423
- you have to
- Go through some things.

994
00:37:05,426 --> 00:37:08,325
- And I have been through...
all right, y'all picture this.

995
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,194
So I'm on stage, right?

996
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,897
- Sickening, big hair,
- Ready to perform, right?

997
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,065
- So different than this.

998
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,166
- Oh.
- Ooh.

999
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,936
- Don't try me.
I take one turn,

1000
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,439
my hair, like a Frisbee...

1001
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,142
- Onto the other side
- Of the stage.

1002
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,710
That is true betrayal
right there.

1003
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,078
- Right, absolutely.

1004
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,848
And what about you,
Blair St. Hair?

1005
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,717
- Well, I do declare that,
- You know,

1006
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,220
- let me take you back
- To about maybe three years ago

1007
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:37,489
- when I was six years old.
- Yes.

1008
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:39,457
- Not only did I discover
- As a little gay boy

1009
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,259
that my t-shirt was a gown,
but it could also be a wig.

1010
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,795
- And that hair
- Can be any style.

1011
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:45,263
It can be an updo, a downdo.

1012
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:47,532
- For me, it was all the 'dos
- And a gown.

1013
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:48,764
- But the great moment

1014
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:49,868
is that she's still wearing
that same t-shirt,

1015
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:51,302
- just with a few sequins,
- Right now.

1016
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,137
She's lovely.
It's just great.

1017
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:56,039
We wanna get you guys
involved a little bit.

1018
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,243
- Yeah.
- So do you have any questions?

1019
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,079
- I just wondered
- If you guys had any advice

1020
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,715
- for, like, baby queens,
- With wigs.

1021
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:07,852
- Just do one or two things,
- Any things,

1022
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:08,918
between taking them
out of the bag

1023
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,052
and putting them on your head.

1024
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:11,222
- Yeah. You can't just...
- There's no...

1025
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:13,124
- Don't buy it
- And put it on your head.

1026
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,558
- Right.
- Okay.

1027
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,926
- Definitely seek out

1028
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,827
any kind of extra knowledge
or education you can get.

1029
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,095
- Listen to the old queens.

1030
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,263
I always go to Miz Cracker,

1031
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,031
because, you know,
she's up in age...

1032
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,232
- I saw that coming.

1033
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:25,170
- And so, you know,
you can always get

1034
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:28,272
really good advice
from the elderly.

1035
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,941
And so you take that,
and you learn something.

1036
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,409
That's what I would say.

1037
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,077
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1038
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,513
[applause]

1039
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,418
- So the first thing
- We want to do,

1040
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:41,551
let 'em know, Blair.

1041
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,487
- Tell them where we start.
- Yeah, okay.

1042
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,987
So what I've done with this wig

1043
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,522
is I've tried to kind of conceal

1044
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,392
- some of those square shapes
- Along the hairline.

1045
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:49,360
Hairlines are what
can look really masculine

1046
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,563
- or go really femu... feminine.
- Femunine.

1047
00:38:51,566 --> 00:38:54,698
So what I've actually done...
I'm gonna set this here softly.

1048
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,333
- Stick it on there.

1049
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,800
- Harder.
- There we go.

1050
00:38:57,801 --> 00:38:59,235
- Yeah, there we go.
- So what I've kind of done

1051
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,238
with this front part of the wig

1052
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:02,674
- is I have done all this
- With teasing.

1053
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:05,676
So I'm just kind of brushing
this down a little bit as I go.

1054
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,946
And then after I have all this
tease put in with all this hair,

1055
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,081
I'm just gonna smooth it out.

1056
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:11,381
- The next part of this

1057
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:15,553
- is gonna be about
- Attaching it to his melon.

1058
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,989
- When you're preparing
- To put a wig on someone's head,

1059
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:19,724
- it's just like preparing
- For a bank robbery.

1060
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:22,426
All you need is some duct tape
and some stockings.

1061
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,530
- Here we go. So now
- I'm gonna take this duct tape.

1062
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,764
[rips tape]
- Whoo!

1063
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:28,864
- This is great.

1064
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:30,401
- Is that gonna hurt
when it comes off?

1065
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:32,302
- Um... no.

1066
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,572
- [all laugh]
- Like this, all right?

1067
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,505
And now we can control
his facial expressions.

1068
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:37,540
All right, no,
I'm just kidding.

1069
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,676
Now we're gonna take this

1070
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,779
- and we are attaching it
- To his head.

1071
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:43,180
- Nice and tight there.

1072
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,748
- Okay. I'm gonna have you put

1073
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:45,781
both your fingers up like this,

1074
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:47,116
right up against your forehead.

1075
00:39:47,117 --> 00:39:48,853
And when I pull this wig
over the top of your head,

1076
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,687
just kind of latch on, okay?

1077
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:51,923
- All right, it's happening.

1078
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:53,123
- There we go.

1079
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,357
- It's like Frankenstein.

1080
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,493
- Oh, my goodness, hello.

1081
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,593

[all laugh]

1193
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,595
- "My Fair Lady"
- Is my mother's favorite movie,

1194
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:52,963
and I identify
with Eliza Doolittle:

1195
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,998
Hottie, cheeky, happy.

1196
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,434
This is my hair.
I don't wear hats.

1197
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,404
- This took me
- Over 12 hours to make.

1198
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:01,973
- Does the carpet
match the hat, or...

1199
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:03,139
[all laugh]

1200
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,710
- That's called hat hair,
- Right?

1201
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:07,011
- She's got hat head, yeah.

1202
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:08,912
- Total hat hair.

1203
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:13,316
- I do declare,
it's Blair St. Clair.

1204
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,120
- For whom
- The Southern belle tolls.

1205
00:44:16,123 --> 00:44:17,654
[all laugh]

1206
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,423
- My hat is inspired
by the Kentucky Derby

1207
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:22,059
- and "Hello, Dolly,"
- And old Broadway musicals.

1208
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:24,394
So when I was making the hat,

1209
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,764
I really wanted it
to be grand and big,

1210
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,967
- but also have
- An elegant flair to it.

1211
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,203
- Does anybody have
- A mint julep?

1212
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:33,437
- She's getting the vapors.

1213
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:34,838
- Uh-huh.

1214
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,473
- Shh.

1215
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,974
[all laugh]

1216
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,476
- The Vixen.

1217
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,545
Ladies and gentlemen,
Hattie McDaniels.

1218
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,347
[all laugh]

1219
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,183
- Excuse me, could you
remove your hat, please?

1220
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,184
[all laugh]

1221
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:52,656
- My hat is a flappy, classic
black-and-white beach hat,

1222
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:55,025
but the gag is my entire dress

1223
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,861
is flappy, classic
black-and-white beach hats.

1224
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:01,031
I am giving you
couture 3D avant garde

1225
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,999
with a classic twist.

1226
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,735
I made this myself,
and I love it.

1227
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,506
- What's black and white
- And ass all over?

1228
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:09,573
[all laugh]

1229
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,007
- Hat's all, folks.

1230
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,276
[all laugh]

1231
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,712
- Welcome, ladies.

1232
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,582
- Based on
- Your runway presentations,

1233
00:45:17,585 --> 00:45:20,083
your Drag Con panels,

1234
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:24,355
- plus feedback
- From the Drag Con audience,

1235
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:26,724
I've made some decisions.

1236
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:28,626
- Welcome, ladies.

1237
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:30,595
I've made some decisions.

1238
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:37,168
- Kameron Michaels,
- Monét X Change, Eureka,

1239
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,903
you are the top three
of the week.

1240
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:43,608
[applause]

1241
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:50,513
Miz Cracker, Blair St. Clair,
The Vixen,

1242
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,017
- you are the bottom three
- Of the week.

1243
00:45:55,353 --> 00:46:00,857
Aquaria, Monique Heart,
Asia O'Hara, you are safe.

1244
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,526
Asia, good work this week.

1245
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,395
- Thank you so much.

1246
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,231
- You may leave the stage.

1247
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:15,806
- Now it's time
- For the judges' critiques,

1248
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,607
starting with Kameron Michaels.

1249
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,111
- I want to say
- What are we doing, girls?

1250
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:22,113
- Proportionizing!
- Thank you.

1251
00:46:22,114 --> 00:46:23,848
I just felt really jealous.
I needed to do it.

1252
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:25,849
Kameron, tonight on the runway

1253
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,618
you did a spacey
fascinator moment,

1254
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,154
- and I thought it was fun
- And different.

1255
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:31,955
- The panel on the whole,

1256
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,658
it was just a great mix of
information and entertainment.

1257
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,794
- You're on that stage with
some pretty funny queens, okay?

1258
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,664
- I am.
- Compared to their funny,

1259
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,299
- it did feel like a little
- After-school special.

1260
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:44,902
- But it was nice
- To see you come through.

1261
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:47,169
You've been very reclusive,
and that's kind of a problem

1262
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,439
that I've been having with you.

1263
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,806
So my challenge for you

1264
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,109
- is to keep pushing yourself
- Further and further

1265
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:53,677
to show us your personality.

1266
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,378
It was a joy.
- Thank you.

1267
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,980
- Let the church say "amen."

1268
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,815
It's Monét X Change

1269
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,919
- serving some Sheryl Lee Ralph
- This evening.

1270
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,055
- So, Monét, you've been
struggling a little bit.

1271
00:47:04,056 --> 00:47:06,390
- Yes.
- And tonight,

1272
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:08,158
I'm not gonna lie.

1273
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,459
I love it.

1274
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,128
Your attitude, your delivery.

1275
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,297
- You had an amazing
- Performance.

1276
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,132
You're so funny and so quick.

1277
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,368
- I'm just so proud
of you tonight.

1278
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,103
- You also are the winner

1279
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:22,640
- of the "Turn
- A Carson Kressley blazer

1280
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:24,574
into an outfit" competition.

1281
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,810
[all laugh]

1282
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,546
- Thank you, Monét.
- Thank you, Ru.

1283
00:47:28,547 --> 00:47:30,413
- Up next, Eureka.

1284
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:33,117
- I really, really liked
- This graphic, kind of bold look.

1285
00:47:33,118 --> 00:47:34,552
It looks stunning on you.

1286
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:36,687
- I wanna know is that a one-piece
- Or are those gloves?

1287
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,121
- Oh, it's all attached.

1288
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:39,256
- Now I love it even more.

1289
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:42,025
- In the Drag Con panel,
you were the moderator.

1290
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,094
- You were great
- With the audience.

1291
00:47:43,095 --> 00:47:44,428
- You were setting the tone,

1292
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:46,863
and I thought you did
such a great job.

1293
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,132
- I'm gonna be saying
"proportionizing"

1294
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:51,702
- to myself in the mirror
- For weeks.

1295
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:54,804
You have the skill that
when you're zinging people,

1296
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,607
- making it seem funny
- And not mean.

1297
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:01,345
- Eureka was the favorite
- From the audience exit polls.

1298
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:03,214
- Thank you, Eureka.
- Thank you.

1299
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,548
- Up next, Miz Cracker.

1300
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,251
- The look is so good,
I just loved it.

1301
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,954
It's a hair hat.
It's why I love you.

1302
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,289
- The panel didn't have
a lot of information.

1303
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,659
- As a woman who has bought
- Party City wigs

1304
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,925
many times in my life,

1305
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:19,194
I would love to know
how to make those look good.

1306
00:48:19,195 --> 00:48:20,831
Unfortunately,
I still don't know.

1307
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:24,535
- You guys really didn't tell us
- Anything about hair.

1308
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:27,805
- And you were trying to be shady.
- I live for shade.

1309
00:48:27,808 --> 00:48:30,241
- But in order for shade to land,
- It needs to be funny.

1310
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:32,275
A few of them were funny,

1311
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,178
but I felt a lot of the things
that you were saying were mean,

1312
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,980
especially to Blair.

1313
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,315
She seems like the sweetest
little lollipop.

1314
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:43,153
- I like her so much,
so not getting across

1315
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:47,257
that those were not actual digs
is my biggest setback, I think.

1316
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,661
- Or as a shocking alternative,
they could have been funny.

1317
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,164
- I declare, Blair St. Clair.

1318
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:56,033
- Tonight it's very sweet
- Southern belle.

1319
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,234
You're breathtaking.

1320
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:00,136
In the Drag Con panel,
you were nonexistent,

1321
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,473
- and every time
- You did say something,

1322
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:04,007
it was matter-of-fact.

1323
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:05,876
- Like show me something
that's not just cute.

1324
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:07,478
- It's like you're a dessert
- On the menu,

1325
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:09,013
- and I keep looking at you
- And thinking, like,

1326
00:49:09,014 --> 00:49:11,315
maybe that's just too sweet
for tonight, I don't know.

1327
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:16,219
- I've come from some, like,
really dark moments in my life,

1328
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,723
- and I want to lighten them up
- And become more positive.

1329
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:22,759
I urge to find daintiness,

1330
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,161
because I feel dirty at times.

1331
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,935
[sniffles]

1332
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:34,904
Um...

1333
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,473
My first sexual experience,

1334
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:42,012
I was raped at a college party.

1335
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:50,354
- And from that, I've looked
- To find pretty things.

1336
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,592
Something I need to get over,

1337
00:49:54,593 --> 00:50:01,232
- but I've tried to turn positive
- The best I can.

1338
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:07,637
- Thank you for being
so candid with us.

1339
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,806
We love you, Blair,
and we are family,

1340
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:13,910
and I'm actually very proud
of you for being so vulnerable.

1341
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:15,478
- [exhales]

1342
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,380
- I'm very shaken,

1343
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,750
- and I can't wait to find
- That motherfucker.

1344
00:50:19,753 --> 00:50:22,719
- Thank you.
- No, I love you.

1345
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,721
- Blair, are you okay?

1346
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:25,989
All right.

1347
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,324
Up next, The Vixen.

1348
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,527
- This is such
- A great interpretation

1349
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,362
of the challenge and the theme.

1350
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,797
- I think
- It's absolutely stunning.

1351
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,200
- It's really fun
to have a floppy hat,

1352
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,903
but we can't see your face.

1353
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,640
In the Drag Con panel,
though you had some moments,

1354
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,710
- it was just, in Yiddish,
- A mishegoss.

1355
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:49,445
And some of your cuts
were kind of deep, too.

1356
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,780
- We do get along.

1357
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,516
This is our third time
working together,

1358
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,052
- and the first two times
- We were tops.

1359
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,452
We were very confident,

1360
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,720
and being like we're fine,
we don't need a moderator.

1361
00:50:58,721 --> 00:50:59,988
- I think you guys

1362
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,325
actually would have benefited
from a moderator.

1363
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:04,193
I wish that we could have gotten
some real information out of it.

1364
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,362
That was the real issue.

1365
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,231
Thank you, ladies.

1366
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,099
I think we've heard enough.

1367
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,502
While you untuck backstage,

1368
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,504
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1369
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:17,774
All right, just between
us squirrel-friends,

1370
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:20,343
what do you think?
Kameron Michaels.

1371
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:21,644
- On the runway,

1372
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,781
- she did a little different look
- With the hat concept,

1373
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:26,350
- and I loved it, because
- She did think out of the box.

1374
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:28,852
- I found her runway look
to be a little simplistic.

1375
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:30,787
If you took away
the galaxy head,

1376
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:31,989
it looks very similar

1377
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:33,490
- to her look that she had
- During the panel,

1378
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:35,726
- which was just
- A swimsuit with heels.

1379
00:51:35,727 --> 00:51:37,859
- I was so excited to see
some personality from her.

1380
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,061
Now I want her to give me
different looks.

1381
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,130
I mean, that's it.

1382
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,332
- Monét X Change.

1383
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,968
- She was very funny
during the panel,

1384
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:46,669
had great timing, had a very
appealing self-confidence.

1385
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,737
- You know when you, like,
see something in the store

1386
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:50,240
and you're like, I love it.
I have to have it.

1387
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,709
- And you bring it home,
- You put it in your closet,

1388
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:53,444
but you keep the tag on it
because you might return it?

1389
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:54,578
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh, well, tonight

1390
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:58,047
I'm pulling the tags
off Monét X Change.

1391
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,149
- You're not gonna exchange her?

1392
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,617
- No, she's staying
- In my closet.

1393
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:04,288
- Eureka. She's come back
- With a vengeance.

1394
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,291
- My God,
- Has she found her groove.

1395
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:10,159
- At the panel,
I thought she was fantastic.

1396
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,326
- Proportionizing!

1397
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:13,128
- She's naturally funny
and very charismatic.

1398
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,963
- And she absolutely
commands a room.

1399
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:16,732
Your eyes want to go to her,
you want to watch her,

1400
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,166
and you want to hear
what she has to say.

1401
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:19,636
She's definitely a contender.

1402
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,571
- Miz Cracker.

1403
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:22,940
- I loved her runway look.

1404
00:52:22,941 --> 00:52:25,142
- I thought
- It was absolutely stunning.

1405
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:27,711
- There's so much polish
- And so much good.

1406
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:29,312
It was just a really bad week.

1407
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:30,948
- I was not impressed
with Miz Cracker

1408
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,915
during the panel whatsoever.

1409
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,952
- I could see
- That she was very funny,

1410
00:52:34,955 --> 00:52:36,552
but it just wasn't landing today

1411
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,223
- and she just wasn't
- Making the adjustments.

1412
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:41,225
- Let's move on
to Blair St. Clair.

1413
00:52:41,226 --> 00:52:43,027
- Well, here's the difference
- With Blair.

1414
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,862
Miz Cracker swung and she
missed, and she missed hard.

1415
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:47,731
Blair didn't even
pick up the bat.

1416
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:50,433
She was totally bulldozed over
by the other two.

1417
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:51,869
- You know,
- We've laid a lot of blame

1418
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:54,337
on the other two queens
sort of zinging at her,

1419
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,540
but I think she should take
some of the responsibility, too.

1420
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,673
- Uh-huh.

1421
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,276
- I don't know
- If she's fully baked yet

1422
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:00,843
when it comes to her drag.

1423
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,979
- My heart goes out to her.

1424
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,180
We've all had trauma
in our backgrounds,

1425
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,682
and the first response to that

1426
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,485
- is to put rainbows
- On everything,

1427
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:10,421
- and maybe those feelings
- Will go away.

1428
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:11,787
We know that that doesn't work.

1429
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,424
Eventually we have
to walk through that.

1430
00:53:13,425 --> 00:53:16,459
I think she's attempting
to walk through that fear

1431
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,129
- and that pain
- To get to the other side.

1432
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:20,296
The Vixen.

1433
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,799
- She had a few zingers
that she landed.

1434
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,299
She had a lot that didn't land.

1435
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,967
She's just as much to blame

1436
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,270
as the rest of them
for it going awry.

1437
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:30,074
- Tonight on the runway
- Her hat look was different.

1438
00:53:30,075 --> 00:53:32,376
- There's always something
just a little unpolished

1439
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,943
about what she's doing.

1440
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,546
- Because you put her up next to
Cracker, Cracker wins that look.

1441
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:37,681
- Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely.

1442
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:39,183
- Way better runway.
- All right.

1443
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:41,184
[clap, clap] Silence.

1444
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:44,120
I have made my decision.

1445
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,988
Bring back my girls.

1446
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,323
Welcome back, ladies.

1447
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,859
I have made some decisions.

1448
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:55,498
Eureka, I have one word for you:

1449
00:53:55,499 --> 00:53:56,933
Proportionize.

1450
00:53:56,934 --> 00:54:00,137
Oh, and I have
another word for you.

1451
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:02,772
Con-drag-ulations.

1452
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,274
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1453
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,975
[applause]

1454
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:10,179
You've won a four-night stay
for two and spa treatments

1455
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,517
at the Saguaro Palm Springs.

1456
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:16,619
- Yes! Yay, thank you.

1457
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:17,921
- You may join the other girls.

1458
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,155
- Oh, my God.

1459
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:21,257
I'm the first girl
to win two in a row, bitch.

1460
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,561
Yay! [laughs]

1461
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,999
- Kameron Michaels,
Monét X Change,

1462
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,201
you are both safe.

1463
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,104
You may join the other girls.

1464
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,575
Blair St. Clair,

1465
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:43,180
on the wig panel, we had
trouble finding your part.

1466
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:49,019
- The Vixen, your wig flips
- Were a bit of a flop.

1467
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:54,223
Miz Cracker, your chemistry
on the wig panel

1468
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,260
was synthetic.

1469
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:01,130
Miz Cracker...

1470
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,599
you're safe.

1471
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:09,506
You may join the other girls.

1472
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,711
- Blair, Vixen,
- I'm sorry, my dears,

1473
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:17,246
but you are up for elimination.

1474
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,784
- I hate the fact I have
- To lip-sync against The Vixen.

1475
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:23,586
I really do love her a lot.

1476
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,022
- It's also a competition,
- Though.

1477
00:55:25,023 --> 00:55:26,657
You have to lip-sync
against somebody.

1478
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,859
- Two queens stand before me.

1479
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,463
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1480
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,367
and save yourself
from elimination.

1481
00:55:39,236 --> 00:55:41,371
- The time has come...
- [thunder]

1482
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:43,673
for you to lip-sync...

1483
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:48,244
[echoing] for your life.

1484
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,246
I love Blair,

1485
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:53,516
but it is time to battle,
and I am not going home.

1486
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:55,718
- Good luck,

1487
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,387
and don't fuck it up.

00:58:04,381 --> 00:58:07,883
- The Vixen, shantay, you stay.

1531
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:11,053
- [sobs]

1532
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:14,423
Thank you for believing in me.

- You may join the other girls.

1534
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,032
Blair St. Clair,
I do declare.

1535
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,902
- Consider this
- Your coming out party.

1536
00:58:25,905 --> 00:58:27,203
- [no voice]

1537
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,205
- And I want the world to know

1538
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:34,176
this is a declaration of
independence from the past.

1539
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:38,415
Now sashay away.

1540
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,052
- From the bottom of my heart,
- Thank you so much.

1541
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,555
[applause]

1542
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:48,592
- We love you, Blair.

1543
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,033
- I do declare,
- I am the Blair St. Clair

1544
00:58:57,036 --> 00:58:59,535
and I'm comin' out.

1545
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,406
[cheers and applause]

1546
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:05,742
- I'm really glad
- I got to share my story,

1547
00:59:05,745 --> 00:59:09,278
and I hope that maybe someone
can relate somewhere.

1548
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,347
I think I'm leaving
a stronger person,

1549
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:15,385
- and I wish I could show America
- Even more of who I am.

1550
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:18,221
- But I hope that what
- I left behind made a mark.

1551
00:59:18,224 --> 00:59:20,055
This means the world to me,

1552
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,160
- and I promise you,
- You haven't seen the last of me.

1553
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,563
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies,

1554
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:30,767
- and remember,
- If you can't love yourself,

1555
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,402
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1556
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,370
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1557
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:35,805
- Amen!
- Amen!

1558
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,641
