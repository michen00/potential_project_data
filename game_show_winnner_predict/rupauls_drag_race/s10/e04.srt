I want you to help me
market new dating apps.

Yuhua Hamasaki, sashay away.

17
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,745
- Whew.

18
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,847
- Girl.
- Girl.

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,047
- Ba-gawk.

20
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,917
- Oh, what did she write
in Chinese up there?

21
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,651
- I don't know what that says.

22
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,452
- I bet that says fuck y'all.

23
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,621
[all laugh]
- Bye, Yuhua.

24
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,125
- You're just like wiping her
- From history, girl.

25
00:00:58,128 --> 00:00:59,992
- Dang.

26
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,628
- I'm still here.
That's all that matters.

27
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,331
- I'm so happy.
- But I need to sit down.

28
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:05,698
My feet hurt.

29
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,100
- I am not supposed to be
- In the bottom.

30
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:09,936
I am in this game,
and I'm going to win it.

31
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,572
- From now on, bitches, y'all
- Better beware, 'cause I'm here.

32
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:13,706
- Hey.
- Yes.

33
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,009
- If we really want
- To set this oven off, girl.

34
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:18,278
- just stick one of these on here.
- [laughs]

35
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:20,513
- Where do those
keep coming from?

36
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:21,714
- Girl.

37
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,316
- So, Asia, congratulations.

38
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,218
- Yeah.
- You're the winner this time.

39
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,086
- Come on, Hefty bag.

40
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,121
Come on, Tweety.

41
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,256
[all laugh]
- Yes!

42
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,757
- Now nobody give her shit

43
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,393
- for borrowing those gloves,
- Though.

44
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:37,797
- Oh!
- Oh!

45
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,832
- Thank you, Blair,
for the gloves.

46
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,101
- You're welcome, girl.

47
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:44,037
- Monique has been really quiet.
- Is everything okay?

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,507
- Um, well, in "Untucked,"
Eureka brought up the fact

49
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,476
that I was thrown under the bus.

50
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,545
And that really
kind of made me feel

51
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,481
a certain type of way
by my teammates.

52
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:57,750
- Mayhem did call Monique out.

53
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,987
- She did mention her name
- Specifically.

54
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,021
- Who was the person
you were supposed to tell

55
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,823
that you didn't like that?

56
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:06,493
- Monique.
- She was our team leader.

57
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:08,561
She was very direct
of what she wanted,

58
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:09,895
so I was like, okay.

59
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,098
I'm gonna fall back

60
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,100
because I know if I was
to try to enforce something,

61
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,135
I would get shut down.

62
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,672
- The way that I meant
- All that

63
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,806
was when we first
started the project,

64
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,575
I was assigned narrator.

65
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,578
- And then
- When it all got switched,

66
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,544
that's when I was like,
eh, well, you know,

67
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:27,746
if that's what
you want me to do...

68
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,316
- Not to cut you off,
but to cut you off.

69
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:32,119
- I felt like
- It would happen already,

70
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,121
so I've just been quiet, like,
oh, I was thrown under the bus.

71
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,187
Got it.

72
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,323
- I didn't throw you
under the bus.

73
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,625
I already told you what I said.

74
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,160
- But where did that comment
- Come from?

75
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,294
I didn't boss you,

76
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:45,232
- but I kept going back
- To make sure were you okay

77
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:47,434
because you were so quiet.

78
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,570
- Really, girl?
Keep doing all that.

79
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,940
- It's hard to get a word in
with you big-mouth bitches.

80
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,442
You talk and talk and talk,

81
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,612
and when a bitch tries to get
a word in, you keep talking.

82
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,046
And I'm like, okay,

83
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,481
well, I'm just gonna
stay in my corner.

84
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,250
This is not about
RuPaul's Friends Race.

85
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:07,319
This is about
me getting $100,000,

86
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,389
- and getting you bitches
- Out of my way.

87
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,891
- If that's how you feel,
done and done, game on.

88
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:15,094
Game, set, match.

89
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,364
- On that note, let's get out
- Of this ass, bitch.

90
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,466
- America, the Bible says
that what's done in the dark

91
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,869
- will be brought to light,
- Mother darling.

92
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,075
The light's on.

93
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,512

Get it? Own.

176
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,607
No, you don't get it.

177
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,609
Tell Gayle I said hell-aire.

178
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,278
Now, are you a Beyoncé fan?

179
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,046
- Yes. I love her.

180
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,881
- House of Dereon, here we go.

181
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,284
I don't think
you can handle this.

182
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,386
- I can handle it.
I can handle it.

183
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,087
- [laughs]
Blair St. Clair,

184
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,189
Destiny's forgotten child.

185
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,594
- You and Mariah go back
- Like babies and pacifiers.

186
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:09,895
A star is born.

187
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,464
Kameron Michaels,
you're photo bombing

188
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,901
- the Trumps
- Looking at the eclipse.

189
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:18,470
Don't stare at the orange blob
or you'll go blind.

190
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,439
Now, this is Grumpy Cat.

191
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,675
Now, are you allergic to pussy?

192
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,476
- I actually am.

193
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,880
- [laughs] Now, this pussy
- Isn't on fire,

194
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:28,781
but he's worth millions.

195
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,385
- You're gonna be photo bombing
- Kanye and Kim K.

196
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:33,919
Do you do a lot
of photo bombing?

197
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,655
- No, I'm usually
the star of the pictures.

198
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,556
- [laughs]

199
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,292
- I'm very comfortable
in front of a camera,

200
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,260
and I love me
a good photoshoot.

201
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,530
- Oh, okay.
- So you a gold digger.

202
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,565
- Oh, honey, I'm not saying
I'm a gold digger, but...

203
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,768
- [laughs]

204
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,338
Nice work, photo bombers.

205
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:56,176
Now, one of you
really pulled focus.

206
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,414
Aquaria, you are the winner
of today's mini challenge.

207
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,883
- Oh, thank you.
[applause]

208
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:09,321
- I thought I was gonna win,
but Miss Aquafina won.

209
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,792
- You've won a $1,000 credit
from PostMates.

210
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,195
- Yes, come on, PostMates.

211
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,230
[doorbell rings]

212
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,564
- Come on in, PostMates.

213
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:24,970
- Oh, my gag,
it's Pit Crew Alum Shawn.

214
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,406
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

215
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:28,474
[all laugh]

216
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,275
- You can just leave the food,

217
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,812
and I will leave you
a big tip on the app.

218
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,781
- Please do.
- Okay.

219
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,083
Good to see you, Shawn.

220
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:43,021
Ladies, I've got good news,
I've got bad news.

221
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,358
- The bad news,
- Climate change is real.

222
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:48,260
The glacial caps are melting

223
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:52,332
and the world
is coming to an end.

224
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,703
- The good news,
- We're throwing a ball.

225
00:08:56,706 --> 00:08:58,203
[cheers and applause]

226
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,207
- That's right.
- For this week's maxi challenge,

227
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,544
you'll be competing in
The Last Ball on Earth.

228
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,279
- Gagging.

229
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,682
- Now, you need to serve
- Three lurks.

230
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:13,620
- First lurk,
- Alaskan Winter Realness.

231
00:09:13,623 --> 00:09:17,756
Think sexy bikini
fun in the sun.

232
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:22,128
- Second lurk,
- Miami Summer Realness.

233
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:27,533
Something furry to keep you
from freezing your muff off.

234
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,866
You're getting it now, right?

235
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,069
- I got it.
- Uh-huh.

236
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,708
Third lurk, Martian
Eleganza Extravaganza.

237
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,779
- Glamour Couture
- That will slay the runway

238
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:43,649
on your new home planet, Mars.

239
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,083
[all laugh]

240
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,319
- I think most of the girls
are very surprised

241
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,322
to see a ball dropping
so early in the competition,

242
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,991
but I'm so excited
to show RuPaul

243
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,760
that I am a fierce competitor.

244
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,729
- Gentlemen, start
your rocket engines,

245
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,333
and may the best woman win.

246
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,901
- Aah! Oh!

247
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,504
- Extra, extra,
read all about it.

248
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,138
It's The Last Ball on Earth.

249
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,974
- So we have three looks
- For this ball.

250
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:11,176
Alaska Winter Realness,
Miami Summer Realness,

251
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,046
- and Martian
- Eleganza Extravaganza.

252
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,850
- Y'all stop getting stuff y'all
don't know how to work with.

253
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:21,086
- There is a beautiful red shiny
patent leather quilted fabric,

254
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,756
- and Monet pushes everybody
- Out the way to get it.

255
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,960
- No stretch, ugh.
- I hate non-stretch material.

256
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,228
It's literally the devil.

257
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,496
- You had
- No business getting it.

258
00:10:29,497 --> 00:10:30,663
- Oh, but you can believe
I'll make it work, though.

259
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,500
- And then she comes
to get ready right beside me.

260
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,336
She's got these scissors,

261
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,270
and she is just cutting into it.

262
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,737
She ain't drawed a pattern.

263
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:40,840
It's like Edward Scissorhands,

264
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,208
and I am cringing

265
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,978
because I know how expensive
that fabric is.

266
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,747
- This is stressful, ugh.

267
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,915
Lord help me.

268
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,885
- This fabric
- Is not easy to work with.

269
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:54,419
- I told you stop grabbing stuff
you don't know how to work with.

270
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,721
- I think this material

271
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:58,157
- can be very much like
- I'm reflected from the sun.

272
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,791
It's this red vinyl moment.

273
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,860
So I'm going to give you

274
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,228
- like this like very
- Structured thing at the top

275
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,630
with these little
peplum moments.

276
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:04,696
- No sponges?

277
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,398
- Oh!
- Whoo!

278
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,466
- [laughs]

279
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,535
- Y'all some haters in here.

280
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,570
In my mind, RuPaul
loved the sponge dress.

281
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,039
And that is my truth
and I'm sticking to it.

282
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,508
Where's my little sponge?

283
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,708
- [laughs]

284
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,810
- So I'm praying to my sponge

285
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,381
- that I pull out
- Another fierce garment.

286
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,984
- So, baby,
- What's your look for today?

287
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:28,787
- I made this really cool
little antenna headpiece,

288
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,590
- because headpieces are
- My favorite thing to make.

289
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,224
- I know, I see.

290
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,861
- She's a little
- Radio frequency space girl.

291
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,261
How about yours?

292
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,095
- I'm trying to get
this Flash Gordon look.

293
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:40,033
One of the things
I'm worried about, though,

294
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:42,834
is that this is like
such a literal interpretation

295
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,070
of, you know, life on Mars.

296
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,739
I don't want them to think,
oh, she went and grabbed

297
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,475
- the easiest, like, Mars
- Reference you could possibly do,

298
00:11:49,478 --> 00:11:51,611
- and then didn't really
- Take us there.

299
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:54,212
So I wanna take them there.

300
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,848
I seem to have smashed
the first sewing challenge,

301
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,384
- but my dad said something
- When I was young

302
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,819
that really embodies
what I say to myself.

303
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,722
- I won a national gold medal
- For karate,

304
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:05,158
- and he said, "good,
- Now you have to win another,

305
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,093
or people will think
this was an accident."

306
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:11,563
That is me when I come
to every single runway.

307
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,667
I have to prove myself
every single day.

308
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,905
- Vanjie.

309
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,540
- Vanjie.
- Vanjie.

310
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,976
- Vanjie.
- Vanjie.

311
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,579
- No, me trying
- To hot glue... this is an issue.

312
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,945
I should probably hand sew it.

313
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,916
I mean, it can't fit
in the machine. It's too big.

314
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,583
- If you're gonna sew this,

315
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,784
and if you're gonna have
to sew it with the top up,

316
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:35,555
you're gonna have to take like
some scotch tape or something

317
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,823
- and put it
- On the bottom of the foot.

318
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:39,391
Because that's not gonna slide
through the machine.

319
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,094
- Asia is the black
Martha Stewart.

320
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,563
She over here telling everyone
how to do everything correctly.

321
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,897
- Black Martha, honey.

322
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,100
- Black Martha Blartha.

323
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,333
- [laughs]

324
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,303
- I'm helping
- A lot of girls a lot.

325
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:51,904
I'm threading
a lot of sewing machines.

326
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,672
I'm fixing a lot of bobbins.

327
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,907
- Asia, whatcha think?
Can I crisscross it?

328
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,174
- You need to like taper it out.

329
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,442
It just feels right.

330
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:00,747
I'm not Mother Teresa,
but it does make me feel good

331
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,481
that girls trust my opinion.

332
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,618
This right here is gonna need to
kind of cascade down like that.

333
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,655
It makes me feel like
the mother of the group.

334
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,190
- I'm so excited.

335
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,260
The ball challenge
is something so up my alley

336
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,864
because to me, drag is about
genuinely liking what you do

337
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,768
- and doing what you do
- Because it's what you like.

338
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:24,603
I'm like Gandhi.

339
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,272
- Yep. That's what
we're gonna do.

340
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:31,276
So for my Martian Eleganza,
I want to use the materials

341
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,146
in a little bit more
of a unique way.

342
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,814
I want to rid myself
of all colors

343
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,418
and play with a kind of paper
doll approach to my design.

344
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,820
So I'm giving you
graphic ka-chow

345
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,057
- straight out of a comic book
- From the future.

346
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:51,930
- I look over at Aquaria
and I see her working,

347
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,900
but there's no garment at all.

348
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,035
- What are you doing with that?

349
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,437
- I'm keeping it very geometric.

350
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:02,375
- So I'm gonna keep this
- Very shape-y.

351
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:04,610
- Oh, okay.

352
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,281
- Come on, stretchy shoulder.

353
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,883
Aquaria's gonna glue
something to a bra.

354
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,618
- Simply no.

355
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,525
- Oh, come on, Buzz Lightyear.

356
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,227
- The end is near, everyone.

357
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,629
Our challenge today
is The Last Ball on Earth,

358
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,700
- where we have to serve up
- Three looks.

359
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:30,268
Not one, not two,

360
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,237
but, bitch, three looks.

361
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:37,709
RuPaul, thank you, but, aah!

362
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,211
[rip]

363
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,480
- Oop. The zipper.

364
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,682
- It just popped.

365
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,449
Oh, my God.

366
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,184
- Yeah, it popped.

367
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,455
- I'm gonna try
- This other flimsy-ass zipper.

368
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,057
- Will you pray
- Over my zipper with me?

369
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,193
- Holy Spirit,
- We ask for flexibility,

370
00:14:54,196 --> 00:14:59,132
- durability, and elasticity
- In this zipper.

371
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,032
[all laugh]

372
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,367
May the church say...

373
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,202
- Amen.
- Amen, girl.

374
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,037
- Hee hee hee hee.

375
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,375
- I love Monique's laugh
- When she does the hee-hee-hee.

376
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:11,243
- Hee hee hee hee.

377
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,511
- [laughs]

378
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,379
- That laugh, insane.

379
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,581
- Signature.

380
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,919
- Trying to get this metal shit

381
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,823
attached and sewn in
is not the easiest.

382
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:29,661
For this Martian Extravaganza,
I am using some hard metal.

383
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,196
Oh, that's my finger.

384
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,764
- Oh, be careful.

385
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,233
- [inhales] Yikes.

386
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,502
- Don't burn yourself, Tyra.

387
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,937
- We got hot glue burns.

388
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,175
- We got cuts and bruises
- Just from the materials alone.

389
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,309
I love what I'm making.

390
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,411
Like, I'm excited to finish it,

391
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,946
- because I think
- It's going to be badass,

392
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:50,081
but also like, I'm nervous
as fuck about it.

393
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,883
[inhales] Ha!

394
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,553
- Fuck. You bitch.

395
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:58,223
- Dusty's idea
is a steam punk look

396
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,792
that is glued to a corset,

397
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,295
and she's going to make
a panty piece as well.

398
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,362
But we've heard
time and time again

399
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,897
that you can't come out on stage

400
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:10,202
in a design challenge
in a corset and a panty.

401
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,039
So dot, dot, dot.

402
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,608
Fill in the blank.

403
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,578
- Hey, kitty girls.

404
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,313
- Oh.
- Hey.

405
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,416
- How's the end of the world
- Treating you?

406
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,684
- Great.
- It's shady.

407
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,919
- Hey, Asia.
- Hey, Ru.

408
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,755
- So you are an O'Hara.
- I am.

409
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,523
- Is that the name
you've always had?

410
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,327
- I've had it my entire
professional drag career.

411
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,661
I got adopted in very early.

412
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,431
- Who are the members
of this family?

413
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,666
- Josephine O'Hara,
Silky O'Hara Monroe,

414
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,102
Sassy O'Hara, Ariel O'Hara.

415
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,470
- And what about Eureka?
Is she part of your family?

416
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:47,473
- I don't believe so.

417
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,875
I had heard of her
from Season 9,

418
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:52,545
- and when it came on,
- I was like, O'Hara? Who, bitch?

419
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:54,279
- Uh-huh. [laughs]

420
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,982
So you know how to sew.
- Absolutely.

421
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,085
- Somebody told me that you
made outfits for other people.

422
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,652
- Oh, yes.
I've made outfits

423
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,088
for Kennedy Davenport,
for Alyssa Edwards.

424
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,323
I've worked on an outfit
for Gladys Knight.

425
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,425
I've even hemmed a skirt
for Dolly Parton.

426
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,929
- Pretty much anybody
- That's come through Dallas.

427
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,130
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:13,698
- You know, and you also
do outfits for ice skaters?

429
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,036
- Yes, I do ballroom,
- Ice skating,

430
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,204
- high school
- And college dance teams

431
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,438
is really big in the south,

432
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,539
so that's my big clientele.

433
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,342
- So this is an actual
side business for you.

434
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,077
- It's a fulltime business
- For me.

435
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,580
- Wow. So tell me about
your outfit on Mars.

436
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,617
- I initially wanted to do
- Something kind of dark and edgy,

437
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,653
- but all the dark and edgy
- Fabric was gone.

438
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:34,718
- So you went with neon.

439
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,755
- So I went with neon.

440
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:38,290
And so I'm gonna kind of do

441
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,458
kind of Judy Jetson
meets Effie Trinket.

442
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,594
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

443
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:43,763
- After that Tweety Bird
- Last week,

444
00:17:43,766 --> 00:17:47,766
I cannot wait to see what
you come out with this week.

445
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,035
- Well, thank you.
I'm very excited.

446
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:52,771
Now the judges know my level
of drag, my quality of drag,

447
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,142
- so I'm confident, and I'm ready
- To slay the runway.

448
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,077
- Well, hello, Aquaria.

449
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,377
- Hello, RuPaul, how are you?

450
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:01,580
- Now, who introduced you

451
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,382
to fashion and magazines
and all that stuff?

452
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,885
- I was studying womenswear.
- Okay.

453
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:08,353
- But thank goodness
for me, you know,

454
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,588
realizing that maybe
the nightlife

455
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,190
is more my true passion.

456
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,226
- Sure, yeah.
- And you're 21 years old.

457
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,326
Now wait a minute.
If you're 21,

458
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,296
I've heard of you
in New York clubs,

459
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,497
I think, for a couple years.

460
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,499
- A couple of years, yeah.

461
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,034
- Did you have a fake ID
- To get in?

462
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:24,469
- We pulled some strings.

463
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,470
- Some stush.

464
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,205
- Some stush, real, real tight.

465
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:30,375
- Now, you haven't won
any maxi challenges.

466
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,376
- Right.

467
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,676
- What are you gonna do
to rectify that?

468
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:33,779
- Looks is what I do.

469
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,982
- Some girls in the workroom
- Chose to read books,

470
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:37,349
I chose to turn looks.

471
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,184
- [laughs]

472
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,987
That, my friend,
will be in the promo.

473
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,120
- Whoosh.

474
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,156
- Let's see if you can do it
- One more time.

475
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,191
- Okie doke.
- Okay.

476
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,126
- Some girls in the workroom
- Try to... or...

477
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,394
- Uh-huh. Occur.

478
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,764
- Some girls in the workroom
choose to turn looks...

479
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:53,966
Oh, blew it.

480
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,168
I'm known as a look queen,

481
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,336
and this challenge
is literally about look.

482
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,972
So I want to show the judges
that I'm not just all talk

483
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,208
and that I really can
walk that walk

484
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,078
three different times
in three different looks.

485
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,015
- The Vixen.
- Hello, how are you?

486
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,951
- You're working
the turquoise affair.

487
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,785
- Yeah. For my
Life on Mars look,

488
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,287
I just wanna be
out of this world,

489
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:19,457
so I'm trying to do some
sporty space-age shapes,

490
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,493
but I think it's gonna be good.

491
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,894
- All right.
- So do you know how to sew?

492
00:19:21,897 --> 00:19:24,897
- I do. My godmother,
- Growing up, she taught me.

493
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,499
- She would write my name
- On a napkin

494
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,365
and she'd make me trace it
with needle and thread.

495
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:29,502
- Really?
- Yeah.

496
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,670
- Now that's a great skill
- To teach a kid.

497
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,705
- Yeah, well, I was...

498
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:34,105
- To make them gay.

499
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,440
- Exactly. [laughs]

500
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,910
Well, I talked too much,
so that's how she kept me quiet.

501
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,879
- And you did it perfectly.
- I got good.

502
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:42,814
- Wow. Tell me,
what's your reputation

503
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,649
back home in Chicago?

504
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,452
- I'm the firestarter.
- [laughs]

505
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,154
- What does that mean?
- I shake things up.

506
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:52,390
I definitely am very influential
in the Chicago drag scene

507
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,626
because I am very vocal.

508
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,162
- My drag can definitely
- Get political.

509
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:59,864
Black Girl Magic is a show
that I produce in Chicago

510
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,436
- that is all about celebrating
- The power, the strength,

511
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:06,438
and the struggle
of being a black woman.

512
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,774
- Well, this is
- A make or break challenge.

513
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:09,774
- Yeah.

514
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,411
- But you've been sewing
- That napkin

515
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,113
for a long, long time.
- For a long time.

516
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,881
- So I want to see that
- Out there.

517
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,283
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, The Vixen.

518
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,087
- Well, I declare,
Blair St. Clair.

519
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,987
- Hey, Mama Ru.
- Is this your Mars look?

520
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,825
- Yes, this is kind of
the base of it.

521
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:29,160
I really am inspired
by eras and time period,

522
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,763
especially more like old
Hollywood vintage things.

523
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,799
So I'm kind of doing
a sixties mod glam look,

524
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,402
reworked for the future,

525
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,305
because it's gonna be the last
thing I wanna wear before I die.

526
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,107
- I love that.
- Yeah.

527
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,476
- How did you get into drag?

528
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:45,678
- Because you don't seem like,
- You know,

529
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:47,812
some down dirty queen
up in the club.

530
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,447
- No, not really.

531
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,417
- But that's
- Still to come later.

532
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,586
- Right, later.
- That's the part we don't air.

533
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:56,387
No, I actually went to school
to do hair and makeup.

534
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,224
So I have been doing
hair and makeup

535
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,126
- and working on theater
- Productions my whole life.

536
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:03,128
And theater transcribed
into drag for me.

537
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,830
- I'm sure people
have said this to you.

538
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,499
You do look like
an all-American boy

539
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,401
from not just in real life,
but like from a storybook.

540
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,869
Have people said that
to you before?

541
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,340
- Mm-hmm. I get mistaken for
like a 12-year-old all the time.

542
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,175
- I'm sitting there, and they're
- Like, where's your mom?

543
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:17,308
- [laughs]

544
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,877
- Because of how young I look,

545
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,613
I feel like I'm just really
kind of skipped over a lot.

546
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,349
I think as soon as I walked
into this competition,

547
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,850
people immediately
just kind of dismissed me

548
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,719
and thought, not a threat.

549
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,122
But it kind of excites me a bit
that they do underestimate me

550
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,590
and for them not to know
what I'm gonna do next.

551
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,392
Yeah, I'm a little sneak attack.

552
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,829
- Well, kiddo, I cannot wait
to see what you do on Mars.

553
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,398
- Thank you. Yes.
- We'll see you out there.

554
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,499
- I'll see you there.
- Okay. [laughs]

555
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,602
- Monet X Change.

556
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,204
- Hi, Ru.

557
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,640
- Now, do you consider yourself
- A fashion queen?

558
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,909
Are you aware of fashion and
putting silhouettes together?

559
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,111
- Oh, yeah, totally.
- On Instagram and Facebook,

560
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,112
people tend to see you first

561
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,580
- before they get
- To see you perform ever,

562
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,215
so I think the look
is very important.

563
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,217
- Okay. But you're always
pumping a pussycat wig.

564
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,286
Do you ever do big hair?
- Hee hee hee hee hee.

565
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,256
- I do, I do
- When the occasion calls for it.

566
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,258
- Uh-huh.
- So what you're saying is

567
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,460
- the occasion
- Of this competition,

568
00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:10,161
your calling is a pussycat wig.

569
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,063
- You know what?
Honestly, Ru,

570
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,566
in New York City,
I work six nights a week.

571
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,368
- So sometimes
- It is like getting out the door

572
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,634
and not worrying
about flubbing with hair

573
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,471
while I'm stage by myself
for two and a half hours.

574
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,374
- Yeah. Sure.
- So it's a convenience thing.

575
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:23,575
- Yeah.

576
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,511
- Just throw on a pussycat wig
and you out the door.

577
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,112
- [laughs] But also I look
really good in them, I feel.

578
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,281
Back in New York City,

579
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:32,818
- Monet shows up in a romper,
- No tuck, no wig,

580
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:35,553
and audiences eat her up.

581
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,423
So no one can blame Monet
for relying on personality,

582
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,491
but this is "Drag Race."

583
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,460
It's not gonna fly.

584
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,363
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Ru.

585
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,866
- All right, ladies.
- Listen up.

586
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,467
Tomorrow on the main stage

587
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,037
we'll be joined by our
extra special guest judges.

588
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,009
- From "Dear White People,"
- Logan Browning.

589
00:22:57,012 --> 00:22:58,810
- [gasps] [cheers and applause]

590
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,011
- What?

591
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,081
- And one of my favorite
- Actresses.

592
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,815
I love this girl.

593
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,351
Tisha Campbell-Martin.

594
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,152
[cheers and applause]

595
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,454
- Oh, my God.

596
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:11,523
- I have waited my entire life
- To meet her,

597
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:12,791
so it is like my birthday.

598
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,659
I am so excited.

599
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,664
- Now, remember, ladies,
- This may be your last chance

600
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:22,300
to show off your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent,

601
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:26,839
- so good luck,
- Because we're fucked.

602
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:28,506
[all laugh]

603
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,508
- Thank you, Ru.

605
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,546
- Aah!

606
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,915
- Runway, runway, runway
- Times three.

607
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,283
- Let's do it.

608
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,850
- For today's challenge,
we're getting ready

609
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,220
for The Last Ball on Earth,

610
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:45,890
which is like a Martian
Eleganza Ball Extravaganza.

611
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,859
We all have to step up, honey,

612
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,496
and have our pussies all fleek,
or we're gonna get the door.

613
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,465
- Girl, I feel like this is
Project Runway the House Down,

614
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,235
and this is a 10-gun
make it work moment.

615
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,403
- There's so much to do.

616
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,638
I have two and a half
costumes to finish.

617
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,940
I have to rework
a couple of things.

618
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,609
So I'm like, aah!

619
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,245
- Girl, if I can't get this
thing through this hole.

620
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,412
- What happened?

621
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,413
- It won't go through the hole.

622
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,814
- Do you want me to thread it?

623
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,052
- Please, because I'm really
about to have an anxiety attack.

624
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:14,218
- I got it,

625
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,387
- Woosa.

626
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,223
[inhales and exhales]

627
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,526
- Dusty, this is your ice queen?

628
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,228
- Yeah, wanna see the gag, girl?

629
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,998
- Word.
- Wow, she's frozen.

630
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,702
- Yep. Let it go, girl.

631
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,705
'Cause they're not gonna see
that in the stage lights.

632
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:35,373
I think my garment is clean,
but I'm looking around

633
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:39,311
- and seeing
- A lot of extra decoration,

634
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,846
and I'm wondering if I should
have done that, too.

635
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,681
- Bam.

636
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,017
- Eureka, can I show you
something real quick?

637
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,720
I think with this,
I wanted to distress it

638
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,354
so it looks like
I was leaving earth,

639
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,824
- like shit was going down, honey.
- Wow.

640
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,790
Like, you've been through
something and you survived.

641
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,361
- And I was like...
- And then she said...

back cat to the ball ♪

[both laugh]

646
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,835
- Gotta get down
at the end, girl.

647
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,038
- Give a little donkey kick.

648
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:08,206
- Donkey kick!
[both laugh]

649
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:09,373
- I never heard that expression.

650
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,143
- That's what we call it
in Tennessee, bitch.

651
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:14,480
- Just the old drag...
- The drag donkey kick, bitch.

652
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,548
- 'Cause you're
- Donkey kicking, bitch.

653
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:18,650
- You know why? 'Cause you look
- Like an ass doing it.

00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:20,619
[both laugh]

655
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,322
- Asia, I definitely feel like

656
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,056
you're kind of the mom
of the group here.

657
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,292
- Really?
- Yeah.

658
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,560
You're always like
so nurturing and loving.

659
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,330
- And even though
- I kind of miss my mom at home,

660
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,031
- I think of you kind of like
- As a mom figure here.

661
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,699
- It's good to hear that.

662
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,502
And it just flowed
naturally out of me.

663
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,204
- Have you ever felt kind
of like a mom figure before?

664
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,273
- Um, it's just... I don't know.

665
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,908
Both of my parents are dead.

666
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,711
I lost both of my parents...
- I'm sorry to hear that.

667
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,080
- Thank you. I was 27
when my parents passed.

668
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,917
- That's me
- And my mom and my dad.

669
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,019
I still don't know...
I'm still processing it.

670
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,321
You don't know what
being alone feels like

671
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,191
until you don't have
a family connection.

672
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,429
- I really felt like
- I had to start from scratch.

673
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:07,098
Doing drag gave me
those family connections.

674
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,867
That's why I really kind of
take these moments to heart,

675
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,335
because I don't know

676
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,469
when I'm gonna see
y'all again after this.

677
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,470
Like, I don't know what...

678
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,573
- We're only promised today.

679
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,808
- We don't know
- Who's going home today.

680
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,042
- Absolutely.
- But someone has to.

681
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,610
- Yeah, girl.

682
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,247
- Aquaria, here's something
- I wanna ask you

683
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,682
because it's come up
a couple times.

684

oh, well, you know, Aquaria,
she has sugar daddies.

686
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,721
- You know, everything
for her is paid for.

687
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:33,623
- Is this someone
in this workroom

688
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:35,093

in New York City?

689
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,794
- Yeah, New York City.

690
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,564
Why do you think
that is out there?

691
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,732
Why do you think people
are saying that?

692
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,100
- Girl, if you look
like a million bucks,

693
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,838
- people might assume that
- You come from a million bucks.

694
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:46,938
- Right.

695
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,273
- I guess people assume
that it is expensive.

696
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,042
That's definitely
a misconception

697
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,778

anything you just said.

- Well, bitch, what do you do
- When you got an accent?

735
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:04,682
That's like telling an English
person not to have an accent.

736
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,919
- They don't have an accent.
- They speak English.

a little history lesson.

with far too much sass
and way too much ass.

870
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,479
My character is that bitch
that walks into the pool party

871
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,915
- looking way too grand
- For where she's supposed to be,

872
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:04,981
but she's serving it.

873
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,585

makes a clear statement.

878
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,228

I've been waiting to crack this
fan on the runway all season,

- Tonight on the runway, I'm
giving you full on Lucha Libre.

889
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,891
This is actually a design

890
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:48,526
- that I drew in college
- For a swimwear assignment,

891
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,995

00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,015
from her song "Lemonade"
when she says "watermelon."

917
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,618
So I decided to put it
on a bathing suit,

918
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,422

- Whatever fish live in Alaska,
- That's the fish I am.

940
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:39,870
And the judges are eating
every drop of it.

I'm thinking about the hula girl

There's nothing
in her bobblehead,

954
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,406
- but she's going to bobble around
- And make you smile.

00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:30,340
I think the blend of the pastel
colors is absolutely stunning.

00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,037

1149
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:30,941
to have breath support
for your breast support.

1150
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,679

1151
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,813
but this is it.

00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,207
- doesn't mean
- You can't look fabulous.

1181

00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,914
- Welcome aboard
- The Starship Innerthighs.

1200
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,949
[all laugh]

1201
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,951
- Miz Cracker.

1202
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,919
- Ball busters.
[all laugh]

1203
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,489
- [robot voice] Take me
to your breeder. Take me.

1204
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,892
- A slinky little number.

1205
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:31,361
- In space, no one
can hear you scream,

1206
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,597
so all the noise
has to be glitter.

1207
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:35,098
Everything is stoned

1208
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,569
- and glittered
- The house down space boots.

1209
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:40,870
She's cute, but she's dangerous.

1210
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,104
I'm ready to blast off.

1211
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:43,574
- One small step for man,

1212
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,410
- and one giant duckwalk
- For queenkind.

1213
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,979
[all laugh]

1214
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,147
- I said which way is Pluto?

1215
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,149
[all laugh]

1216
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,552
- Welcome, ladies.

1217
00:45:54,553 --> 00:45:57,253
Based on your three ball lurks,

1218
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,656
I've made some decisions.

1219
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,860
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1220
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,329
Mayhem Miller.

1221
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,864
Eureka.

1222
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,100
The Vixen.

1223
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,601
Monique Heart.

1224
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,837
Blair St. Clair.

1225
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,208
This week, you are all safe.

1226
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,811
You may leave the stage.

1227
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,348
The rest of you

1228
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,918
represent the tops
and bottoms of the week.

1229
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:30,888
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1230
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,891
First up, Monet X Change.

1231
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,662
- I thought the Miami Summer
- Realness was great.

1232
00:46:37,665 --> 00:46:39,062
It looked elevated.

1233
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:43,800
But the other looks seemed
just a little homemade.

1234
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,804
- I think your Mars look
just looks really sloppy,

1235
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,106
like Mars-y in a school play.

1236
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:52,509
- All in all, I agree
with the judges.

1237
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,378
But listen, I love a good gag.

1238
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,280
- [laughs]

1239
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,449
- All right, thank you, Monet.

1240
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,917
Up next, Kameron Michaels.

1241
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:04,087
- You gave us something
different on each look.

1242
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:06,156
The first look is so funny.

1243
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,224
I just know that lady,
I love that lady.

1244
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,894
The second look
was so glamorous.

1245
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,197
- And then the third look
- Gave me story.

1246
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:14,465
- And then aside
from the character,

1247
00:47:14,466 --> 00:47:17,000
your costumes are fabulous.

1248
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,002
- Tonight was a good night
- For you.

1249
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,402
- Thank you.

1250
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,106
- All right,
- Battling for her life.

1251
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,707
Aquaria.
- Hello, RuPaul.

1252
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,743
- I must say,
- I'm living for this look.

1253
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:27,645
- I'm actually
not serving a look.

1254
00:47:27,646 --> 00:47:29,245
[all laugh]

1255
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:31,649
Well, that means a lot
coming from the lurk queen.

1256
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,783
- Allegedly.
- [laughs]

1257
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:37,153
- All three of your looks
were so cohesive,

1258
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,155
and I love that.

1259
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:41,524
- Your first look,
I absolutely loved you

1260
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,195
- swinging that little ponytail
- All over the place.

1261
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:47,330
Your second look,
the victim poofing and powing,

1262
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,166
- and then the third look
- Is the villain.

1263
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:52,969
- If I could define each one of
your looks, it'd be showstopper.

1264
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,038
You served that today.

1265
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,605
- Thank you.

1266
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,808
- Up next, Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1267
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,112
- The Miami Summer Realness look
- Was really thought out.

1268
00:48:01,113 --> 00:48:02,411
I got to just sit here and go,

1269
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,381
oh, I totally get
what she's doing.

1270
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:07,451
- But with the other two looks,
- I didn't get it.

1271
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:09,687
- With your Alaskan Winter
- Realness,

1272
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,890
- that biker style hat
- Was so decorative and beautiful,

1273
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:16,393
- and then the top and short
- Looked like it was off the rack.

1274
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:20,797
- And this is so gorgeous.

1275
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22,832
You gave us...
[blows] magic.

1276
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,834
- Thank you.
- But not Martians.

1277
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,537
- I'm searching
for a Mars storyline,

1278
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,072
and I'm just not finding it.

1279
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:32,575
- This is "Mars Is Burning,"
and this is my stardust dress.

1280
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,177
I am in the stardust.

1281
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,212
I'm giving it to everyone.

1282
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,348
And that's what I was going for.

1283
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:39,516
- It's a faerie.

1284
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:42,720
- Up next,
- We've got Asia O'Hara.

1285
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:44,119
- You like balls, huh?
- I do.

1286
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,090
- That's good, girl.
I like 'em, too.

1287
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:50,461
- Your balls
- All over yourself were fun,

1288
00:48:50,462 --> 00:48:51,529
but really kind of basic.

1289
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,296
It's Season 10.

1290
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,233
You've got to amp it up
and do much more than this.

1291
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,333
Because after last week,

1292
00:48:58,334 --> 00:48:59,937
we're expecting more
from you, Miss Asia.

1293
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:03,573
- Alaskan Winter Realness
I thought was cute.

1294
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,276
I just don't know
that cute is enough.

1295
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,813
- My two first looks

1296
00:49:09,814 --> 00:49:12,283
were things that weren't
finished when I got here,

1297
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:14,217
and I had plans to finish them,

1298
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,921
- and everybody
- Kind of needed my help.

1299
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:19,789
- How many of the girls
did you help with their sewing?

1300
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,526
- Um... I helped everybody
with their looks.

1301
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:24,760
- Everyone.
- Everyone.

1302
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:25,896
- Every single person.

1303
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,932
- Did that take time away
from you doing yours?

1304
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:34,103
- It did, but I felt like
my time was spent...

1305
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,774
my time was spent
better helping them.

1306
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:40,109
- It's so sweet of you,

1307
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,879
- but just like
- When you're on an airplane,

1308
00:49:41,882 --> 00:49:44,113
you have to put
the oxygen on first.

1309
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,549
- You have to put
the mask on your face

1310
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,784
before you put it
on your child's face.

1311
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:50,988
Asia, you need to take care
of yourself first.

1312
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:55,758
Ground control to Major Cracker.

1313
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,527
Is there life on Mars?

1314
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:59,095
- More than on Staten Island.

1315
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,230
[all laugh]

1316
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,798
- Hi, Miz Cracker.

1317
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,367
I've never gotten away
with saying that.

1318
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:05,435
[all laugh] So thank you.

1319
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:08,504
I love you and your looks.

1320
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:12,175
- You were perfection
walking down the runway.

1321
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,912
- Every single one of your looks
- Told a story,

1322
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:17,514
- and this one
- Is my absolute favorite.

1323
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:21,218
- Though 'tis a body suit,
- You took it further,

1324
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:24,053
out of the ordinary,
into the extraordinary.

1325
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:27,690
And nothing could be gayer than
a glitter astronaut helmet.

1326
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,994
- Tonight was a great night
- For you.

1327
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:32,462
Keep it up.

1328
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:34,732
- Thank you, ladies.
- I think we've heard enough.

1329
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:36,799
While you untuck backstage,

1330
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,202
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1331
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:43,006
Okay, now, just between
us earth girls...

1332
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:44,908
[all laugh]

1333
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,376
What do you think?

1334
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,911
Monet X Change.

1335
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:50,880
- Monet is a great queen
who I'm rooting for.

1336
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,449
- But two out of the three looks
- Tonight

1337
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:53,983
just weren't good enough.

1338
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,886
- I'm only getting
the first impression,

1339
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:59,389
and the first impression,
it was not good enough

1340
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,625
as it compares to the other
queens that were on the stage.

1341
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,694
- The Martian Eleganza,

1342
00:51:03,695 --> 00:51:06,096
- like, Ru, it was falling apart
- On the stage.

1343
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:08,898
Like it was literally
falling apart.

1344
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,100
Tonight was a miss for me.

1345
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,568
- Kameron Michaels.

1346
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,137
- She showed me funny,

1347
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,973
she showed me glamour,
and she showed me character.

1348
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:19,677
- But the Alaskan Winter
- Realness,

1349
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,479
- it did lack more
- Than it just being a bikini.

1350
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:24,347
- But, gosh, that Martian.

1351
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:27,817
I loved her personalities
and how she changed.

1352
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,120
- You didn't know
- Who she was gonna be next,

1353
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,288
and she was that chameleon.

1354
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:32,790
- Would you say
- She's a Kameron-Kameron...

1355
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,391
Kameron-Kameron-
Kameron chameleon?

1356
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:35,491
- Yes.

1357
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,961
- Oh, my God, you are
so totally unitarded.

1358
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:40,997
[all laugh]

1359
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,131
- Aquaria.

1360
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,635
- Well, I don't know
whose legs I want more,

1361
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:48,137
Aquaria's or that goddamn
Logan over there.

1362
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,272
[all laugh]

1363
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,840
- Tisha.

1364
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,477
- What I saw today
on that runway was brilliant.

1365
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,846
The looks were so cohesive.

1366
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,349
- She was the only one
who stayed in her character,

1367
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,584
in her bubble, the entire time.

1368
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:04,754
- This week, Aquaria elbowed
those girls out of the way

1369
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:07,224
- and put herself
- At the front of the pack.

1370
00:52:07,227 --> 00:52:09,425
- Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1371
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:12,729
- The first look,
we all loved the hat.

1372
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,264
She gave great head, and then
the rest was disappointing.

1373
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,266
And that's the word,
disappointing.

1374
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:21,471
It just... all of them were just
off the mark a little bit.

1375
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,440
- If you have
- To explain your outfit,

1376
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:25,174
you have missed the mark.

1377
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,844
Dusty Ray Bottoms
just hit the bottom for me.

1378
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,779
- Asia O'Hara.

1379
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,115
- Ah, this one broke my heart

1380
00:52:31,116 --> 00:52:32,816
- because she had
- Such a good week last week.

1381
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:33,815
The lesson is learned.

1382
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:35,652
You spend more time
on other people,

1383
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,120
you're gonna get burned.

1384
00:52:37,121 --> 00:52:39,622
- She is a queen that has
everything that it takes.

1385
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:40,891
She's got talent.
She's got the looks.

1386
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:42,558
She's got the makeup skills.

1387
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,161
It's gonna hurt her
in this challenge

1388
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:46,230
- that she didn't
- Take care of herself first,

1389
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,766
- because the looks
- Just weren't good enough.

1390
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,634
- It's really sweet
that she helped everyone,

1391
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,303
- but you do
- Have to manage your time.

1392
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:56,272
Last but not least, Miz Cracker.

1393
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,208
- Miz Cracker
- Was my favorite tonight.

1394
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:03,413
- Every look she had was upscale
and couture, very vogue.

1395
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,283
- Her servitude
- Is on a whole other level.

1396
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,717
She is the Ritz, honey.

1397
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:10,119
[all laugh]

1398
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,688
- Now if you wanna talk about
best of the best this week,

1399
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,191
- I think Aquaria
- Was a little bit better.

1400
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:16,393
- But they are neck and neck
- And neck.

1401
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:19,195
- Miz Cracker gives me life.

1402
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,597
- Aquaria's outfits
have that wow factor.

1403
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,598
- Yeah, true.

1404
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,768
- But Miz Cracker is flawless,
- You know.

1405
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,570
- I think Cracker's
way quirkier and weirder.

1406
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:28,738
She's just a weirdo.

1407
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,908
- [clap, clap]
- All right, silence.

1408
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:32,241
I've made my decision.

1409
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:34,343
Bring back my girls.

1410
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,746
- Welcome back, ladies.

1411
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:38,582
I've made some decisions.

1412
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,920
Miz Cracker,

1413
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,857
tonight you had the judges
gallactating.

1414
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,060
Aquaria, up until now,

1415
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,564
your star power
has been eclipsed.

1416
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,669
But this is the dawning
of the age of Aquaria.

1417
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:03,206
Con-drag-ulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

1418
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:04,707
[applause]

1419
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:11,482
- You've won a $2,000 gift card
- From D-Bleu-Dazzled

1420
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:16,152
and a wig wardrobe
from RockStar Wigs.

1421
00:54:16,153 --> 00:54:17,321
- Thank you so much.

1422
00:54:17,322 --> 00:54:19,388
I am so, so, so,
so, so, so happy

1423
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,624
that I won this challenge.

1424
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,526
I'm literally
like over the moon.

1425
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:25,929
- Miz Cracker, you're safe.

1426
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,866
You may join the other girls.

1427
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:36,440
- Kameron Michaels,
you are safe.

1428
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,776
Dusty Ray Bottoms,

1429
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:45,082
your Martian storyline
got lost in space.

1430
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,486
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you're up for elimination.

1431
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:53,990
Asia O'Hara.

1432
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,726
You boosted the other queens,

1433
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,962
but when it came time
for your own drags,

1434
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,299
there was a failure to launch.

1435
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:07,403
Monet X Change,
we loved your stories.

1436
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,572
But on the runway,

1437
00:55:09,573 --> 00:55:13,110
your three lurks
didn't quite works.

1438
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,113
Asia O'Hara...

1439
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,316
You are safe.

1440
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:29,458
Monet, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1441
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,962
- I feel like
- My entire drag career

1442
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:33,629
is like flashing before my eyes.

1443
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,199
- I'm gonna have to lip sync
- For my life

1444
00:55:35,202 --> 00:55:37,200
against my New York City sister.

1445
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:40,002
But I want them to know that
I'm this fierce drag queen,

1446
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,205
and I want to be here.

1447
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:43,940
- Two queens stand before me.

1448
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:48,812
- Ladies, this is your last chance
- To impress me

1449
00:55:48,815 --> 00:55:52,816
and save yourself
from elimination.

1450
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,120
- The time has come...
- [thunder]

1451
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,388
For you to lip sync...

1452
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:04,026
[echoing] For your life.

1453
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,262
- Monet is a friend of mine,

1454
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:09,198
but I am ready to give
the biggest fight I have

1455
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,601
to show Ru I deserve to stay.

1456
00:56:11,602 --> 00:56:14,670
This is the last moment
to make it count.

1457
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:20,544

Now sashay away.

00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,124
- I just have to say
thank you so much.

1505
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,994
- You have changed my life
- Completely.

1506
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:52,496
I'm eternally grateful,
and I love you all.

1507
00:58:52,497 --> 00:58:54,263
Thank you.

[all laugh]

1511
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,773
- You know, she's a punk rocker.

1512
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:07,577
- She doesn't do Nicki Minaj,
- But I lived tonight.

1513
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,312
I didn't expect
to go home fourth,

1514
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:14,316
but this is the hardest thing
I've ever done ever.

1515
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,720
- I just hope
- I didn't disappoint anyone.

1516
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:19,655
[sobs] That's all.

1517
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:23,360
- I tried really hard,
- And I gave it everything I had.

1518
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:27,196
And I know that I did my very
best and I gave a good fight.

1519
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,999
- This is not the last you're
- Gonna see of Dusty Ray Bottoms.

1520
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:32,835
So keep your eye out,
or keep your bottom out.

1521
00:59:32,836 --> 00:59:34,438
I don't know.

1522
00:59:37,274 --> 00:59:39,542
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1523
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:42,679
- And remember,
- If you can't love yourself,

1524
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,681
how in the hell are you
going to love somebody else?

1525
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:46,549
Can I get an amen up in here?

1526
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,217
- Amen.
- All right.

1527
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:49,518
